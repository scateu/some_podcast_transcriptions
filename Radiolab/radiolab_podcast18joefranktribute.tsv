EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:42,400	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	When they squeeze you more forcefully than before
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:44,704	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	A polite way of letting you know

EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Usually
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:50,080	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The one who disengages first
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:52,640	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Is the one who cares less
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,200	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	This used to happen to me

EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:05,440	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Naughty to assume the power position
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:07,488	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Game the psychological advantage
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:09,792	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Are people very briefly
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:12,096	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	22 seconds
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Before freeing myself
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,424	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Sometimes
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,216	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Detect any resistance
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:19,008	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I'll push the person away
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:25,664	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I caused a woman to fall backwards over a chair and during their back
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,712	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Sledge or hospitalization
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:30,016	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	But I had no choice
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,552	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	What's the matter
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:33,856	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	A self preservation
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,000	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	That is classic Joe Frank

EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:50,240	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Little fragments of dark
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Experience which are beautifully realized very Vivid
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:56,384	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Kind of funny but kind of also struggling
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,920	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	How do you think
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,200	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	He

EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,168	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	A lot of different things
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	This was way too beginning for me
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:24,288	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Radiolab was just a 3-hour thing
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:26,080	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	On the AM station

EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:41,952	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Doing it didn't have a style I had this
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,232	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I had the unfortunate
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Thing that we all had back at you.
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I said I would she wanted to be Ira Glass everybody

EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I would certain aerate in and out of different segments

EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,015	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And he was part of my shift
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And everytime I J

EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	There's a surreality and a disorienting Ness
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	To his stuff that I just really fascinated by and I was like oh I want to

EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:11,039	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	It was a time when I danced on a street corner
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:13,343	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Dressed as a chicken
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	My job was to draw attention to a furniture store down the block
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:18,719	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	One evening
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:19,999	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	When my shift was over
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,047	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Still wearing my chicken outfit
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,863	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I walked into a bar across the street
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I go to the Bombay martini
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Straight up
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:29,983	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	IMAX on the side
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,543	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Prostitutes sat down next to me

EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	A Faraway look in her eyes
EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,271	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	We talked about our careers
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,319	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The importance of networking
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:46,879	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Focus
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,927	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Then I excused myself
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,719	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Walk into the men's room
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,303	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Sat down on the toilet
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,863	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Had a bowel movement too broken to
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:05:59,679	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And half of it was still hanging out of me
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:01,983	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	So I had to wipe myself 50 times
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,775	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Repeatedly checking to see
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Who's more left toilet paper
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Written on the wall for the words
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,479	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Know that someone is suffering anonymously
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And unknown

EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:54,463	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Joe Frank always had the quality of like he's coming from inside your head out and then back in again he has that kind of quality
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	It sounds like he's somehow like the voice in your head but broadcast back into your head are there something about that quality

EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,047	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Right
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:24,351	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Basically when I was when I was 20
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:27,679	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I had my first paid job at NPR
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:33,055	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I was there a production assistant to this guy whose job it was to invent new ways to
EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Tudo radio for NPR
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And get a Regular Show when he would do different things in
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Weeks and then he brought Joe Frank down from New York
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:44,319	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And that was the thing we're doing for a while and I was Jose production assist
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	As my very first paid job at NPR
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,207	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I ain't never heard it on the radio I mean he wasn't
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	National media
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,047	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	So I'm never like
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:56,351	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	A few very specific memories for
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,887	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Trish suhr
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The best way I can explain it is like
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:05,055	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I've had the experience a number of times over the years where people try to tell me
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,871	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Liko the first time I heard your show
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:09,151	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Was this
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:12,991	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And generally the singer trying to say to me is like I didn't know that the radio could
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,831	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Did I mean like I didn't realize it like old radio could you like
EDL	00:14:17,343	00:14:18,111	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Australian
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:18,623	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Feel like this
EDL	00:14:19,135	00:14:21,183	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I myself had that exact
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,719	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Experience the person who I had it
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:23,999	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Was Joe Frank
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And dumb
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:27,839	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I remember there was a day
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,119	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Early on
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:35,007	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I was standing in the old control room at NPR's original Studios like the original two
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:35,519	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Studios they have
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:38,335	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Studio 1 Studio 2 on the 1st
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:39,359	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	420 20 amps
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,407	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	We're in studio 2
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,711	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Standing by the reel to reel tape
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:45,759	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Get the bank of them
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,807	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I remember Joe was
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:49,855	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Telling one of the stories I remember feeling like
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,647	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Oh I've never
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I've never heard this before I just remember feeling like
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:15:01,119	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Like this like this thing like I didn't end end end it was just elected feel like
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,911	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Totally caught up in a story
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:08,287	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And you don't exactly know why you're so caught up with it and you don't know where it's going
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,823	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:12,127	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And you just want to stay with us
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,407	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	In the sound of
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:14,943	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Voice is such an incredible
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,735	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Radio performer
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Like much better than you were made
EDL	00:15:24,159	00:15:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I don't remember which specific story it was I do remember have gone back because there was one story of particular called the
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	In fact I've gone and dug up that I remember at the
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Hi
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:39,775	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I thought like this is at this sums up the whole thing
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Literally what it is I'm riding up the elevator of my building is he gets on an elevator
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:48,223	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I'm standing there sharing with small space with a
EDL	00:15:48,223	00:15:52,063	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Terrific looking girl he totally gets a crush on this woman but I feel shy
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,855	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Edible
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Scratch my head
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:15:58,463	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Vici
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:05,375	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I gaze up at the numbers of the floors lighting up one after another imagine their life together and everything that they will be
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,143	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	She seems like
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,167	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Kind of person I'd
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:08,447	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Really like
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,983	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Eddie cannot bring himself
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:12,543	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	To stand there silently
EDL	00:16:13,055	00:16:14,591	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Not looking at each other
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:16,383	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Say a word to her
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:17,407	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Edsel
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,687	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Pulls out something from his
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	How can I reach into my pocket and draw out
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Paper which I unfold
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:26,623	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	It turns out to be a cash register tape from the A&P
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:31,487	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	But I scrutinize it is if it's very important before putting it back in my pocket
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	It has a guy come very magnetic
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:41,727	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Forward motion and it's like 4 5 minutes long
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,519	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And the entire thing happens in the elevator
EDL	00:16:43,519	00:16:47,359	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Are you going to races describing the floors going up and all the feelings he has
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	You go through your life looking and looking
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,455	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Sometimes you see her.
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,991	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The woman you might have loved
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:55,039	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Might have loved you at a bus stop
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Museum across a smoky room at a party
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,647	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	In the lobby of a theater
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:01,183	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Online at the supermarket
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,231	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	In an elevator
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:08,095	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	When she leaves in a panic you want to run out to her calling out to stop
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,607	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Stop
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:11,167	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	It's me the person you were meant for
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Don't you recognize me
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I may seem like a stranger but I'm the person you've been waiting for
EDL	00:17:21,407	00:17:22,431	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The one in your dreams
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:30,111	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	But you just stand there and watch her leave
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:35,487	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	This happens to me with a different woman about once each day
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,559	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I remember
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	What has 20
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:43,679	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Curing that and being like this is at
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,703	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	This guy is doing
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Like I want to know
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,775	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I want to know how you do that
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Yes for me the equivalent thing with Debbie hurt his rent a family
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:55,455	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Trilogy
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,271	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	No, I'd be hard-pressed at 2
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:17:59,807	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	To summarize a story but it's essentially it's a
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,623	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	This whole world in which families can be rented
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:04,415	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	For occasion
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,695	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	When I saw this ad
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And it said
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Rent a family
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,863	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	We have certain
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,167	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Package programs
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Where an individual can experience over the course of
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:21,311	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The twelve-month period A pretty considerable rain
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,335	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The family
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Hi
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,039	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And it's all like in this very documentary
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:34,367	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Format and it's done really well so you can
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Okay sometimes like
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:41,023	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Aren't totally sure that what you're hearing is a drama that sounds super real
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Society
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,119	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Seems to be
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:45,631	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Speeding up
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Before I buried
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The whole idea of renting thing
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:52,799	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Have to do with the people's desire
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,103	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Do not have a permanent commitment to them
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I think it's important to recognize
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:59,199	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Depth of loneliness
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	That
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	That must be addressed
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:08,159	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The end like doesn't resolve at all you'll just left would like 12 different feelings that you don't even know what to do with
EDL	00:19:08,159	00:19:10,719	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I think that's that's what he represents
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:14,815	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	You're like thrown in the middle of the action and it's greeting you don't understand it's kind of dark
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And it's not all going to get resolved all the answers aren't going to be given to you
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And enjoy going to have like weird feelings you don't know what to do with and often it's good over reach
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,055	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And it's not even going to work
EDL	00:19:25,567	00:19:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	But it was still kind of cool
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:32,991	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	You don't like all of that is completely his completely 70s film turned into radio
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	So what is it
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Is it you think you took with you from Joe Frank and putting to This American Life
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:42,719	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I mean honestly the first thing is just what he gave me the most important thing which was desire
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:43,487	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	To do it
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:47,327	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Hearing him made me want to make stories
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:49,375	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And then I spent a decade
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:51,423	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Trying to figure out how to do it
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	With ax
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And with reporting
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The thing that started me
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,567	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	With that ambition was him so that's one thing
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:20:03,967	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The second thing is I'm just the way he would use music in the way that the music would pull the story forward and
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Create a mood but also kind of like
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:09,855	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	She went to the dream of it the notion that you'd use music as a kind of cinematic
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Scoring
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Which is not the way you know music would be used in old time radio dramas and certainly not the Wave Music
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	NPR
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And the way you use music is so built into me that a couple of years
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:23,935	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	After this American life was on the air
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,239	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Joe is already letting out in California have been for
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:31,871	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I like mutual friends I mean Ohio is so angry with
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,479	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I was like why is Joe so angry with me
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	You like why is he so angry
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:43,903	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And it turned out that Joe thought that I was listening to his show
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,231	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And stealing the music oh yeah
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I got in touch with him
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And he's just like it's so petty said this is so petty
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:57,983	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Choosing any music and you listening to my show is like it take me so long to find decent music and I
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Edited so carefully
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	You know it's such a part of the identity of the show
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:05,407	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Are you just listen to my show it rip me off like do a little work brother
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,199	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Isaac Joe it's so
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:14,111	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Much worse than that like the fact is like I haven't heard you're showing years I haven't heard him so sorry and would have
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I just learned how to use music from you
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Pat Metheny comes out with a new record
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I hear the same track you do and you're the same possibility in it and I just do the same thing because like it's so built into who I am
EDL	00:21:27,168	00:21:33,312	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	So in a way like I am totally stealing from you but I'd swear I guess I didn't know it
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,872	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Did you ever
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:42,528	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Did you ever like Linda in a good place and he was fine at the end of it I think
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:48,160	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	It seems so small what's the matter with you
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Yeah so there's that and
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,304	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	What else carries forward
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,120	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I mean I mean it's it's
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:04,288	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Honestly there's a thing or two that he does
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:08,128	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	That I have never figured out how to imitate that in the back of my mind
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:09,152	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I still feel like I'm going to stay
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:15,040	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And one of them is a thing I came up last week I was talking to Parker one of those like the younger producers
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:20,160	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I just say what I think she went to do in kind of a moment that she really loves and she's to be a film professor

EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And he's telling the story of what he keeps referring to as
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:51,648	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I like to call it my Infamous 80-yard run

EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:56,256	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Convoluted tale now before I get to the

EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:11,872	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Professional fight
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,176	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	That happened over the years and tell them
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:15,200	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Oh wow

EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,368	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Unconscious
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:23,648	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And then there comes a point when he's like
EDL	00:23:24,160	00:23:27,232	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Did you like 6 or 8 but it's another thing and he says
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:31,584	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Stop before I can tell you that part of the store you need some this next thing and I would tell you that
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,120	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	After a brief interlude
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:34,144	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	During which I will
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Drink some tea

EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:44,640	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And then he just leaves
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	God
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	30 years trying to figure out how to steal that I don't even know how to do it

EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	This is it
EDL	00:24:44,544	00:24:49,152	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Even though he's a guy who's inspired so many of us to get into the business of telling stories
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,456	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Nobody sounds like him
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:54,784	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Still because it's completely impossible to imitate
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,344	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Into the hundreds of thousands of podcasts that are happening now
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,648	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Is nobody doing anything as
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:05,024	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Daring and competent at the same time
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Yeah I could so singular you can't really imitate it very well
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:15,264	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And I'm personally not one who believes it matters like if your work clothes on past you
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:17,312	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	The people of the future
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I meant to be enjoyed like
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:26,272	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	I'm doing right now and then like if no one ever listens to them again after we're gone like
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Wolf pack them anyway like walking around in
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Being alive while we're dead first bumfuk office people
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	Being alive and having sandwiches and beating for lunch while we're dead
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	And not existing like I hate them already they can f*** themselves
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	But it seems that it seems sad that
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	That that other
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:47,776	| radiolab_podcast18joefranktribute |	People
