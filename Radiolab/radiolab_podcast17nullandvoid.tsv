EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:02,208	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Maybe even scary
EDL	00:01:02,976	00:01:03,488	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Secret
EDL	00:01:04,000	00:01:06,816	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Crazy scary secret hello
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,120	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Power hey sorry
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:11,424	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It comes to us from a producer's Tracy hunt
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:19,872	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The story for us got started with this woman Laura
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:24,736	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I am a freelance internet marketer she's from Colorado and in the mid-90s
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:28,064	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Something happened to Laura that hadn't happened to anyone in
EDL	00:01:28,064	00:01:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Centuries
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:30,368	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's over it's over
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:33,184	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When to take a second 1996
EDL	00:01:33,184	00:01:39,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The day you got your jury summons that very first one that was the day of jury duty I had to I had totally forgotten about
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:42,656	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The jury summons until the day of
EDL	00:01:42,656	00:01:43,680	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I picked it up
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:47,264	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I read the back of the summons and it said
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:50,336	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Something about 6 months in jail if you don't show up
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,896	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And so I didn't have a ride to the
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,664	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The courthouse
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,968	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And so I called the
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Court
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:03,136	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And ask them if I really had to show up since I didn't have a ride and they're like yeah yeah you have to show up then I said well
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:04,416	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I'll have to hitchhike then
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:11,584	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And if something happens to me I said to them my blood is on your hands I wanted to make them
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:17,984	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I feel guilty about making me show up but that didn't work she said I had to show up anyway that whenever
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:24,128	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The point is Lori did get the current in Gilpin County in Colorado and when she got there she walked into the seats
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:30,528	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I think there's about 40 jurors in the pool of jurors and Thursday fill up the box with 12
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,808	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Soldiers and then they
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:38,208	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Ask them questions about themselves but were you hoping to get booted off oh yeah I was hoping to get food
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,976	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Of course
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:45,376	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Any any good red-blooded American was hoping to hot crazy in the jury selection I was I was one
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The last ones to be selected
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:50,752	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So the next day Laura and eleven other jurors
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:55,360	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Showed up to hear the case and the case was for this nineteen-year-old girl and she was charged
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	With possession of methamphetamine
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:03,040	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What happened was that she was up in Central City which is a gambling town
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:09,440	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And that day she was driving in her van with a boyfriend and eventually the two of them drove this casino or boyfriend jumped out
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:14,560	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Out of the van he went to the casino and then she kept driving and then the police pulled her over
EDL	00:03:14,560	00:03:20,960	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They just for whatever reason pull her over pulled over for
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,032	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But she got out and put her purse on the hood of the car and then
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:26,336	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Made a lunging movement towards it
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:32,480	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Which they said give them probable cause to search your purse cuz now they're thinking o the table
EDL	00:03:32,992	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Answer the police open up her purse and they start kind of rifling through it I wish they found this one ounce of meth m
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:39,904	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Amphetamine
EDL	00:03:40,416	00:03:42,976	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And so one of the questions before the jury was
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:45,792	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is this young woman guilty of possession of methamphetamine
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So at the end of the trial
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:52,960	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Laura and the other eleven jurors got up and went to the
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,240	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The Jury Room to deliberate
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Until we talked about a lot of things one of the things I remember we talked about was whether or not the police were
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We're lying about you know her lunging towards her purse and things like that
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	There is also the fact that she did have this mess
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:14,208	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But it was unclear whether it was actually hers or not because according to the girl when her boyfriend got out of the van
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:20,351	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Can you put something in her purse she said without her knowledge this girl saying the meth might be his but it's
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Definitely not hers
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I mean to me that
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:24,447	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The whole thing that's
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:29,055	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Element number one of the possession charges that they have to knowingly
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:32,895	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is that soap for Laura if she said she didn't know she had it
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:33,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:35,967	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Could be her boyfriends and she's not guilty
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It it seemed to her that it was just like
EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:41,855	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Pretty big hole in the prosecution's
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:44,927	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I mean to me I just couldn't get beyond that
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:52,095	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's a law return to the other jurors and I said to him I was like well isn't that enough Reasonable Doubt for you to
EDL	00:04:52,095	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A quitter and they were all
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:05:00,287	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Like no she had it in her first she knew it was there it's almost 5 we need to go to Victory and go home
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But Laura wouldn't budge
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:06,687	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She just couldn't get herself the go along and so
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:07,711	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She held out
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And that night when she went home
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,575	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She just kept turning this case
EDL	00:05:12,575	00:05:14,879	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Over and over in her mind
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,487	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And she started wondering
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What's the girl was looking at
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:22,815	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	As far as
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Sentence right but that's not technically what adder
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:27,679	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Supposed to do
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:34,079	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In this case and generally the judge had told them you know like I'm the one that gets to decide the sentence
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:37,151	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You just have to find out whether she's guilty or not guilty
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,247	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But I was worried about some sentence you know you have is 20 rager
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You have somebody's Liberty in your hand
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:47,903	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's a loris at dad on her computer she got online
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:54,815	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And she found this criminal statute and to her understanding this girl was looking at 2 to 6 years
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:57,375	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Like what that is just feels so out of
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:06:03,007	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Lamp that doesn't feel right also it's a felony charge you know you can't erase that
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:10,943	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So the second day of deliberations you know we just went back and forth where the police line yes we think the police are lying
EDL	00:06:10,943	00:06:13,759	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is that Reasonable Doubt no it's not reasonable.
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:17,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	After all my arguments about Reasonable Doubt we're exhausted
EDL	00:06:18,111	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's one Law return to the other jurors and try this
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,207	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Completely different tact
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:25,023	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She looked it up and she was like look
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:31,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Even if you think she's guilty we didn't have to convictor for any reason that we could let her go
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,983	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The even if she broke a lot we can say
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,519	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We don't agree with the law
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,799	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You know we we are here
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We're here to be the conscience of the community that's what I told them
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:43,199	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You don't have to convictor
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But wait. Seems like I
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:49,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I would imagine some people might be like what are you talking about of course we do we're supposed to just
EDL	00:06:50,111	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Say whether she broke the law or not that's what a jury does
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Fred
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:56,255	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Right well that's where everything broke down
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:07:02,143	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Because as it turns out when I started making this argument
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:03,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A whole series of events
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:05,215	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Set into motion
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:10,079	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	One of the jurors apparently they wrote a note saying Laura's inherit she's talking about sentences
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:14,175	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She's saying that she's only going to quit this girl got sent to the judge
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:19,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And apparently the judge exploded
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:25,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And call this all back in and declared a mistrial
EDL	00:07:25,439	00:07:31,839	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Sheriff showed up at my house with a summons for contempt of court
EDL	00:07:31,839	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And suddenly Laura Story caught fire
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:44,639	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	First juror in 400 years that was actually punished for their verdict prosecuted
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	6 years
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:52,319	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Point is when Laura told those other jurors they could essentially ignore the law that they could disregard the facts if they disagree
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:58,719	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Read with a lot of she had tiptoed
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:05,119	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This very bizarre
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:11,519	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Pull up some kind of people see as a trapdoor to an
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:15,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Anarchy and on other side people see it as like
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When is the
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:21,247	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Foundational bedrocks of what it means to be in a democracy
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It is something called jury nullification
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jury nullification
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Actually the first time I heard about jury nullification I Googled it
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:38,655	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And the first thing that came up with this YouTube video that was like a little
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:40,703	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Explainer thing with an animation
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:42,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I think it was like the
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,775	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	First thing is sad on the
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,799	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Front undercut
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Frozen screen of the YouTube video has
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:49,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You can get arrested for talking about this
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:50,943	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Really
EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:51,711	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I was like
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Oh okay I'm hitting play on that let's go you can get arrested
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,575	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You're talking about
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:59,391	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Get well that ends up being a
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:08:59,903	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Sort of
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,975	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It also did not
EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:04,767	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Which is what makes it a loophole
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Thank you
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,071	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah just this way
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Anyway as we dug into it we figured you know we are going to need some help
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:12,703	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But understanding this thing
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So I was thinking that would start with a little bit.
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What's your notification is
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,311	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So we call the favorite legal expert
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:26,015	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Elie mystal an editor of above the law and the legal editor of more perfect on WNYC
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:29,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What perfect what is that that sounds amazing what is that it will it will
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,391	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You know what it's not worth much
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:34,207	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Anyway
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,487	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Elite season 2
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Anyway when we were talking to Ellie the first thing that we asked him what do you know what just give us
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The pure uncut version
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:48,287	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So pure aspect of jury nullification would be
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:53,151	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Let's see I am the defendant I am accused of stealing a car
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:56,223	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I absolutely stole that car everybody saw
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They had me dead to rights all you have to have me on video
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	My mama said
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,903	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	No Reasonable Doubt
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:09,279	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But I stole the car because my kid was sick and I needed to get to the hospital
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,303	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Take him to the hospital
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:11,839	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I had no other option
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:13,887	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's why I smashed the windows to somebody else
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:15,423	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Car hot wired it
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:17,727	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Put Mike in the back I drove to the hospital
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:19,519	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Save to save my save my kids
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,823	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Now I'm up for child from the
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,359	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The guy who has the Audi
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,895	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Rochester
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,919	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The guy who asked me out
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,711	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's like he stole my car
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:30,271	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Which is true
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Imagery says yeah
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Now we're just going to
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,159	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The jury would nullify that clear
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Bat clear illegality
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,279	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Clear crime that I committed so it's like
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,583	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yes he took the car but
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,887	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The law by the way it's written doesn't
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Account for the fact
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That in this particular case
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,751	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's okay with us
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:51,519	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So that's
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That that's kind of
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Sure
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,079	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Version
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:55,615	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And that's kind of the most
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Kind of Happy clappy
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:00,479	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's a very happy version
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:03,551	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I could have stolen Justin Bieber's car
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I probably couldn't get convicted in a court
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:06,367	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	For that
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The nobody likes him nobody likes him
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:11,487	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So they could be saying the laws not nuanced enough they could be saying the punishment is
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Off they could be saying
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:14,559	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In this case the
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:16,863	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Victims are deserved it
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,143	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or they could be saying
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:19,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We disagree with this
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:21,215	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Right away
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's something I understand is like
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's so here we have a situation where Laura says she doesn't do with
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:27,615	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Descendants
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:30,175	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What does she or any of the other jurors have like
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:31,967	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A'right
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To do this is there is there like something written in the Constitution
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It says they can do that no there's nothing in the Constitution that
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:39,647	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The direct
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,671	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Explicitly says
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:45,023	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yes you have the right to completely ignore the law and let off whenever you want to
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,071	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's not a constitutional right
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:49,375	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Okay
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:52,959	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Crying because Ellie says a jury is told to do what they think is
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:56,287	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Best if they think their best is nullifying
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Aloha
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,383	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's also not exactly illegal
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Which disc get back to Laura first second is why the court never actually charged
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,503	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Perfectdry notification
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:11,647	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Instead they found her guilty for not answering questions directly during the jury question process
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,719	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Eventually that conviction was overturned on appeal because
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,303	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In general the things that are said in a jury room are protected
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,863	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Their private so it's not
EDL	00:12:20,863	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Right it's not a crime
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What it is is a power
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,871	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And so I think of it kind of like
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,271	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Wolverine
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Power
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is Keaton
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She can be patched
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Deal
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Adamantium claws
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's just a
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Back of Wolverine's wife
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,839	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He has the ability to do that
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,375	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's his power
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:54,399	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Now
EDL	00:12:56,191	00:13:00,031	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is it alright for him to have claws shooting out of it and no
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:03,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Absolutely not is it illegal for him to have claws shooting out of
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Well
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:05,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Not really
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:08,735	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's illegal for him to use them in certain ways
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,783	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Rights to Wolverine comes into your house
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,111	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And scratches you on the face that's assault we have a law against
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:18,463	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Wolverine has the power
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:19,743	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To just
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:21,279	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Walk around as he is
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	With these claws in his hands
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:25,887	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Built into the nature of his being
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Real quick to the people who care about
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Superhero Powers we know that Wolverine's Powers apps
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,519	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	United heal
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But at least point
EDL	00:13:32,543	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Don't hold
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:33,823	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Wait a second
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The tree like it
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:37,919	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Claws
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:39,967	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To the jury has this
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:40,991	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Claw
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Whatever
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:45,343	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But these simple point is
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,111	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,927	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jury nullification is as fundamental to juries
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,695	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	As having
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,231	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Klaus is the Wolverine
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:51,999	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's just
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A fact of their existence
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But they still get in trouble if they use it
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:58,911	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Lorded but then how did we end up in this weird
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:00,447	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Place where you can
EDL	00:14:00,959	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Do it you don't have the right to do it but you can do it but if you do it
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,567	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or even
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:07,359	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Talk about it you might get in trouble
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:16,319	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That question because it gives me a chance to update Matt are you back there can you queue some like English jaunty
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	1700s type music
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:19,391	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Coming right up
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,695	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	All right now we're in the mood
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Fluorite
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:28,863	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Explain yeah so I ended up finding this guy Jeffrey Abramson of Law & government the University of Texas at
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:35,263	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Johnston told me you don't have to do with the sort of battle over who has the power to decide
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,287	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What the law is
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:43,199	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And he says the opening shots of that battle go all the way back to William Penn trial in 16:7
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Any which is really the birth of religious liberty
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:49,087	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I guess we can also use some sounds of horses
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,391	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Cobblestone streets and
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:53,183	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Sister Sister
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:15:02,143	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So much better thank you okay so it's 1670 London England we've got a guy William Penn
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,447	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I'm with a young man he was a Quaker
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:10,847	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And one day he walking through the Streets of London hold a prayer meeting and Grace Church meeting Chapel
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Welcome to the chapel door
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:12,383	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But
EDL	00:15:13,407	00:15:16,735	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Define deadlock by the authorities
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:23,135	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And the reason the doors were locked up because there was actually this century-old law on the books it made it a crime to
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,671	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Essentially to be a Quaker
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,951	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But what pain does
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Hey
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:27,999	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:34,655	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Okay one both of you two
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:35,679	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Pain starts
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:42,079	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Calling everybody together in the street and as more people start to gather
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:44,383	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Wrong like three or four hundred people show up
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:50,783	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Come on come on so it's already seized the occasion to
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:52,831	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Arrest him for breach of the Peace
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,951	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And eventually
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,071	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And get thrown in jail and he gets a jury trial
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:09,727	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This follows that William
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:15,615	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Of London now the government became he was pretty much just charging pin for being a Quaker
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:16,639	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But the authorities
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,943	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Thought they could go underneath the table and just
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,479	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Prosecute him for what was
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:23,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Common law crime of breach of the Peace
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:28,415	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Are you guilty as you stand indicted in matter and form as for said or not guilty
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I plead not guilty
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,231	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Matter and form
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:34,303	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The case is pretty open-and-shut I mean
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:38,399	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Gathered hundreds of people in the middle of the street according to law and the evidence he is guilty
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	His
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,471	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Defense is
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,799	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Show me what law in England makes it a crime
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,847	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To worship God in my own way
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,943	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Stop the dream went out to the Jury Room
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The jurors come back several times and say we cannot agree
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:17:00,927	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What was their hang up well don't know how inside the heads of those people you can get but it seems like they just
EDL	00:17:01,439	00:17:02,719	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Didn't feel like
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Locking him up for that was the right thing to do even though it's technically against the law
EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:10,655	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And so the judge says to the jurors I am telling you
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That is
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,215	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The evidence shows
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,519	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The 10 preach
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What's wrong
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:19,359	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	On a public thoroughfare
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:23,711	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And he clearly did I have to find him guilty of the crime of breach of the Peace
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,295	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And then the judge lock them up in the Jury Room
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:30,879	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Without food tobacco or rest facilities for a quote
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,415	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Considerable amount of time
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:34,975	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And quote and then finally they come back
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:36,255	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Hancock
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,023	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Quit vim
EDL	00:17:37,023	00:17:39,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The judge accepts the acquittal
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,375	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And then orders that yours too
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,263	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jail for perjury with the whole jury in jail I got locked up
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Not cool
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,079	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So that guy end up filing a
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:54,943	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	An appeal it went to the highest courts in the realm all the way to the king's court in the Chief Justice
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:56,479	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Rule that it
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,271	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Henceforth would be illegal
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:02,111	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To prosecute jurors for a not guilty verdict
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,719	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So this becomes the start of jury nullification
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I really was was
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:11,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The birth of
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,863	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Bubble this
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:15,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Connected space called The Jury Room
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,727	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Can't
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,775	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Punish anybody for what they do in the Jury Room
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So that notion crosses
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:28,735	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The Atlantic Ocean and becomes a part of the American tradition of law so that when the colonies are coming up
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,551	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They have trial by jury and they have juries and
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Smartdeblur writing things about how the jury is the place where the people get to
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:37,183	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Decide
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,463	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What happens when we die
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,743	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Forecast.
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:42,303	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Punish them for what they do and so you get people like
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:47,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Adams and Jefferson making Grand arguments about the role of the jury
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And actually Jeffrey says one of the things that we get from injury is
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:52,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Freedom of the press
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In the 1700's this newspaper guy New York
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Supposedly
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Libel the king or the crown
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:00,223	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Into the jury in that case it was
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:01,503	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Pretty clear that you did
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:04,319	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But they decide that the law itself is unjust
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,623	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And boom there you go bring the Preston
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:15,071	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This ideas her baked into our nation's beginning of trusting Ordinary People to do the work
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,095	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Injustice themselves
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Ordinary People
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	White Manna
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,191	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But then
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,471	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In the mid 1800
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:23,007	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's hard to change because of two things
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:29,407	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	One more laws are being written and it just more complex and complicated and it is harder for people understand
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:30,943	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Number two
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The legal world is becoming way more professional more more people are getting legal training even judges who before didn't have
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Necessarily have legal training to become a judge
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:41,183	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They're getting legal training
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And so it so now judges are seen as the experts in the law
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:48,863	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And then what happens is that you seem or just would have take
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Bath
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:54,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The power to decide what the lot is from the jury in the United States Supreme Court
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,079	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In a decision in 1895
EDL	00:19:58,079	00:19:59,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I know
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:00,383	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Responsibility for
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Deciding
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:04,479	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Whether to enforce the law question number
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	1
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,783	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or what the law
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Properly interpreted was
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:10,111	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Number two
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And from this you get the sort of
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Judge's instructions that are given to the jury and we still have this sort of instruction today
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:20,863	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury the case is now upon you
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,167	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It is your job to find the fact
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:26,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But it is my job to instruct you on the law
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:33,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Now it didn't it wasn't exactly that jury nullification bikini legal and more like just the court kind of
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Pushed it
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:37,759	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Down made it at start of unspoken thing
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:40,831	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And over the next hundred years or so
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It does I mean certainly there
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:46,207	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Times when jurors refused convicted
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:53,119	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Famous cases are like during prohibition and then some arguments during the Civil Rights movement in the in the Vietnam War
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or but really
EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The explicit idea of jury nullification the idea that this is really
EDL	00:20:59,007	00:21:00,799	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A role for the jury
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Stays mostly Underground
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Until
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Claws come out
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:13,855	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's after the break

EDL	00:22:03,264	00:22:05,824	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We spend a lot of time with kids parents

EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:16,064	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I kids you know did something
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Well
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,160	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	How do they do that
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,208	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:25,280	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:25,792	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To you
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:32,448	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:37,312	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:39,872	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We're interested in the

EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:09,472	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Because of concerns about media exposure

EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,896	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And after a month-long trial

EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,416	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We all saw what happened
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And and it looks very much

EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,824	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Injustice

EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So according to Jeffrey that was round one and then just three years later
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:34,720	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What car you get round to believe that this is the police Simpsons
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:41,120	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	White Ford Bronco there you see the police car
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:47,520	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	OJ Simpson in connection with the brutal slaying of his ex-wife Nicole in 25 year old Ron Goldie Reese
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:53,920	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is blood a massive DNA evidence
EDL	00:25:53,920	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Up to and inside the house in his bedroom and yet a predominantly black jury
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:06,720	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Boxing title action find a defendant or Owens All James Simpson not guilty of a crime of murder
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:13,120	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You heard the verdict can we can we ask you reaction so well
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:19,520	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	How many black people table a white jury to ignore the law in the Rodney King case
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:25,920	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Many white people felt a largely black cherry
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:28,224	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Done the same thing in acquitting OJ
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:33,344	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He's guilty
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,416	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	According to Jeffrey these two cases
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:38,976	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Together they sparked a national conversation
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,256	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	About Journal
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,048	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The day after
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,096	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The OJ Simpson
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:47,936	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Furtick The Wall Street Journal writing the first page story
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,216	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Essentially
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:50,752	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Arguing that in
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,288	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Inner cities throughout the
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Country
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:54,592	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Black jurors were
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:56,128	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Remarkably
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Acquittal
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:00,224	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Another words according to the article there was a spike
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:03,296	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In acquittals among black jurors in cases where the
EDL	00:27:03,296	00:27:04,576	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Defendant was also black
EDL	00:27:04,576	00:27:06,368	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And the most likely explanation
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:07,392	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Kind of jury revolt
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:13,024	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	No Jeffrey actually argues that this idea of a jury Revolt was
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,560	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Stated in Part B
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Because
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:17,376	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He said you can never really know if it's yours actually
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,400	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Hawaii
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,936	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But sometimes
EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Will prosecutors would persuade a jury Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But the drawers would still
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,360	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Find immaculate
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,152	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Georgetown law professor
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:30,176	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Paul Butler who was
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,968	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The prosecutor in DC the time says
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,736	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's exactly what
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,296	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Did that feel wrong
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:39,392	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Only because
EDL	00:27:39,904	00:27:40,672	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You know like
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:43,744	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Every prosecutor I wanted another notch in my belt
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:50,656	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So yeah it took me off but the reason they were doing this is because they didn't want to send another young black
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,680	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Black men to jail
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:55,264	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Which Paul says was mostly what his job was
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:59,104	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	If you go to Criminal Court in DC you would think that white people
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,872	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Don't commit crimes
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,176	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They're just out early absence
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,712	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	From the criminal court
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:07,808	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Obviously that's not a reflection of the real world
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,624	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And over the years day today
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:13,440	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Locking up black people it takes a psychic toll
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:14,720	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Paul says he started
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:18,560	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Ask himself should I go to law school to put black people in prison
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,840	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And for me
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:21,888	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The answer became no
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:27,008	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Well now a black law professor is urging black juries to use nullification
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:30,848	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In their fight for racial Justice that let me smell only understand
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:35,968	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What these African-American troops were doing in DC letting cases of non-violent crimes
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	20 Dwarfs
EDL	00:28:36,992	00:28:42,624	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Did you let a guilty defendant off isn't that the same as really taking the Law into your own hands
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:45,952	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Did absolutely is the same as taking the Law in your own hands
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:48,000	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Political protest
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,192	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Tilia MN
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:00,032	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That one sort of seems to grow directly out of the racial
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:04,896	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Mix of things that we're going on in both Rodney King and in the OJ case
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	As this was all bubbling up there is a group called the fully informed yours Association that started actually
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,808	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In this tiny
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,600	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Butt hole of a town in Montana
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:20,512	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	With these like super libertarian
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,280	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Allowed
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Say that
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:23,584	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And they started this
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:28,960	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Group that was app that was basically advocating for jury nullification writing up pamphlets
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:35,872	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah sending out things eventually the internet comes along and attention to jury nullification just can't go through
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:40,480	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	There's claims that jurors in Atlanta in the mid-1990s started
EDL	00:29:40,480	00:29:43,040	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Quitting sports like bookmaker
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:44,832	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	People defendants on a regular basis
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:51,744	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Even though like in the past those cases it serves her missing a slam dunks and in the post-trial interviews jurors were saying that they
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:52,512	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Basalt
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:57,120	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The reason was a Sigh No moral difference between betting on sports and playing like the Georgia Lottery
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,960	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	By the time you get medical marijuana initiatives around 1996
EDL	00:30:00,960	00:30:01,728	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	All sudden
EDL	00:30:02,240	00:30:07,616	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's become much more difficult for prosecutors to convince Teresa convicted in marijuana cases
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,176	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So prosecutors are deciding not even to file
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:11,456	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Charges in those cases
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:15,296	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It comes up in gun right cases during that time so you have like this
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,320	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Spasm of Interest
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,344	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Largely because of these
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:20,160	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Two kind of race-related Trials and then suddenly you have
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,440	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's kind of
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,208	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Spreading
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Serving all safe places near

EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:28,864	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And in fact today what you're seeing is this kind of
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:32,960	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Rising activism
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:39,360	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Around getting the word out about jury nullification

EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:16,224	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And they would just

EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:29,024	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You know you have the right to vote
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,584	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Conscience to represent the conscious
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:37,984	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The community had the right to judge the law
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:41,312	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Right that's perfectly legal and that's how you get rid of bad law
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	None of these people various sorts
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,384	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Looks like they are very sore
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:51,296	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You'll get the kind of guns rights people you get the Libertarians out west of occupy Denver
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:57,696	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Like occupiers like Mark and you might get some like a racial Justice people who think they're not too many brown people in jail
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:00,768	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Big tents
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:05,632	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is he a prosecutor he's got the LL Bean tote bag
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,704	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Twin Rivers.
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:13,824	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But then the thing is here as we get to the getting in trouble for it guys like Mark we got arrested here
EDL	00:32:13,824	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Who handle this
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:16,384	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And what's in front of courthouses
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:17,664	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They sometimes get arrested
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We will distribute the information and they came down
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:25,856	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When they got seven of these right here from the fully informed jury Association
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And we were handing them out to everybody
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I get arrested for 7 class 5 felony is looking at 21 years in prison
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:35,584	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Under what grounds
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,376	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Almost always
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:40,960	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Never says no once again
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:42,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Json is A Canticle cuz obviously
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:45,824	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Not until they get usually get arrested for
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,104	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	For jury tampering
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:49,408	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But then these cases of go and go get it
EDL	00:32:49,408	00:32:51,200	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Appealed and eventually
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:54,016	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I don't think we found a case where this isn't true every single case
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:57,856	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The brought the charges against thrown out because
EDL	00:32:57,856	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Free speech
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:01,184	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We are now in a
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	1st Amendment
EDL	00:33:02,464	00:33:03,232	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Free speech
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:04,512	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	War
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	OK Google can you hear me
EDL	00:33:13,216	00:33:19,616	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This is Julian haikal and he became kind of a jury nullification activist hero of sorts when he was arrested
EDL	00:33:19,616	00:33:22,944	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Today in 2010 at the federal district court hearing
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:29,856	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Well I made 9 appearances at this courthouse and was arrested five times and he was about 78 years old
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:32,160	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	At this point he was just handing out flyers
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:33,952	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah yeah you have like a deck
EDL	00:33:33,952	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They're like a table set-up or are you not an information
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,888	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I just
EDL	00:33:41,888	00:33:43,424	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	As I got at bacova I I just
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:50,080	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Pass out this one-page flyer people come up to you when they see Jerry information like are there.
EDL	00:33:50,080	00:33:52,384	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	More of the runaway
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,200	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And he said show up at court houses like
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:34:02,112	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Oliver place like a new jersey yet in Pennsylvania and like in Philadelphia and in Florida actually when we talked
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:05,952	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He was in Orlando staying with his friend Mark and they were heading down to the local courthouse
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:12,352	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The following Monday to urge people to know if I lost it on agree with basically because they see notification is a kind of a check on
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:14,656	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	On times when the government or a law goes
EDL	00:34:14,656	00:34:15,424	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Interview
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:18,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Too far we have many cases like this that have shown it
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:22,336	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When the slaves when the slaves were escaping from the south and going up north
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:25,152	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	People were running them up into Canada
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:29,760	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And they were told that they had to return them after all the slaves were property
EDL	00:34:30,272	00:34:31,808	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What that were guilty I was theft
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:35,392	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When they didn't return these slaves probably the most
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:36,160	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Famous
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:38,464	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Example of jury nullification cases
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,000	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Square northern Jersey
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:42,048	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Even though they knew someone had harbored a slave and was
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:43,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	For guilty
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:44,096	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They would just
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,120	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Refuse to commit
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They don't do it that's how that's actually the most important
EDL	00:34:48,960	00:34:51,776	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jury nullification case that this country probably ever had
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:54,848	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is a just left us life I just heard about the Canada
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,152	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Violating the law out now
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's the point of having a jury
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:02,784	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In fact Thomas Jefferson made the statement
EDL	00:35:02,784	00:35:05,856	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The only thing that will save this country is the jury
EDL	00:35:06,624	00:35:07,648	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The only thing
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:13,280	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Hey by the way if you need to stop and take a drink of water don't
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:15,840	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Don't hesitate to stop and cry a little
EDL	00:35:18,400	00:35:20,192	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Anyway let's go
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:22,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You don't mind if I cry while we talk about this
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,032	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Just touches me pretty much
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I mean what is it
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:28,640	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Of course I don't mind if you cry I'm guess I'm curious what
EDL	00:35:28,640	00:35:29,920	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What is it that's hitting you
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In that way emotionally
EDL	00:35:34,528	00:35:38,880	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I'm sorry I think about these cases that I just can't believe what's happening this country
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:42,720	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I can't believe how corrupt this country has become
EDL	00:35:45,024	00:35:51,424	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And you're seeing that corruption in people being locked away put away for things they shouldn't be put away for it
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:52,448	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Web for drugs
EDL	00:35:52,960	00:35:54,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Do you know that
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:36:00,896	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We now are the number one prison state in the world we have the highest percentage of prisoners in any country in the world
EDL	00:36:00,896	00:36:02,432	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's the United States of America
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:07,808	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And of course 40% of the people are in there for a drug violation
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:12,928	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Why does the government have any right to tell you what you can do with your body
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,976	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's the same thing for prostitution
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:19,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Why should the government be able to tell you whether you can have sex
EDL	00:36:19,328	00:36:20,352	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or what you can't have sex
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or why you can smoke a cigarette or why you can't smoke a cigarette
EDL	00:36:24,704	00:36:27,776	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Now I understand why the government tells you you can't shoot somebody else
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:29,568	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Give me that make sense
EDL	00:36:30,336	00:36:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But if you want to shoot yourself
EDL	00:36:31,872	00:36:32,640	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Guess you're busy
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:35,712	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Anyway and I'll tell you something
EDL	00:36:35,712	00:36:37,760	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We're going to the car it's even though
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:41,344	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To pass out this literature on Monday in Orlando that's why I'm down here
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,624	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:48,512	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Then contact with a judge and he's been in contact with me yet he's informed me that if I show up I'll be arrested
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:52,352	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What application are they probably have 50 or a hundred people
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:53,888	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Omaha
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I hope along with me
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:37:00,288	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Do you think I mean is that what you're doing at the courthouse are you going to be passing out the the jury pamphlet
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,824	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's exactly right
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:03,360	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And the
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:05,408	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Judge has promised us that will be arrested
EDL	00:37:06,944	00:37:12,320	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He said he's asking all my people to come with guns and shoot the cops to come after
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,648	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You're not serious about that are you
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I am serious
EDL	00:37:17,440	00:37:21,536	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Why me too baby. That would be the thing that you just said you understand why the government
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:23,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Stop someone for Jimmy.
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:26,656	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Crosses a line. Comes a time when you got to stop
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:30,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I think that time as much as December 5th
EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:33,568	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's got to be ended
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,128	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You got to start killing the
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:39,200	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The police and the guards and hopefully the judges
EDL	00:37:39,200	00:37:41,248	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Until they learn how to behave
EDL	00:37:41,248	00:37:42,784	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's not Justice either
EDL	00:37:43,296	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The point is we've tried now for years
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:48,672	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It doesn't seem to sink into them that is their job
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:50,208	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To uphold a lot
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:52,000	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Not to keep throwing people in prison
EDL	00:37:52,000	00:37:53,536	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	470 years I've been doing this
EDL	00:37:54,048	00:37:56,608	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And this is the first time it ever occurred to me
EDL	00:37:56,608	00:37:58,912	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That I would ever have to do such a thing
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:37:59,424	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:01,472	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I can't help it
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:04,800	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I have a hard time to reason why I should be arrested and taken away
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:06,336	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	After going to try and do it
EDL	00:38:06,336	00:38:07,360	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I want them killed
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:09,920	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But you realize couple
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:12,736	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I have a hard time believing that you believe that that
EDL	00:38:12,736	00:38:13,504	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Desserts
EDL	00:38:13,504	00:38:15,296	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Killing a quart
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,320	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Clarku
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Has a family
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:25,792	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	They've been warned that I've sent them the letter I told him anybody that comes within 15 ft to me that's an officer of the Court
EDL	00:38:26,560	00:38:28,352	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Where are the party of the Court
EDL	00:38:29,632	00:38:30,656	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That there.
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:33,216	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Be removed one way or the other
EDL	00:38:33,216	00:38:35,264	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I've come to the conclusion that it has to be ended
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:39,616	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Well I think that if you're in a position that ended on December 5th
EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,248	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I think that if you're in a
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:46,272	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Position of
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:49,600	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Considering doing what you've just said you were considering doing
EDL	00:38:51,648	00:38:54,976	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That that's that this to do anything it's only if they do so
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:56,512	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Well
EDL	00:38:56,512	00:38:59,584	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Okay no matter what we have to do it's not going to happen again
EDL	00:39:00,352	00:39:04,192	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Julian I'm going to interrupt you there in just say you know I think
EDL	00:39:04,192	00:39:06,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I think we're probably best off just ending the conversation
EDL	00:39:07,008	00:39:11,616	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Letting our microphone person go home and letting me in
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,408	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's not only my opinion.
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:13,920	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	My attention
EDL	00:39:14,432	00:39:15,968	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah we hear you we got it
EDL	00:39:17,248	00:39:19,040	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Okay thank you very much for having me
EDL	00:39:19,552	00:39:20,576	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Okay thank you
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,624	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Bye-bye
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:27,488	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Holy
EDL	00:39:29,024	00:39:30,560	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Do you have to take stickers number
EDL	00:39:50,016	00:39:51,040	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What happened
EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:52,320	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	After that interview
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,856	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Are the talented and
EDL	00:39:53,856	00:39:55,904	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Esso after we hung up
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,952	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We thought we had an obligation to
EDL	00:39:58,464	00:40:01,536	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Call law enforcement down there because he
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:04,608	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It sounded very much like he was making a direct threat with a time and a place
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,912	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Until that Monday
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:08,192	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He and his friend Mark
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:10,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Did show up neither of them are armed
EDL	00:40:10,496	00:40:12,544	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Need a hammer Market
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:13,568	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Been wanting to show
EDL	00:40:14,080	00:40:16,384	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	No it was just that nobody else showed up
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,664	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:18,944	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The police say that
EDL	00:40:18,944	00:40:20,736	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Somebody who works at the court
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:24,064	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And she told him that he had to leave that he was trespassing
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,344	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He refused to leave
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:28,416	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A police officer didn't also came
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,184	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He was
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:30,720	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Shouting things about
EDL	00:40:31,232	00:40:35,584	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Shooting police officers at one point apparently he attempted to hit
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,120	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But the court worker
EDL	00:40:37,632	00:40:38,912	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But yeah
EDL	00:40:38,912	00:40:40,448	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She didn't and
EDL	00:40:40,448	00:40:42,496	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He was charged with threatening public workers
EDL	00:40:43,008	00:40:43,776	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Assault
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:44,544	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And
EDL	00:40:44,544	00:40:45,312	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Trespassing
EDL	00:40:45,312	00:40:46,848	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So what happened
EDL	00:40:46,848	00:40:48,896	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So the charge for
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:50,688	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Threatening public workers
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,456	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That was
EDL	00:40:51,456	00:40:53,504	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Drop the prosecutors drop that charge
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:58,368	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But he is still facing two misdemeanor charges of assault and trespassing
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:00,928	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Did
EDL	00:41:00,928	00:41:03,232	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It when you're sitting there in that interview did that change
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,512	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In any way you are
EDL	00:41:04,512	00:41:05,024	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Feelings
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	One way or the other about
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jury nullification
EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:10,656	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Cuz I kind of feel like it did for me little bit
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:13,472	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	My answer be really short
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,240	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	No
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,264	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Okay
EDL	00:41:15,776	00:41:16,288	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Wino
EDL	00:41:17,568	00:41:18,848	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I think he's just sort of
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,896	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Sounds like a
EDL	00:41:20,896	00:41:22,688	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Angry frustrated
EDL	00:41:22,688	00:41:23,200	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Person
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,016	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	He's angry about
EDL	00:41:27,040	00:41:28,320	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	People not letting him
EDL	00:41:28,320	00:41:31,648	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Talk about what he wants to talk about in front of a courthouse
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:39,328	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I guess not I mean I did hear
EDL	00:41:40,608	00:41:42,144	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When I was talking to him
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:42,912	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Lemon party
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:44,960	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Because I was I've been thinking about jury nullification
EDL	00:41:46,752	00:41:48,544	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What started the most heroic
EDL	00:41:48,544	00:41:49,568	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Term just like this
EDL	00:41:50,080	00:41:50,592	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Chance to
EDL	00:41:51,872	00:41:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Stand up against an unjust law
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:58,527	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This conversation just made me realize they can also it also like
EDL	00:41:58,527	00:41:59,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Can I guess
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:01,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Posted up with this really
EDL	00:42:02,111	00:42:03,391	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Deeply anti-government
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:04,927	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Idea
EDL	00:42:05,439	00:42:07,743	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You know like you talk to these people and you here
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:10,815	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Arguments that sound like Burn It Down
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,375	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's the end of my problem
EDL	00:42:13,887	00:42:15,167	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Burn it down instinct
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:17,471	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's my would always serve at a distance
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:20,031	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It felt this much much
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:20,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Closer
EDL	00:42:21,567	00:42:23,359	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah that's kind of my head when I hear that tape
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:28,991	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's the strain and that's the kind of thinking that you bump into a lot
EDL	00:42:30,015	00:42:31,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That I find
EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:32,319	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	One of the most frightening things
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:33,855	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I find it more frightening than almost any
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:35,647	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What but what
EDL	00:42:35,647	00:42:40,511	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That idea that like we the people should should be should be triumphant over everything
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:43,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Like that if I find that to be a really scary
EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:50,751	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Ideas pops up I think like Tracy has a checks and balance kind of thing like of his system
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:54,335	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We have a legislative branch passes laws so yeah the laws are
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:56,127	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What are you looking to see you tour
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:57,663	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or circumstance
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:42:58,431	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Change
EDL	00:42:58,431	00:43:04,575	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Are you find out a consequence of the law if you know people in One race are constantly going to jail during race on it or getting electrocuted
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And then you get these
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:12,767	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You get these ordinary people walking into these participation points and you know what
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,535	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Doesn't feel right
EDL	00:43:13,535	00:43:14,047	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's just wrong
EDL	00:43:14,559	00:43:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And that's like
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:18,911	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	If you don't have that then the legislators don't get that little creek
EDL	00:43:18,911	00:43:19,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	In their little bubble
EDL	00:43:20,959	00:43:25,567	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Totally hear you I mean I've never advocate for going along with a bad law
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:26,591	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I think you are
EDL	00:43:26,591	00:43:28,127	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah right with that loss
EDL	00:43:29,407	00:43:30,687	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But there's something
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:32,991	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Potentially corrosive about saying to a person
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:34,271	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You can judge
EDL	00:43:34,271	00:43:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Just negate the law
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:38,623	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Think about all them times when white juries in the South refused
EDL	00:43:39,135	00:43:39,647	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To convict
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:41,183	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	People of
EDL	00:43:41,183	00:43:41,695	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Horrible thing
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,231	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You know it
EDL	00:43:43,231	00:43:43,743	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's like that
EDL	00:43:44,767	00:43:51,167	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I mean that's that's absolutely jury nullification and that's like that is that is the history of life
EDL	00:43:51,167	00:43:52,447	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Like post-reconstruction
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:53,727	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	South you know
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:56,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Yeah but you can make those same arguments on the other side
EDL	00:43:56,543	00:43:59,871	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Think about what yours did during the Civil Rights Movement
EDL	00:44:00,639	00:44:04,479	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor speaking at NYU in
EDL	00:44:04,479	00:44:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	10 mm
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:08,319	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	If it weren't for jury nullification
EDL	00:44:08,319	00:44:10,367	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We would have many civil rights
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:14,719	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Individuals who would be convicted felons or otherwise
EDL	00:44:15,231	00:44:17,535	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Four things that today we think
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,815	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Are protected by
EDL	00:44:18,815	00:44:19,583	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The First Amendment
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:22,911	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	There is a place
EDL	00:44:22,911	00:44:23,423	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I think
EDL	00:44:23,935	00:44:27,263	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Forgery notification finding the balance of that
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:31,359	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And the role that a judge should or should not play
EDL	00:44:31,359	00:44:33,407	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Our forefathers did not believe
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:36,991	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The tree is necessarily always got it right
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,807	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But it was I think what they believe is that
EDL	00:44:40,575	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The jury getting wrong
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:44,159	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Was better than the Crown getting it
EDL	00:44:50,815	00:44:54,143	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It goes at some fundamental level 2
EDL	00:44:55,423	00:44:57,727	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	How we want as a people to be governor
EDL	00:44:58,751	00:45:02,335	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Do we want to be governed by experts we want to be governed by each other
EDL	00:45:02,847	00:45:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What power do we want
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:07,199	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Each of us to have over the other one
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:09,503	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This is what this question really comes down
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:13,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	This is once again I'll install legal editor at the WIC show more
EDL	00:45:14,367	00:45:17,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The older I get the more comfortable I become with the idea
EDL	00:45:17,951	00:45:18,463	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Of
EDL	00:45:19,743	00:45:20,767	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	An unelected
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:23,071	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	White man
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:25,375	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Sitting in judicial robes
EDL	00:45:25,375	00:45:25,887	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Deciding
EDL	00:45:26,655	00:45:27,935	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	As opposed to
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:28,447	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	12 random
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:29,471	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jerk-off from the
EDL	00:45:30,495	00:45:33,567	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And I say that knowing full well that that is a horribly elitist
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,407	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Terrible for that reason
EDL	00:45:37,919	00:45:38,431	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Listen to the
EDL	00:45:39,199	00:45:43,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We have it so puts hand in concentrate power in
EDL	00:45:43,039	00:45:43,551	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	2
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Mostly white hands
EDL	00:45:46,111	00:45:49,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It cost to get into the system
EDL	00:45:49,951	00:45:50,463	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:53,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We're saying that one of the only benefits of jury nullification
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,583	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is to be a check on the side
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:59,167	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	If you look at it only from the perspective
EDL	00:46:01,215	00:46:01,727	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Then
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jury nullification
EDL	00:46:04,031	00:46:05,055	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Seems like
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,335	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A great way to protest
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:11,967	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	But I'm kind of I've I've started to look at things more From perspective
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:16,319	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Which victims are getting Justice in which victims are
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:18,879	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I'm not
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:20,159	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What I see is
EDL	00:46:20,927	00:46:22,207	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Juries nullifying
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:23,487	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Cases
EDL	00:46:23,487	00:46:25,535	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When the victim is of color
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:27,327	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Or when the victim is a woman
EDL	00:46:27,839	00:46:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I try bringing rape case
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:30,655	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Try bringing a date rape
EDL	00:46:31,679	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Try it
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:34,239	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's really hard
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:36,799	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And what reasons why sweetheart is the jury
EDL	00:46:36,799	00:46:39,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Is the jury sitting there is talk about
EDL	00:46:39,103	00:46:41,919	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She was asking for it talk about what was she wearing talk about
EDL	00:46:41,919	00:46:45,759	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	How why was he out that late any damn way right
EDL	00:46:45,759	00:46:46,527	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Jury
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:49,599	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Doing that to the woman as much as any as any other
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,111	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Part of the system
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:53,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So when I think about it from the perspective of the victim
EDL	00:46:53,439	00:46:53,951	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And how is
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:56,767	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What are the Avenues of Justice
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:57,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	For the Vic
EDL	00:46:58,815	00:47:01,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	If you're a person of color if you're a minority if you're an other
EDL	00:47:02,399	00:47:05,215	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I feel like the jury makes it very hard for you as the victim to get
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,287	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I feel better about the judge not
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:11,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Hearing if the people that you shot happened to be white or blue
EDL	00:47:12,127	00:47:12,895	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	A jury cares
EDL	00:47:14,687	00:47:19,551	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	If you can't connect the cop when you know we did it when you saw him doing you can't convict
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:22,111	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The cop who shot Walter Scott you can't convict
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,903	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Can't even indict the cop
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Who choked Eric Garner to death in broad daylight
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:26,719	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:27,999	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Tatsumi
EDL	00:47:28,767	00:47:31,071	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Requires a much more dress
EDL	00:47:31,071	00:47:31,583	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Stick wreath
EDL	00:47:32,351	00:47:33,375	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's how we do things in this
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:35,167	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Anthony the
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:36,191	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	First people to go
EDL	00:47:36,191	00:47:37,215	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Have to be these
EDL	00:47:37,215	00:47:38,495	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Gdb
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,639	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I find that really persuade
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:46,687	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I don't
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:47,455	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And a nice
EDL	00:47:47,967	00:47:51,295	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	You know maybe that's because I served on a bunch of juries I've been on them
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:53,855	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	6 now and
EDL	00:47:55,391	00:47:58,975	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Time and again been amazed at one time I was in a murder case
EDL	00:47:59,743	00:48:02,047	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Some men have been accused of stabbing a woman
EDL	00:48:02,047	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	22 * she died on the staircase
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:05,887	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:09,983	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The four women in any New York they just picked a person who speaks first becomes the
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:10,751	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The four the four person
EDL	00:48:11,263	00:48:12,287	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She came
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:13,567	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And she sat down to look
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:15,871	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	How many of you noticed like the
EDL	00:48:15,871	00:48:18,175	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Defendant's lawyer was asleep a lot of
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:20,479	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Every hand when I seen this
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:22,527	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Here's what I want you to do
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:23,039	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Let's
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:26,111	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Let's go back over everything that we know
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:29,439	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Essentially retry the case
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:31,487	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We we we actually
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:33,279	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We went we went
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:37,887	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Together to every bit of it looking for some damned out somewhere
EDL	00:48:37,887	00:48:44,287	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We staged the stabbing we went back over the distances where the pack with the guy have gotten from here to there and data
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:47,871	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	I'm out of time I live in the neighborhood I don't think you can maybe you can maybe can't
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,151	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We basically
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:53,759	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Did the job of the court all over again ourselves and when we were done
EDL	00:48:54,783	00:48:55,295	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So Calif
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:56,575	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Vote now
EDL	00:48:57,599	00:49:01,183	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And when it became clear to the four women that we were going to connect
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,207	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Cuz she was counting the votes in
EDL	00:49:02,719	00:49:03,743	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And finally the 12th vote
EDL	00:49:05,023	00:49:05,535	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	To convey
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:07,839	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She
EDL	00:49:07,839	00:49:09,119	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Just shorter than her
EDL	00:49:09,119	00:49:09,631	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Her chair so
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:11,423	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	When she got off at your sexy
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:13,471	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	What's smaller than when you're sitting right
EDL	00:49:14,495	00:49:16,031	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She asked us all the hold hands
EDL	00:49:16,543	00:49:19,103	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We just spent five days we've been sequestered in a hole
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:19,615	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Hotel
EDL	00:49:20,127	00:49:20,895	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Each of us have
EDL	00:49:20,895	00:49:22,943	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Policeman guarding us because we was
EDL	00:49:22,943	00:49:23,455	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Violence
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:28,319	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	So we all standing on TV she has to hold hands and then she looks up at the
EDL	00:49:28,319	00:49:29,087	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Ceiling
EDL	00:49:29,087	00:49:30,623	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	It's one of those ordinary rooms
EDL	00:49:31,391	00:49:32,671	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And she's addresses
EDL	00:49:32,671	00:49:33,183	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	The
EDL	00:49:33,951	00:49:34,463	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Cu
EDL	00:49:34,975	00:49:35,999	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	One who's killed
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,535	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And she says
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:39,839	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	She says we have spent the last few days
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:42,399	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Trying to do something that is just
EDL	00:49:42,399	00:49:44,191	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And we know you were there you died
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:46,239	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	His hands or didn't
EDL	00:49:47,263	00:49:48,543	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	We decided that you did
EDL	00:49:48,543	00:49:49,567	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And we hope
EDL	00:49:49,567	00:49:50,335	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	And we pray
EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:51,871	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Physicist

EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:56,735	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Bless America
EDL	00:50:02,623	00:50:03,391	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	That's amazing
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:09,791	| radiolab_podcast17nullandvoid |	Even though I think you're you're expressing that kind of faith in democracy that it's
