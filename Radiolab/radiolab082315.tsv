EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:56,319	| radiolab082315 |	That's when it hit me that
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:58,623	| radiolab082315 |	There is no way
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,695	| radiolab082315 |	Did any of this reflects what she would actually want
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:05,535	| radiolab082315 |	I don't know if delusional is a kind word here and if it's not
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,559	| radiolab082315 |	Apologize but
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:07,839	| radiolab082315 |	If she's delusional enough
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,399	| radiolab082315 |	To think that we should get married
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,959	| radiolab082315 |	Is she delusional enough to think she can fly
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:16,799	| radiolab082315 |	Will she be distraught when I say no
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:17,823	| radiolab082315 |	Know and we'll see
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:18,847	| radiolab082315 |	Would you jump
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,895	| radiolab082315 |	It's my Lord the camera
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| radiolab082315 |	And I said
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,967	| radiolab082315 |	I'm afraid of heights and I want to go downstairs immediately
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:26,527	| radiolab082315 |	And I felt for the first time
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:27,039	| radiolab082315 |	Fear
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:30,367	| radiolab082315 |	And I called for I believe they called her mother first
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,135	| radiolab082315 |	Dalian
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:31,647	| radiolab082315 |	And I just said
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:34,719	| radiolab082315 |	My name is Mike I'm a friend of Jamie's
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| radiolab082315 |	And
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:37,791	| radiolab082315 |	I think she may be going through something
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:39,839	| radiolab082315 |	And I don't know what I'm dealing
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,607	| radiolab082315 |	I'm in over my head
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:43,167	| radiolab082315 |	When Mike called
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,751	| radiolab082315 |	I just got on a red eye
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,263	| radiolab082315 |	That night
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,567	| radiolab082315 |	Text Leanne Lantos
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:52,127	| radiolab082315 |	Jamie's mom it was my job to get her
EDL	00:09:52,639	00:09:54,687	| radiolab082315 |	To go back to her therapist
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,455	| radiolab082315 |	So that we could
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,735	| radiolab082315 |	Could get some medication in her
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,575	| radiolab082315 |	For the end of episode was not entirely surprised that it happened once before
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| radiolab082315 |	Jamie was
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:08,511	| radiolab082315 |	High school at that time she was not sleeping at night spinning around the room talking.
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,279	| radiolab082315 |	Non-Stop
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:13,631	| radiolab082315 |	About how she had to save Central America
EDL	00:10:13,631	00:10:14,655	| radiolab082315 |	I'm just asking
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:19,263	| radiolab082315 |	Bring up first episode Jamie ended up at a place called The Neuropsychiatric Institute at UCLA
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,823	| radiolab082315 |	And she ended up being treated by this guy
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:22,847	| radiolab082315 |	Dr. mark deantonio
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,127	| radiolab082315 |	Psychiatrist
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:26,431	| radiolab082315 |	She was in a very
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,991	| radiolab082315 |	Acute manic psychotic state
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:31,039	| radiolab082315 |	I remember being served
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:32,319	| radiolab082315 |	Tackled by
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:35,647	| radiolab082315 |	Nurses that actually take my meds because I refuse
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:38,975	| radiolab082315 |	Still we didn't know if we would ever see our Jamie again
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| radiolab082315 |	You know that was
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,303	| radiolab082315 |	That was the scariest part
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:45,631	| radiolab082315 |	Everyone around me I think was really really worried
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:46,655	| radiolab082315 |	That I wouldn't
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:47,679	| radiolab082315 |	Come back
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,007	| radiolab082315 |	But you did come back and it's what brought her back
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:51,775	| radiolab082315 |	That
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| radiolab082315 |	Is actually the reason
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,591	| radiolab082315 |	Not so interested in the story
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:56,895	| radiolab082315 |	Shortly after she was admitted
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:03,295	| radiolab082315 |	Dr. deantonio told Jamie's parents he know what this is and we know how to treat it he said she's a classic
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:03,807	| radiolab082315 |	A case of
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,879	| radiolab082315 |	Of bipolar is no question
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:07,903	| radiolab082315 |	And
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,439	| radiolab082315 |	Did the drug of choice
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,487	| radiolab082315 |	Is lithium
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| radiolab082315 |	Which
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:15,071	| radiolab082315 |	It's not even a drug but just
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,583	| radiolab082315 |	This
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| radiolab082315 |	Salt and Heat
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:19,423	| radiolab082315 |	Explain to us
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:23,263	| radiolab082315 |	You know that she would need to take three tablets of lithium
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,031	| radiolab082315 |	3 tablet
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| radiolab082315 |	What's this song
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,615	| radiolab082315 |	And it could bring her back when it work
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,151	| radiolab082315 |	Just remarkable
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:33,247	| radiolab082315 |	Memories of like what it was like
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,295	| radiolab082315 |	To come back like that
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,599	| radiolab082315 |	What you were thinking or what it felt like
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,135	| radiolab082315 |	As really hard
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,463	| radiolab082315 |	To describe as a little bit of like
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:45,535	| radiolab082315 |	Slow realization of
EDL	00:11:47,071	00:11:48,095	| radiolab082315 |	I was like
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,143	| radiolab082315 |	Oh that was a weird thing that I
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,423	| radiolab082315 |	I did a week ago
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| radiolab082315 |	Why did I do
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:56,287	| radiolab082315 |	The first time she was actually lucid and coming back
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,311	| radiolab082315 |	To herself again
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,383	| radiolab082315 |	The first words out of her mouth were
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:03,455	| radiolab082315 |	Mom it's not me
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,807	| radiolab082315 |	And I just
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:09,343	| radiolab082315 |	That just killed me
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,183	| radiolab082315 |	Within a few weeks it was like
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:19,583	| radiolab082315 |	The incident never happened so bizarre I mean I felt like he was this thing that's a
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:25,983	| radiolab082315 |	Fault that I get to just take three of a day and and that was it
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:32,383	| radiolab082315 |	Only normal dose side effects no issues she went off to college and just like flourish
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| radiolab082315 |	It was great things were good for a long time
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:39,807	| radiolab082315 |	And then after about six years she said you have been on this pill for six years I've had no problems
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:46,207	| radiolab082315 |	I'd like to go off at why don't we try to go off gradually then about a month after she was totally off lifting
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,791	| radiolab082315 |	In Mike's apartment
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:53,375	| radiolab082315 |	Up all night you were so tired just a minute ago
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:56,447	| radiolab082315 |	Have you told me I had to leave but now I'm still here aren't I
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:59,263	| radiolab082315 |	Totally manic episode all over
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| radiolab082315 |	Cuz I am
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,591	| radiolab082315 |	Whatever
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,175	| radiolab082315 |	One of the things that kind of makes lithium
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:07,199	| radiolab082315 |	That affected
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:11,039	| radiolab082315 |	Lithium has so spooky and you hear this from a lot of people that have taken lithium
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,575	| radiolab082315 |	How to treat bipolar
EDL	00:13:12,575	00:13:14,367	| radiolab082315 |	Is it selfish
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:14,879	| radiolab082315 |	Is so
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:16,927	| radiolab082315 |	Simple
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:18,975	| radiolab082315 |	Lithium is
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:22,303	| radiolab082315 |	If a single atom
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,095	| radiolab082315 |	This is

EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:27,167	| radiolab082315 |	He's had some personal experience with psychiatric
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:28,191	| radiolab082315 |	Chinese written about
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:32,031	| radiolab082315 |	That to me was fascinating that did a single

EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,079	| radiolab082315 |	Can change
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,871	| radiolab082315 |	What we think of who we are
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:37,151	| radiolab082315 |	I mean it's not even
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:40,735	| radiolab082315 |	Number three the third element in the table
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,783	| radiolab082315 |	What are the simplest atom
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:46,879	| radiolab082315 |	Lights with 3 protons 4 neutrons 3 electrons
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:50,463	| radiolab082315 |	That's a pretty simple didn't matter it doesn't get much it really is
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:51,999	| radiolab082315 |	Is it never struck me when I was on Lex
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,839	| radiolab082315 |	Cipro or Wellbutrin together when they put me on you know if you look at them
EDL	00:13:55,839	00:13:58,399	| radiolab082315 |	They look like what you expect a pharmaceutical drug to look like
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:02,495	| radiolab082315 |	Ring of carbon atoms and some other things stuck on the bed and they they look like
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:07,871	| radiolab082315 |	Big complex molecules in I'm complex my brains complex
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| radiolab082315 |	To take this complicated thing to change
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,223	| radiolab082315 |	And then you're confronted with
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,759	| radiolab082315 |	Justice Adam
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:15,807	| radiolab082315 |	He was found by accident that it works
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:18,111	| radiolab082315 |	It's not complicated to make us
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:19,391	| radiolab082315 |	Assault that you did
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,159	| radiolab082315 |	Still out
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,927	| radiolab082315 |	And yet it has the
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:22,719	| radiolab082315 |	Profound
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:26,559	| radiolab082315 |	The other thing I know about lithium.
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,327	| radiolab082315 |	Redis
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:27,839	| radiolab082315 |	Profound language
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:28,863	| radiolab082315 |	Is that
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:30,655	| radiolab082315 |	You're not just saying
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:35,007	| radiolab082315 |	My Mind my personality is being changed by an atom
EDL	00:14:35,519	00:14:39,103	| radiolab082315 |	It's Been Changed by an atom that was created directly in the Big Bang itself
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:42,431	| radiolab082315 |	See how this atom formed in the Big Bang
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,735	| radiolab082315 |	Goes through whatever it does
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:47,039	| radiolab082315 |	Winding path to come onto the Earth
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:48,575	| radiolab082315 |	Gets dug up
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:50,623	| radiolab082315 |	Turn into a pill given to
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:51,135	| radiolab082315 |	Someone
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| radiolab082315 |	And that changes
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:59,327	| radiolab082315 |	Their effect in the world and that to me is just it's this
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:01,119	| radiolab082315 |	Profound reminder that
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:06,751	| radiolab082315 |	The forces that shape everything in the universe are the same as the forces that are shaping
EDL	00:15:06,751	00:15:08,031	| radiolab082315 |	Who we are and what we do
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:09,311	| radiolab082315 |	And what her identity
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,383	| radiolab082315 |	It's possible that these forces
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:15,199	| radiolab082315 |	Shape not just the people with bipolar disorder but
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:15,711	| radiolab082315 |	All of us
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:19,807	| radiolab082315 |	End up talking to a clinical psychiatrist annafellows who
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:21,343	| radiolab082315 |	Told me about these studies
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:27,743	| radiolab082315 |	Huge epidemiologic studies biggest one I think was in Japan owners in Austria when was in Greece famous
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,511	| radiolab082315 |	When in Texas
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:29,791	| radiolab082315 |	In which they look
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:32,863	| radiolab082315 |	At communities that different levels of lithium
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:35,679	| radiolab082315 |	Lithium in the water supply and we're talking about
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:36,447	| radiolab082315 |	Tiny
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:36,959	| radiolab082315 |	Titanium
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:39,007	| radiolab082315 |	Micrograms
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,287	| radiolab082315 |	Thousands of
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,335	| radiolab082315 |	The amount in a milligram
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:45,919	| radiolab082315 |	If you think of like a pill of lithium what were talking about amounts like 10,000
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,967	| radiolab082315 |	I guess the amount
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,735	| radiolab082315 |	We're dealing with here
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:52,319	| radiolab082315 |	And these studies found by and large in in towns that had a
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:53,599	| radiolab082315 |	Tiny bit more lithium in the wall
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:55,391	| radiolab082315 |	Suicide rates were lower
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:57,439	| radiolab082315 |	In some cases as much as
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:00,511	| radiolab082315 |	30% study which is
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,815	| radiolab082315 |	Astonishing also shows
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| radiolab082315 |	The towns that have
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,655	| radiolab082315 |	The highest lithium level
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,191	| radiolab082315 |	Have
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,495	| radiolab082315 |	Lower felonies theft
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| radiolab082315 |	Rape
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,287	| radiolab082315 |	And these are
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,079	| radiolab082315 |	Reputable publisher
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:14,847	| radiolab082315 |	Studies
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:16,639	| radiolab082315 |	No peace studies
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:19,199	| radiolab082315 |	Only showing of correlations but there does Italy
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:20,223	| radiolab082315 |	Seem to be
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,039	| radiolab082315 |	Some kind of connection
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:25,343	| radiolab082315 |	How's it doing do they know why
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,391	| radiolab082315 |	Works in the brain after they know what it does
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,927	| radiolab082315 |	Essentially
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:29,951	| radiolab082315 |	No
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,487	| radiolab082315 |	Still kind of a mystery
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,303	| radiolab082315 |	One of them but here's mark dantonio
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,679	| radiolab082315 |	We know that bipolar disorder involves a defect
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,959	| radiolab082315 |	Certain part of
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:46,591	| radiolab082315 |	It's an area of the brain that has to do with controlling mood
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:50,431	| radiolab082315 |	So believe it out there neurons in the brain that
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:52,223	| radiolab082315 |	Keep your mood even
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:56,063	| radiolab082315 |	These neurons that do their job by a sort of passing electricity back
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:59,647	| radiolab082315 |	4th and that electricity is carried by sodium
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:02,719	| radiolab082315 |	So the whole system is pretty much based on sodium
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:09,119	| radiolab082315 |	Lithium is very similar to sodium so if you have lithium in the Brandon Ron's will use that music
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:10,399	| radiolab082315 |	Send lithium ion
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,703	| radiolab082315 |	Here's what's interesting
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:13,727	| radiolab082315 |	Lithium Werks
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:19,103	| radiolab082315 |	Just like sodium but not as well lithium is similar nothing properties
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:20,127	| radiolab082315 |	That it can be
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,919	| radiolab082315 |	An imposter
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,967	| radiolab082315 |	But whatever does it just doesn't work
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:24,991	| radiolab082315 |	That's the key
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:27,807	| radiolab082315 |	So then this area of the brain
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:32,159	| radiolab082315 |	The defective area of the brain that makes these moods flip
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:33,439	| radiolab082315 |	On and off so
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,463	| radiolab082315 |	Intensely
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,791	| radiolab082315 |	Doesn't work as well and that stops a bipolar episode
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,351	| radiolab082315 |	That's so interesting that maybe it's sluggishness is what makes it
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,143	| radiolab082315 |	Yep
EDL	00:17:42,655	00:17:46,751	| radiolab082315 |	Although he says that same trip where can be a sort of sodium and posture
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,519	| radiolab082315 |	But slower
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,287	| radiolab082315 |	That can
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:48,799	| radiolab082315 |	Also causes
EDL	00:17:49,567	00:17:52,383	| radiolab082315 |	Slight Tremors in your hand you can have nausea
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,943	| radiolab082315 |	I'm taking affect the kidneys
EDL	00:17:54,943	00:17:57,759	| radiolab082315 |	The balance of sodium your body is regulated
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:01,087	| radiolab082315 |	Parsley to the kidneys and somehow lithium
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:02,111	| radiolab082315 |	Replacing it
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,879	| radiolab082315 |	Canby
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,903	| radiolab082315 |	Toxic to the kidney
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,951	| radiolab082315 |	Which actually brings us back to Jamie
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,767	| radiolab082315 |	After that episode
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| radiolab082315 |	New York with Mike
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:13,887	| radiolab082315 |	In the video she went back on lithium and again she was fine fact for the last
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,935	| radiolab082315 |	16 years she's been
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:16,959	| radiolab082315 |	Completely
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,471	| radiolab082315 |	Normal
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:24,639	| radiolab082315 |	But then a couple months ago I went to a new primary physician mostly cuz I'm lazy and I didn't want to go to the Upper West Side
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:28,479	| radiolab082315 |	Side to see my other doctor and this doctor basically
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,503	| radiolab082315 |	Took my blood
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,551	| radiolab082315 |	Pressure and was like you're going to die
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,855	| radiolab082315 |	You need to go to the ER for kidney stone
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:36,927	| radiolab082315 |	Or failing and so she suddenly had to make this
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:38,719	| radiolab082315 |	Choice that I could turn over
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:40,767	| radiolab082315 |	Stay on lithium and
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:42,303	| radiolab082315 |	You know
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,607	| radiolab082315 |	Go to dialysis and get a transplant
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,655	| radiolab082315 |	Or that I had
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:49,471	| radiolab082315 |	And that now would be when I
EDL	00:18:49,471	00:18:51,007	| radiolab082315 |	What switch that I had enough function
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:56,639	| radiolab082315 |	You have you are in the middle of that decision now you feel like or do you feel like it
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:02,271	| radiolab082315 |	I think I'm going to switch I think I made that decision it's just that every psychiatrist
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,807	| radiolab082315 |	Stand New York leaves for August
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:07,647	| radiolab082315 |	Because I don't know why but they all disappear for August
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,951	| radiolab082315 |	All of August and mine said
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,743	| radiolab082315 |	You should probably wait
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,023	| radiolab082315 |	Just wait until I come back
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:14,559	| radiolab082315 |	But I
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,351	| radiolab082315 |	Feel like I have a good
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:19,167	| radiolab082315 |	Group of people around me I have
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,215	| radiolab082315 |	A solid job
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:23,519	| radiolab082315 |	It's terrifying.
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:24,031	| radiolab082315 |	Accord
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:26,335	| radiolab082315 |	Mania
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:29,663	| radiolab082315 |	But I also feel like there are a lot of effective drugs
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,199	| radiolab082315 |	And that one of them
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:31,711	| radiolab082315 |	Is going to work
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:33,247	| radiolab082315 |	Olympia Schoology
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,551	| radiolab082315 |	Depakote sounds like
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| radiolab082315 |	God
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:41,439	| radiolab082315 |	Zac Brown right you're on Depakote
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,511	| radiolab082315 |	Ashley was in the middle of that decision Jamie did
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,535	| radiolab082315 |	One last
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,583	| radiolab082315 |	She actually took a trip to Bolivia
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:49,887	| radiolab082315 |	Which is where much of the world's lithium comes
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:51,679	| radiolab082315 |	Place you can go and
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,727	| radiolab082315 |	Literally see
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,263	| radiolab082315 |	Massive
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,031	| radiolab082315 |	Salt Flats
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,823	| radiolab082315 |	Just covered in mounds of love
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:58,847	| radiolab082315 |	I just wanted to
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,663	| radiolab082315 |	Experience am I wanted
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,431	| radiolab082315 |	To be near them
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:03,967	| radiolab082315 |	So I
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:04,479	| radiolab082315 |	When
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:14,463	| radiolab082315 |	It just looks like a hallucination it looks like somebody could not have conceived of this landscape
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:16,767	| radiolab082315 |	You know you have red legs
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,327	| radiolab082315 |	Send your flocks of flamingos and
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:20,863	| radiolab082315 |	Dislike
EDL	00:20:21,375	00:20:23,935	| radiolab082315 |	Long salty expanse
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,215	| radiolab082315 |	That goes on
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:27,263	| radiolab082315 |	Ever like it's just
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,031	| radiolab082315 |	You
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:28,799	| radiolab082315 |	Jessye Norman
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,359	| radiolab082315 |	Do you go up to a pile and
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:33,407	| radiolab082315 |	Put your hand on it
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:37,247	| radiolab082315 |	You stand on it and you jump off the pile and lady I was
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:43,647	| radiolab082315 |	Makings kind of lithium angels
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,927	| radiolab082315 |	And it was awesome
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:50,815	| radiolab082315 |	I know I have to go off of it but I really am
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,655	| radiolab082315 |	I mean gratitude is like not even the word
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:58,239	| radiolab082315 |	Feel like this thing
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:00,799	| radiolab082315 |	Allows me to be me
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,359	| radiolab082315 |	It doesn't Define me but it
EDL	00:21:03,871	00:21:04,639	| radiolab082315 |	Allows
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:06,431	| radiolab082315 |	4
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| radiolab082315 |	Hino
EDL	00:21:07,711	00:21:09,247	| radiolab082315 |	Functionality and that
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:11,551	| radiolab082315 |	Sounds kind of wonky but it's like
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:12,831	| radiolab082315 |	Everyday
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,855	| radiolab082315 |	I get to work
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:17,184	| radiolab082315 |	And it's because of that like everything
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,976	| radiolab082315 |	You know I'm just
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:25,376	| radiolab082315 |	I'm grateful to it for its service I feel like it's done
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:28,704	| radiolab082315 |	Done a lot for for me
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:32,032	| radiolab082315 |	It worked so hard to get to me too
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,592	| radiolab082315 |	From The Big Bang to now
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:51,744	| radiolab082315 |	Pretty certain weather
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,816	| radiolab082315 |	A sword is made of elements
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,120	| radiolab082315 |	Do not have lithium which we should say
EDL	00:21:57,888	00:21:59,936	| radiolab082315 |	Only some of which was made in the Big Bang
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,216	| radiolab082315 |	Some of it was
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:04,032	| radiolab082315 |	Also made me super no one will have one of those coming up

EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:26,304	| radiolab082315 |	We played them the last story in progress
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,072	| radiolab082315 |	And they wrote a song about it
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:31,680	| radiolab082315 |	It's not me talking to

EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,232	| radiolab082315 |	First I was a
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:07,744	| radiolab082315 |	Star
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,304	| radiolab082315 |	Then a stain of water
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:11,840	| radiolab082315 |	Then
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:12,864	| radiolab082315 |	Kindergarten
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:20,288	| radiolab082315 |	These poems by the way come from two events that we held in New York City
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:25,920	| radiolab082315 |	We went to a emotive fruition which is a wonderful activation run by Thomas Dooley
EDL	00:26:25,920	00:26:32,064	| radiolab082315 |	Who is himself a poet he's summoned poets more on the metropolitan area for two nights they came to the Bell House in Brooklyn
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:38,976	| radiolab082315 |	Botanic lab in Manhattan and so far we have heard hydrogen by cerasoli read by Ramsey faragallah
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:44,096	| radiolab082315 |	Healing by Christina Quintana read by joniece abbott-pratt and I carried your oxygen

EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:47,936	| radiolab082315 |	So next
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:49,216	| radiolab082315 |	I'm going to be three claps
EDL	00:26:49,216	00:26:49,984	| radiolab082315 |	I don't know if you need that
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,640	| radiolab082315 |	Just-in-case mechanic
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:27:02,784	| radiolab082315 |	Okay so a while back we ended up talking to a guy named Eric Mueller who makes a YouTube channel called veritasium
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,088	| radiolab082315 |	Super popular channel guide
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:09,184	| radiolab082315 |	Science and engineering week because he's making a documentary about uranium
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:14,048	| radiolab082315 |	And we got to talkin about what happens when you take two protons or neutrons and you just
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,376	| radiolab082315 |	Putting together
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,400	| radiolab082315 |	It's it's absolutely not
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:21,728	| radiolab082315 |	And that led to this really interesting conversation about
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,800	| radiolab082315 |	The beginning of all that
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:28,640	| radiolab082315 |	I feel like a little bit of back story is worth saying here
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,200	| radiolab082315 |	One really important thing to know
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:32,992	| radiolab082315 |	Is that combining nuclei
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,272	| radiolab082315 |	Gives you energy
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,856	| radiolab082315 |	He says when you slam two particles together they get squished
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:40,160	| radiolab082315 |	And in the squishing they lose a little Mass
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| radiolab082315 |	That
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,720	| radiolab082315 |	Mask gets admitted
EDL	00:27:42,720	00:27:43,232	| radiolab082315 |	As energy
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,792	| radiolab082315 |	This is equals mc squared
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:47,072	| radiolab082315 |	That's what's happening in the Sun
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,120	| radiolab082315 |	So the sun is taking protein
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:49,888	| radiolab082315 |	Individual protons
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,192	| radiolab082315 |	And smashing them together combined
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,984	| radiolab082315 |	And that gives you energy
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,776	| radiolab082315 |	The energy of the Sun
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| radiolab082315 |	They're lost mask
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:57,312	| radiolab082315 |	Is the sunlight
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:58,336	| radiolab082315 |	That we basket
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:27:59,360	| radiolab082315 |	It was math
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,152	| radiolab082315 |	I have never thought of
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:01,664	| radiolab082315 |	Light as
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:06,272	| radiolab082315 |	Former math that's what a star does he says it smashes little Adams
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:08,064	| radiolab082315 |	Like hydrogen together to make bigger atoms
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,112	| radiolab082315 |	Like helium and then big rats
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:12,160	| radiolab082315 |	Like carvana
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,952	| radiolab082315 |	Looks like oxygen and every little Collision
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| radiolab082315 |	It's doing
EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:17,024	| radiolab082315 |	Generate some energy
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,840	| radiolab082315 |	Which keeps the star going stars live
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:22,912	| radiolab082315 |	By this process of sticking nuclei together
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,704	| radiolab082315 |	Going from smaller nuclei
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:30,592	| radiolab082315 |	Making bigger nuclei the heavier the star the more the Smashing and bashing they can do in their core
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,896	| radiolab082315 |	A bigger and bigger nuclei
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,432	| radiolab082315 |	Inform but there are limits
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,808	| radiolab082315 |	6 million years ago there was a star
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,832	| radiolab082315 |	Giant star
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:41,856	| radiolab082315 |	Way to get nurse
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:48,256	| radiolab082315 |	It was just an Adams
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:54,656	| radiolab082315 |	The combining taking hydrogen atoms and making helium taking helium atoms in
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:29:01,056	| radiolab082315 |	Making carbon making oxygen and as its National is nuclei together it's releasing energy
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:03,616	| radiolab082315 |	Bigger and bigger and bigger
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:06,944	| radiolab082315 |	There comes a point
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,504	| radiolab082315 |	We're sticking nuclei together
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,784	| radiolab082315 |	No longer gives you energy
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:13,600	| radiolab082315 |	And that point is element number 26
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:17,184	| radiolab082315 |	Iron once you've formed iron
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,464	| radiolab082315 |	If you're a star
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:22,304	| radiolab082315 |	That's the end of life as you know it
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:29,728	| radiolab082315 |	Is iron iron is incredibly stable one of the most stable
EDL	00:29:29,728	00:29:31,008	| radiolab082315 |	Nuclei in the universe
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:35,360	| radiolab082315 |	Its protons are tightly packed in there until you can't
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:36,128	| radiolab082315 |	Force
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:40,992	| radiolab082315 |	Any more energy out of which means you have a core which is no longer
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:45,600	| radiolab082315 |	Going to give you energy you can't cook up anything higher than than the iron
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:51,488	| radiolab082315 |	What happened to the star does it just become a big hunk what happens
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:58,656	| radiolab082315 |	Everything starts to collapse gravity takes over
EDL	00:29:58,656	00:30:00,192	| radiolab082315 |	By the fact that there's all this energy
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:01,216	| radiolab082315 |	Going out
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,264	| radiolab082315 |	To the Dead iron-core starts
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:09,664	| radiolab082315 |	Pulling everything back in and if this point all of that stuff which is headed inwards aluminum oxygen carbon magnesia
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:14,272	| radiolab082315 |	Silicone starts rubbing against each other and it starts getting real hot
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,552	| radiolab082315 |	And reel dance
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:17,088	| radiolab082315 |	All of a sudden
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,624	| radiolab082315 |	You get
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:21,696	| radiolab082315 |	The supernova
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:29,632	| radiolab082315 |	That was the most pathetic Supernova explosion
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:36,544	| radiolab082315 |	So even though we know there are no sounds in space for the purposes of your enjoyment
EDL	00:30:36,544	00:30:37,824	| radiolab082315 |	We present to you
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:43,200	| radiolab082315 |	This Supernova here's the beauty of it
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,992	| radiolab082315 |	Here's the beauty of the supernova
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:51,392	| radiolab082315 |	In the ridiculous excesses of energy that are there in the supernova
EDL	00:30:51,392	00:30:56,512	| radiolab082315 |	Explosion the biggest in the universe there is so much energy
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:58,560	| radiolab082315 |	Is you for these nuclei
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:30:59,328	| radiolab082315 |	Which
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,864	| radiolab082315 |	Would not form
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,888	| radiolab082315 |	Under any other conditions
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:07,264	| radiolab082315 |	You know Iron is carbon to form germanium silicon hits oxygen to form
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:10,336	| radiolab082315 |	Titanium you start to get all of these bigger elements
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:13,152	| radiolab082315 |	Including like gold including the gold
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,688	| radiolab082315 |	In your wedding ring
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:19,040	| radiolab082315 |	Extreme ridiculous excess of energy to form
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,672	| radiolab082315 |	Is done
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:29,792	| radiolab082315 |	And what are you left with your left with a giant field of debris
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:33,888	| radiolab082315 |	Carbon and oxygen
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:36,960	| radiolab082315 |	Silicon

EDL	00:31:37,728	00:31:41,568	| radiolab082315 |	Clump together due to gravity
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:46,432	| radiolab082315 |	Together is our sun
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:48,480	| radiolab082315 |	Mostly hydrogen and helium in it
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:51,552	| radiolab082315 |	It's like 99% of all the mass in our solar system
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:56,160	| radiolab082315 |	And then the other trunks other bits and pieces start to come together as well
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:32:03,072	| radiolab082315 |	Outside
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:03,584	| radiolab082315 |	How you get the Earth
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:05,632	| radiolab082315 |	And all of us
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:13,568	| radiolab082315 |	This is where we got you so you're saying this is the birth of everything past iron
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,104	| radiolab082315 |	Exactly
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:18,176	| radiolab082315 |	Exactly but I think I can get it for the very first time
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:21,504	| radiolab082315 |	Post Supernova like in the in the middle of cycle

EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,000	| radiolab082315 |	Childhood brilliance
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:40,608	| radiolab082315 |	Basically I want to hear about those times when I kid you know did something
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:43,680	| radiolab082315 |	It just means you lean back and say whoa
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:50,592	| radiolab082315 |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,896	| radiolab082315 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons
EDL	00:33:52,896	00:33:56,992	| radiolab082315 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:01,856	| radiolab082315 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:08,768	| radiolab082315 |	We're interested in the specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:09,792	| radiolab082315 |	Have anything to do with the test
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:12,608	| radiolab082315 |	If you have a story with us

EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:46,656	| radiolab082315 |	So
EDL	00:34:47,168	00:34:47,680	| radiolab082315 |	Science
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,408	| radiolab082315 |	With my sister's I just always go hashtag science
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:02,528	| radiolab082315 |	Cuz they get really sick of me trying to teach the kids science lesson
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:06,112	| radiolab082315 |	#science it okay so
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:09,696	| radiolab082315 |	One of the biggest mysteries in
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:10,208	| radiolab082315 |	Biology
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:12,512	| radiolab082315 |	How old am I
EDL	00:35:14,048	00:35:14,816	| radiolab082315 |	That
EDL	00:35:14,816	00:35:15,328	| radiolab082315 |	It doesn't seem like
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,400	| radiolab082315 |	Well I mean like obviously I'm
EDL	00:35:18,912	00:35:21,728	| radiolab082315 |	Molly Webster who's 32 years old who has lived
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:22,240	| radiolab082315 |	You know
EDL	00:35:22,752	00:35:26,080	| radiolab082315 |	232 birthdays I guess but this is a question of like
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:29,408	| radiolab082315 |	We know that some cells in our body regenerate
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:30,688	| radiolab082315 |	And so it's like
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:34,784	| radiolab082315 |	How old are those cells like how old is my heart right now
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:37,856	| radiolab082315 |	I like how old my eyeball or how old is my nose
EDL	00:35:37,856	00:35:39,648	| radiolab082315 |	The northwest
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,440	| radiolab082315 |	Corner of my kidney
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:47,840	| radiolab082315 |	It's just like you know if I'm 3 years old now I'm 33 years old do the cells in the 32-year
EDL	00:35:47,840	00:35:51,168	| radiolab082315 |	World are they the same as earn even the same as the one when I was three that
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:55,520	| radiolab082315 |	The question that's one of the questions in the same if they're not the same
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:59,104	| radiolab082315 |	Because if you understand that then you might be able to look like
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:05,504	| radiolab082315 |	Salve injuries help people heal faster or fix diseases where cells are
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,528	| radiolab082315 |	You don't messed up
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:10,368	| radiolab082315 |	Like psoriasis or anemia or ALS or something
EDL	00:36:10,368	00:36:14,208	| radiolab082315 |	Like that but also it just seems so cool to be able to be like oh that's
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:15,488	| radiolab082315 |	Chunk of my heart
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:17,536	| radiolab082315 |	Is from 1997
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:21,376	| radiolab082315 |	My heart is from 1983
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:27,776	| radiolab082315 |	At the party of Robert I would want to meet the original Roberts
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:32,384	| radiolab082315 |	Is there anybody who's been here since 1947 I'd love to just say hello
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:38,784	| radiolab082315 |	And if you just join me in 2015 well that's nice I mean night
EDL	00:36:38,784	00:36:43,392	| radiolab082315 |	One of the questions I've had for a long time is is there a way that we
EDL	00:36:43,392	00:36:45,696	| radiolab082315 |	Can try to date cell
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:50,048	| radiolab082315 |	Until the like we can't really send anything into the body because that can be toxic
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:50,816	| radiolab082315 |	So
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:52,608	| radiolab082315 |	Answer for a long time have been no
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:55,680	| radiolab082315 |	And then 2002's
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,216	| radiolab082315 |	This little idea pop
EDL	00:36:57,216	00:36:57,728	| radiolab082315 |	Stop
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:03,360	| radiolab082315 |	And it's something called the bomb pulse
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:07,456	| radiolab082315 |	Bomb by OMB and impulse
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:10,272	| radiolab082315 |	Pul SE
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:11,808	| radiolab082315 |	To explain
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:24,864	| radiolab082315 |	Forties and fifties we all know this we round way
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:31,264	| radiolab082315 |	Testicle out of atomic bomb
EDL	00:37:31,264	00:37:37,664	| radiolab082315 |	The first test with 1945 Trinity test New Mexico a few weeks later
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:44,064	| radiolab082315 |	Atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
EDL	00:37:44,064	00:37:50,464	| radiolab082315 |	World War II comes to an end the rest of the world just tries to catch up to the US
EDL	00:37:50,464	00:37:56,864	| radiolab082315 |	The Russians
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:38:03,264	| radiolab082315 |	Then after the Russians British
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:07,360	| radiolab082315 |	French bull Cold War basically just continues to unspool
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,920	| radiolab082315 |	All in all over 400
EDL	00:38:09,920	00:38:10,944	| radiolab082315 |	Atomic test
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:13,248	| radiolab082315 |	Schwinn off above ground between 19
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,296	| radiolab082315 |	1945 and 1963
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,320	| radiolab082315 |	Just imagine
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:19,136	| radiolab082315 |	If only one atom bomb would be dropped on an American city
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:22,208	| radiolab082315 |	Thousands of persons would be killed instantly
EDL	00:38:22,208	00:38:23,488	| radiolab082315 |	Gnosis sucky time
EDL	00:38:24,256	00:38:25,792	| radiolab082315 |	Well hashtag Zion
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,840	| radiolab082315 |	There's one good thing
EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:29,632	| radiolab082315 |	Potentially one good thing
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:30,912	| radiolab082315 |	Popped out
EDL	00:38:30,912	00:38:33,728	| radiolab082315 |	And that is an answer to the question of how old are we
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:36,288	| radiolab082315 |	That somehow came out of the bomb test
EDL	00:38:36,288	00:38:37,056	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah
EDL	00:38:37,056	00:38:37,568	| radiolab082315 |	Hello how
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,384	| radiolab082315 |	Let me explain
EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:43,712	| radiolab082315 |	Do it so with every one of those detonations
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:47,808	| radiolab082315 |	When atomic bomb goes off it would shoot a whole bunch of stuff up into the app
EDL	00:38:47,808	00:38:50,624	| radiolab082315 |	All these like radioactive elements like
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,392	| radiolab082315 |	Bcmud
EDL	00:38:51,392	00:38:52,416	| radiolab082315 |	Tony and all these things
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:59,584	| radiolab082315 |	Process that explosion shoots up a bunch of neutrons and then Neutron will crash into nitrogen
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:01,376	| radiolab082315 |	Floating in our atmosphere
EDL	00:39:01,376	00:39:02,400	| radiolab082315 |	And create
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:02,912	| radiolab082315 |	C14
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,728	| radiolab082315 |	Do very special type of carbon it has to
EDL	00:39:05,728	00:39:06,496	| radiolab082315 |	The particles in it
EDL	00:39:07,264	00:39:08,032	| radiolab082315 |	Now is all that
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:10,592	| radiolab082315 |	Bad radioactive stuff starts
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:12,384	| radiolab082315 |	Falling out of the atmosphere back to
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:15,200	| radiolab082315 |	The ground c14 doesn't fall out of the sky
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:16,224	| radiolab082315 |	I just heard a
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:16,736	| radiolab082315 |	Floats there
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:23,392	| radiolab082315 |	And what happened is overtime the wind currents
EDL	00:39:23,392	00:39:26,464	| radiolab082315 |	Carried c14 from these test site
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:29,024	| radiolab082315 |	And just spread it all over the planet
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:31,840	| radiolab082315 |	And the c14
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:34,656	| radiolab082315 |	Which is just totally like normal carbon
EDL	00:39:34,656	00:39:35,680	| radiolab082315 |	Not harmful
EDL	00:39:35,680	00:39:38,496	| radiolab082315 |	It is bonds with oxygen and it gets
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:39,776	| radiolab082315 |	Sucked up into plants
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,080	| radiolab082315 |	And then animals eat the plants
EDL	00:39:42,080	00:39:44,384	| radiolab082315 |	And then we eat the animals or we the plan
EDL	00:39:44,384	00:39:46,688	| radiolab082315 |	And then suddenly the c-14 is in US
EDL	00:39:47,712	00:39:51,296	| radiolab082315 |	So we all have like a little bit of the atomic age in US
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:53,856	| radiolab082315 |	Maybe I was even born in 1963 so
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:56,160	| radiolab082315 |	Why would it be in me that is
EDL	00:39:56,160	00:40:00,000	| radiolab082315 |	Cool thing because it hangs out in the air for a long time so it's
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,536	| radiolab082315 |	Is actually still up there
EDL	00:40:02,048	00:40:04,608	| radiolab082315 |	What does have anything to do with dating anything
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:05,888	| radiolab082315 |	Yes I'm about to tell you that
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,168	| radiolab082315 |	Hey you there
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:08,960	| radiolab082315 |	Yes I am
EDL	00:40:09,472	00:40:10,752	| radiolab082315 |	I'm principal called
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:14,848	| radiolab082315 |	I'm a senior scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab
EDL	00:40:14,848	00:40:16,640	| radiolab082315 |	Professor of stem cell research
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:22,784	| radiolab082315 |	At The karolinska Institute has become nearly 2,000 Jonas is staring down this question of like how do I date
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:24,832	| radiolab082315 |	And a certain point he gets
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:25,856	| radiolab082315 |	Together with Bruce
EDL	00:40:25,856	00:40:28,672	| radiolab082315 |	Because he comes up with this idea which is just l
EDL	00:40:29,184	00:40:35,584	| radiolab082315 |	Maybe we just look up there there's some groups in Europe is one in particular that's been measuring the atmos
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:40,448	| radiolab082315 |	Disappear every two weeks since the late 1950s images
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:47,360	| radiolab082315 |	Bruce says what the scientist have done is they've taken all of these measurements and they put them into one chart so you can see the
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:49,408	| radiolab082315 |	The amount of c-14 in the atmosphere over
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:55,808	| radiolab082315 |	So we we have this basically basically a calendar and I could I could send you a picture so you can see what
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:41:00,160	| radiolab082315 |	See what the graph looks like to see a picture
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:06,560	| radiolab082315 |	According to Jonas
EDL	00:41:06,560	00:41:09,632	| radiolab082315 |	Consadole in 1950
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:11,168	| radiolab082315 |	Define with all the bomb test
EDL	00:41:11,168	00:41:12,192	| radiolab082315 |	Victor siburian
EDL	00:41:13,216	00:41:13,984	| radiolab082315 |	Increase
EDL	00:41:14,496	00:41:16,288	| radiolab082315 |	A lot of carbon-14
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:18,592	| radiolab082315 |	Very dramatic increase that's why they call it a pulse
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:25,504	| radiolab082315 |	And that increase was all the way up to 1963 when
EDL	00:41:25,504	00:41:31,904	| radiolab082315 |	Historic events in the US the UK and Soviet Union agree to stop exploding atomic bombs
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:34,208	| radiolab082315 |	Of an atom Test Ban
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:35,744	| radiolab082315 |	After.
EDL	00:41:37,536	00:41:38,304	| radiolab082315 |	Fragile
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:38,816	| radiolab082315 |	Decline
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:45,984	| radiolab082315 |	You know they're just measuring it all the way down so they can just say oh like here's where it was in 1980
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:48,288	| radiolab082315 |	Here's where it was in 1990
EDL	00:41:48,800	00:41:49,824	| radiolab082315 |	Mm
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,592	| radiolab082315 |	2010
EDL	00:41:51,360	00:41:53,151	| radiolab082315 |	This right here is the coolest part because
EDL	00:41:53,919	00:41:56,479	| radiolab082315 |	The amount of c-14 in the atmosphere
EDL	00:41:56,479	00:41:57,503	| radiolab082315 |	Any given moment
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:01,087	| radiolab082315 |	Is directly reflected in our cells
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:04,671	| radiolab082315 |	It's right so if there's like that much
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:10,047	| radiolab082315 |	C14 in the atmosphere in September 1972
EDL	00:42:10,047	00:42:16,447	| radiolab082315 |	And that is going to be mirrored in cells that were born in September 1972
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:17,471	| radiolab082315 |	So it is like this
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,751	| radiolab082315 |	Totally perfect
EDL	00:42:19,263	00:42:19,775	| radiolab082315 |	Birthday
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:25,151	| radiolab082315 |	We can see approximately how long have they been there for 10 years or 20 years or 30 years
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:27,199	| radiolab082315 |	It's like once this idea got out
EDL	00:42:27,967	00:42:33,343	| radiolab082315 |	Everlook scientists all over the world were like oh yeah
EDL	00:42:33,343	00:42:35,135	| radiolab082315 |	There's been a new invention
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:36,671	| radiolab082315 |	It didn't take long to see
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:39,487	| radiolab082315 |	This might be something cool to do
EDL	00:42:39,487	00:42:42,815	| radiolab082315 |	It came about because they made a big atomic bomb
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:45,375	| radiolab082315 |	So just to give you a quick sense of some of the work
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:49,215	| radiolab082315 |	It came out of this I spoke to one scientist I'm Christy sporting and I work
EDL	00:42:49,215	00:42:54,335	| radiolab082315 |	Karolinska Institute in Stockholm she was working with Jonas and they figured out how to use c14
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:55,871	| radiolab082315 |	In brain
EDL	00:42:56,383	00:42:58,175	| radiolab082315 |	I mean first of all the basic question was
EDL	00:42:58,687	00:43:00,735	| radiolab082315 |	Can adult humans make new neurons
EDL	00:43:00,735	00:43:06,367	| radiolab082315 |	She says that for like a hundred years so Dogma had always been that the neurons football movies are the ones who died with
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:09,439	| radiolab082315 |	The problem was she had no way to investigate this
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:11,231	| radiolab082315 |	Said she couldn't use it in humans
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:12,767	| radiolab082315 |	Even if they were dead humans
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:16,095	| radiolab082315 |	Until she figured out a technique where she could like extract brain cells
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:16,863	| radiolab082315 |	To see how much do you
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:17,631	| radiolab082315 |	14 was in there
EDL	00:43:17,631	00:43:18,143	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:20,959	| radiolab082315 |	It turns out the next best thing to Human
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,239	| radiolab082315 |	Is a horse
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:23,519	| radiolab082315 |	Because horses
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:25,055	| radiolab082315 |	Khalifa Court cemitas decade
EDL	00:43:25,567	00:43:27,359	| radiolab082315 |	So every second Tuesday
EDL	00:43:27,359	00:43:29,151	| radiolab082315 |	I would go out to the local abattoir
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:30,687	| radiolab082315 |	Bulova slaughterhouse
EDL	00:43:30,687	00:43:31,455	| radiolab082315 |	An hour away
EDL	00:43:31,455	00:43:32,223	| radiolab082315 |	And
EDL	00:43:32,223	00:43:34,527	| radiolab082315 |	I mean I was a vegetarian surrounded by caucus
EDL	00:43:35,295	00:43:36,063	| radiolab082315 |	And I would
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,599	| radiolab082315 |	Bring the horse's head out to
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:40,927	| radiolab082315 |	And I had to figure out how to get the brain out of its head
EDL	00:43:40,927	00:43:41,951	| radiolab082315 |	Wait what
EDL	00:43:42,463	00:43:43,999	| radiolab082315 |	You actually had to like
EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:49,887	| radiolab082315 |	Cut open the skull and get to the brain yourself I'm in the second time I went I took my boyfriend with me
EDL	00:43:49,887	00:43:51,679	| radiolab082315 |	It's like I can't do this
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,215	| radiolab082315 |	Physically
EDL	00:43:53,215	00:43:55,007	| radiolab082315 |	They actually had a circular saw
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:58,079	| radiolab082315 |	And actually discovered that to the skull
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:58,847	| radiolab082315 |	The barn
EDL	00:43:58,847	00:44:00,383	| radiolab082315 |	Across the top the noise of the horse
EDL	00:44:01,151	00:44:04,223	| radiolab082315 |	Is quite thin so that was a much easier access
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:04,991	| radiolab082315 |	Point
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:10,111	| radiolab082315 |	Christ discussion did you ever see your research going that way
EDL	00:44:10,111	00:44:11,135	| radiolab082315 |	Xidan
EDL	00:44:11,647	00:44:12,415	| radiolab082315 |	Not at all
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:16,255	| radiolab082315 |	But what she saw when she finally moved her research from Horseheads
EDL	00:44:16,255	00:44:17,023	| radiolab082315 |	Humans
EDL	00:44:17,023	00:44:17,535	| radiolab082315 |	Was
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,071	| radiolab082315 |	Turn over
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:21,631	| radiolab082315 |	Which I'm quite Redbox levels of new neurons in adulthood
EDL	00:44:22,143	00:44:28,031	| radiolab082315 |	I think once you notice is team show that this
EDL	00:44:28,031	00:44:28,799	| radiolab082315 |	Work
EDL	00:44:28,799	00:44:30,335	| radiolab082315 |	Scientist got excited
EDL	00:44:30,335	00:44:32,127	| radiolab082315 |	And people started today thing
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,407	| radiolab082315 |	And not just cells
EDL	00:44:33,919	00:44:35,199	| radiolab082315 |	So
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:37,503	| radiolab082315 |	Pantages
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,599	| radiolab082315 |	The bassline ages we knew before
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:42,367	| radiolab082315 |	14
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:44,415	| radiolab082315 |	Was that the skin was like 14 days old
EDL	00:44:44,927	00:44:47,743	| radiolab082315 |	Working for Deloitte
EDL	00:44:50,303	00:44:52,351	| radiolab082315 |	Surface level of your gut
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:56,191	| radiolab082315 |	Skin on your gut I guess was 5 days
EDL	00:44:57,215	00:44:59,775	| radiolab082315 |	5 days even shorter than skin
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:03,359	| radiolab082315 |	Does that's like the surface of the intestine the surface
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:09,759	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah that's like
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:15,135	| radiolab082315 |	Embassy 14 the the deeper muscle apart of the intestine
EDL	00:45:15,135	00:45:16,415	| radiolab082315 |	The averages
EDL	00:45:16,415	00:45:17,951	| radiolab082315 |	18.1 years
EDL	00:45:18,463	00:45:24,351	| radiolab082315 |	15.1 years old big difference between skin 9 years old
EDL	00:45:24,863	00:45:27,679	| radiolab082315 |	That sells was another one that they did
EDL	00:45:27,679	00:45:29,215	| radiolab082315 |	10 years old
EDL	00:45:29,215	00:45:29,983	| radiolab082315 |	10 years old
EDL	00:45:29,983	00:45:30,751	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:32,543	| radiolab082315 |	Interesting why would a fat cell need to
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:34,847	| radiolab082315 |	10 years
EDL	00:45:34,847	00:45:41,247	| radiolab082315 |	Cuz it's perverted George.
EDL	00:45:41,247	00:45:41,759	| radiolab082315 |	They don't know
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:46,367	| radiolab082315 |	Do they know that like what would be one of the oldest part of us
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:50,207	| radiolab082315 |	Your your cortex which is like the
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:51,231	| radiolab082315 |	The part of your brain that does
EDL	00:45:51,231	00:45:53,023	| radiolab082315 |	Like abstract thinking
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:55,071	| radiolab082315 |	Or your voluntary movements
EDL	00:45:55,071	00:45:56,351	| radiolab082315 |	That's as old as you are
EDL	00:45:57,119	00:45:57,631	| radiolab082315 |	Really
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:00,703	| radiolab082315 |	If you want to know one of the
EDL	00:46:00,703	00:46:01,471	| radiolab082315 |	The oldest parts of
EDL	00:46:02,239	00:46:05,055	| radiolab082315 |	The oldest cell is probably in
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:08,127	| radiolab082315 |	Your pinky part of your brain
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:08,895	| radiolab082315 |	Cortical neuron
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:09,919	| radiolab082315 |	Will that fit
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:11,711	| radiolab082315 |	If I think of myself
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:13,503	| radiolab082315 |	As the stories I tell my
EDL	00:46:13,503	00:46:15,551	| radiolab082315 |	When you get Alzheimer's and you lose
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:17,855	| radiolab082315 |	Your stories and you lose your mind like people
EDL	00:46:18,367	00:46:22,463	| radiolab082315 |	But the interesting thing though is the hippocampus is where you keep all your memories
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:24,767	| radiolab082315 |	And they saw that your hippocampus
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:25,535	| radiolab082315 |	Does
EDL	00:46:25,535	00:46:26,559	| radiolab082315 |	Make a bunch of new
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:29,887	| radiolab082315 |	Neurons in the hippocampus
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:32,447	| radiolab082315 |	That's Jonas recent again
EDL	00:46:32,447	00:46:36,287	| radiolab082315 |	Jets approximately 1400 new hippocampal neurons
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:37,055	| radiolab082315 |	Per day
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:37,823	| radiolab082315 |	Really
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:41,407	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah and then each of those neurons will live like 20 maybe 30 years
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:44,479	| radiolab082315 |	So does that mean that the part of Robert's brain where he keeps
EDL	00:46:44,991	00:46:47,295	| radiolab082315 |	Stories he tells himself that part
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:50,111	| radiolab082315 |	Is being made new every 20 or 30 years yeah
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:53,183	| radiolab082315 |	Strange thing I like your oldest stories
EDL	00:46:53,183	00:46:54,207	| radiolab082315 |	Could be stored
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:55,487	| radiolab082315 |	In baby little neurons
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:46:56,511	| radiolab082315 |	He's weird
EDL	00:46:57,791	00:46:59,327	| radiolab082315 |	I remember going to
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,095	| radiolab082315 |	The Kyoto
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:00,863	| radiolab082315 |	And it's like
EDL	00:47:00,863	00:47:02,143	| radiolab082315 |	The oldest most
EDL	00:47:02,143	00:47:02,911	| radiolab082315 |	Temple
EDL	00:47:02,911	00:47:03,423	| radiolab082315 |	In Kyoto
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:04,959	| radiolab082315 |	It has
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,287	| radiolab082315 |	Exactly the form that it had
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:09,823	| radiolab082315 |	Spell hundreds
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,335	| radiolab082315 |	If years ago
EDL	00:47:10,847	00:47:11,871	| radiolab082315 |	But when you walk in
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:12,895	| radiolab082315 |	Though
EDL	00:47:13,919	00:47:14,943	| radiolab082315 |	The walls in the
EDL	00:47:15,455	00:47:16,223	| radiolab082315 |	Floors and
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:17,503	| radiolab082315 |	The roofing live Benrus
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:19,551	| radiolab082315 |	Stewart they can restore toxic over
EDL	00:47:19,551	00:47:20,063	| radiolab082315 |	And over again
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:22,623	| radiolab082315 |	Cuz in Japan what they call old
EDL	00:47:23,135	00:47:23,903	| radiolab082315 |	Is the Forum
EDL	00:47:25,951	00:47:26,463	| radiolab082315 |	Go to
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,487	| radiolab082315 |	Athens
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:29,279	| radiolab082315 |	And you go up to the
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:31,071	| radiolab082315 |	The Parthenon
EDL	00:47:31,839	00:47:34,143	| radiolab082315 |	They're you're standing in the very top
EDL	00:47:34,911	00:47:35,423	| radiolab082315 |	Pericles
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:36,959	| radiolab082315 |	The same
EDL	00:47:38,495	00:47:39,519	| radiolab082315 |	Same materials
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:40,799	| radiolab082315 |	So I can
EDL	00:47:40,799	00:47:42,335	| radiolab082315 |	In Greece they believe
EDL	00:47:43,103	00:47:45,407	| radiolab082315 |	That the original stuff is the
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:47,455	| radiolab082315 |	Is what you preserve and in Japan they don't
EDL	00:47:47,455	00:47:48,479	| radiolab082315 |	I think it's just the form
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:55,391	| radiolab082315 |	I was thinking of this thing you're doing is sort of a little bit like that like I was thinking I'm much more Greek than I am Japanese
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:48:02,815	| radiolab082315 |	Cuz I want to know like what my original cells are fit where they are in me but my question is messing me up more basic
EDL	00:48:02,815	00:48:03,583	| radiolab082315 |	Tickets like why does
EDL	00:48:04,095	00:48:05,375	| radiolab082315 |	Part of Me guitar
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:05,887	| radiolab082315 |	Reborn in
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:08,703	| radiolab082315 |	The other part to me don't like why not all of me
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:12,543	| radiolab082315 |	If all of you is being reborn you just
EDL	00:48:12,543	00:48:16,895	| radiolab082315 |	Crumble into dust
EDL	00:48:16,895	00:48:19,199	| radiolab082315 |	It's interesting because they don't know they said the next
EDL	00:48:19,199	00:48:20,479	| radiolab082315 |	They said basically
EDL	00:48:20,479	00:48:26,623	| radiolab082315 |	This question of how old is a cell they said no one was asking everyone wondered this but no one was asking this question cuz they never
EDL	00:48:27,135	00:48:27,903	| radiolab082315 |	Tools to ask
EDL	00:48:28,671	00:48:30,463	| radiolab082315 |	So now they're just starting to ask those questions
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:31,743	| radiolab082315 |	The problem
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:38,655	| radiolab082315 |	This bump also we've been
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:40,447	| radiolab082315 |	Dependent on in the last decade
EDL	00:48:40,447	00:48:41,983	| radiolab082315 |	To start answering all these questions
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:42,751	| radiolab082315 |	It going away
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:45,823	| radiolab082315 |	Really every day a little more that c14
EDL	00:48:45,823	00:48:46,591	| radiolab082315 |	Get sucked out of the air
EDL	00:48:47,103	00:48:49,663	| radiolab082315 |	So how much time do we have left teen years
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:51,455	| radiolab082315 |	It's gone by 2030
EDL	00:48:51,455	00:48:52,479	| radiolab082315 |	Give or take
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:54,527	| radiolab082315 |	So we need to get questions on Sat now
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:58,367	| radiolab082315 |	Because we really are working against the clock for many things we want to look at
EDL	00:48:58,367	00:49:01,439	| radiolab082315 |	I talked to his Alzheimer's researcher who is trying to figure out life
EDL	00:49:01,439	00:49:03,999	| radiolab082315 |	The chronology of the disease like when certain
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:08,607	| radiolab082315 |	Like pathologies form in the brain he was come just like I just wish I had a little more time
EDL	00:49:11,935	00:49:13,215	| radiolab082315 |	And when I think about this
EDL	00:49:13,983	00:49:18,079	| radiolab082315 |	Like I think about this on the subway this morning like I was looking around and I was thinking
EDL	00:49:18,079	00:49:20,383	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah I'm on the L train it's a bunch of like
EDL	00:49:21,151	00:49:25,759	| radiolab082315 |	30 year old kids or something and I was like these they're all reading or something drinking there
EDL	00:49:25,759	00:49:26,527	| radiolab082315 |	Expensive latte
EDL	00:49:27,295	00:49:28,831	| radiolab082315 |	Like these people are
EDL	00:49:28,831	00:49:30,367	| radiolab082315 |	So far away
EDL	00:49:30,367	00:49:31,135	| radiolab082315 |	From thinking about
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:32,159	| radiolab082315 |	Cold War
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:34,207	| radiolab082315 |	Atomic bombs or anything like that
EDL	00:49:34,207	00:49:36,255	| radiolab082315 |	And they're all walking around just like this

EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:44,447	| radiolab082315 |	Atomic. Inside of them and then that little signal is like banging out like now

EDL	00:49:50,847	00:49:53,407	| radiolab082315 |	The heart and the fact that it's now going away
EDL	00:49:54,431	00:49:55,455	| radiolab082315 |	And how like

EDL	00:54:50,879	00:54:52,671	| radiolab082315 |	It's a matter that we know of

EDL	00:55:29,279	00:55:30,815	| radiolab082315 |	What is that stuff
EDL	00:55:30,815	00:55:32,095	| radiolab082315 |	Whatever it is
EDL	00:55:32,095	00:55:34,911	| radiolab082315 |	It's not interacting with the matter of our world

EDL	00:56:28,415	00:56:31,487	| radiolab082315 |	Is that it is so weakly interacting that
EDL	00:56:32,511	00:56:37,375	| radiolab082315 |	It will pass straight for you and in fact will pass straight through the bed and will

EDL	00:58:06,207	00:58:09,791	| radiolab082315 |	I was interested in the idea of these Frontiers at the
EDL	00:58:09,791	00:58:12,351	| radiolab082315 |	Where are you from
EDL	00:58:12,351	00:58:18,495	| radiolab082315 |	Frontier the movie Fargo
EDL	00:58:20,543	00:58:22,335	| radiolab082315 |	Jamaican says that this story
EDL	00:58:22,847	00:58:29,247	| radiolab082315 |	It starts off way back in the old west Hardy run to Wild rugged 1874 General
EDL	00:58:29,247	00:58:32,319	| radiolab082315 |	Custer and crew Custer comes out looking for this
EDL	00:58:32,319	00:58:34,623	| radiolab082315 |	Gold and finds it
EDL	00:58:34,623	00:58:37,951	| radiolab082315 |	Gold on the mountains and the rivers and in the dark.
EDL	00:58:37,951	00:58:44,351	| radiolab082315 |	Far below the surface of the Earth just like that 10,000 people within 2 years or just invading
EDL	00:58:44,351	00:58:50,751	| radiolab082315 |	Illegally invading the Black Hills which were of the great Sioux reservation and by 1901 the miners blast
EDL	00:58:50,751	00:58:57,151	| radiolab082315 |	1500 feet down by 1927 3500 feet down by 1975
EDL	00:58:57,151	00:58:58,175	| radiolab082315 |	2000 feet deep
EDL	00:58:58,687	00:58:59,967	| radiolab082315 |	To put that into perspective
EDL	00:58:59,967	00:59:01,247	| radiolab082315 |	If that's what's up mile and a half
EDL	00:59:02,015	00:59:06,623	| radiolab082315 |	Is a mile and a half
EDL	00:59:06,623	00:59:09,695	| radiolab082315 |	Imagine 6 empire state buildings going
EDL	00:59:09,695	00:59:12,767	| radiolab082315 |	Straight down and gold is that valuable that you could put
EDL	00:59:12,767	00:59:16,351	| radiolab082315 |	That kind of effort and energy isn't that astonishing
EDL	00:59:16,351	00:59:19,935	| radiolab082315 |	But what happened is that eventually the price of gold
EDL	00:59:19,935	00:59:22,751	| radiolab082315 |	Drop to the point where the size of the mine
EDL	00:59:23,519	00:59:27,871	| radiolab082315 |	What's the unsustainable mining 8000 feet down
EDL	00:59:27,871	00:59:28,895	| radiolab082315 |	Nina forever
EDL	00:59:28,895	00:59:32,223	| radiolab082315 |	What you go down your price increases your cost increase
EDL	00:59:32,223	00:59:35,551	| radiolab082315 |	You got a holic further you got to air condition the mine
EDL	00:59:35,551	00:59:39,391	| radiolab082315 |	You got to pump out the groundwater you have to run electrical lines down there you
EDL	00:59:39,391	00:59:40,927	| radiolab082315 |	And so in 2001
EDL	00:59:40,927	00:59:43,487	| radiolab082315 |	126 years of being an operation
EDL	00:59:43,999	00:59:44,767	| radiolab082315 |	The mine shut down
EDL	00:59:46,047	00:59:51,679	| radiolab082315 |	Metacritic ghost town I mean did the fear that we were just going to have the whole
EDL	00:59:51,679	00:59:52,959	| radiolab082315 |	The whole economy of this
EDL	00:59:53,471	00:59:55,519	| radiolab082315 |	Part of the country is going to fall apart
EDL	00:59:55,519	00:59:56,031	| radiolab082315 |	Barbie
EDL	00:59:56,543	00:59:58,335	| radiolab082315 |	As this was happening
EDL	00:59:58,335	01:00:00,383	| radiolab082315 |	We saw
EDL	01:00:00,383	01:00:06,783	| radiolab082315 |	An opportunity that these physicists realize that this was an opportunity
EDL	01:00:06,783	01:00:10,111	| radiolab082315 |	I don't like how I do physicists do
EDL	01:00:10,111	01:00:12,671	| radiolab082315 |	Are mental physicists do they love holes
EDL	01:00:12,671	01:00:19,071	| radiolab082315 |	Dwarves
EDL	01:00:19,071	01:00:23,935	| radiolab082315 |	This is where we get to that idea of quiet this experiment needs a kind of quiet
EDL	01:00:23,935	01:00:25,727	| radiolab082315 |	That you cannot find on the surface of the Earth
EDL	01:00:25,727	01:00:32,127	| radiolab082315 |	When you and I are sitting on the surface of the Earth when are acutely aware of it but we are being
EDL	01:00:32,127	01:00:38,527	| radiolab082315 |	Hit by cosmic rays at a rate that I think really rather amazes people
EDL	01:00:38,527	01:00:40,063	| radiolab082315 |	If you simply hold your hand out
EDL	01:00:41,087	01:00:43,135	| radiolab082315 |	Three or four times a second
EDL	01:00:43,135	01:00:48,255	| radiolab082315 |	Cosmic ray is going through your off hand and it's going right through it and that's every second
EDL	01:00:49,023	01:00:53,119	| radiolab082315 |	Say what you want your body is literally bathed in thousands of these every second
EDL	01:00:54,143	01:00:56,447	| radiolab082315 |	We are just being bombarded with
EDL	01:00:57,727	01:00:58,495	| radiolab082315 |	Add in
EDL	01:00:59,263	01:01:02,335	| radiolab082315 |	Ricky schedule
EDL	01:01:02,335	01:01:04,127	| radiolab082315 |	Talks about it like being in the middle of a
EDL	01:01:04,639	01:01:06,431	| radiolab082315 |	What's the stadium during the Super Bowl
EDL	01:01:07,199	01:01:07,967	| radiolab082315 |	And
EDL	01:01:07,967	01:01:10,271	| radiolab082315 |	This is is there everybody in this
EDL	01:01:10,271	01:01:11,295	| radiolab082315 |	Arena's clap
EDL	01:01:11,295	01:01:17,695	| radiolab082315 |	Now just imagine that in the middle of all this chaos there is one person
EDL	01:01:17,695	01:01:19,231	| radiolab082315 |	Leaning over to their friend
EDL	01:01:19,231	01:01:20,767	| radiolab082315 |	And Whispering a secret
EDL	01:01:22,047	01:01:24,095	| radiolab082315 |	Dark matter is like
EDL	01:01:25,631	01:01:26,143	| radiolab082315 |	The whisper
EDL	01:01:28,191	01:01:30,239	| radiolab082315 |	It'll be lost in the noise we have
EDL	01:01:30,239	01:01:33,055	| radiolab082315 |	The cut out all this noise
EDL	01:01:34,335	01:01:37,151	| radiolab082315 |	In order to even come close to hearing
EDL	01:01:38,431	01:01:43,807	| radiolab082315 |	And
EDL	01:01:44,319	01:01:49,183	| radiolab082315 |	It turns out putting a Mite of rock between you and the lapis's is taking you
EDL	01:01:49,183	01:01:51,231	| radiolab082315 |	A lot of the way that
EDL	01:01:51,999	01:01:52,767	| radiolab082315 |	Yes the greats now
EDL	01:01:58,399	01:02:01,727	| radiolab082315 |	Listen to this mine through these massive iron doors
EDL	01:02:01,727	01:02:02,239	| radiolab082315 |	Down these
EDL	01:02:04,287	01:02:06,079	| radiolab082315 |	Long underground tunnels
EDL	01:02:08,383	01:02:11,455	| radiolab082315 |	Into a room where we met this guy and who are you
EDL	01:02:12,223	01:02:15,295	| radiolab082315 |	Mike Stone Age grew up in Lead South Dakota I'm the
EDL	01:02:15,295	01:02:17,343	| radiolab082315 |	4th generation that's been
EDL	01:02:17,343	01:02:19,135	| radiolab082315 |	Hanging around homestake mine
EDL	01:02:19,135	01:02:23,487	| radiolab082315 |	Mike works at the mine so does his dad both my grandfathers were homestake veterans
EDL	01:02:23,999	01:02:28,863	| radiolab082315 |	Let's get that Mike went to school with and his dad went to school with they work in the mines and my grandmother's
EDL	01:02:28,863	01:02:30,143	| radiolab082315 |	Father on my desk
EDL	01:02:30,655	01:02:31,167	| radiolab082315 |	It was awesome
EDL	01:02:32,703	01:02:33,471	| radiolab082315 |	But now
EDL	01:02:33,983	01:02:36,031	| radiolab082315 |	Now he works in room where he basically
EDL	01:02:36,031	01:02:39,359	| radiolab082315 |	Equip scientist with other safety gear and stuff
EDL	01:02:39,359	01:02:40,127	| radiolab082315 |	David's Tea
EDL	01:02:40,127	01:02:41,919	| radiolab082315 |	Boots and a respirator
EDL	01:02:41,919	01:02:43,967	| radiolab082315 |	KicksOnFire you want to be able to breathe
EDL	01:02:45,247	01:02:45,759	| radiolab082315 |	What you want to hear
EDL	01:02:47,295	01:02:51,135	| radiolab082315 |	And eventually
EDL	01:02:51,135	01:02:54,207	| radiolab082315 |	If I'm in this old steel service elevator
EDL	01:02:54,207	01:02:54,975	| radiolab082315 |	Little farther
EDL	01:02:55,999	01:02:58,047	| radiolab082315 |	Subcage the 41
EDL	01:02:59,583	01:03:01,119	| radiolab082315 |	Laura Southgate
EDL	01:03:01,631	01:03:07,775	| radiolab082315 |	And then we just start rocketing downward
EDL	01:03:14,431	01:03:16,735	| radiolab082315 |	Ascending
EDL	01:03:16,735	01:03:22,367	| radiolab082315 |	At a thousand feet are ears pop
EDL	01:03:22,879	01:03:29,279	| radiolab082315 |	Wet muddy smell sort of walked up and asked we're dropping
EDL	01:03:29,279	01:03:35,679	| radiolab082315 |	All that noise is getting slowly filtered out
EDL	01:03:35,679	01:03:36,447	| radiolab082315 |	We're able to
EDL	01:03:36,959	01:03:43,103	| radiolab082315 |	Literally use the rock to absorb these cosmic ray particles after.
EDL	01:03:47,455	01:03:48,479	| radiolab082315 |	Donut shops
EDL	01:03:50,783	01:03:52,063	| radiolab082315 |	Hello
EDL	01:03:54,111	01:03:55,135	| radiolab082315 |	Thank you
EDL	01:03:55,647	01:03:56,927	| radiolab082315 |	And we step out
EDL	01:03:57,951	01:03:59,743	| radiolab082315 |	4850
EDL	01:04:01,279	01:04:03,327	| radiolab082315 |	This is a caveman
EDL	01:04:03,327	01:04:04,351	| radiolab082315 |	It looks like
EDL	01:04:05,631	01:04:06,655	| radiolab082315 |	Kate it's got
EDL	01:04:07,935	01:04:12,031	| radiolab082315 |	A dome-like ceiling and walls that are just
EDL	01:04:12,031	01:04:13,823	| radiolab082315 |	Carved Rock what is that sound
EDL	01:04:16,127	01:04:18,687	| radiolab082315 |	That's the sound of rain coming through
EDL	01:04:19,199	01:04:20,479	| radiolab082315 |	A whole lot of Rock
EDL	01:04:22,783	01:04:24,319	| radiolab082315 |	Because it's not raining outside
EDL	01:04:24,319	01:04:25,087	| radiolab082315 |	It's not raining
EDL	01:04:25,087	01:04:26,367	| radiolab082315 |	In the world
EDL	01:04:26,367	01:04:27,391	| radiolab082315 |	It's just groundwater
EDL	01:04:29,439	01:04:31,743	| radiolab082315 |	It's costing over $1000000 a year
EDL	01:04:31,743	01:04:33,023	| radiolab082315 |	Just to run the pump
EDL	01:04:33,023	01:04:33,791	| radiolab082315 |	The drain
EDL	01:04:34,303	01:04:36,863	| radiolab082315 |	That why does that give you some $2000000
EDL	01:04:36,863	01:04:38,143	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah yeah
EDL	01:04:38,143	01:04:38,911	| radiolab082315 |	But Rick says
EDL	01:04:39,423	01:04:40,191	| radiolab082315 |	Down here
EDL	01:04:40,191	01:04:43,775	| radiolab082315 |	Like this is the least amount of radiation that we will ever experience in
EDL	01:04:44,543	01:04:47,103	| radiolab082315 |	It is quite dramatic it's about 3 million
EDL	01:04:47,103	01:04:47,615	| radiolab082315 |	Less
EDL	01:04:48,127	01:04:49,151	| radiolab082315 |	Cosmic rays
EDL	01:04:49,919	01:04:51,455	| radiolab082315 |	So when you hold your hand out
EDL	01:04:51,455	01:04:52,735	| radiolab082315 |	Let someone every few months
EDL	01:04:54,527	01:04:55,039	| radiolab082315 |	January
EDL	01:04:55,807	01:04:56,831	| radiolab082315 |	Coming for you and now
EDL	01:04:59,391	01:04:59,903	| radiolab082315 |	March
EDL	01:05:00,927	01:05:03,487	| radiolab082315 |	But that isn't that isn't the end of the story
EDL	01:05:03,487	01:05:09,887	| radiolab082315 |	Step inside here the very first step when she even have a nice day turns out that even if you cut out all the Rays coming from the outside
EDL	01:05:09,887	01:05:10,655	| radiolab082315 |	Side
EDL	01:05:10,655	01:05:11,935	| radiolab082315 |	Are there still Rays coming off of
EDL	01:05:11,935	01:05:15,775	| radiolab082315 |	You & I we carry a certain amount of uranium and thorium
EDL	01:05:16,543	01:05:18,079	| radiolab082315 |	Are these radioactive elements in
EDL	01:05:18,079	01:05:18,847	| radiolab082315 |	So
EDL	01:05:18,847	01:05:19,615	| radiolab082315 |	Okay
EDL	01:05:19,615	01:05:26,015	| radiolab082315 |	So what we're going to do is you're going to take your coverall saw Robin barland made us change clothes
EDL	01:05:26,015	01:05:26,783	| radiolab082315 |	Do you know
EDL	01:05:26,783	01:05:27,295	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah
EDL	01:05:28,319	01:05:29,343	| radiolab082315 |	Scumbag stuff
EDL	01:05:29,343	01:05:31,391	| radiolab082315 |	Oh the microphone
EDL	01:05:31,391	01:05:32,415	| radiolab082315 |	Okay
EDL	01:05:32,927	01:05:37,791	| radiolab082315 |	And then bring Texas into the Labyrinth experiment happens
EDL	01:05:37,791	01:05:39,327	| radiolab082315 |	If this all white room
EDL	01:05:39,327	01:05:40,863	| radiolab082315 |	What is huge tank metal
EDL	01:05:42,399	01:05:46,495	| radiolab082315 |	Tank contains 70000 gallons of high purity
EDL	01:05:48,031	01:05:54,431	| radiolab082315 |	Water and was directly inside at home we can without fear of disrupting experiment
EDL	01:05:54,431	01:05:56,479	| radiolab082315 |	Experiment actually happens inside this
EDL	01:05:56,479	01:05:59,039	| radiolab082315 |	Bang the outside of it
EDL	01:05:59,551	01:06:01,087	| radiolab082315 |	Steel container
EDL	01:06:01,087	01:06:04,671	| radiolab082315 |	The whole idea is that this water like she still trout even more radius
EDL	01:06:05,183	01:06:07,487	| radiolab082315 |	That makes it very quiet
EDL	01:06:07,999	01:06:09,023	| radiolab082315 |	Not quite
EDL	01:06:09,023	01:06:11,327	| radiolab082315 |	And so inside that tank of water
EDL	01:06:11,839	01:06:13,631	| radiolab082315 |	April even smaller tank
EDL	01:06:13,631	01:06:17,215	| radiolab082315 |	The element xenon about a third of a ton of liquid Xenon
EDL	01:06:17,215	01:06:22,335	| radiolab082315 |	Where do we find Xenon on the periodic table where it what is his seat on this number 54
EDL	01:06:22,847	01:06:25,919	| radiolab082315 |	It's over on the right hand side so that we have this
EDL	01:06:26,431	01:06:28,223	| radiolab082315 |	Imperial
EDL	01:06:28,223	01:06:28,991	| radiolab082315 |	Named
EDL	01:06:28,991	01:06:33,599	| radiolab082315 |	Set of elements week-old a noble element mean they're just too good for everybody else they interact
EDL	01:06:33,599	01:06:34,623	| radiolab082315 |	Hardly at all
EDL	01:06:34,623	01:06:39,231	| radiolab082315 |	That's right you really struggle to make Xenon interact with with any other atoms
EDL	01:06:39,743	01:06:44,095	| radiolab082315 |	Which is just another way of saying that inside of this tank of xenon which is inside of the tank
EDL	01:06:44,095	01:06:45,119	| radiolab082315 |	Water witch
EDL	01:06:45,119	01:06:48,703	| radiolab082315 |	Down in one of the biggest holes ever dug by man
EDL	01:06:49,215	01:06:51,007	| radiolab082315 |	It is really really really really
EDL	01:06:52,287	01:06:53,567	| radiolab082315 |	It's the monster
EDL	01:06:54,079	01:06:55,359	| radiolab082315 |	The quietest place in the universe
EDL	01:06:55,871	01:07:02,015	| radiolab082315 |	When you can't preview you don't know that it is because there could be somewhere some quieter place but as far as we know it
EDL	01:07:02,783	01:07:04,831	| radiolab082315 |	The center of Des Lux detector is the
EDL	01:07:05,599	01:07:06,879	| radiolab082315 |	The quietest place
EDL	01:07:06,879	01:07:08,927	| radiolab082315 |	We human beings now
EDL	01:07:09,439	01:07:12,511	| radiolab082315 |	And what's supposed to happen inside the super quiet Xenon
EDL	01:07:13,279	01:07:15,071	| radiolab082315 |	Space City idea
EDL	01:07:15,071	01:07:16,351	| radiolab082315 |	So you have here is that this
EDL	01:07:16,351	01:07:17,375	| radiolab082315 |	Cloud of xenon
EDL	01:07:17,887	01:07:18,655	| radiolab082315 |	It's just
EDL	01:07:18,655	01:07:19,167	| radiolab082315 |	Waiting
EDL	01:07:19,935	01:07:23,263	| radiolab082315 |	And the thought is that when a dark matter particle
EDL	01:07:23,263	01:07:27,359	| radiolab082315 |	That's like zooming around all the time when that zooms through this see.
EDL	01:07:27,359	01:07:28,639	| radiolab082315 |	Because it is so quiet in there
EDL	01:07:29,151	01:07:30,943	| radiolab082315 |	Because there is nothing else happening in there
EDL	01:07:31,455	01:07:35,295	| radiolab082315 |	That dark matter particle even though it's not supposed to interact with anything from our world
EDL	01:07:36,063	01:07:37,087	| radiolab082315 |	That particle
EDL	01:07:37,087	01:07:38,367	| radiolab082315 |	If it disturbs
EDL	01:07:38,879	01:07:42,463	| radiolab082315 |	Is it nudges in any way any of the atoms of the Xenon
EDL	01:07:42,975	01:07:43,743	| radiolab082315 |	Will notice it
EDL	01:07:43,743	01:07:45,791	| radiolab082315 |	Not tiny little disturbance
EDL	01:07:45,791	01:07:46,559	| radiolab082315 |	Whatever happened
EDL	01:07:47,071	01:07:47,839	| radiolab082315 |	Fences
EDL	01:07:47,839	01:07:49,375	| radiolab082315 |	You can think of that moment
EDL	01:07:50,911	01:07:52,191	| radiolab082315 |	Is the universe whispering
EDL	01:07:52,191	01:07:55,007	| radiolab082315 |	The Whisperer in human nature
EDL	01:07:55,007	01:07:57,567	| radiolab082315 |	The Whisper is a point where we really
EDL	01:07:58,079	01:08:00,127	| radiolab082315 |	We really want to speak
EDL	01:08:00,895	01:08:02,175	| radiolab082315 |	Intently
EDL	01:08:02,175	01:08:04,735	| radiolab082315 |	Do I single person we whisper
EDL	01:08:04,735	01:08:05,503	| radiolab082315 |	When when
EDL	01:08:05,503	01:08:06,527	| radiolab082315 |	And we whisper
EDL	01:08:06,527	01:08:08,575	| radiolab082315 |	Funerals we whisper in the presence of
EDL	01:08:09,599	01:08:11,391	| radiolab082315 |	Awesome things in nature we
EDL	01:08:11,903	01:08:12,671	| radiolab082315 |	We
EDL	01:08:12,671	01:08:19,071	| radiolab082315 |	Use of the voice that drops down
EDL	01:08:19,071	01:08:25,471	| radiolab082315 |	Town and drop starter only goes into the ear it's intended for it's it's Isaiah
EDL	01:08:25,471	01:08:31,615	| radiolab082315 |	Is call you know he's lying on his mad and he hears the whisper because he knows that for me alone
EDL	01:08:31,615	01:08:35,455	| radiolab082315 |	That calls for me alone and that's that's that sense
EDL	01:08:35,967	01:08:42,111	| radiolab082315 |	Get this experiment gives to me is it here the universe has been shouting and shouting
EDL	01:08:45,951	01:08:52,351	| radiolab082315 |	Scientific knowledge out of the shop out of the Clapping out of the cheers and now liver
EDL	01:08:52,351	01:08:55,423	| radiolab082315 |	At in the 21st century is
EDL	01:08:55,423	01:09:01,823	| radiolab082315 |	We're going down to what's it saying in the whisper and those Whispers Goku
EDL	01:09:01,823	01:09:08,223	| radiolab082315 |	Clear back to conception they go clear back to birth if we understand
EDL	01:09:08,223	01:09:08,991	| radiolab082315 |	These Whispers
EDL	01:09:10,015	01:09:12,575	| radiolab082315 |	Were very close to understanding
EDL	01:09:13,599	01:09:14,367	| radiolab082315 |	Gestation
EDL	01:09:15,135	01:09:15,903	| radiolab082315 |	And end
EDL	01:09:16,415	01:09:19,999	| radiolab082315 |	I got carried away there but we love Italy
EDL	01:09:19,999	01:09:21,279	| radiolab082315 |	Yeah
EDL	01:09:21,279	01:09:23,839	| radiolab082315 |	Okay and did you get to hear
EDL	01:09:23,839	01:09:24,607	| radiolab082315 |	The
EDL	01:09:24,607	01:09:27,167	| radiolab082315 |	Whisper see the disturbance whatever it is
EDL	01:09:27,167	01:09:28,447	| radiolab082315 |	Did you meet the dark matter
EDL	01:09:28,447	01:09:34,591	| radiolab082315 |	Well how can I give this to you lightly so this is confession time I've I've
EDL	01:09:34,591	01:09:35,359	| radiolab082315 |	Been looking for.
EDL	01:09:35,871	01:09:36,639	| radiolab082315 |	27
EDL	01:09:37,151	01:09:37,919	| radiolab082315 |	Yes
EDL	01:09:37,919	01:09:42,015	| radiolab082315 |	And so far we have yet to see a convincing
EDL	01:09:42,527	01:09:43,295	| radiolab082315 |	Satta
EDL	01:09:43,295	01:09:44,319	| radiolab082315 |	Interaction
EDL	01:09:44,319	01:09:45,855	| radiolab082315 |	Stop mattering
EDL	01:09:45,855	01:09:47,391	| radiolab082315 |	That's getting that nothing
EDL	01:09:47,391	01:09:50,719	| radiolab082315 |	It all nothing but Rick hasn't given up hope
EDL	01:09:50,719	01:09:56,607	| radiolab082315 |	I mean he's heard never gives up hope he says maybe we just need to build a bigger more sensitive to text
EDL	01:09:56,607	01:09:59,167	| radiolab082315 |	That's exactly what we're doing
EDL	01:09:59,167	01:10:00,447	| radiolab082315 |	Instead of their current one
EDL	01:10:00,447	01:10:01,215	| radiolab082315 |	Which has the third of it
EDL	01:10:01,727	01:10:04,543	| radiolab082315 |	We are now designing and building a detector
EDL	01:10:04,543	01:10:05,823	| radiolab082315 |	Cuz it's going to be 10 top
EDL	01:10:07,359	01:10:08,383	| radiolab082315 |	Says even there
EDL	01:10:09,151	01:10:14,015	| radiolab082315 |	Who knows the uncertainty we have to deal with his is is at least a factor of 10 million
EDL	01:10:18,367	01:10:19,391	| radiolab082315 |	10000
EDL	01:10:19,391	01:10:23,999	| radiolab082315 |	Antoine TV the other pretty disappointing thing is that when you're in this room
EDL	01:10:23,999	01:10:25,279	| radiolab082315 |	Like in the room with
EDL	01:10:25,279	01:10:26,303	| radiolab082315 |	The Lux detector
EDL	01:10:27,071	01:10:28,863	| radiolab082315 |	Supposed to be the quietest place in the universe
EDL	01:10:28,863	01:10:34,751	| radiolab082315 |	Loud it's crazy loud
EDL	01:10:34,751	01:10:37,311	| radiolab082315 |	There's sounds that I can only describe is
EDL	01:10:37,311	01:10:37,823	| radiolab082315 |	Robot
EDL	01:10:38,335	01:10:44,479	| radiolab082315 |	Dying
EDL	01:10:52,415	01:10:54,207	| radiolab082315 |	Was there any moment that was quiet
EDL	01:10:54,719	01:10:56,767	| radiolab082315 |	Like YT quiet like deep quiet
EDL	01:10:56,767	01:10:57,535	| radiolab082315 |	Philly quiet
EDL	01:10:59,327	01:10:59,839	| radiolab082315 |	Well
EDL	01:11:00,863	01:11:07,263	| radiolab082315 |	Sort of after we went Deluxe
EDL	01:11:07,263	01:11:13,663	| radiolab082315 |	I have some time to kill and they took us into the wrong part of the Mind where these to mine for gold and they just
EDL	01:11:13,663	01:11:20,063	| radiolab082315 |	Walked us through these old tunnels
EDL	01:11:20,063	01:11:26,463	| radiolab082315 |	And you're you're walking through the black and all you hear is like the sound
EDL	01:11:26,463	01:11:32,607	| radiolab082315 |	Catching the wind speed suck down
EDL	01:11:39,263	01:11:45,663	| radiolab082315 |	The silence it's it's not like it's not like the science of like
EDL	01:11:45,663	01:11:51,807	| radiolab082315 |	Show the street is really quiet outside of my bedroom it's got like an energy to its like
EDL	01:11:58,463	01:12:04,863	| radiolab082315 |	It's kind of like when you're running and when you stop running and
EDL	01:12:04,863	01:12:11,263	| radiolab082315 |	Absence of your exertion to refills you it's like that moment where the absence of the noise sort of becomes
EDL	01:12:11,263	01:12:17,663	| radiolab082315 |	Palpable and that's for me
EDL	01:12:17,663	01:12:24,063	| radiolab082315 |	The moment not standing in the laboratory for me that moment with moment right now I am standing at the center
EDL	01:12:24,063	01:12:30,207	| radiolab082315 |	A busy not I don't think I ever ever have felt that
