EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:41,024	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	In February of 2017
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:48,704	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Said something that surprised a lot of people would say Italy or not
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,264	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Experiencing the best of times
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,568	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She stepped
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:58,432	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Straight into the political Fray and addressed this political moment
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	A1 said
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,272	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Did the
EDL	00:03:03,296	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	True symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle it is the pendulum
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:15,840	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And when the pendulum swings too far in One Direction it will go back
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:22,240	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Some terrible things have happened in the United States but
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Lincoln only
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:29,664	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Hope that we learn from those bad thing
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Today we're going to ride the pendulum to the dark side
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Start with one of the most infamous decisions the court has ever made
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:44,000	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Korematsu decision you might imagine it's not going to be the happiest of situations but
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Story that we're going to tell you today and tomorrow as well actually
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They're not stories of bitterness
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:55,008	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Because this curious thing happens in both cases
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,872	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Characters can't find Justice inside the Supreme Court
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Stop looking for it there
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,272	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And if I did somewhere else entirely
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Producer Julia Longoria start this off
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The year is 1967 and the place
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:27,775	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is San Lorenzo High School in East Bay of California
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:29,311	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And we're in a
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:35,711	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	U.s. history classroom I was actually a junior in high school this is Karen korematsu
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:41,087	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'm the executive director and founder of the Fred T korematsu Institute in San Francisco
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So on this particular day
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:48,255	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Karen is sitting at the back of the classroom and our teacher had assigned each of
EDL	00:04:48,767	00:04:51,327	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	My classmates a little paperback
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:56,447	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Book to read you know books about American history government in the assignment was to
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:02,847	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Then I get up in front of the class and give an oral book report to me this is a long time ago so that's the way they used to do
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Do things
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:10,015	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I don't even remember what my my book was are my subject but Karen said she was just sitting there in class listen
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,319	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	As one by one classmate Scott up
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:17,951	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Talk about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln or whatever and then my friend
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Maya who is Japanese-American 3rd Generation like myself got up in front of the class
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:28,191	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And her book was called concentration camps USA
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,775	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	About the Japanese-American internment
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,335	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I thought
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,127	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	No that's
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:39,967	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Interesting I hadn't heard about that before what's that about
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:42,527	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	My book report went something like this
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	In 1941 the United States of America with attached
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And the president's President Roosevelt had to respond
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,655	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	All measures be taken broadband
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:00,447	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So in terms of Defense
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:05,823	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	One of the big questions for Roosevelt was what happens if the Japanese invade the continental US
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,919	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	America's founding
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They probably come in on the West Coast
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:16,575	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And you had more than a hundred thousand Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Like what they turn against the United States
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:20,927	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They didn't know
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:27,071	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And so her friend my explained to the class on February 19th 1942
EDL	00:06:27,071	00:06:29,887	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	President Roosevelt issued executive order 90066
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:34,495	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That gave the military the authority
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:40,895	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To forcibly remove anyone of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:46,015	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She goes on to explain these the horrific circumstances and
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	How you a hundred twenty thousand people of Japanese ancestry had been real forcibly
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,695	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Removed from their homes
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:55,743	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She explained they were put into these
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Detention camps really without any due process of law but then she went on to say but there was this one
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	One man
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,007	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Who refused to go to the camps and
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:09,567	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He was arrested and sue the government
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:15,455	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And took his case all the way to the Supreme Court and then he became a landmark Supreme Court case
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,735	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And that man's name
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:19,551	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is Fred korematsu
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I said to myself
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:23,903	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That's my name
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,255	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She says the class got really quiet
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I had 35 pairs of eyes turn around looking at me okay yes she thought my last
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:39,519	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Name is karma to my dad's name is Fred but no way
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:42,079	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There's no way it's my dad someone would have told me
EDL	00:07:42,591	00:07:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:45,919	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Corson I go running home and
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:48,223	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Confronting my mother and asking her
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What she say
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:56,159	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Well I got the standard to answer wait till your father gets home and you can ask him
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:08:01,023	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	My voice you heard by the way was Elie mystal our legal editor by the time he
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I got home it was 8 in the evening and so that's a long time after you know 3:30 in the afternoon
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:11,007	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I calm down a little bit and I asked him in and he said
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:14,079	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It happened a long time ago
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:16,639	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And what he did he thought was right
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And the government was wrong
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:22,783	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And it was at clear and simple
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,599	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I could just see
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,367	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This hurt
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,183	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Going over his face and I just couldn't ask him
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,207	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Any more questions
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:36,095	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Karen says it wasn't until years later that she learned what really happened
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,887	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And why her dad never wanted to talk
EDL	00:08:42,239	00:08:42,751	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Well
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:45,311	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I was 21 then

EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,783	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is it Go picnicking or something like that
EDL	00:09:27,551	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And then all sudden diarrhea
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:35,487	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We interrupt this program to bring you
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:39,839	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Pokemon are newer car radio
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,935	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Cloud right now
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Japanese Embassy
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,311	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I was quite shocked we both were
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:54,431	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred knew there was a war on and that the US was likely to get involved
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Even try to enlist in the US military but was denied because he was Japanese-American
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,623	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is sitting there one of his first thoughts was
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Why does it have to be Japan
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:08,767	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Some country was going to attack Pearl Harbor
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I wish it was Russia
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,327	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You know
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I just thought about that
EDL	00:10:13,887	00:10:16,447	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I was bitter with the pan-fried having this happen
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:20,031	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So I took her home
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And then I went home
EDL	00:10:23,871	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:26,943	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He gets home
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,735	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Central shock
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They're all sitting around the living room
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:38,463	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The house is just in the spare his mom is in tears they were proud of being Japanese
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You know they obey the law
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:42,815	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They did everything that supposed to mean
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To have this happen
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,399	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I put them in chain
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It was even hard to talk to them after that
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred had a traditional immigrant Japanese American family
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:11:02,527	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	His parents were born in Japan and then all his brothers were born here in the US born in Oakland California
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:08,159	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He was the third out of four brothers and being the 3rd not the 2nd or the 1st
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,695	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That matter
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Absolutely
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,791	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred wasn't unique position as the third
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Son he could resist
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We asked Lorraine Vani I teach at Seattle University School of Law for some contacts
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:26,847	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Kiawah professor and a friend of Fred's family the cultural tradition is that the first son is the favorite son
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:30,943	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The oldest was going to inherit the family garden and Nursery business
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,247	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	II would help out with that business
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:39,647	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Brad as a third son was very low on the totem pole is parents and have the same expectations
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,207	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Love him relatively speaking he was kind of the hook
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:49,119	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Unlike his older brothers he didn't speak much Japanese and he felt more American than anything else
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:53,727	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	When I was in school we started each day for the Pledge of Allegiance
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,263	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I studied American history
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:57,823	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Always been a good American citizen
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,895	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So when he came home that Sunday when Pearl Harbor was attacked
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,711	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is family's response to the whole thing was
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,247	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Unsettling
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,527	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I am
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I didn't know what to do
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,623	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And Fred says pretty soon after
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,671	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Things got very weird
EDL	00:12:12,671	00:12:16,511	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Within a few days I put spotlights on the whole Nursery at night
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And they had a guard standing right now
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:22,655	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Our home there around the fence there watching us
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:26,495	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Cuz I went out one night to have a cigarette and I was staying on the park tonight
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,263	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But a cigarette
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:31,871	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And God y'all. If I was singling somebody
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,663	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:12:35,199	00:12:37,247	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Then came Roosevelt executive order
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That big order 906 6
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:45,695	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Authorized the military to make a series of smaller ones
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:47,487	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The first set of orders was a curfew order
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:54,399	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Saying that Japanese Italians and Germans were subject to a curfew the second order was a freeze order
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,215	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Directed just at the Japanese on the West Coast
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,543	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They weren't allowed to leave the area and then the third order
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:02,335	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Wasn't order that they could not
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,127	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We met
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:05,407	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	On the West Coast
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:11,807	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Except for in the custody of an approved location by the army
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:16,415	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They're about 15 of these assembly centers
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:22,559	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Japanese-Americans were told to report to one of these centers by a certain date
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:29,727	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred's family began to scramble to worry about what they were going to take what was going to happen to the nursery
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:36,127	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And so expecting my mother you know the tension and worries
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:37,663	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	For his family left
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:40,223	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred made a decision
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:42,783	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Me being the third son you know
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,599	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I am I had my own worries
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I had mom girlfriend my own problems
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:50,975	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He decided not to go with his family
EDL	00:13:50,975	00:13:52,255	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Talk to them bedtime
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:55,327	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That I don't want to
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:57,375	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I won't be with you
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,935	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You didn't want to leave item behind
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:04,543	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I thought maybe the two of them could make a break for it later on leave the state
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,847	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Before the evacuation deadline
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,151	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,455	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They said fine if you can do it
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,247	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Go ahead
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,319	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She was the third son
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:18,367	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So he knew that
EDL	00:14:18,367	00:14:24,767	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	His older brothers would be able to take care of the family and they said he was a grown-up and he should make his own
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:25,535	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Sessions
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:28,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And so he did he went off and got his own apartment
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	His own job as a welder
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,935	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'm kind of lived under the radar
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:40,383	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Lewis Brothers would be there to take care of his parents if you're with a family like my family or any
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,151	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	A Japanese family
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:45,247	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You feel the pressure in the
EDL	00:14:45,247	00:14:46,015	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Sadness
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:52,159	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But on the outside is different just like a normal
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:54,207	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What if you know
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,999	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Just like we've been living all the time
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,583	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I felt right at home
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:03,935	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You know I'm an American citizen to you know
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:07,519	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I didn't feel guilty
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:11,359	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Cuz I don't think I did anything wrong
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:16,735	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Sense of humor politically aware at this point
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:19,551	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If you're asking me about whether he
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:22,879	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Refuse to go as an act of political resistance
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,159	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I don't think initially
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,975	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Unconsciously he probably
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:30,815	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	New that what was happening to Japanese-Americans was wrong
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:35,167	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But I don't think he had the words for that we might have today
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:43,359	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is on his way home from work one day that he reads in the newspaper about his parents
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:46,943	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And all the other Japanese-Americans in the area being taken away to camp
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:51,039	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Baby's sick to my stomach and on that
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:54,111	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I can see my parents going in Yunnan my brothers
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,135	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Going to camp
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:58,463	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I'm not there you know
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:04,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But that was the only time that I felt
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:11,007	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Kind of lonely you know like what what am I going to do now you know
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:16,127	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It begins to slowly down on him what he's done
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	By staying in the Bay Area he is officially breaking the law
EDL	00:16:20,991	00:16:25,599	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And he and I aren't sure what that means like will they be thrown in jail or worse
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:28,159	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He talks in the archives about how he's worried
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,463	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I was worried to
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,767	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Because now he could get arrested
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:39,679	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So they start to think about their options Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish sounding last name on it so we won't be recognized
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,447	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Nice to Japanese
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:43,007	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And then I decided
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:45,055	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Essentially that might not be enough
EDL	00:16:45,055	00:16:47,103	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Chapul. An article
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,639	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We're going to plastic surgery
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,199	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,735	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What do you think of this
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:56,063	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I looked it over
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:56,831	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And well
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:58,111	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I didn't
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:02,719	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Think I was a good idea but she said hey why don't you think about
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:07,071	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That's this might be a good thing that will allow you to stay here
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So the idea would be that he
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:16,543	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You don't have his eyes doubled or something like that a plastic surgery procedure where you put a fold in the eye
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,311	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Eyelid
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:21,919	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So you look more white less Japanese-American
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,479	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I guess I don't know
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,575	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Well
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,623	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She said she'll be looking to it
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,927	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:40,095	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Why is it that I'm going to lose so we decide to try it
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So Fred gets into his car and he drives into the city into San Francisco and he
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:49,055	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Just stops in front of the doctor's office
EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Amsart spacing
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:57,503	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Walking up the steps of this Victorian and then
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:02,367	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Walking down the steps to leave and he was a really crummy idea and then
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,647	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Walking back up the steps
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:08,511	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Thinking well yeah maybe I was right it's a good idea and the down the steps
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:15,423	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is a ridiculous idea giving some doctor your hard-earned money to
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,471	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Change your face
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:18,751	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So it goes up
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And down
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:20,543	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,591	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Down and up
EDL	00:18:23,103	00:18:24,639	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Down until
EDL	00:18:26,431	00:18:27,199	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He decided to just
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,479	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Going
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:30,783	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And have the procedure done
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,343	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He really did it as a way to
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,903	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Protect them as they try to leave the state
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,999	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The doctor said he was going to work on his eyes and then also fix
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:42,559	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Broken nose I had a broken nose
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,863	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'm playing football in the never had it fixed
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,655	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,703	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So you could do a pretty good work on me
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,287	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But it turned out he didn't do everything he said he would
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,567	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Regis
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,359	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Took my money that's what it was
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Actually
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,175	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There wasn't anything change except
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:00,991	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I didn't have a broken nose anymore
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:07,135	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So he drives back to the East Bay with a new nose but the same eyes
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:12,767	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And shortly after that day at the doctor's office he's out buying cigarettes at a convenience store
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Leclerc
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:17,631	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Recognized him
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,655	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Reported him
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:24,031	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And one day walking down the street he was stopped and arrested
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,103	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:32,223	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Spent his Memorial Day and 1942 in the San Leandro jail
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	When we got caught
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,343	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They called her into
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,511	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I see the police chief
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,047	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Talking to her
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Quite a while
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:55,519	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I imagine it's a small jail and he's just been admitted so he's sitting in the lobby and he sees I to come in to the front desk
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:20:01,663	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He's just out of earshot he can't make out exactly what they're saying but at a certain point
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,687	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	A stop talking
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She just walks out
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So
EDL	00:20:06,783	00:20:07,807	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That was the end of it
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:10,623	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I never did see her again
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:25,983	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Never saw each other
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So he sitting there alone in the San Leandro jail
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:41,599	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And they end up transferring him to Oakland jail for some reason and then he ends up at
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:42,879	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Federal
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:46,719	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Prison in San Francisco because resisting the order was a federal offense
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:47,999	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Anyway
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	One day I got to
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,375	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Call from the guard
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And tell me I had a visitor
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,519	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I didn't know it was you know
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:06,687	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I knew all my friends were in can't or they were in the military but Fred Goes Down to the visiting room anyway
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:07,967	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:21:07,967	00:21:11,551	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There's this man there New Yorker
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,135	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Well I believe in civil liberties
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:16,672	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Right of people
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,464	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is being denied
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:24,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is something that i'm concerned about the man says his name is ernest besig
EDL	00:21:24,864	00:21:25,888	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Very nice phone
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:27,168	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Easier to talk to me
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:31,264	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He asked if I needed some cigarettes or something like that too
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Just to break the ice
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:36,640	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	By the way I asked him
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,944	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Who do you represent
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,736	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And Earnest response well
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:48,160	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	ACLU or something like that
EDL	00:21:48,160	00:21:54,560	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We have no way of knowing what exactly was said between Fred and Ernest best
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,608	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Both men have passed away
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:22:01,728	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But it seems like something important must have happened in this conversation because
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:07,104	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If I was Lori Benitez I don't think he had the words for that we might have today
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,384	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred didn't have
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,712	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Language of resistance before this moment
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:16,064	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Something in that conversation must have given it to him
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,368	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Because when Earnest Pathak asked him
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,136	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Do you want
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:21,440	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Me to represent you in a court of law
EDL	00:22:21,952	00:22:22,976	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred says
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:23,488	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yes
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:27,840	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What do you mention the words worth it
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:30,656	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Might have turned him in that moment
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:33,472	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Imagine
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:34,752	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,288	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Message must have said to fraud
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:40,384	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We think that what's happened to Japanese Americans
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:42,176	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is unconstitutional
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:44,224	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We'd like to bring a lawsuit
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:46,016	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To say the Japanese Americans
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,808	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Are being sent away
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Only because of their race
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,136	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And in that
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,464	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Gay pride language
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:23:01,888	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	For what I think Fred knew was wrong
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:21,344	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Basic try to get Fred out of jail but the military stepped in and said he had
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,880	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Had to join his family and camp
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:26,720	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They were at a place called Tanforan race tracks
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:30,048	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It was a temporary holding spot
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:34,400	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So that meant that the first place that Fred went after jail was
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,216	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	A converted horse stall
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:43,616	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Alpha adorned in their gapping holes on the walls the wind just blew in there in the dust
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,896	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Blue in there and everything
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:48,224	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And this was a small horse dog because Fred had asked for his own
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:52,064	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Wanted to sit and think about what to say to his family
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We're also at Tanforan sat and looked at the single loan
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:01,536	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Bear light bulb above and the smell of manure and hay
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	How many spray for horses not for human beings
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,800	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And then all sudden I hear a knock on the door
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:15,872	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I'll open it with my brother
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:17,664	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is hey you can't stay here you
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,200	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You got coming
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:19,968	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Cedar Park
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:29,440	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Walk spread over to the Star Wars families been living
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:34,560	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I was surprised the way they fixed up their stalls
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,096	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:38,656	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Solar panel cracks
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:43,776	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And they put newspaper for the walls in the paper that all up
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This was a common thing for these families
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:52,224	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Thousands of them were transferred to more permanent camps and many stay there for up to 3 years
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:54,272	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Overtime
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The community
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:59,904	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Kind of tried to build lives for themselves
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:02,208	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You hear stories
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	MC pictures
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:06,816	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	People building small Japanese gardens
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:08,096	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Out of
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:10,400	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What they found in the area
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:15,008	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She saw newsreels about the people who made the Desert Bloom
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:21,152	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Eventually saw
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:24,992	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	People forming you know baseball teams
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:54,432	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	My brother has he was involved in various Japanese activities
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:56,736	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He thought it might be a good idea for me to
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:05,696	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Get some suggestions and opinions regarding to
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If I should fight the case or not
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,632	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So Fred's brother calls a meeting
EDL	00:26:14,144	00:26:16,448	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He got about 30 young people together
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Imagine it was f****** a mess hall or something like that
EDL	00:26:19,776	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And they discussed Frets case
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:22,848	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They were
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:25,664	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Discussion into themselves or in little groups
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:31,296	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I stood around and I waited for someone to speak
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:36,672	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But no one actually came out to speak to me
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:50,496	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I can see Fred
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:54,336	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Can I standing in the corner as people are gathered in small groups
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,640	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Whispering to each other
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:26:59,456	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Stealing glances at him
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But no one says a word to him

EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,776	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We're undecided on
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,800	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If I should buy
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:26,336	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Acacia not because
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,128	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They don't want to
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,200	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Make any more disturbance
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:34,528	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Anything to upset
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:39,136	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The parents right at the time because they were too upset already and think
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,416	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Just being in Camp
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:43,488	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They told him their parents have been through enough
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,768	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Leaving their lives behind
EDL	00:27:46,560	00:27:48,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Basically they said we can't help you
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:28:00,384	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But there was one Japanese American group that did decide to say something about Fred's case
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What's the name of the group
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,456	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Jacl
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:07,040	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Ernest bethak had a nickname for this group
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:10,368	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The Japanese-American Citizens League
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:11,904	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I meant
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:14,976	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	With a leadership of that group
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:16,256	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Several of them
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,280	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I purged them
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:19,328	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To oppose
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,352	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The explosion
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:24,448	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But they didn't seem to be particularly interested
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The JCL condemned Frets case
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:30,080	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And anyone else who fought against the government orders
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:34,176	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Said it would not support any of these individuals were fighting the orders
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:35,968	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And called them
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:36,992	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Self-styled martyrs
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Wow
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:39,552	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They use that phrase
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,064	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yes
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,112	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They would basically
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,392	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Get everyone else into trouble
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:46,976	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To do this by myself
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:49,024	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I just wonder if I was doing wrong or
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:52,096	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'll maybe putting them in Shame by
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,144	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'm bringing the issue up again
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,008	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Because of Japanese people lay their peaceful
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:02,336	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	People when they they like to leave things alone if they can
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:04,384	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Because
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They were in enough trouble as it is because of this Pearl Harbor attack
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:10,528	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And the country blame them
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:13,344	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So they have the sort of a guilty complex
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,648	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Even though
EDL	00:29:16,160	00:29:17,696	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They have nothing to do with it
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:25,376	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Majority I'm just avoided me so therefore I assume that
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:31,776	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:35,104	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I got myself in this problem
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,896	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:40,992	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That was my problem in the end not there
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:50,464	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Reddit continue to fight his case he argued that basically rounding up
EDL	00:29:50,464	00:29:56,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Thousands of Japanese-Americans American citizens without a trial without due process
EDL	00:29:56,864	00:30:00,960	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Basically amounted to racial discrimination
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:06,336	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is case made its way up and down the courts and eventually
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:09,920	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Two-and-a-half years after he met an asbestos in that jail cell
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,968	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The case arrives
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,504	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	At the Supreme Court
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yo he thought that by the time his case got to the
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:17,856	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That's Fred's daughter Karen again he would
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:24,000	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Be able to vindicate his family and everyone that had been incarcerated
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:26,816	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And that's how much he believed in the Supreme Court
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And so when that didn't happen he felt like
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:34,752	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If he felt like it was his fault
EDL	00:30:36,800	00:30:38,592	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It's a big burden to carry around
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,944	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What ends up happening is
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:45,248	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	On December 18th 1944
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:48,064	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The Supreme Court ruled against Fred
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:51,648	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It's kind of a complicated decision
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,672	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The Supreme Court
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:53,440	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Said
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:54,720	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Racial distinctions
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,536	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	When the government is making racial distinction
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,560	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It's serious
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We need to look at this very very carefully
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:03,168	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And that was a big president
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:04,448	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Sun a lot of ways
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:05,728	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It's
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:06,496	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Kind of
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:09,824	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Victory for people fighting racial discrimination
EDL	00:31:10,336	00:31:12,128	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But then the court turned around and said
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Even though racial distinctions are serious
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This one
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:18,528	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is not
EDL	00:31:19,040	00:31:20,064	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Strictly racial
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:26,464	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We are at war with the Japanese Empire Fair for rounding up Japanese-American Citizens
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:28,256	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is a way to
EDL	00:31:28,256	00:31:29,024	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Defend the nation
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	How's your friend at this point
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:38,240	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Like it sounds like it sounds like lonely and then I can almost imagine because you're
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:40,032	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You're by yourself
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Pretty-much on all fronts
EDL	00:31:42,592	00:31:47,712	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The country that you feel so part of that you want to actually enlist in the military to fight for
EDL	00:31:48,224	00:31:49,760	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Doesn't seem to want you at that moment
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,064	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Your own Community doesn't seem to want you
EDL	00:31:52,576	00:31:53,856	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Your family
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:55,136	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It's a Shame by you
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,184	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Your girlfriend
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:31:58,464	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is gone
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,304	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I can't imagine being more alone at this
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:03,072	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Point
EDL	00:32:03,072	00:32:04,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Any never shared that with my brother I
EDL	00:32:06,144	00:32:07,936	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He shared it with my mother but
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:11,008	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But we didn't that wasn't part of our pentateuch conversation
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:29,696	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You know
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:45,568	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What is
EDL	00:32:47,104	00:32:50,432	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is the crazy thing about the korematsu decision
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:50,944	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It is
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,736	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Still on the books
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:57,088	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That guy Carl Higbie got on Megyn Kelly and
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:33:02,464	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Said this stuff about korematsu and the very next day he got on and apologize for saying that
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:04,256	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But he's right
EDL	00:33:04,256	00:33:07,072	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Korematsu is technically still good law
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:08,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Justice Antonin Scalia
EDL	00:33:08,864	00:33:09,888	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	One said
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That sherp korematsu was wrongly decided
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:15,520	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But if you think that it's not going to happen again
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:17,056	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You're kidding yourself
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:18,592	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The courtesan
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:20,384	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Isn't it across the president
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:21,920	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	CNN International
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:27,040	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Would you like it to
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,832	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I think so
EDL	00:33:30,624	00:33:31,392	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Would you like it to
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:32,672	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	No
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:36,512	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That's not injured in school yet it's a judge named Richard Posner
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:40,096	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Not the time that we talked to him he was on the 7th Circuit Court
EDL	00:33:40,096	00:33:40,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Appeals
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:47,008	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He was widely considered by people on both the left and the right to be one of the most influential judges in the country
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,824	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He sometimes called the 10th Supreme Court Justice
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:52,640	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And he's a big Defender
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:53,920	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	At the korematsu decision
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:59,296	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What do you say then to Fred korematsu what do you say then to to a Japanese-American about
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,344	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Kind of the law and the court
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:03,648	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Well they were given compensation
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:08,768	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Right I mean Thursday Thursday
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,840	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There is no pain
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,632	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There there's an anguish right that we can
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,168	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Exactly commodify
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:17,984	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yeah but
EDL	00:34:19,008	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	At the time it all happened
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:23,360	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Shortly after Pearl Harbor
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:28,224	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It seemed like the right thing to do and probably was the right
EDL	00:34:29,760	00:34:32,064	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I imagine that the officials
EDL	00:34:33,600	00:34:35,904	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Federal government in
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:37,184	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	1941
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,720	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They probably
EDL	00:34:38,720	00:34:42,560	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Didn't know anything about Japanese-Americans on the West Coast
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Roosevelt ever compared to Japanese-American I doubt it
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,288	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The fact that he had never met anybody
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:56,640	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I might have been a reason for him to be more restrained in his executive orders right now
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	No because all he cares about is
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,248	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Defense of the United States
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,040	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If there's any
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:09,440	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Possibility of Japanese-Americans somehow cooperating with a Japanese invasion Force
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,976	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That he has to
EDL	00:35:10,976	00:35:13,024	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Move the Japanese
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What's this
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:16,864	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'm sure that's all he would have thought of
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:20,448	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I think it's all he did think of
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,008	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But what else could you have thought of
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,568	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That's the only thing
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,104	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He is going to focus on
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:29,664	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And if he doesn't he could be impeached
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:32,736	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Or he could also
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:37,344	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Worried about citizens right I think one of the look you're not you
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:41,952	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You're missing the priorities the priority is defense
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:46,048	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That's the priority that's what these people are thinking about
EDL	00:35:46,048	00:35:49,120	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You think they have time to be thinking about any
EDL	00:35:49,120	00:35:49,888	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Any
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:53,216	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Kind of nice ideas for protecting people
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:54,496	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Any more than
EDL	00:35:56,544	00:35:57,568	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Lincoln did
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:04,992	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What he's referring to there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham Lincoln basically tossed this alleged Confederate and
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,016	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Jail without due process
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:09,600	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And then Justified it by saying he had to save the Union
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:10,624	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Nikes
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:13,696	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney ruled against him
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:18,304	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Cheerleaders at all well Tony he's the Chief Justice and he said this
EDL	00:36:18,816	00:36:20,352	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Jerk should be released
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:23,936	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I guess I have to do that he's the Chief Justice
EDL	00:36:24,448	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	No you do that enough time
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:28,544	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	As the president you're out
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,592	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It seems to me that
EDL	00:36:30,592	00:36:31,872	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That's why we have court
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:36,736	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We have no, that is not why we have
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,528	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We do not have cords
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:41,344	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So that presidents can be checked
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:45,696	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	In situations of a national emergency
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,744	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That was my courts were set up
EDL	00:36:53,888	00:36:55,936	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Then what I mean
EDL	00:36:56,448	00:36:57,472	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'm flailing now but
EDL	00:36:57,984	00:37:00,032	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Then what stops then what
EDL	00:37:00,032	00:37:00,800	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If Court
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:06,176	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Congress can't stop a man that's the courts can't stop them like what can stop a president in a time of War
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:08,480	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There's nobody that nobody can check
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,528	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The president's responsibilities
EDL	00:37:18,464	00:37:20,000	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Obviously I'd like a do-over
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:22,560	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Because somehow In the Heat of the Moment
EDL	00:37:22,560	00:37:23,584	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I forgot
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:24,352	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:28,192	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I'm talking about defending the rights of actual American citizens
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:30,752	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And Posner is talking about
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:31,520	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	People who are Rebels
EDL	00:37:32,032	00:37:32,544	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To touch
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:36,384	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There is probably a way where I could have said
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,920	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Pointed that out to him
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:43,808	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Friends of the Court stepping in I mean it happens it happened to Truman
EDL	00:37:43,808	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But you know judge Posner is right
EDL	00:37:46,112	00:37:47,904	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But it doesn't happen a lot
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:52,256	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Which is why he gets to be judge Posner and I'm the guy that had to check Wikipedia
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:58,912	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And by the way do you think these Supreme Court Justices are great big brains
EDL	00:37:58,912	00:38:00,448	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Pink Stars
EDL	00:38:01,216	00:38:04,544	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Who are selected because of the best lawyers in the United States
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,848	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And their decisions are
EDL	00:38:07,360	00:38:09,920	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Are usually great you think all that
EDL	00:38:10,944	00:38:14,272	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I don't I don't have a high respect for the Supreme Court at all
EDL	00:38:21,440	00:38:24,256	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You look at them how they are appointed who appoints
EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:31,168	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is so why do you think the Supreme Court has such a great balance
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:32,192	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To the
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:33,728	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Present in a war
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:41,664	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is what gets me up at
EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:43,200	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Gets me going because
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I still think it can be used as a precedent
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:49,344	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So your ears you're still worried that it can be used
EDL	00:38:49,856	00:38:50,880	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And that it
EDL	00:38:50,880	00:38:57,024	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Do you think it will be like you don't like you know I think we cannot take this for granted
EDL	00:39:03,680	00:39:09,824	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Wow that's just quieter I mean
EDL	00:39:10,592	00:39:15,968	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That judge is as revered and as thought highly of as
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:17,504	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	As you guys said
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:21,600	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yeah you just actually think we don't mention I vote on her he will he just retired
EDL	00:39:21,600	00:39:27,488	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yeah he just like I think within a within the last month but you know I mean I'm listening to that and I'm thinking wow
EDL	00:39:29,792	00:39:36,192	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Not only is there a distinction to be made between people who are American citizens and people who are traitors but there's also this
EDL	00:39:36,192	00:39:37,984	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Hugeback
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:40,032	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	If you are German Americans
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:43,616	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	By the tens of thousands in this country at that time
EDL	00:39:43,616	00:39:46,176	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	We were at war with Germany to end Germans
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:50,784	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Held big rally in Madison Square Garden with swastikas and
EDL	00:39:50,784	00:39:54,368	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Supported Hitler out loud and marched for him for a while wish they had it
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,904	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Every right to do
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:56,672	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But
EDL	00:39:57,184	00:39:57,696	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They were not
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:02,816	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Getting quite the same degree of Suspicion is the Japanese and that's a question
EDL	00:40:02,816	00:40:03,584	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I think for
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:06,912	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	For the court
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:12,032	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So there is an argument for justice wasn't but there's an argument against him for sure
EDL	00:40:12,800	00:40:13,312	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yeah
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,104	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Wow that's really
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,384	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So now
EDL	00:40:17,152	00:40:19,456	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Fred has to solve his problem elsewhere
EDL	00:40:19,456	00:40:24,320	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Rights when the next part of the story the question really is like since Fred can't get Justice in the court
EDL	00:40:24,832	00:40:26,112	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Can you find it on the outside
EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:28,928	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And he does in this
EDL	00:40:28,928	00:40:30,208	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Place that you wouldn't expect
EDL	00:40:30,208	00:40:33,024	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Come back we'll find out where that place is yeah

EDL	00:41:27,552	00:41:33,184	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Maybe it was the moment that a kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:41:33,696	00:41:40,096	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lessons and you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:46,496	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework we're interested in the

EDL	00:42:31,039	00:42:34,623	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Maybe he wanted them so now he is I don't know what he's going to do
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:40,255	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Will now end up getting a kind of Remedy you said it was something you did that it's not

EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:48,191	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I got to say just personally
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:50,239	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The whole reason to tell the story is where it ends
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:54,847	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So
EDL	00:42:54,847	00:42:57,407	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So pretty sure Julie Longoria is going to
EDL	00:42:57,407	00:42:58,943	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Pick back up the story with
EDL	00:42:59,455	00:43:01,759	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What happened to Fred after the decision
EDL	00:43:01,759	00:43:02,783	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So the
EDL	00:43:02,783	00:43:05,087	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Internment camp where Fred was staying
EDL	00:43:05,087	00:43:06,879	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Clothes in 1945
EDL	00:43:07,391	00:43:10,975	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And Fred have gotten permission by that point to work
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:12,511	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	At a steel mill in Detroit
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:14,303	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So he was living in Detroit
EDL	00:43:14,303	00:43:16,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He fell in love with a woman named Katherine
EDL	00:43:16,351	00:43:20,447	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	They got married moved back to the Bay Area and had two kids
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:27,103	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And Karen his daughter says that they were kind of ostracized from the Japanese American Community they grew up
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:31,199	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Outside of the Japanese Community he was involved in Boy Scouts
EDL	00:43:31,199	00:43:36,831	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Girl Scouts so I was a girl scout so we all the camps when we had to open the camp he would work on that

EDL	00:43:43,999	00:43:45,023	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And Karen says throughout

EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:48,095	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The fifties the 60s
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:51,167	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She never heard him talk about his case

EDL	00:44:24,447	00:44:25,215	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	She just
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:26,495	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It was just too painful
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:30,847	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But this time there was a professor on the line from the University of California Berkeley
EDL	00:44:30,847	00:44:32,639	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It was a Japanese guy actually
EDL	00:44:32,639	00:44:33,663	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And I told Fred
EDL	00:44:34,175	00:44:36,735	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I really really want you to come into my class
EDL	00:44:36,735	00:44:39,039	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There was a ethnic studies
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:41,343	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Class that was actually off campus
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:43,391	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Ethnic studies was not even recognize that
EDL	00:44:43,903	00:44:45,439	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So he he talked
EDL	00:44:45,439	00:44:48,767	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yeah that this ethnic studies class and these kids were brutal
EDL	00:44:49,535	00:44:52,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Me UC Berkeley at that time had the snow
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:53,631	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Notorious
EDL	00:44:53,631	00:44:58,495	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Reputation of being very radical for asking questions during the whole hour
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:45:04,895	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is Jean Quan former mayor of Oakland she was in the class that day and it was important
EDL	00:45:04,895	00:45:11,295	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Different country like you have to learn up stand up to Authority and certainly these students were like DLC astounding say
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:12,831	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Well why didn't you
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:18,975	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Why didn't you protest why didn't you do this why didn't you do that why didn't you fight harder and we're almost
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:22,815	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You're angry that we he wasn't angry I think
EDL	00:45:22,815	00:45:27,167	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	You got to remember that a lot of these students even know anything about the
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:27,935	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Accounts
EDL	00:45:27,935	00:45:32,543	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Many many kids had not had Frank discussions with their own Tara and so
EDL	00:45:32,543	00:45:35,103	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Was korematsu it was probably a surrogate for like
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:36,383	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Your parents
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:40,735	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	How could they have gone to that and never told me they had no right not to
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:41,503	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To tell me
EDL	00:45:41,503	00:45:43,039	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And so they're really angry at their parents
EDL	00:45:43,551	00:45:44,575	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Surrogate or not
EDL	00:45:45,343	00:45:51,743	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Red felt like he was being indicted all over again it it was such a painful experience for my father he never one
EDL	00:45:51,743	00:45:52,767	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Want to speak to anyone again
EDL	00:46:03,263	00:46:06,591	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Redwood ultimately challenge his conviction in a lower court
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:07,871	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And you would win
EDL	00:46:08,639	00:46:11,199	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The Supreme Court decision still stands
EDL	00:46:11,711	00:46:14,015	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	But he was able to clear his own personal name
EDL	00:46:18,111	00:46:19,647	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Around 1990
EDL	00:46:20,415	00:46:22,463	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Again the world in a very different place
EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:25,535	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He finds himself again on a college campus
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:28,351	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This time the University of
EDL	00:46:28,351	00:46:29,119	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Michigan
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:32,447	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	My father and mother were walking with some other students
EDL	00:46:33,215	00:46:34,751	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Across campus
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:38,847	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To see the newly renovated library and
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:42,175	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Beyond my father loved architecture was very old Gothic
EDL	00:46:42,175	00:46:47,295	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Library so they're walking through this sort of open quad looking at the architecture
EDL	00:46:48,063	00:46:50,367	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	And then they come upon this group of students
EDL	00:46:50,367	00:46:51,647	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	A group of
EDL	00:46:51,647	00:46:52,415	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Arab
EDL	00:46:52,415	00:46:53,695	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	American students
EDL	00:46:54,207	00:46:56,767	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	The student start walking toward him they
EDL	00:46:56,767	00:46:59,583	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	All of a sudden kind of surrounding my father and they had this
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:01,119	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Certificate
EDL	00:47:01,119	00:47:02,911	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To give to my father
EDL	00:47:03,423	00:47:04,959	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	To thank him for speaking up
EDL	00:47:10,335	00:47:11,615	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	So that was meaningful to him
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:17,247	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Why why did that make you emotional
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:18,015	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Why that story
EDL	00:47:24,927	00:47:27,231	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Because it meant so much to my father
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:33,375	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That this group really honored him
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:34,143	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,935	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Also had been racially profiled
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:40,031	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Y'all to think that he would be able to
EDL	00:47:40,543	00:47:46,943	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Touch their lives it it kind of reinforced what he
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:53,343	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	He was doing
EDL	00:47:53,343	00:47:56,927	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Do you have the same faith in the Constitution that your dad did that.
EDL	00:47:56,927	00:47:58,975	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Have great faith
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:47:59,999	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	In our constitution
EDL	00:48:01,023	00:48:03,071	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It is a great document
EDL	00:48:03,071	00:48:04,095	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:08,447	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	It so happened so that it's the way that certain people in
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:08,959	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Interpreted
EDL	00:48:09,983	00:48:11,263	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	That gets us into trouble
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:12,799	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Yes
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:14,335	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Definitely
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:08,607	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	3.0 coming here tonight the Trump Administration on billing
EDL	00:49:08,607	00:49:15,007	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	New travel restrictions on certain foreign Nationals from eight countries
EDL	00:49:15,007	00:49:21,151	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Is everything with a feeling we're thinking they going to start a new line in United States
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:34,207	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	This is what we want we want

EDL	00:49:40,607	00:49:47,007	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	There are many many lawyers here they're all working pro bono today they're from different organization
EDL	00:49:47,007	00:49:53,407	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	What resistance looks like sends a message that they cannot do
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:59,807	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	Away with constitutional protections without people standing up for the Constitution so
EDL	00:49:59,807	00:50:05,951	| radiolab_podcast17americanpendulummp |	I think this is inspirational I think it's wonderful and I think we need to be vigilant and keep fighting
