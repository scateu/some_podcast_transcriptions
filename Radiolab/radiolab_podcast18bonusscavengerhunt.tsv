EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Assume that
EDL	00:02:57,408	00:02:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	And it's like okay I'm going to do some
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:06,112	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Bizarre aerial acrobatic move and that's going to land me on this weird random tree branch

EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:28,128	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Is Google Alerts so you may or may not be familiar with Google Earth
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:33,504	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Use that one for yourself cuz that's what most people do but the most fun way to use Google art I find
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:35,808	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Is that a
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,088	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	So what I do sometimes I just
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:37,856	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Come up with
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,392	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Phrases that I think are
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:42,976	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Fun or funny and I just set Google alerts on them
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,256	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Like what you have
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:46,816	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	So one of the ones that has been
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:49,120	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Very interesting for me is I use the phrase
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,912	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	The human equivalent of
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:57,824	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	So I just set a Google alert for the phrase the human aquilo I know anytime anyone on the internet uses app
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,360	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Phrase the human equivalent of
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,896	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Like I find out about it
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Here's another one of you
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:04,992	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Bizarre but brilliant

EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:16,512	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Or like another one I have
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	A self-fulfilling prophecy
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:19,839	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	I love that phrase
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,607	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	The light
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:25,215	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	When whenever anyone on the Internet is talking about self fulfilling prophecies I got to know about it
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:29,055	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Not to say that it's important that I read any of that stuff inside most of the time I just
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:31,359	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Delete it I just like we glanced at it and delete it
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	But every
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	I think of them as like little scratch off ticket
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Gets or something or like story lottery tickets like one day they're going to

EDL	00:04:56,447	00:05:02,591	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	So it's just Wikipedia surfing like this is my go-to way of procrastinating
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Love
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:08,223	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Wikipedia and in particular the thing I liked about Wikipedia more than anything else
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Cuz if you go on to the homepage so go into the Wikipedia.org Do you have a
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18bonusscavengerhunt |	Okay so you go to wikipedia.org and then you go to English although if you want to go to another language
