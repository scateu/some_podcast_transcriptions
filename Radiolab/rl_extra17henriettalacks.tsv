EDL	00:00:00,256	00:00:01,280	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Kate this is Chad
EDL	00:00:02,048	00:00:04,096	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just wanted to throw it in extra episode indoor
EDL	00:00:04,096	00:00:05,632	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Murphy dandanah from movie that we're really
EDL	00:00:06,144	00:00:06,656	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It about
EDL	00:00:07,168	00:00:07,936	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But first
EDL	00:00:09,216	00:00:11,008	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Couple weeks ago I
EDL	00:00:11,008	00:00:17,408	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I stepped in here and I laid out a challenge grant that we've gotten from the how Foundation
EDL	00:00:17,408	00:00:18,432	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The deal was if you remember
EDL	00:00:19,200	00:00:25,600	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That is 700 of you guys listening step forward agreed to kick in $7 a month to support them
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:29,696	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Making Radiolab then the towel Foundation would give us 70 Grant
EDL	00:00:29,696	00:00:31,232	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Help make the show
EDL	00:00:31,232	00:00:32,256	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So again
EDL	00:00:32,256	00:00:33,792	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	700 people
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:40,192	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Decide to donate $7 a month we get 70 grand that was the deal all right so how do we do it
EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:46,592	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	How did you do you crushed it just
EDL	00:00:46,592	00:00:48,896	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Rushed it okay we needed 700 people
EDL	00:00:48,896	00:00:55,296	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	As of right now I think we're at somewhere over 3,000 you did so well we did so well
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:01:01,696	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The Thao Foundation just came back to us an up the ante full-on stretch goal because here's the thing
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:08,096	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	3000 people is amazing but that is just percentage of the people who actually listen to the spot
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:14,496	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So they're thinking is let's capitalize on this momentum get the other 99.9% involved
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:20,896	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So their new stretch goal is it they have agreed to match any donation that comes to Radiolab
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:26,016	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Right now up to 10 grand so if you decide to make the seven bucks a month
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:32,416	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Deal that becomes $14 a month if you decide to do a one-time donation 60 bucks
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:36,000	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That's not 120 tile will match it and this
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:42,400	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Reminder this is how we're able to do you know the year-long investigation in the police shooting or the
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:45,984	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Nuclear chain of command the name last three that we've done this is how we pay for it
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:49,312	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And this challenge Grant will allow us to go farther
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:54,944	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So if you're down go to radiolab.org match
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:56,224	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Or you can text
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:57,760	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The word match
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:00,320	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To the number 69866
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:03,648	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Getting texts the word match the number 69866
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:08,768	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Little formal pop up and you can donate in a matter of seconds and thank you
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,192	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Alright so tonight
EDL	00:02:16,192	00:02:16,704	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:19,520	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The premiere of a movie we're really excited about
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,824	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's called The Immortal Life
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:22,848	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Of Henrietta Lacks
EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:24,128	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Stars
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:29,504	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	A&M homecoming actress maybe you've heard her Oprah Winfrey
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:34,624	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And it is based on the book of a very very dear friend Rebecca
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,904	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Skloot best-selling book
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,696	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You will watch this
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:42,560	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The movie in a couple days on HBO but in the meantime we're just so proud of Rebecca
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:46,656	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Thrilled that this movie is getting out to a wider audience
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,168	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Everyone should know
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:49,216	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So none of that
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:54,592	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	We're going to play for you a document to reproduce with Rebecca we worked on it for a few years with her while
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,384	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She was sort of formulating the book
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:58,944	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Includes tape you won't hear anywhere else
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:00,480	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Will you move me closer
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:02,784	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And the story
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,576	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is about a tumor that expands
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,112	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I never stops
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,672	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Begin to 1950 a black woman in Baltimore
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,208	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is in her bathroom
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:13,536	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And she discovers pretty much all on her own
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Did she has cancer
EDL	00:03:16,096	00:03:22,240	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's all it's all a bit of a mystery how she initially knew this but she knew it was there
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,592	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Not she called it she
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:30,432	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Had told her cousins for a while that she thought there was something
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,712	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Wrong with her
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	With her womb
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:34,272	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And she climbed in her bathtub
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:35,808	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And she
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:37,344	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Put her fingers up inside of herself
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:40,928	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And found this lump chapter 1
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,256	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Interlocal doctor
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:49,888	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I happen to be an attending at that time the guys she eventually ended up seeing
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,424	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Johns Hopkins University
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:56,032	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Was this fellow doctor Howard Jones
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:04:00,384	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Wow what you came in to see you can you tell me anything about what you would like
EDL	00:04:00,384	00:04:03,200	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Well she was a
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,808	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You don't remember anything I really don't
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:14,208	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But you remember her tumor right anything like it before or after
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:20,607	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It doesn't look like a normal tumor it was it was deep purple and a quarter
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:27,007	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Slightly raised
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:33,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I think it was red Jello there is something very strange about the way I look
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:36,735	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So doctors took a sample
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:43,135	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	These little teeny tiny pieces
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:46,975	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Lab for diagnosis and in this case since it was Hawkins they would take an extra piece
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:48,255	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And give it to
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:50,303	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Man named George guy
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:51,839	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	2
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:54,399	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So George guy was a researcher who works at the Hop
EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:59,775	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You got a deal with the clinic at anytime they got a patient with cervical cancer they give him a tiny piece
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:01,055	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	If the tumor
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,103	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What he really wanted to do his main mission
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She noticed his scientists everywhere we
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,223	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They wanted to find a way
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,015	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To grow human cells
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Outside of human
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:13,599	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In a dish
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,879	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	George guy had been trying to do this
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Working on this project
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:17,439	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And why exactly
EDL	00:05:19,231	00:05:23,327	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's sort of like it's her like having a little tiny bit of a person in it in a lab that
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:26,911	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Detached from them so that you can do whatever you want with them
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know you can't
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,239	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Bombard some person with a bunch of drugs into
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:33,311	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Wait to see how much they can tolerate before their cells all explode
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,103	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But you can do that in cell culture
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:36,639	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You're so this is like
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:41,247	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This is like the basic thing you need to study human biology you need cells in a dish yes
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:43,551	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Rimowa
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:46,367	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Anytime they tried to grow human cells in a dish
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,999	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I would die
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,767	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Yeah
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:53,535	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They died
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:55,583	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This is George guy's former lab assist
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:56,863	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Can you just tell me your name mean
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:59,423	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	My name is Mary
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:00,959	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I'll put my maiden name in there
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:02,751	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Troy kubicek
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:08,127	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Mary lives just outside of Baltimore about an hour from where she used to work with George guy such as
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:11,711	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Show me some pictures and he's sitting at
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,503	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Atom microscope
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:14,271	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So I can have you back
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,807	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	He said he seems like a really big guy like
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,135	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	At least six five judging the picture
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:23,487	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And then every slide that you showed me he had kind of a crazy smile on his face
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:27,327	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	A man is what I always
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:32,703	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Mary says they were completely stumped at why the human cells always die
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:33,983	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But they just did
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:41,663	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	On the day that George guy walked in and married to with a little chunk of a nameless woman cervical cancer inside
EDL	00:06:43,199	00:06:46,527	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	No one expected anything while he was doing that well he probably
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:48,063	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Everhope
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:48,575	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:54,463	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I was eating lunch now that you know it's not going to grow I'm going to finish this sandwich
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:56,511	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That's what I did
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:06:59,327	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	No I went in and
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,911	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Cheapest house in food
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,447	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Turn on all the machines and left
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:05,727	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Came back the next day
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:07,263	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Bandai
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,567	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So she came back the next day
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:11,615	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They were growing
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,663	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And the next day
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:17,503	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Still growing they just kept plugging along
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:18,783	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In the net group
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:19,551	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	A lot
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:22,623	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Becca says they doubled in size every 24 hours
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:25,439	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They just grew all of a sudden you know I care
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,975	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Transferring them
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:27,743	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Making more
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:29,279	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	YouTube transferring them
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,303	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Making mortar tubes
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:36,959	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They were very reliable and stronger they just kept plugging along
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:39,775	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Dark Knight
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Officially she died of
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:42,335	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Uremia witches
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:46,687	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Like toxicity of the blood because she wasn't able to get rid of the toxic waste that
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,967	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Usually goes out in your urine
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:50,015	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Not herself
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,319	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And tell us this story
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:57,951	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is a privilege to introduce dr. George guy with long after that George guy appeared on TV
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:08:01,791	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Holding in his hand a little bottle
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,583	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Like an alarm which we have grown
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:05,887	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Quantity of cancer
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:12,031	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Did you want to look at the photos and uplifting
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,079	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Until you go to the Hopkins archives and look up
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,359	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	George guys pictures and videos
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Okay this is
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:22,783	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Phone can hear your cell phone then it hits you
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:29,183	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Omigod swirling hurricanes of cells just like thousands of little pot
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:33,535	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Some small and some very large
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:39,679	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Make a note to leave them under the microscope
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,335	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's indescribable
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,711	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Why hers
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just sort of took off and grew and the other ones
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:58,623	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The day of tried before didn't is just a little bit of a mystery nobody really knows
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:01,439	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	For unless George gynuity had
EDL	00:09:01,951	00:09:02,719	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Disney cell line
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:04,767	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What's what they'd all been waiting for
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:07,071	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So early on
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:10,143	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Right after this one died George guy sent Mary
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:10,911	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Back down
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:14,751	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Get more cancer cells from the court to the morgue yeah
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,543	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Really
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,823	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So I went down there
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:19,359	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And they are
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,383	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Corner I don't know
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Dr. Garg
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:24,223	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Pair to anywhere standing

EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,063	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Meanwhile she's
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:30,367	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's like she was flying out there she's already open
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,671	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I got some samples
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:33,951	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Cornell Tech
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:36,511	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What you look like
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,303	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I could look at her face
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,351	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I couldn't look at her
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,447	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The only thing I looked at where her toes and they had chips
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,471	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Nail polish
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What was it about the nail
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,199	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Oh cuz it was chipped
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:59,039	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Cuz you know that she hadn't been able to take care of her nails grow long
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,063	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Time if they got
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:00,575	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Like that
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,903	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And it's show that she was proud of her so
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Not everyone wears
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,207	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Nail polish
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:07,231	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Post
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,559	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Over the next several months
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:13,631	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Well this woman's body lady composing the ground
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:15,935	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	George guy in Mary produce
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,471	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Hundreds of thousands of
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:17,983	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Versailles
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:20,287	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Are tumor cells and he named them
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,567	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The Hela strain
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,591	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Hela
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:27,455	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Like hela hela no one would actually know why you named them that for about
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:29,503	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Two decades but what he did with these cells
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,319	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know we would be unusual nowadays
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:37,695	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's like if somebody now found a cell that was special they run off to the patent office and then sell it to Merck
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,463	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Fredonia books
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:42,815	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Hey just passing out freely in trying to make any money off
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:45,119	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Nice nice
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:45,887	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	New things
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,167	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Could help science
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,751	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Mary says it George guy begin to send hila all over the world
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:53,311	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Pretty soon she was in hundreds of labs
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:59,711	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And this was in the midst of the polio epidemic
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:05,343	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	1951-52 you know schools are being closed kids are being kept inside
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:12,255	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Enormous effort to develop polio vaccine
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,583	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Problem was in order to develop a vaccine you had to have enough
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,607	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Poliovirus
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:18,911	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Univ quantity to be able to study in the lab
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:21,215	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And I had no way of making enough
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:22,751	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So what are you doing well
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,031	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	One of the guys
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Guy
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,335	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	One of the guys the guy had sent
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:29,919	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	DSL still your friend of guys discovered something
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:30,687	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Kind of amazing
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:32,223	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Which is it polio
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:38,623	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Loved the hela cell put polio inside a hela cell healing would copy and in the process make more polio
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:41,183	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Xerox El no matter what you want to do
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,719	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Make a copy make a copy make it pop
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:45,791	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Yeah so now that a way of making polio you that could just be a
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:46,559	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Polio Factory
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:48,351	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And so
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:51,167	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The government me to factory look at Tuskegee inst
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:53,215	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Ketut literally a factory said they had
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:12:01,151	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	He's big you know stainless steel if active culture medium that works for rotated constantly
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,991	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Autoclave screw sterilizing other equipment Arroyo with snails
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,271	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Buy microscope
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:08,831	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Crazy frankensteiners to give mode they had
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:15,231	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Machine like an automatic pill dispenser and it had the surgery on arm
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:15,999	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's worth
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,023	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	A certain amount of
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,559	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This culture medium filled with
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:22,399	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Fuel cells into a tube of Industry
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:29,311	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Yeah it is absolutely the cells that were produced satisfactory she says were used to test the polio vaccine
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:31,615	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The test
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,175	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In North is the largest field trial ever done
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:36,991	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	At its peak
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The Tuskegee
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:40,063	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Hila production Center
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,879	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Was producing. 6 trillion cells week
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:43,903	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Maui
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,207	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Kind of inconceivable
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:50,815	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That was actually only the beginning such a backup because this Factory led to an even bigger one
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:52,351	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It was for profit rate
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,143	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That second Factory was the first
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,911	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Time
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:57,471	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Any human biological material was commercial
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,519	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To this was the first biotech
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,335	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Basically when they first started mass-producing
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:04,895	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What sort of things were done to the
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,687	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Problems
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,199	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Investigate
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:09,247	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Click anything you can imagine
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,367	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Do they infected Hela cells with every kind of virus
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,391	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Titus
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:21,791	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Equine Encephalitis virus yellow fever herpes measles mumps rabies whatever like you just any
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,071	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And this was just
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:28,959	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This is a revolution for scientific research on chemotherapy drugs Hela cells went up into the first
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,727	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Space mission
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Really
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:37,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Yes if they were Hela when to spay Louis and to say such a every time I hear that you're like
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:41,247	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Why I mean
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,783	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Because the premise was
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,319	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To see what happens to human cells
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:48,671	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In zero gravity to know if we're going to be sending people up into space what's going to happen to them up there
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:50,719	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Inhumans dead
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Sheetz
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:54,047	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The Fells
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,751	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What's actually skip forward in the story to the point where that
EDL	00:14:03,263	00:14:04,287	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The Flipper
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,591	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	We just heard that pronoun confusion
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,103	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Gets
EDL	00:14:08,895	00:14:09,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Personal
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,199	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Know what would happen
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,991	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Okay the late 60s
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:19,391	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Revolution in science and now there are hundreds of cell lines not just he livid
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,159	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Hundreds
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,183	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Somewhere along the way
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:22,463	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Scientist discovered that
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:27,583	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Sheila is so aggressive that she's actually been contaminating and taking over
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,119	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	All these other cell lines
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,399	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What you just said she
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:31,167	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But I get your point
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:33,983	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And she doesn't know
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:34,495	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,287	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Does it in The Stranger
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:39,103	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just way he was elves can you know they can float on desk
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:42,175	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	We can ride I can what
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:45,503	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They can float on Dust particles
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,087	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Yes so they can they can hop out of addition to
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,111	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Get on a particle and
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:53,183	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Out the door
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:15:00,351	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Stairs down the hall and he'll self to allow drops into into dish cell culture where there's other cells growing
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:03,167	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And because he will sell their sort of powerful
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:03,679	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Salisbury
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:05,471	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Take over
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:12,895	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So on the heels of this catastrophe someone at Hopkins decides
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:14,687	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To make a test
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Let's make a test
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:21,087	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It will allow us to genetically determine if a cell is Gila or if it is
EDL	00:15:21,087	00:15:22,111	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	How to make a long story short
EDL	00:15:22,879	00:15:24,415	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This desire for a genetic test
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:27,487	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Lead scientist II Men journalist
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:30,815	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To ask a question which amazingly for 25 years had not been asked
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,375	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Who was this woman
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,191	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And that's when we found out her name
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,983	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Henrietta
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Lacks
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:46,687	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This is the sound of Rebecca reading henrietta's medical Rec
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:47,967	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	First time
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:49,759	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Can I have this
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:52,831	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is a 30 year old colored woman
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,367	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She sitting with
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,159	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Henrietta's youngest daughter Deborah
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,951	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	2nd of November to this is again
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:58,975	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just bring it with you
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:02,815	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Henrietta had five kids when she died at the age of 31
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,351	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Most have no memory of
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,935	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Especially true of Deborah
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:09,983	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Was only 15 months old and I don't
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:11,519	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Remember anything about my mother
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:12,799	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Yes she
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know she
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,615	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She gets in her entire life
EDL	00:16:15,615	00:16:17,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just a Longing To Know
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,687	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Her mother was and did she lie
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:22,015	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Dancing and I always wanted to know what she
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,807	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Like to do what she
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,319	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	When
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:28,927	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Would you like to eat that you breastfeed Deborah she was she was really sort of
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,975	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I was fixated on that idea she wanted to know
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:33,791	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	If she was breastfed
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,839	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I don't know what I would give up just to
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,375	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,167	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Half a hair tie
EDL	00:16:40,191	00:16:41,215	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's a see her
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,239	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Homework
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,543	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So in 1973
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:47,103	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	When a scientist calls the lacks family never hears
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,895	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That little bit
EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:52,223	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Of the mother that she never knew are still alive
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:58,623	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And oh by the way can we take a blood test from your family's or having some contamination problem when you do genetic marker
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,159	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Blah blah blah what is you could imagine
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,463	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Took me by surprise it really did
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:09,119	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It was really confusing I mean how much is it how much of a sales is out there you know eventually she went online
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,935	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I found thousands and thousands of hits
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:14,239	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Like for instance on HELOC loans
EDL	00:17:14,239	00:17:15,519	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And Deborah had heard
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,543	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And various journalists
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:18,847	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In the past to come to her and mentioned you know
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:20,127	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Dolly the cloned sheep
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	End
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:22,175	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Dad you know your mom
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:26,015	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They did this with your mom to meaning that's actually where the technology started
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:28,319	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The first cells ever cloned were Hela cells
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:29,599	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But that was just clone yourself
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,903	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Not cloning an entire being
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,927	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But that
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Distinction
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,975	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is very complicated
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,511	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	For somebody who doesn't know what a cell is
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Between what
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:41,631	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Journalists I told her and Googling
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:44,447	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Can relax and clone thought there were thousands of
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:46,495	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Cloned her mother around and
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:48,543	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You mean like a bunch of Henrietta
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,079	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Walking Street walking around
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,639	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Rebecca says that one of Deborah's biggest fears
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,919	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is bumping into one of these clones
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:58,015	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know she would say I would have to go talk to her and she wouldn't know that I was
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:58,783	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Daughter and
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:00,063	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And and I don't know that I
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:00,831	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Handle that
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:07,231	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Wow sound so fantastically how could someone believe that they're copies of her mother walking around but at 1.25
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:10,047	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	5 years after their mother died someone called and said hey
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:14,143	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Piper still alive and you know we've got enough of her so that they could wrap around the Earth
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:17,727	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Travel time to Des Moines all bets are off
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,823	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Not to mention that it's actually not that crazy
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:24,383	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Is your DNA is in yourself
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:27,455	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So if your cells are taken out of you and they still grow
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,759	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What is Nats w
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:36,159	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Alive of you but it's clearly not you and it's going on and on that some
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,487	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's a funny middle space that's for sure
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:45,887	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So here's what happened is Rebecca went off in search of Henrietta Lacks
EDL	00:18:45,887	00:18:48,191	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Every so often Deborah would come along
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:54,591	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And sit with her as they interviewed you know anyone that could find friends family and eventually over many many
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:55,615	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Years
EDL	00:18:55,615	00:18:57,919	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Picture does emerge
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:06,111	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This woman was she was born in in Roanoke 1920 Virginia
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,135	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	10th
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:13,279	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Of the 11 children but at least she was the one that stood out everybody talked about her as just being
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:18,399	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know she was the catch oh my goodness I don't think I could stop her
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:22,495	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	This is Sadie Sturdivant henrietta's cousin
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:25,055	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Did it for myself but it was very
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:29,919	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Brown eyes brown hair
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:31,199	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Snake tan complexion
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,527	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Everyone they spoke with zeroed in on the same few points
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,087	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	First she was really
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,879	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Meticulous about her nails
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:45,279	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Always has very deep red and second Henrietta just had this she was very strange
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:47,583	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Forthright
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,655	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	MicroCell
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,751	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Unfortunate thing is it when it comes to her life
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,775	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And how she lived
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	There's not a ton of detail
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:00,127	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So this is when
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,199	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But in that hotel room
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:04,991	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Flipping through the medical record
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,039	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They did start to get some detail
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:08,831	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The Hedgehog
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,623	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Write about
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:11,903	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	How she died
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:16,255	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Wishing a lot of pain when she died this was the hardest thing
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:20,351	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She was eventually in an unbelievable amount of pain
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,119	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Complains of pain
EDL	00:20:21,631	00:20:23,935	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In the right lower quadrant wailing and
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:27,519	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And crying and you know moaning for the Lord to help her and
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:31,103	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	According to the records doctors tried everything morphine they injected
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:33,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Gibson alcohol straight into her spine
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,687	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Pain
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,967	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Spider the alcohol
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:42,367	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Injection last week to have these fits of Team through spasms
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:48,767	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Waves of pain would hit her and she would rise up out of the bed and brush around
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:50,047	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The bass Tracker to the bed and
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,351	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Her sister
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,887	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Along with one of her friends
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:21:00,031	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In one of them would tighten the straps and the other one would put a pillow in her mouth so that she wouldn't bite her tongue
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:05,407	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	If I just had the chance
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,967	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To take care of
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,527	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Now
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:12,575	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Dealing with how her mother died was one thing
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,111	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Cells
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,391	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Made it more complicated
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,696	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Whatever her mother was alive and he sells them how
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:20,000	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So if that's true that
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:22,560	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Left very big questions and the first of them
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,096	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	For Deborah was how can
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:31,008	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I'd rather rest in peace If part of her with part of her soul is being in a shot up to the moon and injected with l
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:34,080	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Chemicals in a radiated and bombarded it so painful
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,360	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	No one you know that
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,896	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Had her sales on
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:39,968	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The backward donkey going to Turkey
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:41,504	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know in the airplane
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:43,552	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just born all over the world
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:50,208	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I just don't know if she worried about them
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,744	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She worried that it hurt
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,792	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Your mother
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,072	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The cells with Ebola
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,376	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Does somehow her mother feel
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:00,704	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The pain that comes with ebola and had a scientist ever like sat down with her
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:05,568	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Me just explain to her like this is no never
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:10,944	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Nothing cuz it's you that wouldn't be that hard to explain it like
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:14,016	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	When you take cells out of a body it's kind of like when you cut your fingernail

EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:22,208	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's a it's really hard there is no other example of
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,768	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Some way that you can take something from someone's body
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,072	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And have it keep living and not have a person feel it
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:29,888	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And all these worries sister Baga
EDL	00:22:30,656	00:22:32,448	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Began to build and Deborah's mind
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:33,984	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And Dill

EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,176	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Tooth broken out in hives
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:47,552	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She was telling him all the stuff that she recently learned can almost hear it on the tape she says to him
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:51,648	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Can't carry the burden of these cells anymore
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,160	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Do it
EDL	00:22:54,976	00:22:56,512	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I don't want to try to do
EDL	00:22:56,512	00:23:00,096	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And I have been started trying to talk her down and he was trying to talk her down
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:03,936	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And then just out of nowhere he just started
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:06,752	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Singing
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:30,560	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And he started preaching
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:36,448	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	He held her head in his hands

EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,192	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Batman
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And she just
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:19,456	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Feel like a man
EDL	00:24:20,736	00:24:21,248	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I feel like
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:26,112	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	She didn't realize it then
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:27,136	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That night
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Deborah was on the verge of a stroke
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:38,912	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	One of the most striking moments of the stories when the two of them visit Hoskins
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,984	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:44,544	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Debra meets her mother's cells for the first time
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,200	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The scientist finally contacted
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:55,296	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Christoph lengauer the scientist to invite us into his lab to see the cells
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:25:02,464	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	He had projected them onto a screen
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:04,768	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Appliques cuz the way they were stained and protected
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:12,448	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So they're very it's cereal looking they're very assertive there they glow you know I mean when you think about angel
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:18,848	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Filtrate you think of something glowing Christopher turned on the screen and she just
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:19,616	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Xiamen Deborah gist
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:25,504	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Gas
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:32,672	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	200 times bigger than what they really are
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:38,816	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Chain of cells
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:51,360	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Kristoff gave the he gave her a vial of the cells that you can hold in her hand
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:57,760	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And it came out of the freezer so they're cold and she sort of her hands together with the
EDL	00:25:57,760	00:25:59,808	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Violin her hands or warm them up in
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:03,136	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Blue on them to keep them warm
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:05,440	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And then she just threw whispered to the cells it was
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:09,024	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Incredible sheep just raise them up to her lips and she said
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:09,792	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You famous
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:11,072	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Nobody knows
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:26,432	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just a week before Rebecca and I spoke in the studio she got
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:32,064	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Got a call that Deborah had died she had a heart attack and died in her sleep
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:49,472	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Okay so
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,032	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	As you may know at this point
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:53,824	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That segment was based on Rebecca
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,360	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Exclusive book The Immortal Life of
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:55,872	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Henrietta Lacks
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,408	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Amazing book
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,432	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It cannot
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,968	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Right when we released at
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,248	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Hispanic
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,016	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Couple years now
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:05,088	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And recently we met up with
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,112	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Rebecca inch
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,136	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Chicago
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:12,512	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just get an update came out of that but
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,304	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Twitter just took off
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:17,376	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Scholarships for named after Henrietta
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:23,776	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Honorary doctorate monuments Highway placards and historical landmarks and buildings named after
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:26,336	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	High school called Henrietta Lacks High
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,384	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Hela high for short B while the book is it
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:34,784	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Exploding she went on this like insane book tour members of the lacks family began to join her and started off with just
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,552	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Relax would go in
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,088	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	User on stage
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:37,600	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	It's Q&A
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:39,392	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And people started cheering
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:41,952	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And scientist ending up saying
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:47,584	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	I want to tell you what I did with these cells and I want to tell you why this was important for me and I'm sorry it was hard for you and
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:51,936	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	People reaching out I'm alive today because of this a drug that your mother sells help that Oliver
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:55,008	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know I do this in my lab and they just it never stop
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:59,872	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The flood which is an away with Deborah always wanted she wanted to go
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:05,248	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	To every event she wanted to be on every television show she had her dress picked out for Oprah like
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:08,832	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You know 8 years for the book came out you know she was
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:10,112	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Deborah wanted this is
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,160	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Exactly what she always do
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:13,696	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But then
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:14,720	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just last year
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,488	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Something interesting
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:21,120	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Troubling so yeah so March 2013 to 3% is from Germany sequence
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,912	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The original in Publisher online
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:24,192	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Where anyone can download at
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:26,240	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Please click button I downloaded it was is there
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:31,872	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And they did not ask the family and my initial reaction when I saw this press coverage was
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,920	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They did what
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,688	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Because
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,224	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Within the Hela genome
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:37,760	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	There's also
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:38,528	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And some of that
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:42,112	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Was Pat 50% kids in 25%
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:43,136	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Potentially to her grandkids
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:49,024	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But one of the things so they put out a press release when this genome sequencing on it had a little
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:51,072	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Frequently asked questions of the press might
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:53,120	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And one of them was
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:59,008	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Can you learn anything about Henrietta or her or her children from this you know the answer is no.
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:01,056	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And I do and I believe that they
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,336	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But they believe
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:08,224	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But this is a misconception you can in fact learn about people and in fact you cannot even hide
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:11,296	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	People's private information if you try and so
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,064	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	1
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,088	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Researcher
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:15,392	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Took the genome and created
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,416	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Essentially
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,952	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	A report on Henrietta
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:19,744	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	You have
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:21,792	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	X percent chance of
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,328	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Bipolar disorder
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:28,960	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Alcoholism obesity has this huge range of things and
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:30,752	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Some of it is yes there's some real
EDL	00:29:30,752	00:29:37,152	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Potential privacy violation like with the Alzheimer's jeans and things like that bit of information about your family
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:37,920	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Will not tell you
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,992	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Was it support this dude
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,272	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	May did he
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:45,856	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	List all these things are describing to me
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:47,648	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So I called The Lacs
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,208	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Did you know that
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:53,536	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Let me think about this and Rebecca head cold you know
EDL	00:29:53,536	00:29:54,560	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They did not
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:57,120	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Any kind of bothered us because we're saying okay
EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:00,448	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Why wasn't a family involved with this decision maker
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:02,752	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That was Jerry lacks Gary Lacks
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:04,544	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Y.
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:08,128	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Laxus granddaughter back in the 50s you had Henrietta Lacks
EDL	00:30:08,128	00:30:09,664	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Versailles weather
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:11,712	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Removed without her family's knowledge
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,760	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Can you go in the 70s
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:16,832	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	My dad and his siblings
EDL	00:30:17,344	00:30:18,880	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Mito blood samples
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Used it for research
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:22,976	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They didn't give consent
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:25,024	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Then you come 2013
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:26,304	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And you have
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:27,840	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Henrietta's
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:30,912	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That's out this though it was her medical records being
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:32,192	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Published publicly
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,472	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Another first question was
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,264	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Can you get them to take it down
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,080	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Until we can figure out what it is what it means
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:40,896	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So I reach out to the scientist and said
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,176	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Black family you know
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:46,528	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	They replied immediately they took it offline
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:47,296	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Immediately
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:50,624	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And then I contacted Francis Collins
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,440	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The head of the NIH I also reached out to
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:54,464	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Kathy Hudson who
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:31:01,376	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Used to run the genetics and public policy Center at Hopkins and is now over at the NH dealing with a lot of these issues
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:02,400	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Shout to them
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:05,216	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And said somebody needs to try to
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:07,520	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Help black men get consent to me need to just
EDL	00:31:07,520	00:31:08,288	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Go back
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:09,824	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Pretend like this is starting
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,592	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Now
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:16,992	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And just do it probably should have happened in the first place and that's a might have been like a couple of weeks after that several weeks after that
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:19,296	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That they had a meeting with NIH
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:23,904	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	That was my mom myself my sister my dad my uncle My Brother David
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:28,512	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	My cousin Ron Rebecca skloot she was asking or not
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,536	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Conference call
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:32,864	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	All the nhbooks drive up to Baltimore
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:39,776	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Doctor College Kathy I sending it was like we were excited like
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:41,824	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	With the director they all met
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,128	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Listen to everybody you know

EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,480	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What can be done what can be done
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:53,088	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The last time we asked about everything you could possibly imagine when over you know
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,368	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The information about Geno
EDL	00:31:55,392	00:32:00,256	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Gene sequencing the basic science of genomes to get a clear understanding of
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:02,560	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	What DG No Limit
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:03,072	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Defiance
EDL	00:32:03,584	00:32:05,120	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	We all want to stop science
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:06,144	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	But yet we don't want
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:09,472	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Certain information to be just broadly available
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:15,872	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Publicly so they laid out three options one was we don't release any of them at all and then there was a second option which was released
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:16,384	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Sit with
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:18,176	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	No restriction
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:20,224	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Just put it out there like the Germans did
EDL	00:32:20,224	00:32:23,808	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And then there was corruption which was really sit with restrictions
EDL	00:32:23,808	00:32:25,344	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Dover NH wood house it
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:27,136	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	On their own servers
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:34,048	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And that in order to get access to it you would have to send an application at said this is the research we're going to do that would be
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:35,840	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The committee formed that was a group of scientist
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:38,144	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	And then some members Alexa
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,680	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	The Hela genome
EDL	00:32:39,680	00:32:45,824	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Committee one grandson child and one great-grandchild My Brother David and my cousin Veronica and this is the option
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:48,640	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	So yeah there's this company and they just
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:49,920	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	A few weeks ago
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:51,968	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	Saw their first batch of applications
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:57,600	| rl_extra17henriettalacks |	In the news hit and it was the first time that they were part of the news
