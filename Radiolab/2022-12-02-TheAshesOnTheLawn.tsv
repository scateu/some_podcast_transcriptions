A global pandemic. Thousands dying. A passive government. An afflicted group
fueled by grief and anger. In this episode, first aired in 2020, Reporter
Tracie Hunte wanted to understand this moment of pain and confusion. As she
looked back three decades, she found a complicated answer to a simple question:
when nothing seems to work, how do you make change?

Special thanks to Dr. Anthony Fauci.

EDL	00:00:25,070	00:00:42,330	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We pulled an episode from the archive today because it takes on a question that is as pressing as ever, maybe even more so how do you fix the world, how do you change things when you don't personally have the power to change them and the people in power don't really want to change them.

EDL	00:01:05,480	00:01:20,560	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	What they did, what it accomplished, where they fell short also you will no doubt recognize the gravelly and calm voice of Anthony Fauci in this episode after nearly four decades heading the National Institute of allergy and infectious disease.

TITLE

EDL	00:01:45,500	00:02:05,090	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wait, you look all right listening to radio lab radio from WNY..C rewind hello, this is radio lab. 
EDL	00:02:05,090	00:02:09,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I'm Lulu Miller and today we have a story from reporter Tracy Hunt. 
EDL	00:02:09,840	00:02:10,380	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:02:10,380	00:02:27,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Where does the story start, so I'm gonna start you off in New York City, June 25th 1989, it was the gay pride parade, but it was also the very first time that David Robinson ever laid eyes on Warren Crowd. 
EDL	00:02:27,350	00:02:46,040	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I noticed this guy I thought was incredibly hot, marching by with a group of people he was shirtless and muscling and blonde hair, but it was but was like really short except these two like what Wolverine had. 
EDL	00:02:46,040	00:02:46,700	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:02:46,700	00:02:49,640	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Okay, they're almost like these little wings up there. 
EDL	00:02:49,640	00:02:50,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:02:50,350	00:02:57,650	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	If you just look amazing and I remember just thinking, oh my God, but yeah. 
EDL	00:02:57,650	00:03:02,830	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	He was marching by with a group of people and I remember thinking, oh, well. 
EDL	00:03:02,830	00:03:04,409	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I'll never see him again, 

EDL	00:03:04,409	00:03:12,460	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	but the next day David was that of AIDS activist meeting who should be in the front row with this guy. 
EDL	00:03:12,460	00:03:13,660	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:03:13,660	00:03:28,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So, yeah and he invited me to have lunch with him the next day at the apartment where he was staying and I did go over there and we didn't in fact have lunch. 
EDL	00:03:28,840	00:03:30,280	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:03:30,280	00:03:34,250	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We had a lovely, lovely time right away. 
EDL	00:03:34,250	00:03:36,570	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	David was like, okay, this is it. 
EDL	00:03:36,570	00:03:41,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You're the one he had grown up on a small small dairy farm in Connecticut. 
EDL	00:03:41,350	00:04:02,870	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It had been a very joyless and sometimes abusive happening and he was kicked out at 17 for being gay and he ended up having his own gosh, I don't know, just unique way of being in the world. 
EDL	00:04:02,870	00:04:03,430	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:04:03,430	00:04:34,190	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So it's a little hard to talk about because I feel he got cheated so so badly, Warren had told David when they first got together that he was HIV positive and it was less than half a year after we moved down to San Francisco that the infection started coming fast and furious by the last several months of his life. 
EDL	00:04:34,190	00:04:35,060	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	He was just. 
EDL	00:04:35,060	00:04:39,380	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know, pretty much homebound last two months, he had dementia(痴呆). 
EDL	00:04:39,380	00:04:51,980	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The last thing he got ended up causing dementia and he was he was in the hospital for much of that time I took him home his last months until he had dementia. 
EDL	00:04:51,980	00:05:02,760	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	He was really angry, David and Warren would sit around their apartment talking about that anchor and talking about that they both knew Warren was going to die. 
EDL	00:05:02,760	00:05:08,360	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know we would talk and he would express that it was his wish to. 
EDL	00:05:08,360	00:05:27,170	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know, make a difference beyond his death, Warren died April 1992 you know this is a moment when the eighth epidemic had been going on now for about 10 years, research into treatments had basically stalled. 
EDL	00:05:27,170	00:05:32,610	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	There was no here in sights more and more people were getting sick and dying. 
EDL	00:05:32,610	00:05:39,340	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We are in the middle of a pole and it looked like the bishop administration was just not paying attention. 
EDL	00:05:39,340	00:05:52,240	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	40 million people is a place and nobody acts as it is nobody and people like Larry Kramer who co-founded ACT UP, an activist group that David was a part of. 
EDL	00:05:52,240	00:05:52,540	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:05:52,540	00:05:54,360	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They were at their wits end. 
EDL	00:05:54,360	00:05:58,508	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We are in the worst shape we have ever ever been in. 
EDL	00:05:58,508	00:06:14,670	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They had spent years protesting and demonstrating and just trying to get people to pay attention, trying to get the government to just do something nobody knows what to do and that was David's question too. 
EDL	00:06:14,670	00:06:31,845	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	What do I do next, what would Warren want me to do, he wanted to be able to continue to make a difference even after he died and so David was sitting in their San Francisco apartment alone with a box of Warren's ashes and inside was just, you know, 
EDL	00:06:31,845	00:06:40,230	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	the plastic bag with the ashes and bone chips and and eventually he decided that he needed to use what was left of Warren's body. 
EDL	00:06:40,230	00:06:40,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:06:40,840	00:06:42,500	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	To make people pay attention. 
EDL	00:06:42,500	00:06:50,910	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 8.4 secs ]

* ATTENTION
EDL	00:06:50,910	00:06:52,210	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So in October 1992. 
EDL	00:06:52,210	00:06:58,360	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	David and about 150 other people, many of them members of ACT UP, met in DC right in front of the capital.

EDL	00:06:58,740	00:07:07,000	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know I remember a lot lining up with these other people and some were people I knew very well from ACT UP and some were people I had never met.

EDL	00:07:19,202	00:07:29,376	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and the crunch of the gravel under our feet as we walked down the the mall, it started marching down the path along the them all, 
EDL	00:07:29,376	00:07:34,130	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and as they marched they started to chant 
EDL	00:07:34,130	00:07:37,430	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 3.3 secs ]
EDL	00:07:37,430	00:07:39,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We're bringing our dead to your door. 
EDL	00:07:39,840	00:07:41,670	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We won't take it anymore. 
EDL	00:07:41,670	00:07:42,050	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:42,050	00:07:48,930	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	One of my strongest memories is just of how sore my throat I lost my voice and just pushed through it. 
EDL	00:07:48,930	00:07:49,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:49,350	00:07:58,860	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I was in a line of people who were carrying their beloved persons ashes in a variety of different kinds of vessels. 
EDL	00:07:58,860	00:07:59,300	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:07:59,300	00:08:02,950	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Some had ashes in a baggy what was your ashes? 
EDL	00:08:02,950	00:08:06,210	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And I had I had created a box. 
EDL	00:08:06,210	00:08:07,330	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:08:07,330	00:08:16,380	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It was painted black with gold Line drawings on it and then for like the last section and of the market. 
EDL	00:08:16,380	00:08:16,980	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:08:16,980	00:08:20,340	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We were getting closer to the White House. 
EDL	00:08:20,340	00:08:22,370	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 2.0 secs ]
EDL	00:08:22,370	00:08:28,951	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Just remember almost a grim feeling and as the White House came into view, 
EDL	00:08:28,951	00:08:42,190	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	they could see a line of Mounted Police. the police had prepared by filling up with on their horses 20 feet away from the White House gate surrounding the entire perimeter of the White House. 
EDL	00:08:42,190	00:08:44,090	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	When you look at videos of this. 
EDL	00:08:44,090	00:08:56,190	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It's terrifying these these cops like high up on their horses and it looks like the horses are going to stampede them or something. but the protesters had a strategy. 
EDL	00:08:56,190	00:09:10,400	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The Romans called it the the cuneus, the wedge they formed a triangle with a couple people up in front, pointing directly at the Mounted Police behind them were all the people carrying the ashes. 
EDL	00:09:10,400	00:09:10,710	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:10,710	00:09:17,870	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	All you got to do is get the front of the triangle through the straight line of the enemy and they begin to turn around to see what's happening. 
EDL	00:09:17,870	00:09:18,640	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:09:18,640	00:09:26,795	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The protesters got the tip of that triangle between two of the Mounted Police and pushed through and that gave everyone else an opening to to get through 
EDL	00:09:26,795	00:09:30,980	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	the line of us thinking because you had ass is to get right up to the fence. 
EDL	00:09:30,980	00:09:39,470	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know all of a sudden I remember being at the fence physically crammed into one another as we all tried to get as close as possible. 
EDL	00:09:39,470	00:09:44,720	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 5.2 secs ]
EDL	00:09:44,720	00:09:56,310	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Things became very quick and very slow all at the same time. the people with the urns began to hurl those ashes onto the lawn. 
EDL	00:09:56,310	00:09:57,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:09:57,350	00:10:07,195	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I remember opening this box and reaching in and the feel of the the bag and turning it over and shaking it. 
EDL	00:10:07,195	00:10:26,171	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I shook the box out and feeling seeing these ashes wave of action in the air, some of them just falling and some going on the wind wafted back over us and began to coat us 
EDL	00:10:26,171	00:10:36,827	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and some getting on my arm the feel of those ashes, even the taste of them on your face and lips I can remember having to clean my glasses 
EDL	00:10:36,827	00:10:44,170	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	because I couldn't see and it was somewhere in the process of. 
EDL	00:10:44,170	00:10:51,910	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	This that I went from that grim feeling to just this just fierce. 
EDL	00:10:51,910	00:10:52,530	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:10:52,530	00:11:08,470	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I don't know feeling like an embodiment of enraged green this incredibly release of energy out into the universe. 
EDL	00:11:08,470	00:11:26,740	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 25 secs ] 




EDL	00:11:26,740	00:11:30,310	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wow, but I had never heard about this. 
EDL	00:11:30,310	00:11:32,270	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, I didn't know this happened. 
EDL	00:11:32,270	00:11:52,670	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, I think when I first heard this, I think the dominant thing that I was like feeling and thinking was, that's a metal like it's so like I just I can't think of a like more pure response to that sort of anger and that disgrace. 
EDL	00:11:52,670	00:11:53,010	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:11:53,010	00:12:04,220	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	But at the same time, you know it just it just didn't there, there wasn't any meaningful response from the White House and didn't get a lot of media attention at the time. 
EDL	00:12:04,220	00:12:04,570	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:04,570	00:12:09,610	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And I think if you were in in DC that day at that moment, you probably wouldn't have known that that had happened. 
EDL	00:12:09,610	00:12:14,740	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Right, and it's like, how loud do you have to like, what does it take. 
EDL	00:12:14,740	00:12:22,982	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, and and honestly that's the thing about ACT UP the group that David was part of that made the ashes action happen because when you look at all the other things 
EDL	00:12:22,982	00:12:29,770	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	that ACT UP did they're just constantly trying to punch through and and get people to see them like, for example. 
EDL	00:12:29,770	00:12:32,770	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They did this die in at Saint Patrick's cathedral. 
EDL	00:12:32,770	00:12:35,740	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	What did that look like, this is jesus christ. 
EDL	00:12:35,740	00:12:36,240	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:12:36,240	00:12:39,140	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I am in front of Saint Patrick's cathedral on Sunday. 
EDL	00:12:39,140	00:12:41,760	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We're here reporting on some of the people I talked to. 
EDL	00:12:41,760	00:12:49,410	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They said that the plan was go into Saint Patrick's cathedral just lie down like they were dying or dead, you know simple.

EDL	00:12:52,700	00:13:10,120	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	But some of the protesters went off scripts and stop killing someone, smashed a communion wafers and someone else started heckling the priests and I like the ashes action. 
EDL	00:13:10,120	00:13:19,030	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	This one got a lot of attention but not good attention when people from ACT UP started standing on pews and screaming. 
EDL	00:13:19,030	00:13:21,760	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It really alienated the people who were praying. 
EDL	00:13:21,760	00:13:23,930	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I saw people get very angry and said. 
EDL	00:13:23,930	00:13:24,390	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:13:50,318	00:13:59,690	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	yeah or like to in your face or you know I just was wondering and I know I'm not really supposed to wonder this because I'm a journalist and you know.

EDL	00:14:08,080	00:14:11,900	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Which is like what would work, what would make you know. 
EDL	00:14:11,900	00:14:25,690	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	How do you make change and the amazing thing about the early AIDS movement is that there are so many different kinds of protests going on that it's just like this perfect little petri dish for this.

EDL	00:14:28,920	00:14:51,520	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So just to get started, let's go back to that very same day that the active activists were doing the ashes demonstration because right next to where they were marching on the mall, there was another AIDS demonstration unfurling the AIDS cult.

EDL	00:16:18,180	00:16:20,270	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So I ended up talking to Mike Smith. 
EDL	00:16:20,270	00:16:21,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	My name is Mike Smith. 
EDL	00:16:21,350	00:16:27,370	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I'm the co-founder of the AIDS quilt he was there from the beginning, and he told me that when the quilt first started.

EDL	00:16:27,880	00:16:50,890	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It also came from an angry place if you back up to its inception, many of the earliest panels were made out of anger and desperation, probably the best known of the angry ones is literally white vinyl with red oil paint and the red kind of ran down in drips along the bottom, he says Ralph Reagan. 
EDL	00:16:50,890	00:17:06,420	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	His blood is on your hands, but then about four weeks before the display, we'd had some coverage in The New Yorker and a few other things like right before the display in 1987, they had been putting out newsletters and doing all kinds of press. 
EDL	00:17:06,420	00:17:27,110	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We've said if you get us a panel by October September 15, we would get it into the event on the mall a month later and on the three days around September 15, we had 800 pieces of overnight now oh, from every state and they weren't from the gay men in the urban course they were from mothers. 
EDL	00:17:27,110	00:17:35,180	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It was all these like midwestern ladies whose sun died of AIDS and they had no one to talk about it with. 
EDL	00:17:35,180	00:17:41,160	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They couldn't really talk about it, maybe with their families they couldn't even tell their church group what their son had died of.

EDL	00:17:41,780	00:18:01,740	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	First of all, how much, how isolated and desolate do you have to be to create a beautiful, loving fabric memorial for your son and then box it up and send it to a bunch of gay men you don't know 3000 miles away, but we tapped into this nationwide sense of grief and that's when the panels he was saying started to get really. 
EDL	00:18:01,740	00:18:13,900	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Really beautiful bomber jackets and high school track medals and things that mom put on that really tell the story of the person and it changed everything by the time we got the quilt out there on the mall. 
EDL	00:18:13,900	00:18:15,500	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	This wasn't a protest banner. 
EDL	00:18:15,500	00:18:27,270	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It was literally all of America saying, wake up, our sons are dying rubber, you know when it came to talk about media attention. 
EDL	00:18:27,270	00:18:30,070	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	There's like a ton of media attention on the AIDS quilt.

EDL	00:18:39,270	00:18:45,200	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	A dark reminder of AIDS and its victims was unfurled, each panel representing a depth. 
EDL	00:18:45,200	00:18:47,940	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And it cracked open some political movement.

EDL	00:18:48,260	00:18:56,402	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I bet two thirds of the members of Congress at some point had a mother standing in their office with a quilt panel and then within a few years,

EDL	00:19:25,830	00:19:37,942	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It's how do you and and you know one thing that accent members were reacting to at the time is that a lot of the funerals of people who died of AIDS 
EDL	00:19:37,942	00:19:44,626	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	they were being covered in like the art section of a lot of major newspapers 
EDL	00:19:44,626	00:19:51,078	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and as as one person told me, it was sort of like the world was seeing their deaths as aesthetic events 
EDL	00:19:51,078	00:20:01,140	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and not as political events like instead of their debts being treated as news and politics, it was just a cultural event or something. 
EDL	00:20:01,140	00:20:04,710	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And David in particular felt like that was what was happening with the quilt. 
EDL	00:20:04,710	00:20:09,220	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I think the quilt itself does good stuff and is moving still. 
EDL	00:20:09,220	00:20:21,796	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It's like making something beautiful out of the epidemic once I saw that the people who organized the quilt and the quilt showings would allow anyone to read names, 
EDL	00:20:21,796	00:20:35,200	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	including President Bush, it was just so clear to me that we needed to demonstrate what the actual result of AIDS was. 
EDL	00:20:35,200	00:20:36,970	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	There was nothing beautiful about it. 
EDL	00:20:36,970	00:20:37,930	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	This is what I'm left with. 
EDL	00:20:37,930	00:20:40,400	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I've got a a box full of ashes and bone chips. 
EDL	00:20:40,400	00:20:41,810	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know there's no beauty in that.

EDL	00:20:42,170	00:20:47,820	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I know I was adamant that I didn't want this to be symbolic.

EDL	00:20:48,300	00:20:56,890	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The power in what we were doing was the utterly unvarnished and I guess you know when I think about these two approaches. 
EDL	00:20:56,890	00:21:02,604	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Maybe it's sort of a false choice and you need both or what, but it feels like a dilemma. 
EDL	00:21:02,604	00:21:11,068	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I know that I feel pulled towards the raw truths and expression of anger in the ashes action. 
EDL	00:21:11,068	00:21:16,990	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah yeah, but I can also see the beauty of the quilt and the pragmatic political power it had. 
EDL	00:21:16,990	00:21:17,960	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:21:17,960	00:21:19,510	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And I think that's a real question.

EDL	00:23:09,350	00:23:17,460	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So I was looking back to the early AIDS movement for insights on some of those questions and a familiar name popped out. 

EDL	00:23:17,460	00:23:18,250	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Hello, good morning. 
EDL	00:23:18,250	00:23:22,880	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Sorry, a doctor Anthony Fauci, I wasn't expecting you to pick up the phone.

EDL	00:23:23,460	00:23:25,110	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The Fauci is in this story. 
EDL	00:23:25,110	00:23:27,490	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Well, I'm here if you want me to go away, I'll leave. 
EDL	00:23:27,490	00:23:28,560	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	No, no, do not. 
EDL	00:23:28,560	00:23:29,200	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Please don't go away. 
EDL	00:23:29,200	00:23:31,790	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The fouch is actually a big part of the story. 
EDL	00:23:31,790	00:23:42,290	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Well, yeah, back in the eighties early in the 8th crisis he had the exact same job that he has now like truly the same title, the exact same title job. 
EDL	00:23:42,290	00:23:51,160	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Everything the head of not yet and back then he was studying immunology, the molecular architecture of fevers. 
EDL	00:23:51,160	00:23:55,440	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Then he heard about this weird disease. 
EDL	00:23:55,440	00:24:03,451	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	HIV AIDS before we knew it was HIV that in the United States at the time I was afflicting mostly white, young gay men, 
EDL	00:24:03,451	00:24:15,920	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	you know who would have thought back in the 80s that you would have 78 million infections and 37 million deaths from a disease that no one wanted to pay attention to his mentors at the time were like. 
EDL	00:24:15,920	00:24:19,650	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	What are you doing you're on this path to like success. 
EDL	00:24:19,650	00:24:28,430	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Why do you want to work with AIDS patients, but I had a great deal of empathy for these gay young men, so he ignored his mentors. 

EDL	00:24:28,430	00:24:38,630	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, now let's go to the lecture and join Dr Anthony Fauci as he talks about AIDS and he turned his career to focus almost completely on AIDS research. 
EDL	00:24:38,630	00:24:44,900	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I'm working directly on on AIDS clinically and from a basic science, and it was a transforming time in my life.

EDL	00:25:26,290	00:25:27,453	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	No, no, no, of course.

EDL	00:25:35,470	00:25:46,380	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Your refusal to hear the screams of AIDS activists early in the crisis resulted in the deaths of thousands of queers with 270000 dead from AIDS and millions more infected with HIV. 
EDL	00:25:46,380	00:25:59,950	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You should not be honored at a dinner you should be put before a firing squad, right, that that I would say he was trying to gain my attention and he certainly accomplished his goal.

EDL	00:26:01,550	00:26:06,240	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wow, yeah so that letter was published in 1988. 
EDL	00:26:06,240	00:26:11,990	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wait, but okay, so before we go on with Fauci like and so was he doing that like he made this move to go work on it. 
EDL	00:26:11,990	00:26:19,510	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	But then was he somehow doing something something dangerous, yeah, well, there were there were bunch of issues. 
EDL	00:26:19,510	00:26:25,370	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	This is Peter Staley, long term age activist and LGBTQ rights activist. 
EDL	00:26:25,370	00:26:30,534	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	He was a big time member of the acts of community and he says that sure 
EDL	00:26:30,534	00:26:40,930	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	yes, Dr. Fauci was doing a lot of work on AIDS, but he was head of NIAID and they were the primary institute at NIH to handle the bulk of the research back then.

EDL	00:26:42,140	00:26:50,820	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	In essence, he was the head of AIDS research for the us government, and we had problems with that effort back in the eighties. 
EDL	00:26:50,820	00:26:52,790	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The drug trials that they were running. 
EDL	00:26:52,790	00:27:01,880	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They had a pretty disgraceful track record of not enrolling the full diversity of patients tended to be really white and really male.

EDL	00:27:13,285	00:27:20,220	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and the board was also making all these decisions without the input of people who actually were living with AIDS.

EDL	00:27:20,750	00:27:27,950	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know the board was just these doctors and researchers who were playing it kind of safe, frankly, you know we had AZT. 
EDL	00:27:27,950	00:27:30,910	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We had the first drug, but AZT was toxic. 
EDL	00:27:30,910	00:27:33,970	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It had all these terrible side effects. 
EDL	00:27:33,970	00:27:44,650	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And Peter Staley and others thought that there were lots of other drugs out there that could be even more useful and we wanted a robust research effort on those drugs. 
EDL	00:27:44,650	00:27:53,010	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	But Fauci and his team, they just started testing the wazoo at AZT and a few times when they did have a new drug. 
EDL	00:27:53,010	00:27:58,936	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It took years and years for it to make it to anybody with AIDS who could actually benefit from it 
EDL	00:27:58,936	00:28:01,900	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and activists were like people are dying now. 
EDL	00:28:01,900	00:28:06,539	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	He's not moving fast enough on the things we want, so they put together a list of demands 
EDL	00:28:06,539	00:28:10,802	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and they decide to bring them to him at the NIH 
EDL	00:28:10,802	00:28:17,426	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	okay in act of land that can't be as simple as showing up on a beautiful crisp morning 
EDL	00:28:17,426	00:28:28,540	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	in Bethesda Maryland onto the serene campus of the NIH all these people over 1000 demonstrators from all around the country showed up and started marching. 
EDL	00:28:28,540	00:28:30,120	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:28:30,120	00:28:34,580	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The cops were already cops on horseback, they were quite prepared. 
EDL	00:28:34,580	00:28:36,750	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They were also TV cameras and reporters. 
EDL	00:28:36,750	00:28:37,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

EDL	00:28:37,350	00:28:44,141	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And Peter knew that if we put on a really big fancy display that gives the media a really colorful picture, 
EDL	00:28:44,141	00:28:50,203	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	you increased your odds of appearing on the front page and he had these colored smoke bombs, 
EDL	00:28:50,203	00:28:57,590	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	surplus military smoke grenades hidden behind protest signs on the top of really long bamboo poles. 
EDL	00:28:57,590	00:29:05,250	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So they marched along with others but then at the right moment all at the same time we dropped our poles. 
EDL	00:29:05,250	00:29:15,220	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	ripped off the signs, pulled the pins of these things and then raise the pulse back up and these plumages of huge thick, red, orange. 
EDL	00:29:15,220	00:29:16,510	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:29:16,510	00:29:20,880	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	blue, purple and pinks and greens started pouring out at the top of these poles. 
EDL	00:29:20,880	00:29:27,404	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And beneath this massive rainbow war cloud they charged through the crowd 
EDL	00:29:27,404	00:29:37,090	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and the crowd abrupted and then it was just an entire day of well-orchestrated chaos. 
EDL	00:29:37,090	00:29:37,390	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:29:37,390	00:29:43,930	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	This was a major day of protest by AIDS acrobats in this country and I mean, everywhere you looked something was happening. 
EDL	00:29:43,930	00:29:47,900	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Oh, people were giving speeches. 
EDL	00:29:47,900	00:29:49,410	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:29:49,410	00:29:54,270	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Nash Walker is hazy, too black women talking about their experiences living with AIDS.

EDL	00:29:55,900	00:29:58,070	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They were people dressed up in lab coats. 
EDL	00:29:58,070	00:30:00,700	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You don't fit our profile making fun of sciences. 
EDL	00:30:00,700	00:30:13,330	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Ah yes, there is singing Diane's one section of the lawn was transformed into a graveyard, air horns punctured the noise of the crowd. 
EDL	00:30:13,330	00:30:16,660	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Basically, what we're doing is blasting the horns every 12 minutes to mind people. 
EDL	00:30:16,660	00:30:22,206	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	That's statistically right now every 12 minutes someone in America is dying from AIDS 
EDL	00:30:22,206	00:30:31,805	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and at the center of all this noise and color stood for people dressed in hooded black robes, 
EDL	00:30:31,805	00:30:37,340	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and they carried a black coffin that had the words [beep] you Fauci written on its side. 
EDL	00:30:37,340	00:30:38,940	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:30:38,940	00:30:47,680	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They also had a really giant Fauci head, impelled on a spike and there was blood coming out of his ears. 
EDL	00:30:47,680	00:30:56,700	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	nose and mouth and his eyes, and then they burned him in effigy. 
EDL	00:30:56,700	00:30:58,020	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They burned him in effigy?
EDL	00:30:58,020	00:31:09,150	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yes, ACT UP was publicly taking that list of demands and tests, shaking it in Fauci's face. 
EDL	00:31:09,150	00:31:10,680	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:31:10,680	00:31:12,790	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I mean and nailing it to his door. 
EDL	00:31:12,790	00:31:15,880	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 3.1 secs ]
EDL	00:31:15,880	00:31:17,090	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wow, that is intense. 
EDL	00:31:17,090	00:31:26,260	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah and Fauci is sitting up in his office several floors up looking out the window. 
EDL	00:31:26,260	00:31:36,460	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They were really confronting me in a very, very aggressive way and as he was taking it all in, I saw a sip from my window and missed all this chaos. 
EDL	00:31:36,460	00:31:42,670	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The slight figure of Peter Sally get boosted up onto this ledge above the front door of the building. 
EDL	00:31:42,670	00:31:44,180	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah I got onto the overhead. 
EDL	00:31:44,180	00:31:51,180	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You can see that he was on this little overhang and started hanging up banners and the crowd cheered. 
EDL	00:31:51,180	00:32:00,010	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	But the cops were having none of it that day and the police were going to climb up and get him they lodged a few of their up under the overhang and tackled me. 
EDL	00:32:00,010	00:32:03,988	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The police are scrambling, lowered me down in the hands of a dozen cops 
EDL	00:32:03,988	00:32:09,032	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and they had to take him to the police van and the police van is like in the back of the building 
EDL	00:32:09,032	00:32:10,525	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and because of the building, is now surrounded by activists, 
EDL	00:32:10,525	00:32:16,240	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	the only way to get him to the back of the building is to take him through the building. 
EDL	00:32:16,240	00:32:16,610	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:32:16,610	00:32:19,040	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So they handcuffed me behind my back. 
EDL	00:32:19,040	00:32:27,446	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	An officer grabbed my elbow and started pauling me through the first floor building 31 
EDL	00:32:27,446	00:32:35,018	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and as we're going down this wide corridor, I see that familiar white lab coat 
EDL	00:32:35,018	00:32:42,633	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	on that short scientist coming towards me, he had handcuffs behind his back 
EDL	00:32:42,633	00:32:48,510	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and this police officer was taken away and he passed me and he said, Tony, and he goes. 
EDL	00:32:48,510	00:32:51,110	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Peter and Tony said, are you all right, and I said. 
EDL	00:32:51,110	00:32:52,960	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, yeah, just doing my job. 
EDL	00:32:52,960	00:32:53,320	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:32:53,320	00:33:01,490	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	How about you, and he said, well, we're trying to keep operating under these conditions and so good luck with that. 
EDL	00:33:01,490	00:33:08,140	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I will talk tomorrow and I said, okay, Peter, see you later and the cop looked at me like what the hell is going on here? 
EDL	00:33:08,140	00:33:09,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wait, they know each other. 
EDL	00:33:09,840	00:33:20,048	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah and and this is the first little piece of the puzzle in explaining why this action was so different from the ashes action or even the quilt 
EDL	00:33:20,048	00:33:25,120	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and I'm gonna get into that right after this break, radio lab will be back in a moment.

* back
EDL	00:33:56,190	00:34:02,330	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Hi, I'm Lulu Miller and I'm Tracy, hence this is radio lab and today you were talking about well. 
EDL	00:34:02,330	00:34:12,230	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Kind of how you actually make change in the world and doing that by looking at a bunch of different kinds of protests that took place during the AIDS crisis, right. 
EDL	00:34:12,230	00:34:20,860	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And before the break we heard from Dr. Anthony Fauci, who at the time was leading the country's efforts to find a cure for AIDS, 
EDL	00:34:20,860	00:34:27,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and he was actually being targeted by ACT UP because they felt that he was failing the AIDS community 
EDL	00:34:27,840	00:34:32,026	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	with the type of research he was running and when we left off, 
EDL	00:34:32,026	00:34:39,399	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Peter Sally had just been arrested at a protest and as he was being escorted away by officers, 
EDL	00:34:39,399	00:34:44,019	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	they have this you know they ran into each other in the hallways of the NIH 
EDL	00:34:44,019	00:34:51,288	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and then it turns out that this whole time Peter Staley and Dr. Fauci were actually friends 
EDL	00:34:51,288	00:34:58,842	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and you know that surprised the police officers at the time and it also surprised us as we were reporting the story 
EDL	00:34:58,842	00:35:02,920	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	right, and so you were just getting ready to explain how they know each other. 

EDL	00:35:02,920	00:35:03,500	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:35:03,500	00:35:09,010	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yes, and why this particular protest was different from any of the other protests that had come before it. 
EDL	00:35:09,010	00:35:15,800	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So we have to go back to 1988 to that letter that Larry Kramer wrote to Fauci. 
EDL	00:35:15,800	00:35:17,660	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Where he called him a murderer. 
EDL	00:35:17,660	00:35:18,390	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Do you remember that? 
EDL	00:35:18,390	00:35:22,810	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, the whole murderer thing, of course, of course I mean Dr. Fauci she saw that letter he thought. 
EDL	00:35:22,810	00:35:29,820	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	If somebody is that angry to be able to print that in a national newspaper. 
EDL	00:35:29,820	00:35:30,150	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:35:30,150	00:35:35,540	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I mean, I got to find out what is it that has stimulated him to do that. 
EDL	00:35:35,540	00:35:36,480	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:35:36,480	00:35:41,187	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So he just called this guy who called him a murderer called him on the phone and said, 
EDL	00:35:41,187	00:35:49,208	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	let's figure this out and despite their differences, we know we came to a to an agreement that we we both had the same kind of goal. 
EDL	00:35:49,208	00:35:54,020	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, well, I'm I'm I'm really surprised by that because like you know, 
EDL	00:35:54,020	00:35:58,757	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I'm thinking of like the store might be an age protest when people literally have like pictures of your heads on a 
EDL	00:35:58,757	00:36:03,246	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	of your head mistake and saying, you know F U Fauci 
EDL	00:36:03,246	00:36:08,369	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	well, no one was really able to listen to their message because they were too put off 
EDL	00:36:08,369	00:36:17,997	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	by the tactics and I think the thing that I was able to do was to separate the attacks on me 
EDL	00:36:17,997	00:36:26,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	as a symbolic representative of the federal government that they felt was ignoring their needs. 
EDL	00:36:26,840	00:36:27,430	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

* Fauci why you so good

EDL	00:36:27,430	00:36:30,350	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Dr. Fauci, I wonder if I can follow up on that. 
EDL	00:36:30,350	00:36:33,650	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	That's our host Dad Emerald he was sitting in on the interview with Fauci. 
EDL	00:36:33,650	00:36:39,220	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It's a kind of an extraordinary emotional jujitsu (柔术) that you're describing. 
EDL	00:36:39,220	00:36:40,310	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:36:40,310	00:36:46,796	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	People are saying horrible things which could could be read as symbolically about about a person in a role 
EDL	00:36:46,796	00:36:51,591	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	or it could be taken quite personally and you're saying everybody around you is taking it quite personally, 
EDL	00:36:51,591	00:36:55,120	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	but you somehow were able to shift posture. 
EDL	00:36:55,120	00:36:56,240	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:36:56,240	00:36:58,990	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Do you have any recollection of how you did it? 
EDL	00:36:58,990	00:37:08,530	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Like what specifically got you out of defense and into receptive mode, you know, I think it's a complicated thing. 
EDL	00:37:08,530	00:37:08,880	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:37:08,880	00:37:10,540	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It really dates back to my family. 
EDL	00:37:10,540	00:37:15,555	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	My mother and father were very much people who were quite tolerant of different opinions 
EDL	00:37:15,555	00:37:22,154	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and part of not only my background, but the Jesuit training, both in high school and in college 
EDL	00:37:22,154	00:37:33,180	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	is that you care about people no matter who they are and you keep an open mind to opinion, once you become defensive and push back. 
EDL	00:37:33,180	00:37:45,480	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You never hear what their message is and once you listened to what the concern was, I got this feeling that goodness they're right. 
EDL	00:37:45,480	00:37:47,060	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

EDL	00:37:47,060	00:37:53,080	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wow, it is so hard to picture a person in power responding like that today. 
EDL	00:37:53,080	00:37:53,540	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:37:53,540	00:37:57,970	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know, it seems like when someone spits on your face and says awful things about you 
EDL	00:37:57,970	00:38:07,650	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	the main move you see is people screaming back louder or like blocking you on social, not acknowledging or hating back. 
EDL	00:38:07,650	00:38:14,140	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, I mean, there's a part of me like when I hear this story where I'm just like. 
EDL	00:38:14,140	00:38:19,918	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know, that's like a really easy way to make himself look good, but at the same time, you know 
EDL	00:38:19,918	00:38:28,997	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	even me who's like miss Senegal can't deny the fact that that was like a pretty cool move on statues part 
EDL	00:38:28,997	00:38:39,636	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	to turn that moment into a moment for like a conversation and after that initial phone call, 
EDL	00:38:39,636	00:38:46,579	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Larry Kramer actually connected, Dr. Fauci with Peter Staley and a couple of other activists 

EDL	00:38:46,579	00:38:49,250	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Fauci swung his office door open. 
EDL	00:38:49,250	00:38:53,473	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I said it's time for me to put the theatrics aside and listen to what they are saying 
EDL	00:38:53,473	00:39:03,690	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and we had a very healthy back and forth and you know a little while after that, those phone calls turned into dinner parties. 
EDL	00:39:03,690	00:39:13,960	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	These famous dinners we would have with him in Washington sitting down around the dinner table of my deputy at the time, Jim hill, they discussed ideas. 
EDL	00:39:13,960	00:39:20,510	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Strategy, medicine, how we can and continue the dialogue of coming to some common ground. 
EDL	00:39:20,510	00:39:30,430	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And now this is all still before Peter and others stormed the NIH and this is actually where Peter would bring up the list of ACT UP demands like hey Dr. 

EDL	00:39:30,430	00:39:30,790	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:39:30,790	00:39:33,150	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Fauci, could you please pass the salt. 
EDL	00:39:33,150	00:39:37,470	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And also we think that you really need to diverse about your trials. 
EDL	00:39:37,470	00:39:38,060	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:39:38,060	00:39:44,540	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Hey, Dr. Fauci, this pie is so good what you put in it ah but you know what's not good is A T. 
EDL	00:39:44,540	00:39:47,730	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Let's start testing more drugs and Fauci. 

EDL	00:39:47,730	00:39:49,840	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Well, he kind of passed the buck. 
EDL	00:39:49,840	00:39:54,090	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I mean, I had a lot of pushback from my own colleagues in the scientific community. 
EDL	00:39:54,090	00:39:55,760	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	He just had a lot of excuses. 
EDL	00:39:55,760	00:40:02,500	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We were sick of hearing from him tell us for year dinner after dinner after dinner. 
EDL	00:40:02,500	00:40:03,640	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I understand you. 
EDL	00:40:03,640	00:40:11,820	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	I agree with you, but I can't convince the executive committee and we were like screw that Peter and the others were like. 

EDL	00:40:11,820	00:40:15,530	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know what empathy and listening and dinners. 
EDL	00:40:15,530	00:40:16,890	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It's not enough. 
EDL	00:40:16,890	00:40:22,500	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So it was actually at one of these dinners, Peter told Dr. Fauci. 

EDL	00:40:22,500	00:40:25,030	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	So Tony, I got bad news for you in a couple of months. 
EDL	00:40:25,030	00:40:29,780	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We're going to descend on your campus with a massive demonstration to push these issues. 
EDL	00:40:29,780	00:40:31,150	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And what do you say, wait a minute. 
EDL	00:40:31,150	00:40:32,290	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:40:32,290	00:40:38,590	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We're we're sitting here having dinner and sharing a glass of Pino grigio and you're going to storm the NIH. 
EDL	00:40:38,590	00:40:40,750	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	What are you talking about, he tried to talk us out of it. 
EDL	00:40:40,750	00:40:41,360	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	No, I did. 
EDL	00:40:41,360	00:40:41,910	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know, I said,
EDL	00:40:41,910	00:40:48,037	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Peter, are are you sure that this is going to be a productive thing at play that he needed a little more time. 
EDL	00:40:48,037	00:40:52,396	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And and we said, well, you got a couple months and I said, okay, fine. 
EDL	00:40:52,396	00:40:53,101	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Thanks an awful lot 

EDL	00:40:53,101	00:40:59,950	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	a couple of months later, thousand people show up to his door with his head on a spike.

EDL	00:41:00,790	00:41:01,820	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah well, what happened? 
EDL	00:41:01,820	00:41:05,290	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	What did happen with it was the tons of did the media pick it up. 
EDL	00:41:05,290	00:41:10,425	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	There was a lot of media attention and thanks to Peter's colored smoke bombs, 
EDL	00:41:10,425	00:41:13,460	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	it actually did make the front page of a couple of newspapers. 
EDL	00:41:13,460	00:41:14,010	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:41:14,010	00:41:18,090	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	A lot of the media attention was not sympathetic. 
EDL	00:41:18,090	00:41:22,990	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	It was just like look at these pathetic look at these crazies who showed up at the NIH. 
EDL	00:41:22,990	00:41:31,717	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Okay, but the thing that makes this protest different from the ashes action or even the quilt is that they were 
EDL	00:41:31,717	00:41:37,120	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	saying [beep] you to somebody who was actually sympathetic to them 
EDL	00:41:37,120	00:41:43,770	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	that demonstration was more about putting him between a rock and a hard place. 
EDL	00:41:43,770	00:41:49,280	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We were the rock and the hard place was the executive committee of the ACTG. 

EDL	00:41:49,280	00:42:00,000	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	This was about giving Fauci a very public boot in the ass we wanted to politically difficult for them to ignore him and us. 
EDL	00:42:00,000	00:42:09,017	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	And so he got squeezed by ACT UP and that squeezed was apparently exactly what he needed because he did kind of what we were hoping he do. 
EDL	00:42:09,017	00:42:17,440	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	He pushed the ACTG. harder and within a few months of that demonstration the ACTG executive committee caved. 
EDL	00:42:17,440	00:42:23,420	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They got pretty much everything they wanted true like on that list. 
EDL	00:42:23,420	00:42:31,070	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They got it all yeah ACTG team decided to open up all of their committee activists and other people with AIDS were added to the panels. 
EDL	00:42:31,070	00:42:33,380	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	We got voting membership on the executive committee. 
EDL	00:42:33,380	00:42:38,120	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They did diversify the people that they were testing. 
EDL	00:42:38,120	00:42:46,587	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They did begin to start testing drugs that were in AZT and we started to reformat and refocus the clinical trials 
EDL	00:42:46,587	00:42:49,850	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and the conducting of clinical trials towards HIV AIDS. 
EDL	00:42:49,850	00:42:51,120	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They got they got what they needed. 
EDL	00:42:51,120	00:42:51,830	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:42:51,830	00:42:56,880	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Wow, yeah, that is so not a story I feel like you ever hear. 

EDL	00:42:56,880	00:43:11,889	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yeah, but to be clear, the storm be an NIH action happens in 1990s it wasn't until 1996 that they actually had the drug cocktail 
EDL	00:43:11,889	00:43:16,064	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	that was giving people living with AIDS a much longer life 
EDL	00:43:16,064	00:43:26,112	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and so it was actually after the storm DNA age action that Larry Kramer was giving these angry speeches about how desperate the situation was 
EDL	00:43:26,112	00:43:31,420	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and David and Alexis thrown their loved ones ashes on the White House lawn. 
EDL	00:43:31,420	00:43:32,050	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:43:32,050	00:43:37,254	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	But that happened after storm the NIH and yeah, you know 
EDL	00:43:37,254	00:43:43,369	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	you can certainly point to the ashes action and other political funerals 
EDL	00:43:43,369	00:43:50,930	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	that ACT UP did during that time period as, like, you know, not being as effective as storm the NIH, 
EDL	00:43:50,930	00:43:58,990	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	but when the situation is so dire and things are so dark and people are so desperate 

EDL	00:43:58,990	00:44:04,111	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	maybe that moment called for a different kind of demonstration 

* Alexandra

EDL	00:44:04,111	00:44:08,960	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	that is exactly right and this is me as a media scholar talking rather radical one.

EDL	00:44:32,000	00:44:35,320	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	There was an organization at this time that I knew called AIDS films, 
EDL	00:44:35,320	00:44:40,502	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and they made a number of short narratives, highly polished films, 
EDL	00:44:40,502	00:44:46,780	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and those were definitely changed mind kind of films 'cause they were they were feel good.

EDL	00:44:47,390	00:44:51,766	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	They looked familiar now that's a reasonable goal, 
EDL	00:44:51,766	00:44:59,090	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	but I'm not sure that stop the church or the ashes action or political funerals. 
EDL	00:44:59,090	00:45:01,170	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	The goal is to change someone's mind.

EDL	00:45:12,490	00:45:19,980	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Those actions by ACT UP were to express defiance and to put defiance on the map.

EDL	00:45:20,410	00:45:26,800	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	You know she was like protest is about like making sure that this thing is never going to go away 
EDL	00:45:26,800	00:45:34,013	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and I kind of had like a moment like that cause I was talking on the phone with a friend 
EDL	00:45:34,013	00:45:42,080	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and all of a sudden I was I heard outside my window say his name George Floyd and part of me was like, again?

EDL	00:45:45,860	00:45:52,278	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	Yes, I should say that where I live like they were protests almost every day during the summer 
EDL	00:45:52,278	00:45:56,331	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and so I had actually gone a few months without hearing any 
EDL	00:45:56,331	00:46:03,290	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and then it was happening outside my window and and I did have that reaction and then I was like, wait. 
EDL	00:46:03,290	00:46:07,079	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	What am I annoyed with, what am I really annoyed with 
EDL	00:46:07,079	00:46:10,963	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	and I realized like what I'm really annoyed with is the fact that 
EDL	00:46:10,963	00:46:17,140	| The Ashes on the Lawn |	another black man was killed in Philadelphia and that's why the protest was happening again.
