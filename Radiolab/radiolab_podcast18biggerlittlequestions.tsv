EDL	00:00:02,048	00:00:02,816	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Are you awake
EDL	00:00:07,168	00:00:10,496	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Northern listening to Radiolab
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:15,616	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Radio WNYC
EDL	00:00:19,712	00:00:24,576	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay ready 3-2-1 hey time Jedi been wrought iron rubber College this is Radiolab
EDL	00:00:24,576	00:00:29,952	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And this is part two of our attempt to answer some listener questions that are piled up over the years
EDL	00:00:30,464	00:00:33,792	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Gathering digital dust in our inbox
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Come from kind of close to home
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:39,680	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Starting us off this round is a question ask her
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:41,216	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Who has developed
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:44,544	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Quite a reputation here at Radiolab
EDL	00:00:45,056	00:00:47,104	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Scott little
EDL	00:00:47,104	00:00:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm just a normal dude man Scott spoke to our producer a lot of Nasser
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:59,904	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Send us a lot of questions that got her attention they don't they don't stop I can't slow this brand on it
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:06,304	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I truly do not even remember like writing why is the moon
EDL	00:01:06,304	00:01:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We seriously not translated any animal language is yet is there a reason coconuts look a lot like she pansy
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He had just a coincidence
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:22,432	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Zeroed in on one of Scott's questions that at first seemed kind of simple but it got really
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,456	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Ibig
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:25,504	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When a space shuttle goes into space
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	How do they make sure it doesn't hit any satellite
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:29,856	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is it chest radar
EDL	00:01:29,856	00:01:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is there some kind of complicated cyst in the tracks all of them in and since we talked it's kind of looking at the bow
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	About that she know about like how many satellites are Acts
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,352	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The up there
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:42,912	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What are we even calling space junkins
EDL	00:01:42,912	00:01:45,472	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And has this affected anything
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah
EDL	00:01:46,240	00:01:50,848	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You know it's just like it it goes from like kind of informational to like
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:54,432	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Almost like this sort of Doom and Gloom real fast like
EDL	00:01:54,432	00:01:59,808	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	There's so much junk up there like it's going to be impossible to leave the Earth's atmosphere pretty soon
EDL	00:01:59,808	00:02:02,112	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And I don't know I just it just kind of
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:05,184	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'll be curious to see what what
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:10,816	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Who's who's in charge of all this that's what I want to know
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:15,168	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay is everybody there
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,264	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Willing to talk to you about space surveillance
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,288	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes I'm here
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:24,640	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So I couldn't actually find anyone who is literally in charge of space
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:31,040	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But I did find what I think is pretty much the next best thing on the commander of the 18th space control
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:37,440	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I think your title has got to be the coolest title of anyone I've ever interviewed
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:43,840	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The commander of the 18th space control Squadron
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:49,216	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Amazing
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:54,336	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay so so let's start from the top when the space shuttle goes in the space how do they make sure it doesn't hit any satellites
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We keep track of wood called the space catalog of all the man-made stuff
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,016	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Surrounding Us in outer space
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:08,416	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A little over 23,000 objects whenever there's a launch anything mad or unmanned
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,952	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We'll track it again
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Disgusting things in catalog and will make sure that it doesn't hit anything on the way out
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Up there and then
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:21,216	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If there is a chance of an actual Collision they send out an alert
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:24,544	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The notifications we create are called conjunction data messages
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,872	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Send several thousand of those everyday
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:35,808	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Thousands we have a more refined what we call emergency criteria
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:38,624	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Between 6 and 10 of those per day
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:45,536	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That's a good that's a lot but when you consider retracting 23,000 objects
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But on top of those 23000 object
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:55,008	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It turns out there's there's even more stuff out there
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,544	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But she says it's basically just
EDL	00:03:56,544	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Too small to be able to track
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:03,456	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We think that they're probably more like a half a million close to half-a-million on
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:06,528	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What's you have like almost none of them
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:10,624	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It sounds like that but just remember that some of those
EDL	00:04:10,624	00:04:17,024	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Frost 500,000 objects are very very tiny pieces of debris
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:20,351	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah what are we talkin about
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But the paint so there's no way you can track like
EDL	00:04:24,959	00:04:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Half a million flexor pain that feels like
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Stop feels like impossible
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,199	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Metal window
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,735	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That was hit by a flock of pain
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:42,111	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And the kind of damage that it can do moving and tell me what kind of
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Speed what what
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:45,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah what would I see if I saw that picture
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:50,303	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Several layers of the shuttle window and they determined that it was from a Fleck of paint
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm just you know what tiny flag
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,679	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So you got almost half a million pieces of the
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Itty bitty space junk
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Keeping our fingers crossed
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:01,823	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Monitoring the situation
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm so we can react to it if something happened
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What's up when I when I called this listener he's like
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:12,831	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	She's a little bit
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Paranoid
EDL	00:05:15,135	00:05:21,279	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I think it's called the
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The Kessler
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,351	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Syndrome that what it is
EDL	00:05:24,351	00:05:25,631	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The castle
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That's what it is
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:31,007	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	NASA scientist got this thing named after him
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Bernese like we might get to a point where we have so much stuff in space
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:35,871	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That like
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,175	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Something will collide with
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:44,063	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Wait like two satellites will collide and that Collision will cause so much debris but it will basically be like this
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:49,951	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Giant thing we're just like things are just exploding around the earth for like years and years and years.
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Some sort of locust plague
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Space Jam
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Swarmed with a locust plague of space junk
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And that it'll be impossible to leave the Earth's atmosphere anytime soon
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,519	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What would you say to Scott
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,711	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This is Steve
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,991	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We have
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We have a job to
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Attractive object
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A question like that
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:23,231	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is this kind of out of our realm of responsibility
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,351	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And just let me ask another question then tell me
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,655	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If you can answer it that's fine too
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:34,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Which isn't he also brought up something called the keslow effect
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,287	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Do you know about that or have you heard of that before
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,663	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Which is which is the idea that
EDL	00:06:41,663	00:06:45,247	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	There's a possibility that two satellites will collide and then milk
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:47,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Create debris and an idol
EDL	00:06:47,295	00:06:49,855	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Make a domino effect and cause all kinds of other
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:51,647	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Collisions and then it'll be
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,951	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Ahold giant debris field
EDL	00:06:55,999	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm sure we've heard of it the Kepler effect
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:02,143	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okcastle are sorry about that
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:04,191	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And is that something you worry about or no
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,383	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Hello
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:16,991	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Hello hello
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I guess it is a concern
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,647	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Her butt
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:30,303	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The members of the Squadron do such a great job tracking everything that's up there that we would hope that that wouldn't happen
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I thought nothing nothing but the answer I was hoping for started this whole thing
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:42,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Thinking that
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Scott Speer was like kind of crazy but then after that conversation I started
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:48,479	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah researching it for real and I
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Online I found this video of Kessler himself there was a general attitude
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:08:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The space was a big sky that you can put anything in it that you wanted and not fill it up to the problem that you quickly running
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:08,191	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He basically says exactly the way we operate in space all this results in exponentially
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:14,591	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Free until all objects are reduced to a cloud of orbiting fragments that are capable of destroying any
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:17,919	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Spacecraft the 10th operate anywhere within that cloud
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:20,479	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Which would mean no satellites
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:23,807	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The weather satellites no GPS satellites and then
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,135	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In the future if things go really badly
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,975	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You know we just be
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:31,487	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Stuck here
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Forever
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,047	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Andeavor
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,071	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	On Earth
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Our next question comes from the sky in Brooklyn and he is
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,823	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That would be fine
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:47,871	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	5 years old
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:50,175	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And I interviewed him
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Dad are going to go in my kitchen
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:54,527	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Who r u t g
EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:55,551	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And I'm your son
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:57,343	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay tell me your question
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,391	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The question is
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,951	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What's Earth color
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,999	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Why is the earth called Earth
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,791	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I don't know why
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Give any guesses
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,191	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Just came up with the name
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The Earth came up with its own name
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I think
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,847	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Should I find out and then tell you
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:26,271	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	My first stop was a guy named Peter Peter Barry
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:28,319	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Isotope geochemistry I work at the
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,367	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The University of Oxford
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,135	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	My research
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Am I right that you have some kind of loose affiliation with NASA is that is that not right
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,303	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In a sense that I mean I do a little bit of
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:39,327	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Planetary work I've worked
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,119	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Lunar samples
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,167	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In the past but you work on lunar samples
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes I've actually done some
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,495	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Isotope work on
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,567	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's actually one of the few people on the planet who
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Held the Moon
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:51,615	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In his hand
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,431	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So here's my question I think it's pretty simple but maybe there's a
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:54,943	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The story there I don't know
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:56,479	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Question comes from
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Tej via me his dad
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Why is the earth called the Earth
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,855	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Well that's that's a really in
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Question the Earth is actually so this is
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And it's in
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In Old Saxon
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Derive from

EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And of course all these
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,775	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	All these words are originally drive from
EDL	00:10:20,543	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A mother language
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	An endo your

EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:26,175	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What it means in German and what it means and all those old languages
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,455	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Actually just means
EDL	00:10:27,455	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Soil or
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Ground
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,551	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	All the other
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,831	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Planets all visible
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:34,367	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Have these really
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:35,647	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Awesome name
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	They're all named after Roman god
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I mean you have
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Mercury
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,167	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The move really quickly around the Sun
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So it got its name from the Roman messenger god then you have
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Venus
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Does this Bright Beautiful or blowing in the sky
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,455	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So we named it after the goddess of love
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,271	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Of course Mars
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,319	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Which was fiery and red
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,135	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And so we named after the God of War
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:07,903	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Earth is the only
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:10,463	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Planet which is it named after
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A Roman god
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He clearly has
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:13,535	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This much different
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,583	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Etymology
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:19,679	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Peter ultimately referred me to another guy.
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:23,519	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Classify the game please
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:28,127	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I speak and yeah this is Gabriel Berry
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	To the price of indo-europeans probably were sure
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Proto proto-indo-european
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:38,879	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes so it's so basically that what Gabriel Berry told me is that you could
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:43,743	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You could trace all this whole thing the word or back to this
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,791	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Group of people who lived in a day
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,631	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This is like way before JC way before
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	For the Greeks or the Romans
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The proto-indo-european
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,471	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Lived in
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,031	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Especially what's now Eastern Europe

EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:00,895	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Don't know a lot about them
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We know they moved around a lot
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:07,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	People couldn't for whatever reason settle down at some point maybe about
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	5000 years ago

EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:28,287	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Imagine This
EDL	00:12:28,287	00:12:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This wave of people on Horseback spreading
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	All over Europe in an India and
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Speaking this language they would ultimately Branch out into English and German and French and Hindi and Portuguese and
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,319	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	400 some odd language
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Spread across Europe

EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Settle down
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,863	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And that's when they start spending a lot of time
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,143	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Looking down at the dirt
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:55,679	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We have lots of words for founding
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Plow
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,847	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Or as in the world that would become Earth
EDL	00:13:03,615	00:13:05,407	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Evidence that early point adjustment dirt
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:07,455	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And presumably adjustment like

EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,319	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But this specific
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,087	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Little
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,855	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Piece of dirt
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:15,135	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Right here
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Then I'm plowing
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's somewhere along the way
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:25,631	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That word
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:26,911	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Herta
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,983	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Became the word for Alder
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:33,311	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The whole ball of dirt
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,103	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Basically the word that starts Benji
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:36,895	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It comes
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:38,431	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Same word
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:39,967	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Beautiful then
EDL	00:13:39,967	00:13:42,015	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And also
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:43,551	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Quite often
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,159	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We have no idea when that

EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	May we know within a

EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,191	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That strikes me as a pretty important moment for us people
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:03,263	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Can I ask some questions
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:06,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When did you discover the Earth was a planet
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:12,735	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Don't know really what did you discover do you remember when you when you learned
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:13,759	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If the Earth was a ball
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When

EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:32,863	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	By the time we get from the Proto Indo Europeans to the ancient Greeks and Romans
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,887	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Couple thousand years
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:37,215	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You begin to see the concept of Earth rising up
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:40,799	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It goes from a simple word that means dirt or soil
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,615	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	To Mother Earth
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:45,407	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The goddess
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,479	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So it went in the opposite direction of the other planets
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:56,159	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It started as lowly dirty thing beneath our feet and then became divine

EDL	00:16:49,407	00:16:55,807	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What does he know that I mean

EDL	00:17:33,183	00:17:35,231	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	As a user Simon Tyler and his dad
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:38,815	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So a couple weeks back
EDL	00:17:38,815	00:17:40,607	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm just heading out of town now
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I asked my old man my dad to record himself going on a drive
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:52,639	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	All good road trips deserve, coffee and being approved
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:59,039	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Individual but I am I decided that a drive-through at McDonald's would be the appropriate
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:05,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He and my mom live in Northwestern Wisconsin in a small Lil
EDL	00:18:05,439	00:18:07,231	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Little city town called auclair
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Going to drive
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Country Roads
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:16,703	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In specifically what would I ask him to do was to go drive on the county highways just outside of town
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,471	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Passing
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Farm field areas there are very few cars on the road that I'm on
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:27,711	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The reason I asked him to do this was because for as long as I can remember
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He's had this nagging
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:30,783	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Question
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A question that he bombard me with every time I'm home off times when were talking
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:40,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	On the phone he'll bring it up by 9
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:45,375	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Can you hear me yeah that's the dinner table over email I mean I've heard about this at least
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,399	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	600 *
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What does Mom think about all this I've never asked her
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,519	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	She just rolls her eyes
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,895	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,431	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah so what happened
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:03,807	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So do you want me to tell you why why I'm recording or do you want me to I knew we would get
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:08,671	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So you can tell me now I thought maybe it was going to be like that I had
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:10,207	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Figure out
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:14,559	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Let me let me just prompt you with this and see it see how well you take the bait here
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:18,399	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Do you know the question I'm talking about and could you just
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,447	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Tell me what that question is
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:23,775	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Question is
EDL	00:19:24,799	00:19:27,615	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Well let me back up an example is this
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:31,711	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A person will be riding a road bike
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:34,271	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Down a lonely Country Road
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:37,087	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Two other people
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,159	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Will be walking their dog on the side of
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	10 days
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Semi-trailer truck
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:47,839	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Will then be coming down that road
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay so we've got three different actors here
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And nobody else for miles and miles and
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:55,007	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And there is not at you having
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,311	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The biker hasn't seen another car
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:20:00,127	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Or pedestrian
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,919	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	4 miles on this road
EDL	00:20:02,943	00:20:04,991	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But what will happen is
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	All
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:09,343	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Three of those actors will come together
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	At the exact same point in the exact same time
EDL	00:20:14,719	00:20:17,791	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Creating a dangerous situation first of all
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,327	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But then it's just
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,887	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And then it diffuses
EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:27,263	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And you could sit on that stretch of road for six more years
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,799	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Cannot find that app
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:31,359	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And the key thing here my dad says is
EDL	00:20:31,359	00:20:32,895	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Kia Tim Adler
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When is this sort of thing
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:37,247	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Give me a lot all the time
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,783	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I would say it happens
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,831	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Once every two weeks
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Upcoming we have the possibility of an event
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:48,511	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	On the day I sent him to record himself
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:52,607	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	After 10 or 15 minutes of not seeing a single other car on the road
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,423	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Cam'ron this band there's a manure wagon
EDL	00:20:55,423	00:20:56,959	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Being driven by a tractor
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,543	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Right down the road and yes
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:02,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We are here at all happens
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:05,151	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The manure wagon is going down the road
EDL	00:21:05,663	00:21:12,063	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Attractor has just pulled out on the road and now I'm passing by
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,623	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And all three happened at the event
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Same place it just happened
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,744	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What is your
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:24,352	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Question then is it why does that happen or is it a question is
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Why
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,960	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Does this happen to me
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:33,568	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Does it seem to happen to others as well
EDL	00:21:38,432	00:21:42,016	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:45,856	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Take it to the bottom of this we called her man who he thought might just have been
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:52,768	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm by Professor MSU Professor David Spiegel
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,536	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Does that mean you've been knighted
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:22:01,472	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You're a knight you're the you're the first night I've ever spoken to

EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When I ran my old man questioned by his response
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:20,672	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	People contact me and they get very anxious
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:27,072	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Because they feel it something's going on in their lives but making things happen all the time they're getting signs from the environment

EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:03,680	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Something beyond the normal rules of

EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,872	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Wasn't very good statistician
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:12,640	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Because
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:19,040	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Sir David says when you start to look at the events in our lives in terms of their probability every single event.
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,856	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Unbelievably unlikely and unpredictable
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:25,440	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Soak the crucial thing that measures it for the surprising
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:28,256	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is the unlikeness of it occurring
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:30,560	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	At some point over a reasonable period
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:34,400	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And just I don't know I'm trying to make this as concrete as possible so
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,704	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Good luck so if you're driving down the street
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:37,984	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah that has I don't know

EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:48,736	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah yeah likely is it that over the course of those 10 miles you're going to intersect at the way that he does
EDL	00:23:48,736	00:23:51,040	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The likelihood of that happening any

EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,624	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is very loud
EDL	00:23:54,624	00:23:55,392	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's a surprising event
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But if your father drives a lot
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,512	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The likelihood of it happening over
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:01,792	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I didn't make a week
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:02,560	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	2 weeks
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,328	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Suleiman
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:04,352	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is very high
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	David says think of it this way
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:12,288	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Let's say my dad would consider one of these intersections to be a meaningful coincidence
EDL	00:24:12,800	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Synchronous event
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,640	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If a semi truck in a biker pass him
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Within five seconds of each other
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,040	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Now
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:26,112	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If in 1 hour of driving my dad sees say
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,160	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	15 cars
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,696	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	5 biker
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:33,792	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The map tells you that the likelihood of one of each or both
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The car in the bike passing him in the same 5 Second window
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:39,680	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is about 1 in 7,000
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,216	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:46,336	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Think of how many of those 5 Second Windows there are in any given week or month
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:50,944	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In fact think of each of these 5 Second Windows as like
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:53,248	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	One spin of a roulette wheel
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:56,832	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Giant roulette wheel with
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	7000 different numbers that you could bet the ball would land. But
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,024	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This is Keith
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:11,424	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When my dad's driving it's not like he only gets one spin of the wheel for one chance to see
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	See one of these synchronous events
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Instead it's like every 5 seconds he gets to try again
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:22,432	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Given that he drives like 3 hours a week
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,224	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When you do the math
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:28,320	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What you end up with is a 31% chance
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A-Team experiencing Mis in any given week
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,696	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Meaning if he's looking for it
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He should definitely expect to see one of these
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,280	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	At least once a
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:39,072	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So you have to
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Not look at just the Avenger not just
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:43,424	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The particular thing your father exist
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:45,472	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You have to think all the time
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	For those things because it didn't
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:50,336	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You know you got to think of all the stuff you're not singing
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:50,848	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	How are you
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:53,408	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Pretty good fish
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:56,224	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Quite the fish if you'd like its Third cast
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:58,784	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Call my dad back
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:00,320	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	To break the news to
EDL	00:26:00,320	00:26:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	All right you want the answer
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,136	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes
EDL	00:26:03,648	00:26:04,160	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:11,072	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We can explain it to him from the history of Yuan to the fact that he's really just got to pay attention to all the times these coincidences
EDL	00:26:11,072	00:26:11,840	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Aren't happening
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,400	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Right and when you look at it from that angle it's
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,936	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Statistically to be expected
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,472	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	There
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:18,752	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I understand
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,568	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I understand
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's a little hard to swallow
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:27,968	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm a Little More Union than most
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,528	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It it does make sense
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	From a statistical analysis
EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:34,880	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But why does it
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Happening to me
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:40,512	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So these things do happen to some people
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:45,632	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Because your friend so sick right now. It doesn't happen to people who are very sensitive
EDL	00:26:45,632	00:26:50,496	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Underwear and then notice their environment they're pretty mindful people that happens to
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:54,080	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I was just what I'm saying is this is a real admirable
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,848	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Your characteristics
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Well there's no question this makes my day when I've heard that I've been

EDL	00:27:19,936	00:27:21,984	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I think I would say that
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:23,008	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He's not very special
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:31,712	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You didn't really have
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,224	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Tell me that

EDL	00:29:57,120	00:29:57,888	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Brilliant
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:30:00,448	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When a kid you know did something
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,800	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:06,592	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	How do they do that
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,640	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:12,224	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A kid you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:14,784	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Or maybe the kid was a piano
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:18,880	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,928	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Or maybe the kids in math class
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:23,744	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Are ready music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We're interested in the
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,584	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Epic moments where

EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:31,680	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It doesn't have anything to do with it

EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:11,104	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Boston-area still in box
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:11,872	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In today
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:12,896	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Kind of relevant today
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:15,968	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The question is is something of a snowboard
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:19,552	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Snowboarding for 20 plus years or so
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,088	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Friends and I OST

EDL	00:31:25,696	00:31:31,328	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah and you know a mini years back on one of these group trips they took
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And I
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,912	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Recently opened a
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:35,680	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Don't you mean course
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,496	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And by the way that tiny
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That's a producer Tracy hunt
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And then another friend jumped in and said I bet you I can get that up to like a hundred miles an hour easily from the top of the mountain
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:54,368	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	No way
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:55,904	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You couldn't even do that in purpose
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Addition

EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:03,584	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	From there and I was in 2004
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:11,520	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Going on for more than a decade and over these 10 years going back and forth in the back and forth on this question

EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,128	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What's up
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	An event
EDL	00:32:17,408	00:32:19,712	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	They came on this very specific wording
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:21,248	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So the question is
EDL	00:32:21,760	00:32:23,296	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In perfect condition
EDL	00:32:23,296	00:32:26,624	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Within the Earth's atmosphere and I was in the back
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:28,160	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Can you read
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:30,976	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	100 miles per hour going down a mountain
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,256	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:32,768	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And everyday
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Like an inner tube
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's the same thing that you get if you went to a local hardware store
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Nothing fancy nothing
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,448	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Andover the engineer
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And still to this day some of Evans friends are like yeah we can break a hundred miles an hour we can
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,176	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It happened he says no
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:51,200	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Cannot do that
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But I think it can happen
EDL	00:32:54,016	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I think you can happen
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:57,088	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That is Destin Sandlin host
EDL	00:32:59,136	00:33:05,536	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Of an extremely popular YouTube channel called
EDL	00:33:05,536	00:33:09,632	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Important smartereveryday cuz he is very smart on his channel but Destiny does
EDL	00:33:10,144	00:33:11,424	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is he proposes
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:13,472	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So you probably observed that cats
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:15,264	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Almost always land on their feet
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,032	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Questions
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:16,544	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Today's question
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:17,824	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is why
EDL	00:33:17,824	00:33:20,896	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Questions a lot like Evans Wiki then proceeds to answer
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,920	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	GGG
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:27,296	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I think that's in your also an actual rocket scientist
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:33,440	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I've only I've only said that one time my mom corrected me very quickly she's what
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:35,232	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	They know
EDL	00:33:35,744	00:33:42,144	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm what's called a flight test engineer so we test missiles and helicopters and stuff like that
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:43,936	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	How do you say one thing before we start
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:48,032	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I feel like before we jump to the answering part of this
EDL	00:33:48,032	00:33:48,800	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Conversate
EDL	00:33:48,800	00:33:51,616	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I want to appreciate what was the question
EDL	00:33:51,616	00:33:54,688	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm wondering is there some like physical
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:33:57,760	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Are there some physical reasons why a hundred would be really hard to do
EDL	00:33:57,760	00:33:59,808	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In an inner tube down a hill
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So this is what I thought about when I first heard the quest
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:05,696	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So if you think about going down a hill
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:08,000	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	There's two things that are slowing you down
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:10,048	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The first one is the friction with the snow
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,096	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In the second one is the era's
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:14,656	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Which progestin all boils down to something to eat
EDL	00:34:15,168	00:34:15,680	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Drag
EDL	00:34:17,216	00:34:20,800	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	1/2 times the density of the air coefficient of drag
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:24,384	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So this started as a really simple question in my mind
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:26,176	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	NSI started
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:27,712	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Gaming out how to
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:34,368	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	How to do this without killing the person the more I thought about it the more I realized it can get very very calm
EDL	00:34:35,136	00:34:38,464	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah I can I can show you all those equations
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,768	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But I can't work them out on the back of neck
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:42,304	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Mostly because
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:43,584	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Math is hard
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:48,448	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Still he did tell us that he could he was pretty confident that he could get this
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,520	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Tube to go down more than a hundred miles an hour.
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:54,080	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes I'm saying that it can happen
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:56,896	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Are we sure that somebody hasn't done this
EDL	00:34:56,896	00:34:59,968	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And posted like their GoPro video on YouTube
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:02,016	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Well I guinness world record
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,808	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Oh gravity
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,320	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Powered snow
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:10,976	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Well what is it what what's the what's the world record
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:14,560	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay so at this moment Destin's wife Tara Sandlin
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:19,680	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	She's in the studio cuz she's with him on vacation in New York and she's been looking at her iPhone
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,984	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Epi Guinness World Records website
EDL	00:35:21,984	00:35:23,776	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Gravity powered snow sled
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:29,920	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	134 km per hour
EDL	00:35:30,944	00:35:31,968	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	3.5 under
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:39,648	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Remedy power questioning everything about what I believe
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:44,768	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A sled is meant for velocity of two business values faster
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:48,608	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Omani miles an hour
EDL	00:35:48,608	00:35:50,912	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Would you slow here so so here's the deal
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:54,496	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm different than most people I I'm not going to die in this Foxhole
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's clear that I'm wrong
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:03,968	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I would go with this this is what I would do
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:06,528	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The real thing that the tube
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,320	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Causes of problem in my mind is
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:10,112	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	All the friction on the
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,136	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	On the mountain
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:12,928	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Right so I mean
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:14,976	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Within the balance of the question because he
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:18,048	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He went to all these Great Links to Define what we could do and what we couldn't
EDL	00:36:18,048	00:36:19,072	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He did not
EDL	00:36:19,072	00:36:21,376	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Tell us what slope the mountain had to be on
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:25,984	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And so what we're going to do is work and go to the worst possible Mountain imaginable witches
EDL	00:36:25,984	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Straight down
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A cliff basically
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:31,616	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay are we all on the party line
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:33,152	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And so with the help of producer Tracy
EDL	00:36:33,152	00:36:34,944	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Evan
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:36,992	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And in Destin
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:37,760	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Can you hear me
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:41,088	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Do you want to Devin the questionnaire to hear what how death is going to work.
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:43,136	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This thing out good we're all together
EDL	00:36:43,136	00:36:44,928	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	To break the ice with answers are
EDL	00:36:44,928	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah so this is ultimately a question about terminal velocity
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,280	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Rewrite
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:50,816	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In theory
EDL	00:36:50,816	00:36:51,840	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If we were to
EDL	00:36:52,352	00:36:53,632	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Go straight down
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:54,912	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Like
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:55,424	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Out of an airplane
EDL	00:36:56,704	00:36:58,240	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We would go as fast as we can
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,544	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Can ever go because the only thing contributing to the
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The terminal blocks
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:01,824	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	See that point
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:02,848	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Would be dry
EDL	00:37:03,360	00:37:04,384	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	No friction
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:06,176	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I don't know you what would you do
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:10,528	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Except the answer if I'm able to go a hundred miles per hour straight down out of an airplane
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:11,040	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	For example
EDL	00:37:12,064	00:37:13,600	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Would you say that it is pause
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:15,136	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Maybe you even if our
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:17,696	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah even if our Hill is only
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,720	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	1 degree
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:21,536	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Off of in a straight down towards the Earth that still counts as a
EDL	00:37:21,536	00:37:22,304	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Alright
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:24,608	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah I guess so
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,424	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah as long as it's going downhill in the Earth
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:34,080	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah I want to call I got a buddy named Paul here in Alabama he owns a place called
EDL	00:37:34,080	00:37:35,104	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Skydive Alabama
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,896	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I go to church within the same all the time
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:43,040	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And I think he became so distant like I don't know like
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:45,600	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Seaway call him from your phone or something is that what you
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:46,880	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What you think going to try to do
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:47,904	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,440	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Paul reset Her Go
EDL	00:37:51,232	00:37:53,280	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What's up man are you ready for me to merge you
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:57,888	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Alright Paul you there
EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:04,288	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Hi Paul how's it going and we have Evan who had those who had this crazy question about snow tubing
EDL	00:38:04,288	00:38:10,688	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay
EDL	00:38:10,688	00:38:12,480	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When's the whole inner tube thing in a toaster
EDL	00:38:12,480	00:38:15,552	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Suspend Pollak we want to know if you could jump out of a plane go straight
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Could you break a hundred miles per hour barrier
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:20,928	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is that safe can you do a test like that
EDL	00:38:22,720	00:38:24,768	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah it is totally possible I've done it
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:27,072	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What weight
EDL	00:38:28,352	00:38:29,632	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You done it with an inner tube
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:33,984	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Absolutely.
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:39,872	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Closest two different occasions he in a bunch of friend jumped out of an airplane
EDL	00:38:39,872	00:38:43,456	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Carrying an inflatable flotation device in one hand
EDL	00:38:43,456	00:38:48,832	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I watch a little computer to track their speed on the other side it how fast did you go
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:52,928	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In both cases it was over a hundred
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Really
EDL	00:38:58,304	00:39:04,704	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The same it's as if it's as if he has a virtual Mountain
EDL	00:39:04,704	00:39:10,848	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He jumped off the question specifically said on the mountain that these guys have been arguing about this for a decade
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:17,504	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We're going to come back to them and be like noon or just drop out of an airplane
EDL	00:39:19,040	00:39:25,440	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	True or false and that's where you go to law school you and stuff like that what did you read the question I am now
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:28,000	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I hereby recusing myself from this whole affair
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,536	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Do we have we have we have ceased
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You truly in good faith answer the question and furthermore we get the guy on the phone
EDL	00:39:35,936	00:39:42,336	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Phone and we Hoodwink him into accepting a renegotiated contract.
EDL	00:39:42,336	00:39:47,200	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I am I would not be a party to this
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,072	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Hangzhou
EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:48,896	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Tell us where we're going next eat so the next one is
EDL	00:40:48,896	00:40:51,712	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	From our producer Annie McEwen hello
EDL	00:40:51,712	00:40:52,736	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Any
EDL	00:40:52,736	00:40:53,504	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Dad
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:58,112	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So what are we going to be talking about to question you bring us
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:41:02,464	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay so this one is a little bit different
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Because it didn't come in from a question came in the form of a very tantalizing email
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,888	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	From a fellow named iron Hendricks
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,424	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Iron Henry
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:14,240	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	From Amsterdam high iron
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes it's me and he's basically said ham iron I'm an artist and it just want you already left to know that me and my friend
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:23,456	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We are building a building and island of fat
EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:26,016	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And Island
EDL	00:41:26,016	00:41:31,136	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah I know a couple of all the things to build an island out of wife at
EDL	00:41:31,136	00:41:36,768	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm just fascinated by it I just like thinking about it that made you start
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:42,656	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Looking at fat in a curious way what was the moment
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:47,520	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A friend of mine and Mike Thompson and we are in a train
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:48,544	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Going to Amsterdam
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Are you feeling fat or what what what
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:41:59,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We're weird guys
EDL	00:41:59,807	00:42:04,159	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Great joke about things like this like the chips
EDL	00:42:04,159	00:42:10,559	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Ray Wise or something and then we started talking about how in the English newspapers that has been this news
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:12,095	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Stories about pepper
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:16,191	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Stop birds that are under the ground in the sewers of London just like wreaking havoc
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And there was one
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's actually in the Oxford dictionary since 2015 is sick an actual word
EDL	00:42:25,407	00:42:31,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	How fat burgundy Iceberg look like
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:35,647	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Well I mean like a sort of Imagine Iceberg I guess but this one's floating on the water
EDL	00:42:36,159	00:42:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In the tunnels Underground in London
EDL	00:42:38,207	00:42:39,743	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And is made entirely of
EDL	00:42:40,255	00:42:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That and a little while ago Hernandez friend Michael actually got to go down into the store to check out these fatbergs
EDL	00:42:46,655	00:42:52,031	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And it was an amazing experience through it with these waiter hip waders on
EDL	00:42:52,031	00:42:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Pushing bits and pieces of fat side
EDL	00:42:56,127	00:42:58,175	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Drains for the trampoline
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Gooey stuff inside of the sewer
EDL	00:43:01,247	00:43:03,807	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Where is you have is that a picture of it of a fatberg
EDL	00:43:04,575	00:43:09,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Oh my god wow yeah so it's so it's like this like clumpy lumpy Mass
EDL	00:43:09,439	00:43:10,975	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Girbaud jeans
EDL	00:43:10,975	00:43:11,999	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Fat stuff
EDL	00:43:11,999	00:43:17,631	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Gray and brown and it's filled with all the sewer stuff when I'm sleeping
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:20,959	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Fungus grows on it completely block
EDL	00:43:21,471	00:43:22,751	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The Old Brick tunnel
EDL	00:43:22,751	00:43:28,895	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Underground so this is like this is like based on the things people have eaten there so much fat in people's dies here and such in the sewer
EDL	00:43:29,919	00:43:34,783	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	People throwing fat away like taking bacon grease thrown down the sink cooking fat down the sink
EDL	00:43:34,783	00:43:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah and in September of this year in London they found a fatberg in the sewers that weighed as much as 11 double decker bus
EDL	00:43:41,695	00:43:42,719	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That's how much fat
EDL	00:43:42,719	00:43:49,119	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Shut up in one place oh my God
EDL	00:43:49,119	00:43:50,143	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Engine is at the Thames water
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,703	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The Civil War Oregon
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:54,751	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When's the giant fat blob plugging London
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Describing the news
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:44:02,943	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Spectacle lake monster monster
EDL	00:44:06,015	00:44:07,551	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But I mean I felt like
EDL	00:44:07,551	00:44:08,575	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Maybe fat
EDL	00:44:08,575	00:44:09,087	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is it a monster
EDL	00:44:09,599	00:44:10,879	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Maybe it's just like
EDL	00:44:10,879	00:44:13,183	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This this giant thing in the world that's
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:14,975	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's trying to express itself
EDL	00:44:17,279	00:44:18,047	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Young States
EDL	00:44:18,559	00:44:24,959	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Appreciation
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:31,103	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I make up 20% of your body that
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He wasn't he's celebrating fat and so he said that
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:41,087	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If as an artist you're trying to explore water you don't just drink it out of a glass
EDL	00:44:41,087	00:44:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Rock Your Body
EDL	00:44:42,367	00:44:48,767	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Appreciate
EDL	00:44:48,767	00:44:53,119	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What's that experience it in all these different ways
EDL	00:44:53,119	00:44:56,191	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Check engine
EDL	00:44:58,495	00:44:59,519	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We just want to have this
EDL	00:45:03,103	00:45:07,199	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And is that where he came up with the majestical idea of building a fat Island
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Citibank
EDL	00:45:11,295	00:45:15,391	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Spot off The Wharf in Amsterdam and right there in the ocean water
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:17,183	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	He's building this little
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:22,559	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Floating blob of fat waste materials
EDL	00:45:22,559	00:45:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Sometimes you're just buying it
EDL	00:45:28,959	00:45:35,359	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Right now it's like 15 feet across and it's just like they're hanging out

EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Always changing
EDL	00:45:40,735	00:45:42,015	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	We give ourselves
EDL	00:45:42,527	00:45:46,623	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Maybe another half year or a year and then it should be finished interview
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:48,671	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Haha actually how big do you hoped
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,695	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	To get it can you think of
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:51,999	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	At like it's a big as a truck
EDL	00:45:51,999	00:45:54,047	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Or a blue whale over
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:03,007	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Oh my God that would be amazing just of course my dreams are like the my dream is that I won't be able to
EDL	00:46:03,007	00:46:03,775	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The end of it
EDL	00:46:04,287	00:46:07,615	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But that's not really realistic I suppose I mean
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:14,527	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The size of two or three trucks would be amazing already and then you have a real thing I mean it's probably be able to stand on it
EDL	00:46:15,551	00:46:16,831	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's something I would like to be able
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:21,695	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It'll be pretty good then. Then you can really sexy college at Island summer
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,207	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Definitely
EDL	00:46:22,719	00:46:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah I know it's strange but
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,351	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But I know that I love it
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:33,471	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I know the time when I'm there I I really love that little
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:37,055	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Thing that is there in the water
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:43,711	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	If we were that uses as part of the show I need you to give me some kind of
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:50,111	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Question that I can try and answer about that and it sounds like you are are doing a lot of questioning
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I would really like to know when it was like
EDL	00:46:52,159	00:46:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I'm very very very curious about
EDL	00:46:54,719	00:46:55,231	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The relation
EDL	00:46:58,303	00:47:04,447	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay or even when did set start because we know when certain species of animals started
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,799	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	More or less when the universe was created right
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:12,383	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When was the first set
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,151	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay
EDL	00:47:13,151	00:47:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This is something that I would love to know
EDL	00:47:15,199	00:47:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	When was the
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:17,247	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The first five
EDL	00:47:17,247	00:47:17,759	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Fat
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It turns out that the
EDL	00:47:21,087	00:47:22,111	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Very very first
EDL	00:47:22,623	00:47:23,647	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Version of fat
EDL	00:47:24,159	00:47:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Has been around for
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:29,279	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Pretty long time
EDL	00:47:30,303	00:47:36,703	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Before Big Bang
EDL	00:47:36,703	00:47:40,799	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The actor star form in exploded then you can start forming
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Okay so this is
EDL	00:47:42,335	00:47:43,615	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is aqueous geochemist
EDL	00:47:43,615	00:47:49,247	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Tom McCollum in my pajamas
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:50,271	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Teamweek
EDL	00:47:50,271	00:47:53,343	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I told Tom told me that the earliest earliest version of fat
EDL	00:47:53,855	00:47:56,415	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Was a harbin
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:58,719	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Oxygen compound
EDL	00:47:58,719	00:48:00,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Arias Arias
EDL	00:48:00,255	00:48:01,791	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Hydrogen carbonate
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:03,583	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So first
EDL	00:48:03,583	00:48:04,351	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Eat Hydra
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And hydrogen comes along with the big bang
EDL	00:48:06,399	00:48:07,423	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So we get there really early
EDL	00:48:07,935	00:48:09,727	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Then we have to wait for
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:13,567	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Start a forum starting at Old assorted Diana
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:14,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Explode
EDL	00:48:14,335	00:48:15,871	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And then you get carbon and
EDL	00:48:17,151	00:48:20,991	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And that carbon and oxygen along with the hydrogen is now a certainty
EDL	00:48:20,991	00:48:23,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Swirling around in this Interstellar space
EDL	00:48:23,295	00:48:24,319	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Dust stuff
EDL	00:48:24,831	00:48:26,623	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And when those three things
EDL	00:48:26,623	00:48:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Come together
EDL	00:48:28,159	00:48:29,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	They start to make these
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:30,463	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	These shapes
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:34,815	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So you have like a chain of carbons linked together
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:37,375	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And each one of those carbon has equal height
EDL	00:48:37,375	00:48:38,655	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	James Bond
EDL	00:48:38,655	00:48:41,215	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Carbon hydrogen chain
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:46,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And then at one end is the what's call the carboxyl group
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:48,639	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Carbon hydrogen and oxygen
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:52,479	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah so I like to think of it kind of like a flower
EDL	00:48:52,479	00:48:55,295	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The stem of the flower is hydrogen carbon
EDL	00:48:55,295	00:48:56,831	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The Petals of the flower contains ox
EDL	00:48:57,343	00:48:58,623	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	As well as carbon and hydrogen
EDL	00:48:59,903	00:49:00,671	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And there's fat
EDL	00:49:01,183	00:49:02,207	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And it's little
EDL	00:49:02,207	00:49:02,719	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Flower likes
EDL	00:49:03,743	00:49:05,279	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Long before the earth existed
EDL	00:49:06,047	00:49:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Floating around in space
EDL	00:49:11,167	00:49:13,727	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Savannah Sun and the Moon and the Earth
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:14,495	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	In the planet

EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:19,103	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And on the surface of the Earth
EDL	00:49:19,103	00:49:20,127	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	After it's cooled
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:21,663	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You got fatty acid
EDL	00:49:22,687	00:49:27,807	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Now we don't know exactly how they got there whether they formed on the Earth itself or came from like
EDL	00:49:27,807	00:49:30,879	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Meteorite smacking in the Earth
EDL	00:49:30,879	00:49:33,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But the important thing is that fatty acids are there
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:34,975	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And there's also a lot of water
EDL	00:49:35,487	00:49:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Water is important because
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:43,423	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That's the thing about these little fatty acids is that never a hydrophobic into the molecule
EDL	00:49:43,935	00:49:45,727	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So hydrophobic means
EDL	00:49:45,727	00:49:46,751	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Scared of water
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:49,311	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It is a first quarter
EDL	00:49:50,591	00:49:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So are fatty acid flowers the oxygen end the the flower end
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And so if there's water dispenser like and so all these flowers form
EDL	00:50:05,183	00:50:09,535	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Desi can imagine it like a bouquet that is so full that it is a
EDL	00:50:09,535	00:50:10,303	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Sphere
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:16,703	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Show all the flowers on the outside cuz they'll of water and all the stems on the inside they're hiding from the water
EDL	00:50:16,703	00:50:17,727	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The all the fat flowers
EDL	00:50:18,239	00:50:19,519	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Join together
EDL	00:50:19,519	00:50:21,055	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Because it allows the
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:22,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Water heating parts
EDL	00:50:22,335	00:50:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The Hyatt
EDL	00:50:23,359	00:50:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And the water and loving parts
EDL	00:50:24,639	00:50:25,919	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Beyond the surface
EDL	00:50:25,919	00:50:27,967	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But this is all like longpre life
EDL	00:50:27,967	00:50:30,271	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This is life has no idea what it is yet
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:32,063	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Life hasn't even thought about
EDL	00:50:32,575	00:50:33,343	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Coming on the scene
EDL	00:50:34,367	00:50:35,647	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But there is a theory
EDL	00:50:36,159	00:50:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That is one of many theories out there
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:42,559	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But there's an idea that when these little fat flower bubbles for Minnesota
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:43,839	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Primordial sea
EDL	00:50:43,839	00:50:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	They're kind of taking a little hair pulled the fluid
EDL	00:50:46,655	00:50:48,447	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Rounding them inside with
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Whatever your fluid
EDL	00:50:50,751	00:50:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Going to get trapped inside there
EDL	00:50:52,543	00:50:54,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So on the inside they've got
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,103	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Some things
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:56,383	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Some visitors
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Some visitors
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:51:03,551	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And the theory goes that maybe one of the things around in the sea that end up getting pulled inside one of those fat bubble
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:06,367	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	With a little floaty bits of genetic material
EDL	00:51:07,135	00:51:08,927	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Like it with a little bit of RNA
EDL	00:51:09,439	00:51:10,463	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And then
EDL	00:51:10,463	00:51:11,231	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	For the first
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:12,255	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Time ever
EDL	00:51:12,255	00:51:16,095	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Instead of random bits of RNA floating around in a CPC
EDL	00:51:16,607	00:51:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You have
EDL	00:51:17,631	00:51:18,143	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A cell
EDL	00:51:21,471	00:51:24,031	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	For the first time you have an inside
EDL	00:51:24,799	00:51:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You have
EDL	00:51:25,567	00:51:27,359	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A you separate from
EDL	00:51:27,359	00:51:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The soup around you
EDL	00:51:28,639	00:51:29,663	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So
EDL	00:51:29,663	00:51:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The Fat Ball
EDL	00:51:31,455	00:51:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Bandirue threesome from outer space and Levy landing gear and maybe Hood cool
EDL	00:51:37,855	00:51:40,671	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The first container that made life possible
EDL	00:51:40,671	00:51:41,439	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That's right
EDL	00:51:42,719	00:51:49,119	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I don't think there is any way to really have anything like we call a living being without having
EDL	00:51:49,119	00:51:50,143	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A membrane
EDL	00:51:50,655	00:51:52,191	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Separated from this round
EDL	00:51:52,191	00:51:54,239	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That is really important
EDL	00:51:54,239	00:51:55,263	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Propounding
EDL	00:51:55,263	00:51:56,031	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	What is
EDL	00:51:56,031	00:52:02,175	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is without father would be no us there we beheld we we are we are we are built in houses effect
EDL	00:52:02,687	00:52:06,527	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So that means when you get your soap bar out of the shower you should give it some respect
EDL	00:52:06,527	00:52:09,599	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Is so fat yeah I think so
EDL	00:52:10,111	00:52:12,671	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Traditional sopes
EDL	00:52:15,999	00:52:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	You don't know everything.
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:22,655	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But I think I'm actually excited for I'm to hear this because I feel like
EDL	00:52:23,167	00:52:29,055	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I mean what can convey all the way that the beginning of Life
EDL	00:52:29,567	00:52:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Can hear me
EDL	00:52:30,335	00:52:32,383	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I wonder what he'll say
EDL	00:52:32,895	00:52:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So I called on again
EDL	00:52:34,431	00:52:35,711	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And this time
EDL	00:52:35,711	00:52:38,271	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Just had a conference
EDL	00:52:38,271	00:52:39,807	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I have to go to this conference
EDL	00:52:39,807	00:52:42,367	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I didn't know what was coach Webb because
EDL	00:52:43,391	00:52:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Colts coach
EDL	00:52:45,183	00:52:47,231	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	But you're everything is covered in fat
EDL	00:52:49,023	00:52:51,071	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Taking over my life and I just have to deal with it
EDL	00:52:51,583	00:52:52,095	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Anyway
EDL	00:52:54,143	00:52:57,727	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So I wanted to tell you what my sign just told me about
EDL	00:52:57,727	00:52:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	The earliest
EDL	00:52:58,495	00:52:59,263	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Spermicide
EDL	00:52:59,263	00:53:01,311	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Can I tell you okay
EDL	00:53:01,823	00:53:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Think of a way to put this succinctly
EDL	00:53:04,383	00:53:05,919	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I told them everything I learn
EDL	00:53:08,223	00:53:09,247	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Barrier between us
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	And the rest of the
EDL	00:53:10,271	00:53:11,039	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	So that makes it makes
EDL	00:53:11,551	00:53:12,831	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah
EDL	00:53:12,831	00:53:16,927	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yeah and it could be that these Lee be like early early fatty acids
EDL	00:53:17,439	00:53:18,463	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Are the sting
EDL	00:53:18,975	00:53:20,767	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	That make life as we know it
EDL	00:53:20,767	00:53:21,535	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Possible
EDL	00:53:21,535	00:53:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Exodus
EDL	00:53:22,303	00:53:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	I suspected it
EDL	00:53:24,351	00:53:25,119	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Why
EDL	00:53:25,119	00:53:25,887	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Yes
EDL	00:53:25,887	00:53:26,399	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	How'd it go
EDL	00:53:26,911	00:53:27,935	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	Intuition I guess
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	It's beautiful
EDL	00:53:30,239	00:53:32,799	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This is how it's supposed to be this is what I've always dreamt of

EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:43,551	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	This is why I live
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18biggerlittlequestions |	A lot of people to think for this these two episodes this is actually a real group effort but one particular props
