EDL	00:01:17,056	00:01:17,824	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	About
EDL	00:01:18,336	00:01:20,896	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	The periodic table of elements we're going to tell
EDL	00:01:20,896	00:01:23,456	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Individual stories about the different elements
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:24,480	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	The stories are going to take it
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:26,016	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Space
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:29,856	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Deep man-made holes in the middle of America into our cells
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:31,136	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	All kinds of place
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:33,440	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	So this week we decided to make a small
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:33,952	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Telescope
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:35,488	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Preview
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:37,024	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	In which we go to one
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:37,792	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Apartment
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,072	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	In one building in the sea
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:42,144	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Occupied by the rather singular
EDL	00:01:42,144	00:01:43,168	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Dr. Oliver Sacks
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:46,240	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	We should say this was a visit we paid him about
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,800	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	7 years ago I think
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:52,896	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	This is the story that in a very real way in
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:54,432	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Inspired us to do this
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:01:55,456	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Upcoming at the
EDL	00:01:55,968	00:01:56,736	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	About the Alamo
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:01:59,552	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I will also know by the way that I love you
EDL	00:01:59,552	00:02:00,320	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Is intensive
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:00,832	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Right now
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:01,856	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Which makes
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:02,880	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Perfectly wonderful
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,696	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Enjoy
EDL	00:02:06,208	00:02:06,976	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Alpha-gal
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:09,536	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I think that's always been a desire to somehow
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:11,840	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Plastic rice and classify
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,888	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	The world around us
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,008	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	And when you were in
EDL	00:02:19,008	00:02:21,312	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I don't know when I can 8th grade when they
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:24,896	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	When the teacher comes in and general science and he pulls down the periodic
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:28,736	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Table of elements
EDL	00:02:30,016	00:02:34,624	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Yeah I want to be a scientist but not for me but for kids who love this kind of thing
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:35,648	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Oliver Sacks
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:42,304	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	ESO a couple years ago we'd went to talk to Oliver Sacks about something
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:44,608	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Was that supposed to use was going to talk to him and I was
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,144	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Tagging along for the hell of it
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:47,168	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	For some reason
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	We ended up in his
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:51,008	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Bathroom
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,824	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Maybe to look at a book or something
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,128	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	He seems have facts and figures in this is wrong
EDL	00:02:56,128	00:02:58,944	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	. a lot of us in there
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:05,344	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	That's when we noticed
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,904	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Elements on the wall in the bathroom
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,952	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Wow funny
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:16,352	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Periodic table the bathroom but then he said well you know if you go out to the couch you'll see.
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:22,752	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Embroidered with the periodic table and then he took a Swiss bedroom
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:29,152	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Where you should assist periodic table comforter
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:29,920	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	On the tungsten
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,968	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	But the cool part
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Was when he took us to the living room
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:37,600	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	We had this describe what it's before us here
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:43,488	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Alter a little dictionary Stan on top of which was a beautiful
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,280	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Mahogany boxes
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:48,096	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Find wooden box at the size of a Backgammon set
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Periodic table of the elements is a very fine wooden and if you can't open it
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:55,776	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	It's a
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:59,360	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Play The Sims where to find wood comes from Russia
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Is there a trick to opening it
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:11,648	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Okay we've all seen the periodic table pinyin chart
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:18,047	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	But I was response there there were the usual elements
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:21,375	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	We have like 90 some odd little
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:22,399	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Little tubes
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:34,175	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Hydrogen + nitrogen
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:40,319	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	2 time for drama having my 72nd birthday tomorrow and element 72 is half an hour
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:44,159	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Iraq
EDL	00:04:44,671	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Do what they sound like
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:53,887	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I have coming to me I hope it arrives today and English of hafnium which would be very about tomorrow
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:59,007	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Satisfied
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:05,407	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I'll be able to hold it in my hand my first love of chemistry have to do with the essential
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:11,551	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Yeah one of the liquid album I love the colors around me Brown
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:18,463	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Lobster very very beautiful day the physical properties
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:24,607	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Best trapped in a little vial yes
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:32,287	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Cuz I I I really need to know things really crazy about that box
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:35,615	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	And this you don't get from from looking at it.
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:39,199	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Chart on the wall is it all those elements
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:40,991	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Ashley
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,855	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	My everything we can see and perceive this
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:49,183	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Table right here the thief in my mouth
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:52,767	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Sky ocean mountains it all
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:55,583	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Need of some combination of elements from that box
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,399	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	And the Box itself
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,423	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Gives it all in deep
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:00,703	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Deep
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,215	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Order
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:06,079	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I have noticed myself
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,871	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I can't help noticing
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,663	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Elements
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,199	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Organized
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:12,991	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	In a very special
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:14,015	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Sort of way
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,855	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I have managed to not notice
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,135	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I find it a little odd
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:26,303	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Then you could organize them at all I don't even know how to begin the process of figuring out there to relate
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:31,423	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Well then you are sort of recapitulating Watch
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:33,727	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I know what what everyone felt in the
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:38,591	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	In the early days question a really early days people thought there were just four of them
EDL	00:06:38,591	00:06:41,919	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	The ancient notion of elements that took the form of
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:50,623	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Basically the thoughts of the whole world
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:53,439	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Could be composed of these four ingredients
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,207	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Different way
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:59,583	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Then in the 18th century was skipping ahead of it
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:03,167	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Small pieces like wind became castles
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:06,495	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Like oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen Earth
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,799	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	God divided up into things like salsa
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:09,823	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Phosphorus
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:16,223	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I am and eventually chemist got all the way down to the root which was the atom
EDL	00:07:16,223	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	That's really what an element is it's a particular kind of atom the problem was though
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:27,743	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	When chemists begin to start measuring the atoms they found that they were all different sizes and types like one would be heavy
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:34,911	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Another would be light third one be really friendly likes to link up with other items worth the 4th would be a loner
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,727	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Anyway, combinations like heavy friendly
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:44,127	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Heavy shy light friendly light shine what was the pattern that was the question could they fit all of these differences
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:48,735	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Similarities
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:51,551	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Let me hear show you a picture of the
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:56,415	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Here's where we get to Oliver's here outside.
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:08:02,047	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	I see this cold that will be Dmitri Mendeleev
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:03,839	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Over has a black and white picture of him
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,607	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	His
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:07,167	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Habits man is not going to win any
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:10,751	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Any beauty looks like a mix
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Strip between the Rasputin
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Anthem
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:22,015	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Who do I mean I mean he is a big nose a Shaggy slightly unkempt white beard and mustache the puzzle
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,527	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	All over the place
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,063	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Piercing eyes
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:25,087	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Thick eyebrows
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:27,647	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	And looks like he's in a hunchback position
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:33,279	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Generally if you met him on the sidewalk you probably want to walk around it
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:36,351	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Yucky didn't believe in wasting time going to a barber
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,679	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	The degree of your passion when you look at this man
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:43,519	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	You think he's a beautiful looking guy or do you see what I see
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,079	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Isaac Mendeleev had a beautiful mind
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,127	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	And when that mine
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:48,895	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Can get Sonic

EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,583	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	It just means you lean back and say

EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:43,679	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	How do they do that
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,727	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Maybe it was the moment that I

EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:51,871	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:55,967	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the musical score
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:10:00,831	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're ready music in the margin of their geometry homework

EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:55,263	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	This week in February
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Of 1869 he is said to have had a dream and stream all the atoms of all the elements of all the way
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:08,575	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	That was a small one dance was everyone's the friendly ones to shine once they all begin to dance in his mind and then

EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:17,023	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	With a vision of the periodic table
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:22,399	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Dreams wrote on the back of an amp
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:31,103	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	The thing about what he wrote on the back that envelope
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	It starts out so simply left to right the atoms just get heavier and heavier and heavier
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	But every so often while they're getting heavier their other trades
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:50,047	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Diamagnetic or whatever those traits repeat
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:13:01,311	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Simple repeating structure you get a table that you can read in a million ways
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:07,711	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	There's so many ways to read this table

EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:37,215	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Which raises maybe the deepest question of all
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:44,127	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Did Mendeleev think this up and impose it upon the world or was this pattern always
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Is there
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	In which case mendeleyev just
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:52,831	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Remove the veil and set out there you are is the periodic table a discovery or invention
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,879	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Is it a human construct
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:16:01,023	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Who is it a revelation of the cosmical Define water is it so to speak God's abacus
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:20,223	| radiolab_podcast15sackselements |	Okay so that was our visit with wow did I just get gas
