EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:19,360	| radiolab101915 |	Will humans ever stop fighting Wars once and for all
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:24,480	| radiolab101915 |	No
EDL	00:01:24,480	00:01:26,016	| radiolab101915 |	Because of
EDL	00:01:26,528	00:01:27,296	| radiolab101915 |	Greed
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:28,064	| radiolab101915 |	And one UPS
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:31,392	| radiolab101915 |	To explain John's been asking this question
EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:33,440	| radiolab101915 |	Will humans ever stop fighting wars
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,208	| radiolab101915 |	What's 4 years
EDL	00:01:34,208	00:01:35,744	| radiolab101915 |	These are him this question
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:38,560	| radiolab101915 |	Snapchat about war get something really Bass
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:41,888	| radiolab101915 |	Do we feel we can change
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:42,400	| radiolab101915 |	Who We Are
EDL	00:01:44,704	00:01:48,288	| radiolab101915 |	Any kind of popped out of his mouth was 2003
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:54,688	| radiolab101915 |	In a friend asked him to give a talk at a church just a few days after the first invasion of Iraq
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:57,248	| radiolab101915 |	So here I was in this
EDL	00:01:57,248	00:02:01,344	| radiolab101915 |	Church and I remember the mood was very somber
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:05,184	| radiolab101915 |	I was determined to try to make people
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,720	| radiolab101915 |	Feel that okay
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,768	| radiolab101915 |	This is a setback but still
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:13,376	| radiolab101915 |	You got to believe that this is possible and I try to list all the reasons
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:17,728	| radiolab101915 |	Hennessy was making his case and getting worked up
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:21,312	| radiolab101915 |	You look at the 60 or so people were there in the audience is that all right
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:24,384	| radiolab101915 |	How many of you here believe that war
EDL	00:02:24,384	00:02:26,432	| radiolab101915 |	Will and someday
EDL	00:02:26,432	00:02:32,832	| radiolab101915 |	And I think one or two people raise their hand at a 60
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:36,672	| radiolab101915 |	And John thought way
EDL	00:02:37,440	00:02:38,976	| radiolab101915 |	This is really Who You Are
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:40,512	| radiolab101915 |	And so that's actually when I started
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:47,424	| radiolab101915 |	Reading as much as I can about all these things and dug up some surveys from the 1980s
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,960	| radiolab101915 |	Sounds about 20 years ago
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,008	| radiolab101915 |	People were asking this question
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:53,056	| radiolab101915 |	You think war will ever end taking surveys
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:54,848	| radiolab101915 |	A snowman that they were not the most scientific
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:56,384	| radiolab101915 |	But like the results
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,152	| radiolab101915 |	Seem to indicate
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:02:59,200	| radiolab101915 |	That we used to be optimistic
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:02,016	| radiolab101915 |	Back in the 80s only one and three
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,040	| radiolab101915 |	Got that work
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,112	| radiolab101915 |	Is a minority
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:07,136	| radiolab101915 |	Where is today
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:14,048	| radiolab101915 |	Will Youmans ever stop fighting Wars once and for all if you take that question to the streets of Hoboken
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:21,728	| radiolab101915 |	You'll find love about nine out of 10 people
EDL	00:03:21,728	00:03:28,128	| radiolab101915 |	Saying yeah I think so
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| radiolab101915 |	Never know
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:32,224	| radiolab101915 |	Might be called up John again recently to ask
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:34,016	| radiolab101915 |	Have the results change cuz he has
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:35,808	| radiolab101915 |	Kept on doing a survey and he said no
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,856	| radiolab101915 |	6 years later it's
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:42,208	| radiolab101915 |	Still roughly eight or nine out of ten people say no we'll never stop fighting
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:44,000	| radiolab101915 |	Same results
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,280	| radiolab101915 |	Depressingly
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,304	| radiolab101915 |	The worst part
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:48,096	| radiolab101915 |	Is it when he asked the next
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:49,376	| radiolab101915 |	Why do you think
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,424	| radiolab101915 |	Invariably he gets
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:57,568	| radiolab101915 |	Something like I think there is a human nature is to for greed and to always want more it's just
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:03,968	| radiolab101915 |	Human Nature
EDL	00:04:03,968	00:04:09,600	| radiolab101915 |	And I don't think we're ever going to learn why do you say that I just think that it's too ingrained in our human nature
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,392	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:13,184	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:13,696	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:14,976	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,280	| radiolab101915 |	So we want to challenge that last day
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:21,119	| radiolab101915 |	Too ingrained in our human nature that was handed down to us
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:23,679	| radiolab101915 |	From our primate ancestors violence meme
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:24,447	| radiolab101915 |	Who knows
EDL	00:04:24,447	00:04:25,215	| radiolab101915 |	Question is
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:27,263	| radiolab101915 |	How ingrained is that
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,031	| radiolab101915 |	Well yeah
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:32,639	| radiolab101915 |	Me if you think that we have inherited something yet what can we do about it we Stocker can we change
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,687	| radiolab101915 |	Phoenix Wright choices
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:39,039	| radiolab101915 |	So he's got for you this hour or three stories where choice
EDL	00:04:39,039	00:04:40,319	| radiolab101915 |	Individual choice
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,111	| radiolab101915 |	Challenges destiny
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,647	| radiolab101915 |	Maybe
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:46,975	| radiolab101915 |	I'm Jared I'm right by Robert krulwich this is Radiolab
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:53,887	| radiolab101915 |	Stick around
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,191	| radiolab101915 |	Here's the thing
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:04:58,495	| radiolab101915 |	Did not mean the present
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:04:59,519	| radiolab101915 |	This show was
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:05,151	| radiolab101915 |	Are usually inspired by an anecdote that I'd read about the New York Times is Guy Martin bunzl
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,455	| radiolab101915 |	Was telling a story
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:12,575	| radiolab101915 |	When he was 18 it was 1966 I believe you sitting on a plane and a guy next to him
EDL	00:05:13,087	00:05:13,855	| radiolab101915 |	Sad looks
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| radiolab101915 |	The stewardess and then says
EDL	00:05:16,159	00:05:18,207	| radiolab101915 |	Not another negro stewardess
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:18,719	| radiolab101915 |	Something like that
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,559	| radiolab101915 |	Sky Martin buns over by the way the classroom
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:23,839	| radiolab101915 |	He says
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:24,607	| radiolab101915 |	Thinking back on it
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:27,679	| radiolab101915 |	That was an interesting thing
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:28,447	| radiolab101915 |	Because
EDL	00:05:28,447	00:05:31,519	| radiolab101915 |	Had that guy on the plane said that a few years earlier would have been like
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,055	| radiolab101915 |	Commonplace
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,615	| radiolab101915 |	Had he said it a few years later
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,687	| radiolab101915 |	It would have been intolerable the right then
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:40,735	| radiolab101915 |	It was neither
EDL	00:05:41,759	00:05:43,039	| radiolab101915 |	It was things were shifting
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,319	| radiolab101915 |	And he said
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:49,439	| radiolab101915 |	You know it was like this guy was shouting through an open window Between Worlds
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:51,231	| radiolab101915 |	That was his praise
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:53,279	| radiolab101915 |	Open window Between Worlds
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,839	| radiolab101915 |	Totally lodged in my head
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:57,631	| radiolab101915 |	And I've been thinking about that phrase a lot
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:06:01,727	| radiolab101915 |	This feeling that maybe the ground is Shifting beneath our feet not quite sure
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:05,567	| radiolab101915 |	And that's actually what brought us back to the show that feeling
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:07,871	| radiolab101915 |	Is each of the stories in this
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:08,383	| radiolab101915 |	Show
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,919	| radiolab101915 |	Kind of suggests that
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:11,455	| radiolab101915 |	Window Between Worlds
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:16,319	| radiolab101915 |	So what we going to do is as a redo the show after a couple of stores are going to check in real quick
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:19,903	| radiolab101915 |	Whether we feel like we passed
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,463	| radiolab101915 |	Through this window into a new world or whether we're still
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:22,975	| radiolab101915 |	Stuck in the Middle
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,095	| radiolab101915 |	You just you just heard Lulu Miller
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,399	| radiolab101915 |	I briefly in art and that last few minutes
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:33,215	| radiolab101915 |	She at the time with our producer now of course she is
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| radiolab101915 |	Become Superstar host of invisibilia
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,287	| radiolab101915 |	Damn
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,335	| radiolab101915 |	To the show began with
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:40,639	| radiolab101915 |	A familiar voice
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:43,967	| radiolab101915 |	Remember this guy Roberts
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:44,735	| radiolab101915 |	Sapolsky

EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:11,103	| radiolab101915 |	Effects stress has on the body and turns out baboons
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:12,895	| radiolab101915 |	Are perfect
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:14,687	| radiolab101915 |	Source of data
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,199	| radiolab101915 |	Because
EDL	00:07:15,711	00:07:16,735	| radiolab101915 |	They're always under
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:19,807	| radiolab101915 |	You know the one thing we know about baboons on forever
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:26,975	| radiolab101915 |	Is it a fight baboons constantly not just metaphorically but literally have been V

EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:46,175	| radiolab101915 |	Like we humans used to invest we evolve very similar like they have a constant Baseline level of aggression
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:49,759	| radiolab101915 |	Which inevitably spills over into their social life
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,039	| radiolab101915 |	Which is why he's
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:55,135	| radiolab101915 |	So what's supposed to be does basically he goes into the bush

EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:14,847	| radiolab101915 |	He tells the following story of a particular moment in his baboon watching
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,639	| radiolab101915 |	Which completely
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,175	| radiolab101915 |	Changed his life
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:22,015	| radiolab101915 |	James how he sees the world it happened about 30 years ago
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,063	| radiolab101915 |	Supposed to be the young guy just out of grad school
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,111	| radiolab101915 |	Settings first troop might
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,647	| radiolab101915 |	My first Baton Rouge
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:30,719	| radiolab101915 |	True. We love these rare animals I was very
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| radiolab101915 |	Connected with
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:35,327	| radiolab101915 |	The most ways a pretty average group or basic
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| radiolab101915 |	Baboon Troop
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,911	| radiolab101915 |	The females were highly affiliated with each other
EDL	00:08:38,911	00:08:42,751	| radiolab101915 |	They had a very stable ranking system the males meanwhile
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:47,103	| radiolab101915 |	Highly aggressive dumping on each other cuz that's just what males do
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| radiolab101915 |	Right
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:54,015	| radiolab101915 |	Okay mid-80s
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:09:00,415	| radiolab101915 |	A big boom in tourism in Kenya of Wonders for the economy lot Sanu lodges lot to Lodge expansions
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:06,047	| radiolab101915 |	And there happened to be the next territory over the tourist Lodge in this one particular Lodge
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,327	| radiolab101915 |	She says he's gotten really big
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,607	| radiolab101915 |	Really fast
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:15,007	| radiolab101915 |	And during the time the lodge greatly expanded their garbage dumped me they stated they just dug a hole out behind the
EDL	00:09:15,007	00:09:17,311	| radiolab101915 |	A large when you stay a tractor came out
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,103	| radiolab101915 |	With the leftovers and dumped it there
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:26,271	| radiolab101915 |	So we're talking about here if you can easily imagine is he big steaming pile of
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:30,111	| radiolab101915 |	Trash half-eaten Food baking in the Sun
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,671	| radiolab101915 |	Smell wafting in the breeze
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:36,511	| radiolab101915 |	From miles and miles and into the nostrils of baboons everywhere
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:37,023	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,095	| radiolab101915 |	It was not long before a troop of baboons
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:40,863	| radiolab101915 |	Possible
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,935	| radiolab101915 |	When your boss covered the garbage and just order cheating on it
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,799	| radiolab101915 |	I hear there are eating leftover
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,335	| radiolab101915 |	Desert Sun
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,895	| radiolab101915 |	Chicken whatever is done
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,663	| radiolab101915 |	Dumb full of
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:55,199	| radiolab101915 |	Food must be to a baboon like
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:57,503	| radiolab101915 |	Like wandering into
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,319	| radiolab101915 |	Manna in the wilderness
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:03,903	| radiolab101915 |	So this troop almost immediately shifted their entire Behavior
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:10,047	| radiolab101915 |	2 they just slept in the trees above the garbage dump and instead of getting up at 6 in the morning to start forging
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:12,095	| radiolab101915 |	Are they would waddle down around
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:17,215	| radiolab101915 |	2 minutes of mine and the tractor would show up at 9 and dump the food and they would have
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:21,311	| radiolab101915 |	20 minutes of sheer Frenzy
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:24,895	| radiolab101915 |	And then they go back to sort of being couch potatoes
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:27,711	| radiolab101915 |	And this is how it went for a while
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,991	| radiolab101915 |	So they're over there
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,271	| radiolab101915 |	Living off of garbage
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:31,551	| radiolab101915 |	And
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:34,879	| radiolab101915 |	Somehow some of the males in my troop figure this out
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| radiolab101915 |	Ismael's think
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:37,439	| radiolab101915 |	We got to get in on this
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,719	| radiolab101915 |	We got to go over there
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:45,119	| radiolab101915 |	And take their food what emerged was each morning a bunch of males would run a kilometer or so
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:51,263	| radiolab101915 |	The garbage dump in fight their way in
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,823	| radiolab101915 |	So every morning there be a showdown
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:59,711	| radiolab101915 |	I'm basically yeah they would come back with canine slashes and stuff like that and fat but also have
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:00,223	| radiolab101915 |	Drumsticks
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:01,247	| radiolab101915 |	Cakes
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,271	| radiolab101915 |	Hamburgers
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,807	| radiolab101915 |	This ritual
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,623	| radiolab101915 |	Accessible C1 on for year and then
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:08,927	| radiolab101915 |	You years into it
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:13,535	| radiolab101915 |	I got word that there were a couple of baboons in this garbage dump Troop
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:20,447	| radiolab101915 |	That looked awful and something was wrong with him these guys from Elijah called him and said hey you better get down here and look at this and
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:20,959	| radiolab101915 |	When you got there
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| radiolab101915 |	What he saw
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:27,359	| radiolab101915 |	Was horrible animals with rotting hands walking on their elbows
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:35,807	| radiolab101915 |	Trying to figure out what this is about get veterinarians involved when we finally figure out is tuberculosis
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:39,903	| radiolab101915 |	Infected meat have been thrown in the dump and then eaten by the baboons
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,439	| radiolab101915 |	And this is really bad news
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:44,255	| radiolab101915 |	Because well tuberculosis in people
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:48,351	| radiolab101915 |	Is it really slow moving disease he be kills non-human primates in weeks
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:51,167	| radiolab101915 |	And it's a nightmare of a disease
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,703	| radiolab101915 |	For them in just a short time
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:54,495	| radiolab101915 |	The garbage dump Troop
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,519	| radiolab101915 |	Was completely decimate
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:58,591	| radiolab101915 |	Not to mention the tough guys in sapolsky
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,639	| radiolab101915 |	The ones that have gone to the dump every morning
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:05,247	| radiolab101915 |	They got two of the same kind of rotting hands and they all died
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:07,807	| radiolab101915 |	That must have been really
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,343	| radiolab101915 |	Kind of tragic
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:11,903	| radiolab101915 |	Not
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,439	| radiolab101915 |	Good. For me
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,535	| radiolab101915 |	These were my animals
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,095	| radiolab101915 |	Grown up with these guys
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,727	| radiolab101915 |	But yeah while sapolsky was heartbroke
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,007	| radiolab101915 |	Now that half
EDL	00:12:27,007	00:12:27,519	| radiolab101915 |	The alpha male
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:28,799	| radiolab101915 |	Super Dad
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,079	| radiolab101915 |	He didn't notice
EDL	00:12:30,847	00:12:32,127	| radiolab101915 |	Strange things start to happen
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:40,063	| radiolab101915 |	Change is harder than well grooming spiked and I sit on a branch and I take
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:41,855	| radiolab101915 |	Please out of here
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:46,463	| radiolab101915 |	Be as well either usually when a female Grooms of a male the male is never received
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,255	| radiolab101915 |	But suddenly they were
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:54,399	| radiolab101915 |	Even weirder you saw a adult male sitting in contact with each other and grooming each other
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:56,703	| radiolab101915 |	It helped how rare that is
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:00,799	| radiolab101915 |	Be like it from something in the middle of round 5 of a heavyweight bout
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:07,711	| radiolab101915 |	Mike Tyson just decided to stop boxing and Evander Holyfield hair
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:14,111	| radiolab101915 |	If you were babbling all legit it would have been less shocking if these guys had wings
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:20,511	| radiolab101915 |	Door were photosynthetic or something up to then I've seen like 30 seconds of male male grooming the corset
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:26,911	| radiolab101915 |	15 years but at the time supposed to be kind of wrote it off this is just some freak event wasn't going to last
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:33,311	| radiolab101915 |	Sookie actually stop studying
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:35,871	| radiolab101915 |	Non natural event removing half the study subjects
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:42,783	| radiolab101915 |	Scientist became less interesting to you know that was the rationale it was just too painful to go on walks
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:43,551	| radiolab101915 |	These guys
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,367	| radiolab101915 |	So I moved to the other end of the reserve
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:52,767	| radiolab101915 |	Like 40 miles away and started with a new troop there are an for 6 years I would not go anywhere near the corner of the power
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,279	| radiolab101915 |	Park is I just
EDL	00:13:54,559	00:13:55,071	| radiolab101915 |	Be there
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,631	| radiolab101915 |	Fast forward
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:58,143	| radiolab101915 |	6 years
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:13:59,935	| radiolab101915 |	We come to the MoMA
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,727	| radiolab101915 |	That really change things
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,263	| radiolab101915 |	Strand really flipped him into a different way
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:05,055	| radiolab101915 |	And it happened
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:06,591	| radiolab101915 |	Kind of bags
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:09,919	| radiolab101915 |	It's about 6 years later out there
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,967	| radiolab101915 |	For the first time with
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:14,527	| radiolab101915 |	Who was destined to become my wife and
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,599	| radiolab101915 |	Decided I wanted a kind of show her where
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:24,255	| radiolab101915 |	I am grown-up what part of the part I'm going to go to the old haunt yeah basically she went there
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:30,655	| radiolab101915 |	And the truth was there and they were acting pretty much the same as before lots of grooming not so much fighting isn't that
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:34,495	| radiolab101915 |	Nice and they're still like this great Remnant true
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,799	| radiolab101915 |	Just pointing out all the different baboons are there
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,311	| radiolab101915 |	Steven
EDL	00:14:38,335	00:14:38,847	| radiolab101915 |	Whoever
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:40,383	| radiolab101915 |	And then it
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,919	| radiolab101915 |	Hixson
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:43,711	| radiolab101915 |	Houston or whatever
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:47,551	| radiolab101915 |	There was only one male left
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,599	| radiolab101915 |	We've been there at the time of the TB outbreak
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:53,183	| radiolab101915 |	One meal
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:55,487	| radiolab101915 |	Stick with me for just one second and you will go
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,023	| radiolab101915 |	The thing about male baboons
EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:58,303	| radiolab101915 |	Christian artists
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,327	| radiolab101915 |	Hands around puberty
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:01,119	| radiolab101915 |	The Mills get a little ants
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:02,143	| radiolab101915 |	I get itchy
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:04,703	| radiolab101915 |	They're bored and they just pick up and leave
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:10,847	| radiolab101915 |	So in a troop any of the adult males grew up someplace else which meant these new guys at work
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,615	| radiolab101915 |	We're coming into
EDL	00:15:11,615	00:15:12,383	| radiolab101915 |	Sapolsky Stroup
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:19,295	| radiolab101915 |	Coming in from the outside from the old world order jerky real dog-eat-dog world out there
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:21,343	| radiolab101915 |	What's he got to figure these new mails are coming in
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:24,415	| radiolab101915 |	Withhold expectations that they're going to have to kick ass
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,975	| radiolab101915 |	To be respected which would mean
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:29,023	| radiolab101915 |	This whole Kumbaya
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,303	| radiolab101915 |	Situation should
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,583	| radiolab101915 |	Evaporate
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,143	| radiolab101915 |	The moment these guys show up
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:38,239	| radiolab101915 |	But it didn't
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:40,031	| radiolab101915 |	It's stuck
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,543	| radiolab101915 |	Oh my God
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:46,175	| radiolab101915 |	The new guys are learning we don't do stuff like that here
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:51,551	| radiolab101915 |	You guys are learning a new way will that means the old way the violent way
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:53,855	| radiolab101915 |	Isn't the only way
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:16:00,255	| radiolab101915 |	This this lured me was one of those moments
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:04,095	| radiolab101915 |	Will be one of the three or four that sign for once in my life
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:10,495	| radiolab101915 |	The key question was how do these guys unlearn their entire
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:16,895	| radiolab101915 |	Fire childhood culture of aggression blah blah and somehow learned we don't do
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:17,919	| radiolab101915 |	Stuff like that around here
EDL	00:16:19,199	00:16:19,711	| radiolab101915 |	Wow
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,831	| radiolab101915 |	Well what will how do they unlearn something that was supposedly built in oh
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,879	| radiolab101915 |	Midas Moline
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:29,951	| radiolab101915 |	But but here's
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,463	| radiolab101915 |	Sapolsky
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:31,743	| radiolab101915 |	Ears
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:33,791	| radiolab101915 |	And this is really going may have to do
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:34,303	| radiolab101915 |	With that
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,863	| radiolab101915 |	Precarious moment when the new guy comes
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,191	| radiolab101915 |	Now normally what happens in this order status quo
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,983	| radiolab101915 |	Is it the new guy arrives and it's
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,263	| radiolab101915 |	That really bad
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:45,311	| radiolab101915 |	It's awful
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:48,383	| radiolab101915 |	Can you look at them and eat just identify with
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:51,199	| radiolab101915 |	Like freshman year of college or something
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:57,599	| radiolab101915 |	They're completely peripheral every male whose higher-ranking dumps on them
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:17:00,927	| radiolab101915 |	Baboon is completely ignored by the lady who just sit there
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:04,767	| radiolab101915 |	Somebody groom him my God I went to sophomore year until
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:07,071	| radiolab101915 |	Somebody groom him come on
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,095	| radiolab101915 |	Why don't they
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:14,495	| radiolab101915 |	Cuz they did some adult male would have attacked them hopetown ladies hang back while he's out there biting and
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:17,055	| radiolab101915 |	Incline and trying to scratch his way and we've got here
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:22,175	| radiolab101915 |	Is a cycle that is a good tip for a long long time
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:28,575	| radiolab101915 |	But if you make one small change just remove the alpha male take him out of the equation
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:34,975	| radiolab101915 |	Suddenly the females are more relaxed and more likely to take a social gamble of reaching out to some
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:41,375	| radiolab101915 |	Somebody new the key thing is the females
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,775	| radiolab101915 |	Early enough everything's different remarkable in your typical true
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:53,151	| radiolab101915 |	3 months on the average before the first female rooms in this true
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,455	| radiolab101915 |	6 days
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:57,247	| radiolab101915 |	Can I out 6 days a week
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| radiolab101915 |	Compared to 3 month
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:02,623	| radiolab101915 |	Yeah and a world in which from day one as an adolescent male you're treated better
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:05,183	| radiolab101915 |	Something about the aggressiveness melts away
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,327	| radiolab101915 |	The thing though is Jabba.
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:14,655	| radiolab101915 |	Before we get too carried away would you have to ask
EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:16,703	| radiolab101915 |	The question just how permanent is
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,727	| radiolab101915 |	Change is
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:21,823	| radiolab101915 |	As nice as it is so I explain this whole story that you just told
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:24,639	| radiolab101915 |	To a professor at Harvard named Richard wrangham
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,711	| radiolab101915 |	Brother innov-is hear music evolutionary biologist
EDL	00:18:27,711	00:18:28,735	| radiolab101915 |	Annie's chips
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:29,503	| radiolab101915 |	Particularly
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:33,343	| radiolab101915 |	But you have to know okay you heard the story about the baboons
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,879	| radiolab101915 |	What do you think
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:37,183	| radiolab101915 |	You'll know it's a nice example of the
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,975	| radiolab101915 |	Potential for some change
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,279	| radiolab101915 |	Actually we should put on resume
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,583	| radiolab101915 |	Let you know lots of balloons have been started across town
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:47,935	| radiolab101915 |	And this sort of example is never been found in a natural
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:48,447	| radiolab101915 |	Context
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:55,359	| radiolab101915 |	But I just happened to put a garbage dump
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,663	| radiolab101915 |	Text to have humans provide food the
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,431	| radiolab101915 |	Leads to
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:18:59,455	| radiolab101915 |	Several mail.
EDL	00:18:59,455	00:19:04,831	| radiolab101915 |	That means that I could imagine going on a helicopter all over Africa shooting all the alpha males
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:06,367	| radiolab101915 |	I've been giving all the ladies at
EDL	00:19:06,367	00:19:07,391	| radiolab101915 |	A chance to
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:11,743	| radiolab101915 |	Create a different baboon culture and me when I guess I'm wondering is do you think
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:16,863	| radiolab101915 |	An absurd situation like that the baboonery might change it
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,631	| radiolab101915 |	Its essential nature
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:21,983	| radiolab101915 |	I don't think it'll change it to sensual nature I can see that that can be
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,263	| radiolab101915 |	A cultural influence
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,567	| radiolab101915 |	That may lost a little bit of time
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:28,383	| radiolab101915 |	But the larger info
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,199	| radiolab101915 |	Clearly is the session of
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:34,271	| radiolab101915 |	A genes that produce a particular kind of brain
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:37,855	| radiolab101915 |	A baboon is basically a baboon until you get some kind of
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,623	| radiolab101915 |	Genetic China
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,135	| radiolab101915 |	That is
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,415	| radiolab101915 |	Something good
EDL	00:19:40,927	00:19:41,439	| radiolab101915 |	Supposed to
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,999	| radiolab101915 |	So Professor running
EDL	00:19:43,999	00:19:45,279	| radiolab101915 |	A genetic change
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:49,631	| radiolab101915 |	To make sure that this is really real permanent and here's the thing
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:53,215	| radiolab101915 |	I know this constitutes a genetic change but it has been 20
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:53,983	| radiolab101915 |	Years
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,007	| radiolab101915 |	Real yes
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:57,567	| radiolab101915 |	20 years in sapolsky original baboon troop is
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:58,079	| radiolab101915 |	Still
EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,359	| radiolab101915 |	Operating in this
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,663	| radiolab101915 |	Even though dozens of new mail
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:02,175	| radiolab101915 |	Elsa come and go
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,479	| radiolab101915 |	Any idea
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,503	| radiolab101915 |	Something that was
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:06,527	| radiolab101915 |	Miso
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,551	| radiolab101915 |	Unchanged
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,343	| radiolab101915 |	Could change
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| radiolab101915 |	And change quickly
EDL	00:20:11,391	00:20:12,671	| radiolab101915 |	And then State change
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,463	| radiolab101915 |	As a result of something so
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:17,023	| radiolab101915 |	Arie and undefinable is culture will that
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,327	| radiolab101915 |	It's caused Robert sapolsky
EDL	00:20:19,327	00:20:20,095	| radiolab101915 |	Dare I say it
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:21,119	| radiolab101915 |	2
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:23,679	| radiolab101915 |	Absolutely understand
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,959	| radiolab101915 |	Something that I Do by
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,007	| radiolab101915 |	By Nature
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:30,591	| radiolab101915 |	No not at all if you think this syllable
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,615	| radiolab101915 |	Decided
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:34,687	| radiolab101915 |	To send it to Foreign Affairs magazine
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:37,503	| radiolab101915 |	The magazine read by a lot of politicians
EDL	00:20:37,503	00:20:38,015	| radiolab101915 |	Still
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:39,807	| radiolab101915 |	They went for it
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,111	| radiolab101915 |	And so we had to ask him after it was published
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:43,647	| radiolab101915 |	Did anyone
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,183	| radiolab101915 |	Write you back
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,791	| radiolab101915 |	No basically not
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:53,631	| radiolab101915 |	I basically heard nothing from anyone now
EDL	00:20:53,631	00:20:55,679	| radiolab101915 |	Yes big yawning silence
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,959	| radiolab101915 |	III
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,775	| radiolab101915 |	I'm sure George Bush and Cheney
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:04,639	| radiolab101915 |	Rita teach evening and tremble at his implication
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,967	| radiolab101915 |	No basically as far as I can tell it was a huge waste of time for me to write it
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:11,039	| radiolab101915 |	Well we're at it
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:15,391	| radiolab101915 |	My mother didn't even
EDL	00:21:17,440	00:21:18,720	| radiolab101915 |	Alright so
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,512	| radiolab101915 |	7 years
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:22,560	| radiolab101915 |	Past as we've mentioned and so we say
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:24,096	| radiolab101915 |	Decided that it was only right for us.
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:24,864	| radiolab101915 |	The catch up with rabbits
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:29,216	| radiolab101915 |	Hello hello
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:32,288	| radiolab101915 |	You know we're trying to close a window here to
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:33,568	| radiolab101915 |	Increasing noise
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,688	| radiolab101915 |	We found him in a very odd place
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:40,224	| radiolab101915 |	Actually a for a Baboons
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:42,784	| radiolab101915 |	Play this in the library of the middle school with
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| radiolab101915 |	A bunch of kids outside
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:50,720	| radiolab101915 |	How did that happen cuz wife now directs the musical theater Productions
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,488	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:54,304	| radiolab101915 |	Somehow I'm playing piano is rehearsal pianist at this
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:56,096	| radiolab101915 |	School with the musical
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:58,912	| radiolab101915 |	We are doing Oliver this year
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:21:59,936	| radiolab101915 |	Really
EDL	00:22:01,472	00:22:04,544	| radiolab101915 |	I just had nothing to do with me or queso
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:05,568	| radiolab101915 |	Anyway so
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:10,176	| radiolab101915 |	I told Robert that we talked to Richard wrangham reminded him
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:14,272	| radiolab101915 |	Ryan says no no baboons are hardwired to be a certain way in
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,344	| radiolab101915 |	And circumstances never going to change them in
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,368	| radiolab101915 |	Yep
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:20,416	| radiolab101915 |	He and I are
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,464	| radiolab101915 |	This isn't the first time we've
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:23,232	| radiolab101915 |	Disagreed
EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:25,792	| radiolab101915 |	And I think we probably had a we shall see sort of finish
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:33,216	| radiolab101915 |	So what what have we seen since you guys talked about what's been happening yeah what's been happening as well they were
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,496	| radiolab101915 |	A few possibilities
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:35,776	| radiolab101915 |	There's
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:38,080	| radiolab101915 |	One scenario where
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:40,640	| radiolab101915 |	It could have turned into exactly what was
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,944	| radiolab101915 |	Being predicted there which was that the
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:44,224	| radiolab101915 |	Troopers go back to you
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:45,760	| radiolab101915 |	Being a
EDL	00:22:45,760	00:22:48,832	| radiolab101915 |	Typical highly aggressive baboon Troop
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:52,160	| radiolab101915 |	The other possibility is the one that I was always like
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:52,928	| radiolab101915 |	Dreaming of
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,208	| radiolab101915 |	Which is
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,000	| radiolab101915 |	So you're a
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,536	| radiolab101915 |	Kid who's grown up in that
EDL	00:22:57,536	00:22:59,072	| radiolab101915 |	True band you
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,632	| radiolab101915 |	Grown up on the Communists are and
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:03,680	| radiolab101915 |	Along Comes puberty and it's time for you to
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,472	| radiolab101915 |	To pick up and you move to a different route
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:09,824	| radiolab101915 |	And what happens when the kids who grew up in this baboon culture
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:11,104	| radiolab101915 |	Switch to other Troop
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:16,736	| radiolab101915 |	Not supposed to eat miss it if just one baboon from the nice if you went off to join the menes Heap
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,528	| radiolab101915 |	Probably get his ass kicked but he thinks
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:20,576	| radiolab101915 |	How did you get to nice
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:21,600	| radiolab101915 |	Balloons together
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:23,392	| radiolab101915 |	Make a little bit of a team
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,672	| radiolab101915 |	Arabic language
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:26,208	| radiolab101915 |	Critical mass of niceness
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:26,720	| radiolab101915 |	I just might
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,000	| radiolab101915 |	Red
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,792	| radiolab101915 |	And turn all the other guys nice
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,072	| radiolab101915 |	In principle this
EDL	00:23:31,072	00:23:33,120	| radiolab101915 |	Like great unique
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:35,680	| radiolab101915 |	Pacific culture in these baboons
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:37,216	| radiolab101915 |	Could be transmissible
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:38,752	| radiolab101915 |	Who in Siri
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:41,824	| radiolab101915 |	Okay well don't leave us hanging I got what
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,336	| radiolab101915 |	Has happy
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:46,176	| radiolab101915 |	Okay so what actually happened is pretty
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:47,456	| radiolab101915 |	Damn Grimm
EDL	00:23:48,480	00:23:50,528	| radiolab101915 |	Did they did they go back to being mean
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:56,672	| radiolab101915 |	In substance is really worse than that number how this whole thing begins because there's a troop next to sapolsky
EDL	00:23:57,440	00:23:58,976	| radiolab101915 |	I may be eating garbage
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:00,256	| radiolab101915 |	In a garbage dump
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:02,816	| radiolab101915 |	Eventually sapolsky
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,376	| radiolab101915 |	But now the garbage dump is open and available
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:09,216	| radiolab101915 |	They went over there and began looking at the tourist Lodge
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,520	| radiolab101915 |	And just living off of garbage now they just
EDL	00:24:13,056	00:24:13,824	| radiolab101915 |	With the garbage
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,104	| radiolab101915 |	And essentially
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:17,408	| radiolab101915 |	Stopped functioning as a coherent truth
EDL	00:24:17,920	00:24:23,040	| radiolab101915 |	So this question will they all become nice baboons eventually or will they all revert back to
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:24,320	| radiolab101915 |	To being mean baboon
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,624	| radiolab101915 |	That. Totally trumped by
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,392	| radiolab101915 |	The garbage
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:30,464	| radiolab101915 |	There was so much food.
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,232	| radiolab101915 |	Need for these baboons
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:35,840	| radiolab101915 |	Hakeem so free and so available that the natural business of baboonery
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,376	| radiolab101915 |	Just broke down
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:41,216	| radiolab101915 |	Lot of males around that being killed by game Park Rangers there because
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:45,056	| radiolab101915 |	As per usual with a sort of thing they got dangerous to the humans
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,336	| radiolab101915 |	There because
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,360	| radiolab101915 |	They got to habituate
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:47,872	| radiolab101915 |	The humans
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:50,432	| radiolab101915 |	So lots of males were killed
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,992	| radiolab101915 |	The rest of the troupe is
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:55,040	| radiolab101915 |	Defragment it so
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| radiolab101915 |	I never
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,344	| radiolab101915 |	Got to find out what
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:58,624	| radiolab101915 |	What happened in the long run
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,672	| radiolab101915 |	Cuz the garbage got in the way again
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:01,184	| radiolab101915 |	Yep
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,744	| radiolab101915 |	Exactly that's simulator I've seen you at
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:07,072	| radiolab101915 |	What's the troubling thing here for me is that how you know there was
EDL	00:25:07,072	00:25:09,120	| radiolab101915 |	Traditional baboon culture which was
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| radiolab101915 |	Violin hierarchy
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,168	| radiolab101915 |	Call there was this
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,192	| radiolab101915 |	Hint of a hope
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:13,728	| radiolab101915 |	Have a different
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:15,264	| radiolab101915 |	Baboon culture which was
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,544	| radiolab101915 |	Grooming and happiness
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:20,640	| radiolab101915 |	And we had a question about which one of those two would spread or
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,664	| radiolab101915 |	Last
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:25,760	| radiolab101915 |	But the truth is they ran into some junk food and then they have no culture
EDL	00:25:25,760	00:25:29,856	| radiolab101915 |	Exactly what I had to say it that sounds depressingly like America
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:30,880	| radiolab101915 |	Yeah
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| radiolab101915 |	Unders
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:36,768	| radiolab101915 |	Bunches of them still there I'm sure as we speak actually not as we speak but
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,328	| radiolab101915 |	10 hours from now to philby
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,632	| radiolab101915 |	Waddling / 2
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:46,240	| radiolab101915 |	Get some leftovers they're probably not missing the culture that they had but
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:48,288	| radiolab101915 |	Yeah those were my guys
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:53,408	| radiolab101915 |	I had my last season out there for years ago and haven't been back since
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| radiolab101915 |	To quote a
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,880	| radiolab101915 |	We would do anything
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:03,648	| radiolab101915 |	For you any
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,024	| radiolab101915 |	Where is daffodil
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,608	| radiolab101915 |	So you just so you know
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,936	| radiolab101915 |	View all I will
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:17,984	| radiolab101915 |	Okay
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,264	| radiolab101915 |	Oh God

EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:17,888	| radiolab101915 |	For those of you who spend a lot of time with kids parents aunts and uncles teachers
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,960	| radiolab101915 |	We're looking for stories about what we're calling tiny moments
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,984	| radiolab101915 |	Brilliance
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:24,032	| radiolab101915 |	Basically I want to hear about this
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,592	| radiolab101915 |	Times when a kid you know did something
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,640	| radiolab101915 |	It just means you lean back and say
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:29,920	| radiolab101915 |	Well
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,688	| radiolab101915 |	How did they do that
EDL	00:27:31,200	00:27:32,736	| radiolab101915 |	Maybe it was the moment that I
EDL	00:27:32,736	00:27:35,808	| radiolab101915 |	Kids started reading back
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,576	| radiolab101915 |	Do you
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,880	| radiolab101915 |	Or maybe the kid was a piano lesson
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:42,976	| radiolab101915 |	And you suddenly noticed they were doing advanced math on the margin of their musical score
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:47,840	| radiolab101915 |	Or maybe the kids in math class you noticed they're writing music in the margin of their geometry homework
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:53,728	| radiolab101915 |	We're interested in the small specific moments where a kid does something super smart
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,520	| radiolab101915 |	It doesn't have anything to do with it
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,312	| radiolab101915 |	If you have a story

EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:30,592	| radiolab101915 |	With a way we are is that the way we're going to stay
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:37,504	| radiolab101915 |	A very nicely but here in the last section we were talking about a baboon and their propensity to Sirius
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,808	| radiolab101915 |	Maybe or maybe not we don't
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:42,112	| radiolab101915 |	Really no
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:48,512	| radiolab101915 |	Blitz which R8 will go to Oregonian or just a rare subset of human being
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:50,816	| radiolab101915 |	Set up we were thinking a lot about
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:52,352	| radiolab101915 |	Small groups
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:52,864	| radiolab101915 |	On the show
EDL	00:28:53,376	00:28:55,424	| radiolab101915 |	Yeah cuz that's what we are we are small group primates
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:58,496	| radiolab101915 |	The phrase sometimes used to describe humans
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,520	| radiolab101915 |	And it's a phrase
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:02,336	| radiolab101915 |	Carry some negative connotation
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:07,456	| radiolab101915 |	As involved in these small groups that we are predisposed to be small-minded no
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,248	| radiolab101915 |	Small is not always a bad thing
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,784	| radiolab101915 |	I tell you story now this
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,552	| radiolab101915 |	The small groups
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:13,856	| radiolab101915 |	Story it's just as a warning
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:15,904	| radiolab101915 |	Contains graphic
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,440	| radiolab101915 |	But
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,280	| radiolab101915 |	We hope you'll stick with it cuz it's a really cool story takes place in a small town
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:29,984	| radiolab101915 |	You can dial the wrong number and still have a conversation
EDL	00:29:29,984	00:29:31,520	| radiolab101915 |	So tell me where we are in end
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:35,360	| radiolab101915 |	Downtown Silverton
EDL	00:29:35,360	00:29:38,176	| radiolab101915 |	Essentially our downtown is not changed since the
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:41,248	| radiolab101915 |	Late 40s early 50s
EDL	00:29:41,248	00:29:44,832	| radiolab101915 |	But we'll get to that this is Stu Rasmussen either main character
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:48,160	| radiolab101915 |	A little while back still gave myself and producer Aaron Scott
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:52,000	| radiolab101915 |	A tour movie theater on the corner of the old hardware store on this corner
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:54,304	| radiolab101915 |	This builder of his favorite place on Earth

EDL	00:29:57,120	00:30:01,216	| radiolab101915 |	Top 40 years for Portland actually you know it's the town I grew up in
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:08,384	| radiolab101915 |	My image for what I want silver going to be no I rode my bicycle down the street and came to the hardware store tea
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:14,528	| radiolab101915 |	How are you and wave all the time it's a small town everybody knows me
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,064	| radiolab101915 |	Ifrit
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,576	| radiolab101915 |	Stu
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:18,368	| radiolab101915 |	This time would never change
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:20,160	| radiolab101915 |	You would stay frozen in that quaint
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,488	| radiolab101915 |	Norman Rockwell candy-coated image
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:25,280	| radiolab101915 |	I'm his boy had the weird thing though
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,328	| radiolab101915 |	Is it that image in his head
EDL	00:30:27,840	00:30:29,888	| radiolab101915 |	Would probably never have included a guy likes
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,216	| radiolab101915 |	At least do as he is now

EDL	00:37:12,320	00:37:13,344	| radiolab101915 |	Hanging off his chest

EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:08,896	| radiolab101915 |	Somehow
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:11,712	| radiolab101915 |	It's just trying to
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:16,064	| radiolab101915 |	Fulfill that body image he's got in his head
EDL	00:38:16,064	00:38:16,576	| radiolab101915 |	West York
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:17,856	| radiolab101915 |	Body image
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:19,136	| radiolab101915 |	Mate
EDL	00:38:19,648	00:38:20,160	| radiolab101915 |	As I've been difficult
EDL	00:38:26,304	00:38:26,816	| radiolab101915 |	No
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:33,472	| radiolab101915 |	No I'm sorry it if you if you want to get kinky about it
EDL	00:38:33,472	00:38:34,752	| radiolab101915 |	A man with
EDL	00:38:34,752	00:38:35,264	| radiolab101915 |	Chronicle
EDL	00:38:37,824	00:38:38,336	| radiolab101915 |	Okay
EDL	00:38:38,848	00:38:39,616	| radiolab101915 |	Did the
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:41,152	| radiolab101915 |	Was there ever any
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:41,920	| radiolab101915 |	Concern
EDL	00:38:41,920	00:38:45,248	| radiolab101915 |	There was for me not so much force to I think
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:50,112	| radiolab101915 |	Partly because he didn't hear as many Whispers as I felt I did
EDL	00:38:50,624	00:38:51,392	| radiolab101915 |	But
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,696	| radiolab101915 |	I was concerned for the theater business
EDL	00:38:53,696	00:38:54,720	| radiolab101915 |	Not without reason
EDL	00:38:55,488	00:39:01,888	| radiolab101915 |	A lot of kids in the town stop coming to the theater cuz their parents wouldn't let him take his health to go ahead and
EDL	00:39:01,888	00:39:08,288	| radiolab101915 |	Wasn't long before pickup trucks full of teenage boys with drive-by the theater yelling slurs
EDL	00:39:08,288	00:39:09,312	| radiolab101915 |	Well yeah I guess
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:10,336	| radiolab101915 |	I guess
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:12,640	| radiolab101915 |	Fagedes
EDL	00:39:13,152	00:39:15,712	| radiolab101915 |	Fleur I guess so you get to this point in the
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:19,808	| radiolab101915 |	Sped up movie narrative UPS to this point right here we're even
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:22,112	| radiolab101915 |	Though he took it so slowly
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:22,880	| radiolab101915 |	So careful
EDL	00:39:23,648	00:39:24,672	| radiolab101915 |	It's still
EDL	00:39:24,672	00:39:31,072	| radiolab101915 |	Easy to imagine things turning ugly I don't know what was that movie about the boy that was Beno draw
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:37,216	| radiolab101915 |	Dragon Beat to Death because he was gay in a small town in the midwest you know what a voice.
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:44,128	| radiolab101915 |	According to Linda Webb silverton's not so different from Laramie Wyoming where Matthew Shepard lived it's a small town
EDL	00:39:44,128	00:39:50,528	| radiolab101915 |	Very traditional very conservative
EDL	00:39:50,528	00:39:52,832	| radiolab101915 |	To expect the worst but here's the surprise
EDL	00:39:54,880	00:39:56,672	| radiolab101915 |	And the whole reason we came here so rude
EDL	00:39:56,672	00:39:57,440	| radiolab101915 |	Monday January
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:03,584	| radiolab101915 |	The worst did not happen
EDL	00:40:03,584	00:40:09,216	| radiolab101915 |	It was no redneck rebellion in fact the opposite happened
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:11,008	| radiolab101915 |	Something historic
EDL	00:40:11,520	00:40:12,032	| radiolab101915 |	I
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:16,896	| radiolab101915 |	High on January 5th 2009 the town of Silverton elected stew
EDL	00:40:17,664	00:40:24,064	| radiolab101915 |	Mayor of the city of Silverton Marion County Oregon congratulations
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:30,464	| radiolab101915 |	Silverton has a length of a nation's first openly transgender mayor directions first openly
EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:36,864	| radiolab101915 |	Transgender man
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:43,264	| radiolab101915 |	Transgender in heels
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:49,664	| radiolab101915 |	Speaking of the sound of
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:52,480	| radiolab101915 |	Stew's 4 inch heels pounding on linoleum
EDL	00:40:52,480	00:40:54,272	| radiolab101915 |	Is he goes to city council meeting
EDL	00:40:54,272	00:40:54,784	| radiolab101915 |	O'Hara
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,088	| radiolab101915 |	Couldn't be better how are you
EDL	00:40:57,856	00:41:00,160	| radiolab101915 |	Nicole Wallace
EDL	00:41:00,160	00:41:01,184	| radiolab101915 |	You know
EDL	00:41:01,184	00:41:05,792	| radiolab101915 |	City elitist or whatever but I met her in a plunging v-neck sweater and a black mini skirt
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:07,328	| radiolab101915 |	Not what you would expect
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:09,376	| radiolab101915 |	A tiny Conservative Republican town
EDL	00:41:10,144	00:41:10,912	| radiolab101915 |	So we want to know
EDL	00:41:11,424	00:41:12,448	| radiolab101915 |	Your why did this happen
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:15,264	| radiolab101915 |	Co-producer Aaron Scott and I walked around town for a couple days
EDL	00:41:16,544	00:41:18,592	| radiolab101915 |	And we interviewed dozens of people including
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:21,664	| radiolab101915 |	Guy named Ken Hector
EDL	00:41:21,664	00:41:22,944	| radiolab101915 |	Beat out from there
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:26,272	| radiolab101915 |	He's a Conservative Republican definitely not one of those big fans
EDL	00:41:26,272	00:41:29,088	| radiolab101915 |	It was just a difference in philosophy about
EDL	00:41:29,856	00:41:33,184	| radiolab101915 |	I don't want to sound pretentious but you know as a mayor I think they're certain extra
EDL	00:41:33,184	00:41:33,952	| radiolab101915 |	Haitians
EDL	00:41:33,952	00:41:36,000	| radiolab101915 |	About professionalism of that
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:37,024	| radiolab101915 |	You should exhibit
EDL	00:41:37,024	00:41:38,048	| radiolab101915 |	He would come in
EDL	00:41:38,048	00:41:38,560	| radiolab101915 |	Where at
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,096	| radiolab101915 |	Appetite
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,120	| radiolab101915 |	Cleaning copper
EDL	00:41:41,120	00:41:41,888	| radiolab101915 |	Cleavage down to here
EDL	00:41:42,400	00:41:43,936	| radiolab101915 |	You're almost point of your belly button
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:49,056	| radiolab101915 |	Come on you know when you're at the council meeting show some dignity here and just
EDL	00:41:49,824	00:41:50,336	| radiolab101915 |	Dress
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:52,895	| radiolab101915 |	In the appropriate attire for the occasion
EDL	00:41:53,407	00:41:56,735	| radiolab101915 |	Can even try to get the city council to impose a dress code
EDL	00:41:57,759	00:42:00,063	| radiolab101915 |	But when we asked him you know are you surprised
EDL	00:42:00,575	00:42:01,343	| radiolab101915 |	The town has
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:01,855	| radiolab101915 |	Embraced
EDL	00:42:02,623	00:42:04,159	| radiolab101915 |	And even got so far to elect a mayor
EDL	00:42:05,183	00:42:06,463	| radiolab101915 |	He said
EDL	00:42:06,463	00:42:11,583	| radiolab101915 |	No news of Rarity in that you know there's a lot of people in this town
EDL	00:42:11,583	00:42:13,119	| radiolab101915 |	Extremely religious
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:14,655	| radiolab101915 |	Very conservative people
EDL	00:42:14,655	00:42:16,447	| radiolab101915 |	Word a stranger
EDL	00:42:16,447	00:42:22,335	| radiolab101915 |	Who came into town suddenly I'm sure the support and perception might have been different but you're talking about a Native Son
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:23,615	| radiolab101915 |	Who grew up
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:26,687	| radiolab101915 |	He said
EDL	00:42:26,687	00:42:31,807	| radiolab101915 |	Who runs the only theater in town so he's out there every weekend standing out from the Palace Theater
EDL	00:42:31,807	00:42:34,111	| radiolab101915 |	Taking tickets to everybody knows
EDL	00:42:34,623	00:42:36,927	| radiolab101915 |	Back in the day we used to be the Cable Guy
EDL	00:42:38,719	00:42:41,023	| radiolab101915 |	Play home is still the guy you call here
EDL	00:42:41,023	00:42:43,583	| radiolab101915 |	Your computer so it might sound strange to you but it's
EDL	00:42:45,375	00:42:46,655	| radiolab101915 |	And that is when it hit me
EDL	00:42:47,935	00:42:48,703	| radiolab101915 |	Actually
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:50,751	| radiolab101915 |	Under the right circumstances
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:53,055	| radiolab101915 |	Small town could be like the most
EDL	00:42:53,055	00:42:54,079	| radiolab101915 |	Progressive place on Earth
EDL	00:42:57,151	00:43:00,991	| radiolab101915 |	And it's exactly because everyone's all up in your grill
EDL	00:43:01,503	00:43:03,039	| radiolab101915 |	You are forced to know people
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:05,855	| radiolab101915 |	Like stew
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:06,879	| radiolab101915 |	Oh my goodness
EDL	00:43:06,879	00:43:08,159	| radiolab101915 |	I grew up with stew
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:13,279	| radiolab101915 |	Amy I remember when stool is like an altar boy at the church as my brother
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:15,071	| radiolab101915 |	This is Susie team
EDL	00:43:15,071	00:43:17,631	| radiolab101915 |	Retired teacher his parents and my parents
EDL	00:43:18,143	00:43:23,519	| radiolab101915 |	Like a lot of folks and silver 10 she is known stew for so long and so many different contexts
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:29,663	| radiolab101915 |	But you can't do that New York thing with him where you like you see someone on the sidewalk and you size them up instantly and thinking
EDL	00:43:29,663	00:43:31,711	| radiolab101915 |	Now after he's way too complicated
EDL	00:43:31,711	00:43:38,111	| radiolab101915 |	Note to her he's do the Altar Boys do the computer geek
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:44,511	| radiolab101915 |	City councilman sue the mayor or just
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:47,583	| radiolab101915 |	Do whatever
EDL	00:43:47,583	00:43:50,911	| radiolab101915 |	Go on about your business at the people we talked to
EDL	00:43:51,935	00:43:53,727	| radiolab101915 |	Effects of the same folks who said
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:43:55,007	| radiolab101915 |	Yes just do
EDL	00:43:55,007	00:43:56,799	| radiolab101915 |	You are still not happy about the
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:58,335	| radiolab101915 |	The situation no I mean
EDL	00:43:58,335	00:44:00,127	| radiolab101915 |	I don't think God's a crossdresser
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:01,919	| radiolab101915 |	The other felt it was morally wrong
EDL	00:44:01,919	00:44:03,199	| radiolab101915 |	As in the case of this Menace
EDL	00:44:03,199	00:44:05,247	| radiolab101915 |	Genesis 1
EDL	00:44:05,247	00:44:08,319	| radiolab101915 |	27 says so God created man in his own image
EDL	00:44:09,087	00:44:12,927	| radiolab101915 |	In the a.m. or some folks like Linda Webb husband John
EDL	00:44:12,927	00:44:16,255	| radiolab101915 |	Just felt like he takes it way too far right there it's in your face
EDL	00:44:16,767	00:44:19,327	| radiolab101915 |	He dresses kind of like a streetwalker
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:21,887	| radiolab101915 |	You feel that that's confrontational baidu
EDL	00:44:21,887	00:44:26,495	| radiolab101915 |	The most of the people who had objections it was a little more nuanced
EDL	00:44:26,495	00:44:27,519	| radiolab101915 |	It went something like this
EDL	00:44:27,519	00:44:32,127	| radiolab101915 |	Well I buy personally did not vote for him for mayor because I didn't feel it was
EDL	00:44:32,127	00:44:33,407	| radiolab101915 |	Good idea to
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:34,687	| radiolab101915 |	Have someone
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:35,455	| radiolab101915 |	That look
EDL	00:44:35,455	00:44:37,759	| radiolab101915 |	Like that representing us but on the other hand
EDL	00:44:38,271	00:44:41,343	| radiolab101915 |	He is a good man and he's got this town at heart
EDL	00:44:41,343	00:44:44,159	| radiolab101915 |	Another rights according to John but really isn't stew
EDL	00:44:44,159	00:44:44,671	| radiolab101915 |	Where the town
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:46,463	| radiolab101915 |	It's the outside
EDL	00:44:46,975	00:44:49,023	| radiolab101915 |	All those people out there who are going to hear about
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:50,815	| radiolab101915 |	And then judged
EDL	00:44:54,399	00:44:56,959	| radiolab101915 |	Which is what makes November 25th 2008
EDL	00:44:57,471	00:44:59,007	| radiolab101915 |	Such an interesting day
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,055	| radiolab101915 |	Stupid just been elected mayor
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:03,359	| radiolab101915 |	Squeaked It Out by about 400 votes
EDL	00:45:03,359	00:45:04,639	| radiolab101915 |	But he hadn't yet been sworn in
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:11,039	| radiolab101915 |	When a group of Christian extremist from Kansas showed up and down and started marching up and down Main Street
EDL	00:45:11,039	00:45:11,551	| radiolab101915 |	Yelling at the
EDL	00:45:12,319	00:45:15,903	| radiolab101915 |	And at one point that you can unfrozen American flag put it on the ground
EDL	00:45:15,903	00:45:16,671	| radiolab101915 |	And stepped on it
EDL	00:45:17,439	00:45:23,583	| radiolab101915 |	Just to show how expensive it sounds good
EDL	00:45:28,703	00:45:29,471	| radiolab101915 |	Cuz they
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:33,567	| radiolab101915 |	Will not by any means warn him about to send this taking him to hell
EDL	00:45:33,567	00:45:39,967	| radiolab101915 |	So unpleasant and then bringing up signs that say things like God hates over tank God hate
EDL	00:45:39,967	00:45:46,367	| radiolab101915 |	It's your man. Hates f*** your pastor is a hore
EDL	00:45:46,367	00:45:52,767	| radiolab101915 |	The opposite sex from the town decided to start a counter protest
EDL	00:45:52,767	00:45:53,791	| radiolab101915 |	Stood
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:56,607	| radiolab101915 |	Across the street from these people by and large
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:57,375	| radiolab101915 |	Just a few guys
EDL	00:45:58,143	00:46:04,543	| radiolab101915 |	No earlier someone it suggests all the guys out to dress up as girls and all the girls I did dress up these guys and gassy Davidson
EDL	00:46:04,543	00:46:05,567	| radiolab101915 |	Said his initial reaction was
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:06,591	| radiolab101915 |	Yeah right
EDL	00:46:07,615	00:46:08,383	| radiolab101915 |	Very was
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:14,527	| radiolab101915 |	Address
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:18,623	| radiolab101915 |	He said that at first he in the two or three other guys who had on women's clothing
EDL	00:46:19,135	00:46:20,159	| radiolab101915 |	Felt a little weird
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:23,743	| radiolab101915 |	But then
EDL	00:46:23,743	00:46:30,143	| radiolab101915 |	People just started coming and was just amazed
EDL	00:46:30,143	00:46:36,543	| radiolab101915 |	Amazing of a couple of hundred people I mean men dress like women who dress like men some of the people that I sat down there
EDL	00:46:36,543	00:46:38,079	| radiolab101915 |	What's surprising
EDL	00:46:38,079	00:46:44,479	| radiolab101915 |	Because I had labeled them in my head as conservative people drive by
EDL	00:46:44,479	00:46:50,879	| radiolab101915 |	People signs got love sort of God loves to with costumes the town
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:57,279	| radiolab101915 |	Really lie about your gut getting bigger and bigger thinking that moment
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:59,327	| radiolab101915 |	Understand you were standing off to the side just watching
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,607	| radiolab101915 |	What's going through your mind
EDL	00:47:00,607	00:47:04,959	| radiolab101915 |	Yeah well honestly I tried to discourage people from even giving them the time of day saying
EDL	00:47:04,959	00:47:06,239	| radiolab101915 |	Don't give him any attention
EDL	00:47:06,751	00:47:07,519	| radiolab101915 |	I couldn't
EDL	00:47:07,519	00:47:08,031	| radiolab101915 |	Get that.
EDL	00:47:09,055	00:47:10,335	| radiolab101915 |	They were so angry
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:15,199	| radiolab101915 |	They they came out
EDL	00:47:16,223	00:47:16,991	| radiolab101915 |	200 people
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:18,783	| radiolab101915 |	Minute dresses
EDL	00:47:18,783	00:47:20,063	| radiolab101915 |	Grandmother's babies
EDL	00:47:27,743	00:47:28,511	| radiolab101915 |	It's just amazing
EDL	00:47:30,047	00:47:32,095	| radiolab101915 |	That was the town that wasn't me
EDL	00:47:41,311	00:47:42,079	| radiolab101915 |	Sorry I guess
EDL	00:47:42,079	00:47:42,847	| radiolab101915 |	Emotional
EDL	00:47:44,895	00:47:46,431	| radiolab101915 |	That must have been a turning point for you
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:50,015	| radiolab101915 |	The biggest one
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:48:01,791	| radiolab101915 |	Frost Aaron Scott who did a huge chunk of the reporting for that piece and co-produced it with me
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:03,071	| radiolab101915 |	We'll be right back
EDL	00:48:05,375	00:48:07,679	| radiolab101915 |	Okay so that story with we did that about
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:08,191	| radiolab101915 |	6
EDL	00:48:08,703	00:48:09,471	| radiolab101915 |	7 years ago
EDL	00:48:12,031	00:48:12,799	| radiolab101915 |	The world is different
EDL	00:48:14,079	00:48:14,591	| radiolab101915 |	Like what
EDL	00:48:15,103	00:48:16,127	| radiolab101915 |	Regards to transgender
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:17,663	| radiolab101915 |	The language we use
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:21,247	| radiolab101915 |	Change it back then we said transgendered
EDL	00:48:22,015	00:48:22,527	| radiolab101915 |	And now we would
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:23,807	| radiolab101915 |	Transgender
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:27,647	| radiolab101915 |	But with Caitlyn Jenner in the news and all the stuff we
EDL	00:48:27,647	00:48:28,415	| radiolab101915 |	Stadt
EDL	00:48:28,415	00:48:29,183	| radiolab101915 |	Wondered like
EDL	00:48:29,951	00:48:32,255	| radiolab101915 |	How have things changed for stew in these left
EDL	00:48:32,767	00:48:33,279	| radiolab101915 |	6-7 years
EDL	00:48:34,047	00:48:38,911	| radiolab101915 |	So hello
EDL	00:48:38,911	00:48:41,983	| radiolab101915 |	We decided to send producer reporter Erin Scott
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:42,751	| radiolab101915 |	Back to Silver
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:46,591	| radiolab101915 |	Sit down with Stu EyeMasters partner Victoria
EDL	00:48:47,871	00:48:49,151	| radiolab101915 |	Just to catch up
EDL	00:48:49,151	00:48:50,687	| radiolab101915 |	I mean it's been 7 years
EDL	00:48:50,687	00:48:53,759	| radiolab101915 |	Since I will be going on seven years six years
EDL	00:48:53,759	00:48:56,319	| radiolab101915 |	Since we were in the store the first time
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:57,343	| radiolab101915 |	Going on in your world
EDL	00:48:58,623	00:48:59,903	| radiolab101915 |	Well since the election that's
EDL	00:49:00,927	00:49:06,303	| radiolab101915 |	So the first thing you told me was that he got re-elected after 2 years and then he was re-elected again
EDL	00:49:06,815	00:49:07,583	| radiolab101915 |	And then
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:08,351	| radiolab101915 |	Actress
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:09,375	| radiolab101915 |	6 years of marriage
EDL	00:49:09,887	00:49:13,727	| radiolab101915 |	You know out of the game hello you
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:15,775	| radiolab101915 |	I have truly enjoying my vacation
EDL	00:49:15,775	00:49:19,871	| radiolab101915 |	I need to tell me the back when the story first aired things did get
EDL	00:49:19,871	00:49:20,639	| radiolab101915 |	Kinda nutty
EDL	00:49:20,639	00:49:27,039	| radiolab101915 |	Well you know it's probably the most unusual phone call we've ever received Victoria net worth
EDL	00:49:27,039	00:49:29,343	| radiolab101915 |	Sitting at home the phone rang and it was a fellow
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:33,439	| radiolab101915 |	From New York City who said I was bicycling in on Manhattan
EDL	00:49:33,439	00:49:35,999	| radiolab101915 |	Listening to the original Radio Lab piece
EDL	00:49:36,511	00:49:37,279	| radiolab101915 |	And
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:42,143	| radiolab101915 |	He thought it would be really fun to do my life story as a musical
EDL	00:49:42,143	00:49:45,983	| radiolab101915 |	But I know it's a big deal
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:46,751	| radiolab101915 |	Any dip
EDL	00:49:46,751	00:49:51,359	| radiolab101915 |	That fella was Andrew Russell he put on a big production up in Seattle it got standing ovation
EDL	00:49:51,871	00:49:52,639	| radiolab101915 |	The most
EDL	00:49:52,639	00:49:54,175	| radiolab101915 |	Surreal and bizarre
EDL	00:49:54,175	00:49:58,783	| radiolab101915 |	Experience in my life sitting in an auditorium with 400 strangers watching as
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:00,575	| radiolab101915 |	In song and dance
EDL	00:50:00,575	00:50:01,855	| radiolab101915 |	My life goes by
EDL	00:50:01,855	00:50:02,879	| radiolab101915 |	You can call me
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,927	| radiolab101915 |	And she can call me
EDL	00:50:06,463	00:50:06,975	| radiolab101915 |	Can call me
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:08,767	| radiolab101915 |	You can call me
EDL	00:50:10,303	00:50:11,071	| radiolab101915 |	You can call me
EDL	00:50:12,351	00:50:14,911	| radiolab101915 |	Can call me she went
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:20,543	| radiolab101915 |	So there is this musical which seemed to do pretty well and then
EDL	00:50:21,055	00:50:23,103	| radiolab101915 |	A movie producer called them up and said that
EDL	00:50:23,615	00:50:26,175	| radiolab101915 |	You wanted to options to his wife for a movie
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:29,247	| radiolab101915 |	And now Victoria says those Whispers that they used to get
EDL	00:50:29,247	00:50:31,039	| radiolab101915 |	Those have turned into people wanting
EDL	00:50:31,039	00:50:31,807	| radiolab101915 |	Autograph
EDL	00:50:31,807	00:50:34,879	| radiolab101915 |	We're stopping them in the shoe store and saying you stew
EDL	00:50:35,391	00:50:38,207	| radiolab101915 |	Are true that beer can I get a picture with you
EDL	00:50:38,207	00:50:39,231	| radiolab101915 |	What's sure
EDL	00:50:39,743	00:50:40,255	| radiolab101915 |	Really
EDL	00:50:40,767	00:50:42,047	| radiolab101915 |	What's the big deal
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:47,935	| radiolab101915 |	But one of the most interesting things for me was that a lot of that attention was at the beginning
EDL	00:50:48,447	00:50:49,727	| radiolab101915 |	These states two sides
EDL	00:50:49,727	00:50:51,519	| radiolab101915 |	You know he's transgender issues him
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:54,335	| radiolab101915 |	Grown in in the national news
EDL	00:50:54,335	00:50:55,871	| radiolab101915 |	The ad on TV shows
EDL	00:50:56,383	00:50:57,407	| radiolab101915 |	Deuces the
EDL	00:50:57,407	00:50:59,199	| radiolab101915 |	Back in Silverton
EDL	00:50:59,199	00:51:00,991	| radiolab101915 |	Cities transgender
EDL	00:51:00,991	00:51:02,783	| radiolab101915 |	Becoming pretty much passe
EDL	00:51:03,807	00:51:04,319	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:51:04,831	00:51:05,599	| radiolab101915 |	Here we are
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:10,207	| radiolab101915 |	You says it's just kind of routine now
EDL	00:51:10,207	00:51:11,231	| radiolab101915 |	For him and everyone else
EDL	00:51:12,511	00:51:15,327	| radiolab101915 |	Except he did say there's this one thing
EDL	00:51:15,327	00:51:19,423	| radiolab101915 |	Every time the story are their rears which it does from time to time
EDL	00:51:19,423	00:51:20,959	| radiolab101915 |	When it when it goes
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:22,495	| radiolab101915 |	The phone starts ringing a week
EDL	00:51:22,495	00:51:27,359	| radiolab101915 |	Tell where it's from he says he gets these calls from people who are struggling with their own gender issues
EDL	00:51:28,127	00:51:29,919	| radiolab101915 |	We're trying to figure out how to come out to their family
EDL	00:51:30,431	00:51:36,831	| radiolab101915 |	And people actually call your home phone usually anonymously they won't identify themselves necessarily because they're still
EDL	00:51:36,831	00:51:39,903	| radiolab101915 |	He'll either closeted or not really ready to come out there saying
EDL	00:51:39,903	00:51:41,951	| radiolab101915 |	Thank you so much for being yourself
EDL	00:51:41,951	00:51:44,767	| radiolab101915 |	And for telling your story to other so that I can
EDL	00:51:45,279	00:51:47,583	| radiolab101915 |	You know I can validate my life from that thank you
EDL	00:51:48,863	00:51:51,679	| radiolab101915 |	Does that ever get old
EDL	00:51:52,447	00:51:53,471	| radiolab101915 |	No
EDL	00:51:53,983	00:51:58,591	| radiolab101915 |	For somebody who was in the position that I wasn't made the change and then to have other people
EDL	00:51:59,103	00:52:00,639	| radiolab101915 |	Either following along or
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:03,967	| radiolab101915 |	Emulating in one way or another
EDL	00:52:03,967	00:52:08,831	| radiolab101915 |	Is very gratifying because it validates my life and it says why you weren't a complete waste of time
EDL	00:52:10,623	00:52:12,415	| radiolab101915 |	A lot more than a lot of people get
EDL	00:52:42,367	00:52:45,439	| radiolab101915 |	Special thanks to producer Eddie McEwen for helping us and all the update

EDL	00:53:07,967	00:53:09,247	| radiolab101915 |	Are we about to do thoughts
EDL	00:53:09,247	00:53:11,295	| radiolab101915 |	Okay
EDL	00:53:11,295	00:53:15,647	| radiolab101915 |	Hey I'm driving right by Robert krulwich Radiolab and today we're talking about
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:18,207	| radiolab101915 |	Change really what what looks like
EDL	00:53:18,719	00:53:21,279	| radiolab101915 |	So you remember back to the booze when we started this
EDL	00:53:21,279	00:53:22,047	| radiolab101915 |	Program
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:24,863	| radiolab101915 |	The question were asking then was Will those baboons
EDL	00:53:24,863	00:53:28,447	| radiolab101915 |	If they do enough Generations will they create a new color lipstick looks.
EDL	00:53:28,959	00:53:35,359	| radiolab101915 |	What's up let's hope we don't know whole milk and the town that uses a mayor is that town expanding the sense of
EDL	00:53:35,359	00:53:37,407	| radiolab101915 |	Possibility or stop lower blood pressure
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:41,759	| radiolab101915 |	Now let's get really serious there are indeed
EDL	00:53:42,271	00:53:43,551	| radiolab101915 |	Changes that deuce
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:44,319	| radiolab101915 |	Stick
EDL	00:53:44,319	00:53:47,903	| radiolab101915 |	We're going to examine a rather startling example of it right now
EDL	00:53:48,927	00:53:53,279	| radiolab101915 |	But you do that we need an evolutionary biologist and we found one at Duke University
EDL	00:53:54,047	00:53:57,375	| radiolab101915 |	Yeah hello who's this that's Brian hair
EDL	00:53:57,375	00:54:03,775	| radiolab101915 |	And the first thing Brian your did was tell me about another guy
EDL	00:54:03,775	00:54:07,615	| radiolab101915 |	I have was a very famous geneticist in Russia
EDL	00:54:07,615	00:54:11,199	| radiolab101915 |	He was alive during World War II and doing genetic
EDL	00:54:11,199	00:54:13,503	| radiolab101915 |	Lights work but after World War II
EDL	00:54:13,503	00:54:15,551	| radiolab101915 |	He was a little spot of trouble
EDL	00:54:16,319	00:54:21,439	| radiolab101915 |	But what you do well because he was a real darwinian he believed in evolution and genetics
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:25,535	| radiolab101915 |	But thinking about Evolution like a darwinian evolution is does
EDL	00:54:26,559	00:54:32,959	| radiolab101915 |	That was not popular in Stalin's Russia is popular the word or was that a death sentence it was a distance
EDL	00:54:32,959	00:54:34,495	| radiolab101915 |	So
EDL	00:54:34,495	00:54:36,287	| radiolab101915 |	The writing was on the wall
EDL	00:54:36,287	00:54:39,871	| radiolab101915 |	Any new that he should probably take the Trans-Siberian railroad
EDL	00:54:39,871	00:54:42,175	| radiolab101915 |	From Moscow quickly
EDL	00:54:42,175	00:54:43,199	| radiolab101915 |	Quickly
EDL	00:54:43,199	00:54:44,991	| radiolab101915 |	And he went to
EDL	00:54:44,991	00:54:45,759	| radiolab101915 |	Nova De Beers
EDL	00:54:46,271	00:54:50,623	| radiolab101915 |	And the way that Dimitri blab decided to hide his continued in
EDL	00:54:50,623	00:54:52,671	| radiolab101915 |	Starting darwinian Evolution was
EDL	00:54:52,671	00:54:54,463	| radiolab101915 |	He would begin a fox
EDL	00:54:54,463	00:54:56,255	| radiolab101915 |	Farm where he would make
EDL	00:54:56,255	00:54:57,023	| radiolab101915 |	Fur coats
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:54:59,583	| radiolab101915 |	So what is Mr Bean live actually doing what
EDL	00:54:59,583	00:55:01,119	| radiolab101915 |	Dr. balaya was actually interest
EDL	00:55:01,887	00:55:03,167	| radiolab101915 |	Was to understand
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:05,471	| radiolab101915 |	How does domestication happen
EDL	00:55:08,031	00:55:14,175	| radiolab101915 |	That's a question that's a dumb question or select them question in all because you just going to bring that note I think about a wild ant
EDL	00:55:15,199	00:55:16,735	| radiolab101915 |	It is impulsive
EDL	00:55:16,735	00:55:19,551	| radiolab101915 |	It is aggressive it growl
EDL	00:55:19,551	00:55:23,391	| radiolab101915 |	What is it a wolf or you're playing a wolf that I've got there
EDL	00:55:23,391	00:55:24,415	| radiolab101915 |	This is
EDL	00:55:24,415	00:55:25,183	| radiolab101915 |	A domesticated
EDL	00:55:29,535	00:55:35,679	| radiolab101915 |	The nature the animal has completely changed here and if you want to learn something about the nature of a creature how it can change
EDL	00:55:36,191	00:55:38,495	| radiolab101915 |	Domesticate animals are wonderful place to start
EDL	00:55:39,263	00:55:40,287	| radiolab101915 |	Supplier
EDL	00:55:40,799	00:55:42,591	| radiolab101915 |	He decided why did I just
EDL	00:55:42,591	00:55:44,383	| radiolab101915 |	Experimental domesticate semana
EDL	00:55:44,895	00:55:48,735	| radiolab101915 |	And his cover was that he was going to make better for a cup
EDL	00:55:49,247	00:55:51,551	| radiolab101915 |	When was the 1959
EDL	00:55:51,551	00:55:56,159	| radiolab101915 |	Kiss a Sputnik was up Russians were feeling good and he was making fur coats so to speak
EDL	00:55:56,159	00:55:58,207	| radiolab101915 |	So to speak began one of the most
EDL	00:55:58,207	00:55:59,487	| radiolab101915 |	Exciting experiments in biology
EDL	00:55:59,999	00:56:04,351	| radiolab101915 |	Things with Demetri but life does he goes to a bunch of fox Pharmacy to look at I want to buy
EDL	00:56:04,351	00:56:04,863	| radiolab101915 |	A bunch
EDL	00:56:05,375	00:56:09,727	| radiolab101915 |	Foxes and he says we'll all I got to do is take this group of foxes and break him in the shoe
EDL	00:56:10,751	00:56:11,775	| radiolab101915 |	And one group
EDL	00:56:11,775	00:56:13,055	| radiolab101915 |	I'm not going to change them in any way
EDL	00:56:13,567	00:56:15,103	| radiolab101915 |	Okay so it's like a controller
EDL	00:56:15,103	00:56:16,895	| radiolab101915 |	So when we was just normal Fox normal
EDL	00:56:16,895	00:56:18,687	| radiolab101915 |	But the other line
EDL	00:56:18,687	00:56:22,015	| radiolab101915 |	I'm going to decide who is going to be allowed to breed
EDL	00:56:22,015	00:56:23,039	| radiolab101915 |	And who is
EDL	00:56:23,039	00:56:23,807	| radiolab101915 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:56:23,807	00:56:24,575	| radiolab101915 |	It going to be a haircut
EDL	00:56:25,855	00:56:27,135	| radiolab101915 |	Some of the factors get to have
EDL	00:56:27,647	00:56:28,671	| radiolab101915 |	Puppy foxes
EDL	00:56:28,671	00:56:31,487	| radiolab101915 |	Of their own and some foxes become
EDL	00:56:32,767	00:56:34,559	| radiolab101915 |	So what are you doing
EDL	00:56:35,583	00:56:36,095	| radiolab101915 |	Marvelously
EDL	00:56:36,607	00:56:37,631	| radiolab101915 |	You go or what
EDL	00:56:38,143	00:56:39,423	| radiolab101915 |	Roach in
EDL	00:56:39,423	00:56:40,447	| radiolab101915 |	Where the fox
EDL	00:56:41,471	00:56:42,495	| radiolab101915 |	Beautiful baby
EDL	00:56:42,495	00:56:43,263	| radiolab101915 |	Author of a juvenile
EDL	00:56:43,775	00:56:45,055	| radiolab101915 |	The experimenter would stay
EDL	00:56:45,055	00:56:46,591	| radiolab101915 |	Stand say a foot away
EDL	00:56:46,591	00:56:47,871	| radiolab101915 |	And we just try to touch
EDL	00:56:47,871	00:56:48,895	| radiolab101915 |	The fox
EDL	00:56:49,407	00:56:50,175	| radiolab101915 |	Hi
EDL	00:56:50,175	00:56:51,711	| radiolab101915 |	Run Fox Run
EDL	00:56:51,711	00:56:53,247	| radiolab101915 |	If the fox would make
EDL	00:56:53,247	00:56:54,527	| radiolab101915 |	This kind of sound
EDL	00:56:55,551	00:56:57,855	| radiolab101915 |	And sort of cower in the corner like
EDL	00:56:57,855	00:56:58,879	| radiolab101915 |	Most boxing
EDL	00:56:58,879	00:56:59,647	| radiolab101915 |	Would do
EDL	00:56:59,647	00:57:04,255	| radiolab101915 |	What is that what the sound is the sound a Fox Makes
EDL	00:57:05,791	00:57:07,583	| radiolab101915 |	So what happens if I make that sound
EDL	00:57:08,351	00:57:12,191	| radiolab101915 |	They did not breathe at Fox in the Next Generation board put it another way
EDL	00:57:14,751	00:57:15,263	| radiolab101915 |	Pretty much
EDL	00:57:16,031	00:57:17,567	| radiolab101915 |	That's just wrong but now
EDL	00:57:17,567	00:57:21,919	| radiolab101915 |	Every so often like maybe one out of every 20 foxes there would be a fox
EDL	00:57:22,687	00:57:23,711	| radiolab101915 |	It would not
EDL	00:57:24,479	00:57:25,247	| radiolab101915 |	Would not
EDL	00:57:26,271	00:57:27,295	| radiolab101915 |	It wasn't afraid then
EDL	00:57:27,295	00:57:28,319	| radiolab101915 |	Then they would
EDL	00:57:28,319	00:57:29,343	| radiolab101915 |	Shoes that fart
EDL	00:57:29,343	00:57:30,111	| radiolab101915 |	2
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:31,647	| radiolab101915 |	Read in the Next Generation
EDL	00:57:31,647	00:57:34,207	| radiolab101915 |	Let me get this over and over again
EDL	00:57:34,207	00:57:40,607	| radiolab101915 |	Generation after generation they would breed the nice boxes together get rid of a bad foxes breed the neck
EDL	00:57:40,607	00:57:47,007	| radiolab101915 |	Except get rid of a bad foxes read the next set next set next set neck
EDL	00:57:47,007	00:57:48,799	| radiolab101915 |	Next
EDL	00:57:49,311	00:57:55,455	| radiolab101915 |	What happened in the end eventually if they had foxes that were attracted to humans no job how long do you think
EDL	00:57:55,967	00:57:57,759	| radiolab101915 |	It would take to get boxes
EDL	00:57:57,759	00:58:00,575	| radiolab101915 |	For being wild ferocious animals
EDL	00:58:00,575	00:58:05,695	| radiolab101915 |	Tubing animals to would lick your face after this kind of like a how many year Exterminating
EDL	00:58:05,695	00:58:07,999	| radiolab101915 |	Reading Eggs
EDL	00:58:08,767	00:58:10,559	| radiolab101915 |	A long long time I mean I would garlic
EDL	00:58:11,327	00:58:12,863	| radiolab101915 |	Like how many years how many years how many
EDL	00:58:13,375	00:58:16,447	| radiolab101915 |	Well it took wolves like thousands of years income dogs
EDL	00:58:16,447	00:58:19,263	| radiolab101915 |	Diamond almond long time well here's this here's the thing
EDL	00:58:19,775	00:58:21,055	| radiolab101915 |	10 years ago
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:29,759	| radiolab101915 |	Don't tell me to shut up
EDL	00:58:29,759	00:58:31,039	| radiolab101915 |	Crazy what was
EDL	00:58:31,039	00:58:32,575	| radiolab101915 |	Exciting and surprising
EDL	00:58:34,111	00:58:34,879	| radiolab101915 |	Was that
EDL	00:58:34,879	00:58:41,023	| radiolab101915 |	The same foxes they actually show a whole Suite of changes that he did not select for on Purp
EDL	00:58:41,535	00:58:43,327	| radiolab101915 |	I like what do you mean physical change
EDL	00:58:44,095	00:58:46,655	| radiolab101915 |	These foxes as they became more gentle
EDL	00:58:46,655	00:58:48,703	| radiolab101915 |	For some unaccountable reason
EDL	00:58:49,215	00:58:50,239	| radiolab101915 |	Their ears
EDL	00:58:50,239	00:58:51,007	| radiolab101915 |	Instead of pointing straight up
EDL	00:58:51,519	00:58:57,663	| radiolab101915 |	Flip over that's right it was a big accident that they now have floppy ears the tail
EDL	00:59:00,223	00:59:03,039	| radiolab101915 |	Now they have curly tails
EDL	00:59:03,039	00:59:08,927	| radiolab101915 |	They have multi colored coats that are no longer just grape tips of their paws
EDL	00:59:08,927	00:59:10,975	| radiolab101915 |	Color the teeth
EDL	00:59:10,975	00:59:17,375	| radiolab101915 |	Get smaller and their bones became very thin their bones got the yes
EDL	00:59:17,375	00:59:23,519	| radiolab101915 |	What happens to the skull and the face is it actually becomes more feminine
EDL	00:59:27,103	00:59:28,127	| radiolab101915 |	Dead Sea
EDL	00:59:28,895	00:59:30,687	| radiolab101915 |	I don't know what to make of that
EDL	00:59:30,687	00:59:37,087	| radiolab101915 |	And it's not over this experiment has been going on at 7:50 years 45000 foxes
EDL	00:59:37,087	00:59:43,487	| radiolab101915 |	Later who is read about this is that I got to see this for myself so he went to a
EDL	00:59:43,487	00:59:43,999	| radiolab101915 |	Xenoverse 2 beerus
EDL	00:59:44,767	00:59:49,631	| radiolab101915 |	Just to check it out I did I took the Trans-Siberian railroad which you know
EDL	00:59:49,631	00:59:51,679	| radiolab101915 |	2 days of looking at green grass
EDL	00:59:51,679	00:59:53,983	| radiolab101915 |	And there's like one species of tree
EDL	00:59:53,983	00:59:56,287	| radiolab101915 |	And I think there was a butterfly that was kind of pretty
EDL	00:59:56,287	01:00:02,687	| radiolab101915 |	I was at birch trees you look at Bridge Street and mother Bridge Street and Liberty Street and pretty much
EDL	01:00:02,687	01:00:03,967	| radiolab101915 |	You got it you got it
EDL	01:00:03,967	01:00:05,503	| radiolab101915 |	So I show up and they had
EDL	01:00:05,503	01:00:06,527	| radiolab101915 |	Thousands
EDL	01:00:06,527	01:00:07,295	| radiolab101915 |	A foxes
EDL	01:00:07,295	01:00:10,111	| radiolab101915 |	Giant buildings that are probably you know as long as a football for
EDL	01:00:10,623	01:00:11,647	| radiolab101915 |	Full of
EDL	01:00:12,159	01:00:13,439	| radiolab101915 |	Just rows and rows
EDL	01:00:13,439	01:00:14,207	| radiolab101915 |	Of fox
EDL	01:00:14,719	01:00:19,839	| radiolab101915 |	And when you see them they actually wag their tail they whine like a puppy dog
EDL	01:00:19,839	01:00:23,935	| radiolab101915 |	They're cute and cuddly and they love people and they don't bite
EDL	01:00:23,935	01:00:24,959	| radiolab101915 |	Sounds perfect
EDL	01:00:24,959	01:00:25,727	| radiolab101915 |	Except
EDL	01:00:25,727	01:00:27,263	| radiolab101915 |	For the one thing I forgot to tell you
EDL	01:00:27,263	01:00:28,543	| radiolab101915 |	Is that when they're yapping
EDL	01:00:28,543	01:00:29,055	| radiolab101915 |	Beside the sea
EDL	01:00:29,823	01:00:36,223	| radiolab101915 |	They cannot help but pee for joy
EDL	01:00:36,223	01:00:38,015	| radiolab101915 |	Makes sense to me that they're getting nicer
EDL	01:00:38,015	01:00:39,295	| radiolab101915 |	Is there breeding them to get nice
EDL	01:00:40,575	01:00:42,879	| radiolab101915 |	Why is all this other stuff happening with their to their body
EDL	01:00:42,879	01:00:43,391	| radiolab101915 |	What's going on
EDL	01:00:44,671	01:00:45,439	| radiolab101915 |	Well you know
EDL	01:00:45,951	01:00:47,743	| radiolab101915 |	The unsatisfactory answer that problem
EDL	01:00:48,255	01:00:50,047	| radiolab101915 |	Nobody really
EDL	01:00:50,047	01:00:50,815	| radiolab101915 |	Knows why
EDL	01:00:50,815	01:00:55,679	| radiolab101915 |	Why am I in this is to synchronize
EDL	01:00:56,191	01:00:56,959	| radiolab101915 |	Sync
EDL	01:00:56,959	01:01:00,031	| radiolab101915 |	Evolutionary biologist at the University of st. Andrews in sky

EDL	01:01:04,127	01:01:05,407	| radiolab101915 |	This is just a hypothesis
EDL	01:01:05,407	01:01:06,431	| radiolab101915 |	Here's what he told me
EDL	01:01:06,431	01:01:09,759	| radiolab101915 |	Did you guys go back to when a fox has a very very little
EDL	01:01:11,551	01:01:14,367	| radiolab101915 |	Inside its mother's womb very very very early embryo

EDL	01:01:50,975	01:01:54,815	| radiolab101915 |	Happened to the cartilage of the Fox's beard
EDL	01:01:54,815	01:02:01,215	| radiolab101915 |	All these different issues tell big parts of the nervous system
EDL	01:02:01,215	01:02:04,543	| radiolab101915 |	Major parts of the brain and the adrenal glands
EDL	01:02:05,567	01:02:07,615	| radiolab101915 |	What's a real man that's the most important one for our
EDL	01:02:08,127	01:02:09,151	| radiolab101915 |	The adrenal gland
EDL	01:02:09,919	01:02:10,943	| radiolab101915 |	I'm sad
EDL	01:02:10,943	01:02:11,711	| radiolab101915 |	When
EDL	01:02:11,711	01:02:12,479	| radiolab101915 |	To be afraid
EDL	01:02:13,247	01:02:16,575	| radiolab101915 |	If you against a well that's something that makes
EDL	01:02:17,855	01:02:22,719	| radiolab101915 |	Whatever that sounds like it's the one that makes that sound when your breeding
EDL	01:02:22,719	01:02:23,999	| radiolab101915 |	Hear out of an animal
EDL	01:02:26,047	01:02:27,327	| radiolab101915 |	Maybe what you doing
EDL	01:02:27,839	01:02:29,375	| radiolab101915 |	Is your slowing down
EDL	01:02:30,911	01:02:34,495	| radiolab101915 |	The migrations of these cells
EDL	01:02:34,495	01:02:36,031	| radiolab101915 |	They don't deliver the fear
EDL	01:02:36,031	01:02:38,079	| radiolab101915 |	If you don't deliver all the other things that they use
EDL	01:02:38,591	01:02:42,175	| radiolab101915 |	What you're focusing on what you as the experimenter doing
EDL	01:02:42,175	01:02:43,967	| radiolab101915 |	I want the guys who's adrenal glands
EDL	01:02:44,991	01:02:49,855	| radiolab101915 |	That might have the function of making the animal more team but what you're doing is a by-product
EDL	01:02:49,855	01:02:54,719	| radiolab101915 |	The bat is selecting for guys who don't get as many of those cells into their ears and don't get as many of
EDL	01:02:59,839	01:03:02,911	| radiolab101915 |	So if you get some of the cells you need
EDL	01:03:02,911	01:03:03,423	| radiolab101915 |	How to make your ears
EDL	01:03:04,191	01:03:04,959	| radiolab101915 |	Pyramids
EDL	01:03:04,959	01:03:06,239	| radiolab101915 |	Straight but not quite enough
EDL	01:03:06,751	01:03:09,055	| radiolab101915 |	And your ear will go up to a certain point
EDL	01:03:09,567	01:03:12,383	| radiolab101915 |	I think the sales are going to complete the deal the rest of your ear
EDL	01:03:12,895	01:03:13,663	| radiolab101915 |	Flops over
EDL	01:03:14,175	01:03:20,575	| radiolab101915 |	Really you haven't come is that why dogs have little sloppy joe
EDL	01:03:20,575	01:03:22,111	| radiolab101915 |	Slow down to the point where they don't
EDL	01:03:22,111	01:03:28,511	| radiolab101915 |	Finish the job they were still there are literally arrested the argument is that
EDL	01:03:28,511	01:03:30,303	| radiolab101915 |	When you select against aggression in animals
EDL	01:03:30,815	01:03:34,143	| radiolab101915 |	You're changing the time in the rate of development such that
EDL	01:03:34,143	01:03:36,191	| radiolab101915 |	The experimental foxes are actually
EDL	01:03:36,191	01:03:37,471	| radiolab101915 |	Frozen as juveniles
EDL	01:03:40,799	01:03:42,591	| radiolab101915 |	They actually never really grow up
EDL	01:03:45,663	01:03:47,967	| radiolab101915 |	So then to domesticate a fox
EDL	01:03:50,015	01:03:53,599	| radiolab101915 |	Just like to domesticate a wolf and you can talk what you doing
EDL	01:03:53,599	01:03:55,903	| radiolab101915 |	Is you making permanent puppies
EDL	01:03:55,903	01:03:58,463	| radiolab101915 |	Peter Pan kind of things
EDL	01:03:59,999	01:04:02,815	| radiolab101915 |	So if we wanted to apply the store to us
EDL	01:04:02,815	01:04:05,887	| radiolab101915 |	And we wanted to say breed a gentler
EDL	01:04:05,887	01:04:07,679	| radiolab101915 |	Bleeker human being
EDL	01:04:08,959	01:04:09,727	| radiolab101915 |	We should just
EDL	01:04:09,727	01:04:15,871	| radiolab101915 |	Kill the football players is that the idea
EDL	01:04:15,871	01:04:21,503	| radiolab101915 |	Like with the foxes you just eliminate the meeting with the same thing happened to us
EDL	01:04:21,503	01:04:22,015	| radiolab101915 |	Really
EDL	01:04:22,783	01:04:25,855	| radiolab101915 |	Remember to eat professionally interview.
EDL	01:04:25,855	01:04:28,415	| radiolab101915 |	I was back a Richard wrangham vividly
EDL	01:04:29,951	01:04:33,279	| radiolab101915 |	Movie think about humans obviously we're getting are just super specs
EDL	01:04:34,047	01:04:36,095	| radiolab101915 |	But he says if you choose to
EDL	01:04:36,095	01:04:37,375	| radiolab101915 |	Go back if we go back
EDL	01:04:37,375	01:04:39,679	| radiolab101915 |	Just 30000 50000 years
EDL	01:04:39,679	01:04:41,471	| radiolab101915 |	And you look at the collection of
EDL	01:04:41,471	01:04:42,239	| radiolab101915 |	Goals
EDL	01:04:42,239	01:04:44,543	| radiolab101915 |	The early versions of Ostrom way back
EDL	01:04:44,543	01:04:46,079	| radiolab101915 |	I think you see some interest
EDL	01:04:47,359	01:04:48,895	| radiolab101915 |	Like changes
EDL	01:04:48,895	01:04:51,455	| radiolab101915 |	If you look at a domesticated animal
EDL	01:04:52,223	01:04:53,503	| radiolab101915 |	They have smaller teeth
EDL	01:04:55,039	01:04:55,551	| radiolab101915 |	That want to dance
EDL	01:04:56,319	01:04:58,879	| radiolab101915 |	And in humans we've been getting smaller teeth
EDL	01:04:58,879	01:04:59,647	| radiolab101915 |	Over
EDL	01:04:59,647	01:05:01,183	| radiolab101915 |	The last few tens of thousands of years
EDL	01:05:01,951	01:05:06,047	| radiolab101915 |	Like the Box we've been getting more gracile bones that means to say that
EDL	01:05:07,327	01:05:10,655	| radiolab101915 |	Particular length of limbo and it becomes a little bit narrower
EDL	01:05:10,655	01:05:11,935	| radiolab101915 |	Just like the
EDL	01:05:11,935	01:05:13,471	| radiolab101915 |	So it is tempting to think
EDL	01:05:14,495	01:05:15,263	| radiolab101915 |	That
EDL	01:05:15,263	01:05:17,311	| radiolab101915 |	The same kind of process
EDL	01:05:17,311	01:05:20,127	| radiolab101915 |	What's been going on in humans as a pink eye going into my
EDL	01:05:20,127	01:05:21,407	| radiolab101915 |	Animals which is that
EDL	01:05:21,919	01:05:22,687	| radiolab101915 |	There's meaning
EDL	01:05:22,687	01:05:23,455	| radiolab101915 |	Selection
EDL	01:05:23,455	01:05:23,967	| radiolab101915 |	In favor of
EDL	01:05:24,735	01:05:26,271	| radiolab101915 |	Kinder gentler human
EDL	01:05:26,271	01:05:30,623	| radiolab101915 |	Wait a second. Who's doing the selecting in the case of the foxes
EDL	01:05:31,135	01:05:33,951	| radiolab101915 |	Mitsubishi LF shot you if you were
EDL	01:05:34,719	01:05:35,999	| radiolab101915 |	Too aggressive
EDL	01:05:35,999	01:05:41,119	| radiolab101915 |	Who's selecting the who's domesticating the humans
EDL	01:05:41,631	01:05:43,679	| radiolab101915 |	Is that it was the
EDL	01:05:44,191	01:05:46,495	| radiolab101915 |	A growing tendency for
EDL	01:05:46,495	01:05:48,031	| radiolab101915 |	Hunter-gatherer ancestors
EDL	01:05:48,031	01:05:49,055	| radiolab101915 |	Settle down
EDL	01:05:49,055	01:05:49,567	| radiolab101915 |	In the
EDL	01:05:50,335	01:05:51,103	| radiolab101915 |	Instable
EDL	01:05:51,103	01:05:53,407	| radiolab101915 |	You mean like summer camps
EDL	01:05:53,919	01:06:00,319	| radiolab101915 |	Sing songs about communities but if you are in a very small family group
EDL	01:06:00,319	01:06:06,463	| radiolab101915 |	Well then it pays to be big and strong and mean because of you are the biggest guy and you meet a smaller guy and he's got some potato you
EDL	01:06:06,975	01:06:12,095	| radiolab101915 |	Grab him eat his potatoes beat him up and then move on to the next till you never have to see him again
EDL	01:06:12,607	01:06:13,375	| radiolab101915 |	But let's say
EDL	01:06:13,887	01:06:18,495	| radiolab101915 |	It is time passes Human Society grows on
EDL	01:06:19,519	01:06:21,311	| radiolab101915 |	We might have 30 or 40 people
EDL	01:06:21,311	01:06:27,455	| radiolab101915 |	That way you can build bigger fires and you can catch more bunnies and you can defend against enemies
EDL	01:06:27,455	01:06:30,271	| radiolab101915 |	But in this world if you beat everybody up
EDL	01:06:31,039	01:06:34,879	| radiolab101915 |	You may not survive that when pitted against anybody else
EDL	01:06:34,879	01:06:35,647	| radiolab101915 |	One on one
EDL	01:06:36,159	01:06:39,999	| radiolab101915 |	The big strong pink eye is a win-win big strong mean doesn't
EDL	01:06:40,511	01:06:41,791	| radiolab101915 |	And we see this in summer
EDL	01:06:41,791	01:06:43,839	| radiolab101915 |	When you can start to form coalition
EDL	01:06:43,839	01:06:45,119	| radiolab101915 |	When you can start that multiple in
EDL	01:06:45,631	01:06:48,703	| radiolab101915 |	She say a mean guy stop it
EDL	01:06:49,215	01:06:50,495	| radiolab101915 |	What you can't take on
EDL	01:06:50,495	01:06:56,639	| radiolab101915 |	Both of us or all three of us or our whole group
EDL	01:06:56,639	01:06:59,711	| radiolab101915 |	Go away we're going to deal with this guy
EDL	01:06:59,711	01:07:06,111	| radiolab101915 |	Maybe they deal with him by shouting and Darna ostracizing him or even capital punishment
EDL	01:07:06,111	01:07:10,463	| radiolab101915 |	Richard wrangham theory is
EDL	01:07:10,463	01:07:16,863	| radiolab101915 |	Who they can't have kids to spread their genes because they have the unfortunate condition of being dead then we've essentially bread
EDL	01:07:16,863	01:07:18,911	| radiolab101915 |	The more aggressive genes or
EDL	01:07:19,423	01:07:20,191	| radiolab101915 |	We have
EDL	01:07:20,959	01:07:21,471	| radiolab101915 |	Domestic
EDL	01:07:25,311	01:07:28,127	| radiolab101915 |	What we're really talking about groups versus individuals
EDL	01:07:28,895	01:07:30,431	| radiolab101915 |	And $0.07 I think we're really talking
EDL	01:07:30,943	01:07:31,711	| radiolab101915 |	Beginning of society
EDL	01:07:33,247	01:07:34,527	| radiolab101915 |	Rule of law
EDL	01:07:34,527	01:07:35,039	| radiolab101915 |	In the way that we think of
EDL	01:07:46,815	01:07:49,887	| radiolab101915 |	And this pressure
EDL	01:07:50,655	01:07:51,679	| radiolab101915 |	Be a little more gentle
EDL	01:07:52,191	01:07:53,215	| radiolab101915 |	Going to be a little bit more quiet
EDL	01:07:53,215	01:07:55,519	| radiolab101915 |	It hasn't gone away
EDL	01:07:55,519	01:07:57,055	| radiolab101915 |	If anything we're being select
EDL	01:07:57,055	01:07:58,335	| radiolab101915 |	To work together more
EDL	01:07:58,847	01:08:00,127	| radiolab101915 |	Took took
EDL	01:08:00,127	01:08:02,687	| radiolab101915 |	Be able to tolerate being packed in even tighter
EDL	01:08:03,199	01:08:05,247	| radiolab101915 |	What you put 20 chips on a Jet Plane
EDL	01:08:05,759	01:08:07,295	| radiolab101915 |	And try to send them across the Atlantic
EDL	01:08:07,295	01:08:08,831	| radiolab101915 |	Let me tell you that only one or two
EDL	01:08:10,879	01:08:13,183	| radiolab101915 |	We do this all the time we take it for granted
EDL	01:08:13,183	01:08:13,951	| radiolab101915 |	Is human beings.
EDL	01:08:14,975	01:08:21,375	| radiolab101915 |	Big groups of people can get along with one another I do think that is reasonable
EDL	01:08:21,375	01:08:23,935	| radiolab101915 |	Imagine that humans have a future of
EDL	01:08:23,935	01:08:25,215	| radiolab101915 |	Increasing
EDL	01:08:25,215	01:08:28,287	| radiolab101915 |	Self domestication what I sent you proposing
EDL	01:08:28,799	01:08:34,943	| radiolab101915 |	Is it as the Earth gets more crowded all the creatures on Earth are these dissension could you have to start learning to live with each other to the Marcos
EDL	01:08:35,455	01:08:36,479	| radiolab101915 |	Bumping into each other
EDL	01:08:36,991	01:08:43,135	| radiolab101915 |	The winners will be the domesticated wild everyone will get more empathetic to each other because that's the only way you survive
EDL	01:08:43,903	01:08:44,927	| radiolab101915 |	Let me get gentler
EDL	01:08:45,439	01:08:48,767	| radiolab101915 |	And gently and gentler tool am literally lie down
EDL	01:08:48,767	01:08:49,279	| radiolab101915 |	With lion
EDL	01:08:50,303	01:08:51,327	| radiolab101915 |	You said it Beauty
EDL	01:08:54,655	01:08:57,983	| radiolab101915 |	But I do believe it
EDL	01:08:58,495	01:09:02,079	| radiolab101915 |	Well we may have to go through water through ups and downs before we get there
EDL	01:09:02,079	01:09:03,359	| radiolab101915 |	And of course to something
EDL	01:09:03,871	01:09:10,271	| radiolab101915 |	Select the alarming about the fact that one possible mechanism by which domestication is Happy than humans
EDL	01:09:10,271	01:09:11,039	| radiolab101915 |	This through
EDL	01:09:11,039	01:09:12,063	| radiolab101915 |	Literally EX

EDL	01:09:15,647	01:09:16,671	| radiolab101915 |	But in the long-term
EDL	01:09:17,439	01:09:17,951	| radiolab101915 |	Sure
EDL	01:09:18,463	01:09:19,743	| radiolab101915 |	Let's hope that
EDL	01:09:19,743	01:09:21,023	| radiolab101915 |	All of us become
