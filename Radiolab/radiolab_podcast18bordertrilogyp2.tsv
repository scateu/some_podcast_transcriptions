EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,656	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Northwest of here
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:47,936	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We are
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:48,960	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We grew cotton

EDL	00:02:55,360	00:03:00,736	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He says that his brothers and sisters did I'll work on the farm along with a bunch of undocumented workers who
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Came in
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:04,064	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	From Juarez back then we had party line phone
EDL	00:03:04,064	00:03:05,856	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So somebody would say
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,904	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Roberto's coming today
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But they didn't know what time or where
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,744	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So whenever that happened
EDL	00:03:12,256	00:03:12,768	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I was
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,304	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Test2
EDL	00:03:14,304	00:03:15,072	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Citadel

EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And he would watch the road
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:20,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And I would blow the horn
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,520	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	At the first sign of what we would refer to his La Migra
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To alert the workers
EDL	00:03:26,848	00:03:28,384	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Jesse calls at the greatest
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:30,432	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Irony of his life because
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:31,456	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Fast forward
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:34,784	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To college I got drafted into the army
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He gets drafted to go to Vietnam spent 13 months in Vietnam
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That was a helicopter crew chief
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,928	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I came back from Vietnam
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I was scheduled to go back
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:44,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But what happened in
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:46,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	1968 was
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	My dad
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:49,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	My second brother
EDL	00:03:49,888	00:03:51,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Was on his way to Vietnam
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:52,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,216	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:54,496	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	My
EDL	00:03:54,496	00:03:56,032	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Dad was on his way to the airport
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:58,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And he had an automobile accident
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And got killed
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:00,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I was the oldest
EDL	00:04:01,664	00:04:02,432	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In the family
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:03,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They let me out
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,296	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To take care of the family
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,576	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I'm so
EDL	00:04:08,576	00:04:14,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Raise needed a job being a veteran any federal exam they opened up for you
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:16,000	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So he starts taking these federal job exam
EDL	00:04:16,512	00:04:17,536	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The post office
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:20,095	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Bureau of Prisons Customs border
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:23,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Patrol I mean just any test that I could cuz I have to make a living
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:25,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the very first place to call him back
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Border patrol
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah that was what was available
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Again Tim done so he becomes the kind of Pioneer in the board of choice one of the early
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Hispanic agents when there were very few the job
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:45,695	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Was tough cuz they didn't welcome you with open arms cuz your name is Reyes and not Smith or Jones
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,743	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But I kind of enjoyed the challenge
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He said he was dead set do everything twice as good and have
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Pine and eventually he moved from being an agent into management and he works as well through management I was a first-line supervisor
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:58,495	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Kaiser through the ranks
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:00,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Second line supervisor
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Tata towel
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:04,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Academy and he eventually becomes the first Hispanic sector chief
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:06,175	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Which means
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:06,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In charge me
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,735	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Huge swath of the Border in Texas
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:11,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So then come
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:13,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	1993 you are
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Sector Chief and your sign back here
EDL	00:05:17,439	00:05:19,743	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I was moved here in late June
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In early July I decided to
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Assess the situation
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:26,399	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the situation
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In El Paso
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,959	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Did not
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Look good
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:30,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	No
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Looks like there was a mess
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So one of the first things Ria's discovers is that the border between the US and Mexico apaso is in a state of
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:43,807	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Chaos chaos we were averaging about 10 thousand illegal entry
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:51,231	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Add a add a unprecedented numbers Bend for trolling have enough people to get them all so people were telling me
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:57,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That agents are pretty much running cycle through the city
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:06:01,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Liberalism questioning everybody stopping people asking for their immigration status
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:08,127	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And they're doing this despite the fact that they just got sued by these high school kids for doing essentially the same thing and just lost tooth is still
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:14,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Hanging over the patrol deal with that there was a huge deal it was making a chaotic
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:19,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Which is worse and rias is on top of all of this there was a movement
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:25,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When I got here to push the Border Patrol

EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:34,751	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Two kind of creative borderless Zone around the city to unite El Paso and Juarez
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:41,151	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Who's coming the spirit of NAFTA opening up NAFTA is good for us because it will cut the tariffs on trade between the United States and
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:47,551	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA is going to open the border for the flows of goods and capital
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But not people
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:52,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And there's a little bit for people to
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:53,695	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So they felt
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:58,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That the border patrol is an invading Army they're the problem instead of the solution
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	ESO what he finds it that they're really unpopular and and that's just
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:08,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Half the reason you're unpopular there's a whole bunch of other people that hate him for a whole different reason
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Really yeah you when he got there he went on this listening walking tour of the neighborhoods along
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	On the Border there's there's whole neighborhoods there
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:18,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But you are WETA
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:21,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Barrio I want those neighborhoods and I talked to them
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:22,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	End
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:24,927	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They thought the Border Patrol was a disaster
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:30,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But instead of saying that the Border Patrol was over reaching that they were doing too much they felt
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:34,655	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That the border patrol had failed him
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Had let them down
EDL	00:07:35,935	00:07:40,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the people that lived on those neighborhoods they felt like they were under siege
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,311	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We have been broken rice

EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:07,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	These people living right on the border wanted was more border
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:10,495	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Patrol to stop what they perceive to be
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You know migrant petty crime
EDL	00:08:12,287	00:08:14,335	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Aunt Susie he's really getting it from both sides
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,127	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah it's like a whole City's coming out
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,663	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We were
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:19,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	With one foot on a banana peel
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Of getting driven out of town
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:23,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That's why I had to change
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:24,319	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And I didn't have a lot of time to do the
EDL	00:08:25,599	00:08:26,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Okay
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,159	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Sung so what does he do
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Well he had an idea
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,719	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	A pretty radical idea
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:31,999	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I knew
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:36,607	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There would be political pressure there would be public outcry
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:39,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So you take this idea around to a bunch of
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:39,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	High level
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:41,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The mayor of Juarez
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:46,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The mayor of El Paso people at the Mexican consul in El Paso are going to in Juarez
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:47,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The Sheraton
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Chief of police of Juarez in El Paso
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Annie's going to each one of them and basically saying
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:53,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Look
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:56,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We're able to correct
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:58,367	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If I can quell the chaos
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Would they support the Border
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And they said yes
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:05,535	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Okay so here's what I find so fast
EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:08,095	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It's September of 93
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:13,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And while Reyes is hatching his plan at the same time at the El Paso Civic Center
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:15,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Honest one particular weekend
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:19,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The United El Paso people are having this big convention
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:22,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Talking about how we can try and create this borderless
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:28,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Community Resources local officials and Civic leaders are hammering out their proposals and everything
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Presenting to the audience
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That same weekend
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Silvestre Reyes
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:33,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Rolls out
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,719	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	His plan
EDL	00:09:34,719	00:09:35,999	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He wanted this to be a surprise
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So we launched the operation at midnight
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:41,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Since September 18th 1993 Saturday night
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:45,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Reyes gathers all of his border patrol agent for Border Patrol
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	From all over the sector
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:49,823	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And I breathe every single shift
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Allegiance
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Myself
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:53,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I told him what was at stake
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I told him that if this thing didn't work
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,503	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They're going to run us out of town
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:01,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	My initial reaction was well this is going to be interesting
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:05,183	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Retired border patrol agent David Hamm was there with his anti drug smuggling
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:10,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And he said after the briefing we drove up the Border Highway on the Mexican side
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:15,935	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And we got to downtown water sitting in the library about sunrise
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And so he and his agents are waiting right at the Rio Grande
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:20,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the sun came up
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Any severe
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,847	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	At the border
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:25,407	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	She just saw all the wall border patrol
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:28,223	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	A wall of Agents along the river
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Hard yards Park
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:31,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Each one in their trucks
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Light green trucks
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:35,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There helicopters buzzing
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:40,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Lowell along the river there were floodlights every worth of the agents could be out there on the clock 24 hours a day
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Basically what race
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:44,607	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Done is he created a human
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,655	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Wall on the border at the river.
EDL	00:10:46,655	00:10:47,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It stretched for like
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:49,215	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When my
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,543	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And I had told my guys
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We're in this for the Long Haul
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What race was doing
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:57,407	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	This is his plan
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:11:00,735	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Was to essentially change our strategy On the Border
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:04,575	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	How we police the border from a strategy of
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Apprehension of letting migrants come in and running around chasing them sending them back
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,975	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To one of deterrence
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:15,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And called it operation blockade operation blockade
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:20,703	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Day one on Sunday morning like they always did
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:26,847	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Hundreds of Mexican migrants tenders construction workers housekeepers
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Waiting to cross into El Paso for work
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:35,551	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But now they were confronted with the Berlin Wall On the Border
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	On the line
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Where they would have to wait him out
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Waiting to see when the border patrol agents will pack up and leave
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:48,095	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	By the time night falls the migrants they just turn and go home and figure okay I guess we'll just
EDL	00:11:48,095	00:11:50,655	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Come back in the morning they came back Monday
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We were still there
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And that's
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When to start
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Spaghet
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:56,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Chaos

EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:18,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Close the paso del Norte bridge and confronted border patrol
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They blockaded traffic

EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:34,431	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Time there was screaming going on so racist how many races are there are all these headlines
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The newspaper there are better ways to do this
EDL	00:12:37,503	00:12:43,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Basically saying this new strategy is wrong operation blockade is nothing more than an attempt
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To divide the community
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:51,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Race is the mayor of El Paso who he preached about the operation is denying ever knowing about it would call them when they said mayor

EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:53,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They came out with these huge banners of we support our border patrol
EDL	00:13:53,791	00:13:56,863	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The tide ribbons on their cars that came out with

EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:02,751	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	For the border patrol agents who were on the line it was like all of a sudden there was just sort of
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Flip people locally on love
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Across
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Racial and ethnic lines

EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:15,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because overtime what happened during this blockade was two things
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:17,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	1
EDL	00:14:17,087	00:14:21,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Brian is one of the most popular reasons he's El pasoans are in favor of operation blockade
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:22,975	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Prime goes down
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:25,279	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Now it's hard to tell whether this is actually
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,303	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because of the blockade
EDL	00:14:26,303	00:14:31,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But there's a reduction in petty crime some like 15%
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,703	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That's the bottom line
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:37,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the second thing and this is way more surprising was it from Mexican Americans
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:39,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Could being harassed by the border patrol presence in their neighborhood
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They start to notice that is a ghost
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:50,111	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The agents were gone right right it completely clear them out because now they were all down on the border
EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:52,159	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So there's this you know this

EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:36,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We should just change her entire view after after one visit.
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:40,575	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What he says and apparently she was barely there for a day

EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:45,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I wish we could get Janet Reno take on this but unfortunately she died in 2006

EDL	00:20:51,839	00:20:55,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	A very important political element to all of this
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,215	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Text Doris meissner
EDL	00:20:57,215	00:21:03,615	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	She was at the time the head of the immigration Naturalization Service basically Janet Reno's number 2 when
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When it came to the Border
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And she says but at that moment the Janet Reno

EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	About the illegal immigration that is coming into California 40% of the babies born on Medicaid

EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:11,968	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	California being a red state from 1968 all the way to 1992 Clinton was

EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:28,352	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So one of the things that might have changed Janet Reno's mind or more importantly your boss
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Bill Clinton's mind
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:32,960	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Was that they saw in El Paso

EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	National border patrol strategy
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:22,368	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I spend a great deal of time on it things had not been done that way before
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:26,464	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And it was a it was a fundamental change in strategy
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:31,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	According to Doris meissner and she really was the architect of the strategy
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The idea was to
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:39,264	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Take what Reyes was doing which was very clarifying and steal it up there were basically
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:40,288	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Play 4
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,312	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Major
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Crossing quarters
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,152	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Along the Southwest border
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:48,992	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Each of those four spots that were going to amass border patrol agents
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:50,528	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	On the Border not
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:54,112	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Behind the Border not in the city where they piss off the locals
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:23:56,672	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But directly on the border
EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:58,464	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Concentrate resources
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:01,024	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Starting of course in California
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:01,536	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	AR
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:06,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Strategy was to start in San Diego because that was
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,680	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The highest Crossing Court
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Maybe 45 to 50% of the crossings
EDL	00:24:10,240	00:24:12,032	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Across the entire Southwest border
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We're happening in the San Diego sector
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:17,664	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We start in San Diego with operation GateKeeper
EDL	00:24:17,664	00:24:24,064	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Then move to I believe Arizona and I'm just trying to think of what we name. Ever
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Operation safeguard
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:29,184	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Exactly and then the fourth was southtex
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,536	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	All of a sudden now
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In 1994 the Border Patrol
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,864	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Publishes this
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:37,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Was called the
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:44,032	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The Strategic plan is also known as prevention through deterrence this is Jason De Leon again the Anthropologist who started us off
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	This whole series
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Did they write in his policy document
EDL	00:24:47,360	00:24:50,432	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We know the Border cut across a whole bunch of very difficult environments
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If we disrupt traditional Crossing places Urban ports of Entry
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And we push people toward these extreme environments
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,904	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They will have to cross rushing Rivers
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:03,744	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Mountainous terrain places that where you can freeze to death or you can die of
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Dehydration
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But the extreme environment
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Will slow people movement
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Will make them easier to catch
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,656	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And we'll also perhaps
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:11,936	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Stop them from coming
EDL	00:25:12,448	00:25:13,216	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Another word
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	After Reyes
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:18,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It became our national strategy to push people away from urban areas
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And you say
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:21,664	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The desert
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:27,808	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	As a kind of natural deterrent thinking was the that would be a natural geographic
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You know of
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Allied that would
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,720	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Take care of
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,000	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The rest
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:44,448	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Now one of the things
EDL	00:25:44,448	00:25:45,984	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Of course that we learn
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:47,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is that
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That that didn't hold
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:58,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because in the nineties the Mexican economy was struggling so people still need a jobs in that on the American side Farm
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So people still cross
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:06,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Crossing to the cities
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They were crossing through the desert
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,816	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	No one was watching
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:13,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Five men stumbled out of the mountain pass
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:14,656	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So sunstruck
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They didn't know their own names
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:19,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Justlikenew Reyes books The Devil's Highway
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:20,288	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Going to remember where they come from
EDL	00:26:22,848	00:26:23,872	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Had forgotten how long
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:28,224	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And so that's why
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In the late 90s
EDL	00:26:29,504	00:26:33,088	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You see the number of people dying in the Sonoran Desert overnight
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:36,160	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Start to Skyrocket you go from 5 to 10 Bodies 2
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:37,440	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The hundreds
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:43,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	By 2002 or so the numbers in Arizona or upper end $150
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:47,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	4 year a couple years after that it goes over 200
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:49,728	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Those are the official border patrol numbers
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:53,056	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That they report based on the number of bodies
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,568	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Found
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:27:00,992	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But after Jason had that experience finding an arm in the desert and not being able to locate the rest of the body he started
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:02,784	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You do wonder whether those numbers
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:03,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Were accurate
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,880	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	How many more people
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Might be dying out there
EDL	00:27:08,416	00:27:09,184	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Who are never found
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:10,464	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Never count
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,744	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:13,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Which for json at least
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,816	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You became a scientific way
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,608	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But what happens to bodies in the Dead
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:18,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	How fast
EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Do they decompose and what ends up happening is
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:23,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I just kind of Hit the library
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:24,032	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Scout literature
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You know his body Farms where we do this Tennessee Texas
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:33,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Jason Thomas one paper that suggested that when bodies are decomposing in the desert heat in the dryness drastically slowed that
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:36,576	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Down this idea that the debtors going to conserve
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:37,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Nobody is going to
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:44,000	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Mummifying that people will be at the forever according to that paper could take up to six months for a body to decompose to the Bone
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When will you be able to see the bone
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:47,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But the remains in that
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:51,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Study were collected in a bunch of different areas under
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:57,568	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Different condition sometimes even indoors no one have done it kind of in situ in the deserts beheading literally no
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:58,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	No scientific data on that at all
EDL	00:27:59,616	00:28:01,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So I started getting really interested in
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,200	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is there a way to
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:05,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Do some science around me
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,880	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He eventually wrote in an assistant named
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:13,696	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Kate hall Hall and I'm a physical anthropologist
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What's a physical anthropologist
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:19,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	A physical Anthropologist is someone at who
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:19,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Studies
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:27,520	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	At least 30 human bones and I try and infer what someone's life and death was like from skeletal remains
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Ions
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:32,384	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Jason pretty much came up to me and told me that
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He's been thinking about getting some pigs
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:36,480	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Pics
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:40,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Pigs have long been at the common proxy for human bodies Buena for Crime Scene stuff like
EDL	00:28:41,344	00:28:43,648	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They shoot them they bury them
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,696	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And you know that you're using
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Police different report of decomposition experiments
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:49,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:54,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Jason and Kate and the research team had down to Arizona
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:59,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	University of Arizona has a meet laboratory at that deals with live animals so we called up
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:00,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Jerome
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	DIA
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:02,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Euthanizer
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:03,872	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And he came out
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In this big truck
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,968	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He comes out with these animals to pigs
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:09,248	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	150 lb
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:13,856	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Alive Jerome shoots the pigs in the head right in front of them
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,672	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And then Kate and Jason we got shoes and socks
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:18,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Thruster pigs
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:21,792	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Bra panties jeans t-shirts and clothes at migrants
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:23,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because they wanted to recreate the conditions exactly
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:26,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And then he took these dress dead pigs
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:30,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Out into the desert arivaca Arizona
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:36,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It's like another planet it's like nowhere else I have ever been on Earth
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:38,944	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It's hot
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,760	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And saying it's hot doesn't
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:46,880	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Really do it justice
EDL	00:29:47,904	00:29:51,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So get together in this big field
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:54,560	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And we had one when pigs
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:58,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Under a tree in lightshade we are trying to replicate like
EDL	00:29:58,400	00:29:59,424	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If someone weighs
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:05,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Tired and needed to take a rest somewhere
EDL	00:30:05,824	00:30:12,224	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Lying in their groups and they would say well we didn't leave the person behind but we had to go they were dead so they would cover their body with rock
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:13,760	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Fox in hopes of protecting them from animals
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:15,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Three places to pigs
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:17,088	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	One in the shade one under rocks
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And they set up a series of motion sensing
EDL	00:30:20,416	00:30:21,952	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Cameras all around the perimeter of
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,720	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The area
EDL	00:30:22,720	00:30:23,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To watch
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Both pigs
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:30,912	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	These are the kinds of cameras that turn on if something moves we set up the cameras under a very very hot sun
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:39,872	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And remember based on what Jason and read the prevailing idea was that bodies in the desert dome decompose until
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:46,016	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Six months in around nine months in amount would make the likelihood that they'd be found
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:46,784	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Higher
EDL	00:30:46,784	00:30:48,576	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Which might suggest that the official numbers are Act
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:51,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Regardless the Assumption wise
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:54,464	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That these bodies would be laying around for a while
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:54,976	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But
EDL	00:30:55,488	00:30:56,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Pretty quick
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Something moves
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:01,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And triggers the camera
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:10,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So this is footage of the pig that was in the shade and on the cameras you see
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:13,152	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Pig just under a tree lying on its side
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:15,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Wearing his little white shoes it has
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:16,992	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Jingdong
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,760	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Bloated
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,040	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But it intact
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:21,088	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And then
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,672	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Later that night camera comes on against night vision
EDL	00:31:24,672	00:31:26,976	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You can see the pig again
EDL	00:31:27,744	00:31:28,512	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And then
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,072	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	See this vulture
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:35,936	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	A few feet away from the pig
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:38,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Kind of looking at it kind of checking it out
EDL	00:31:38,240	00:31:38,752	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Just
EDL	00:31:39,264	00:31:39,776	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Standing there
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:42,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And then
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:46,944	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	After a couple of hours
EDL	00:31:46,944	00:31:48,480	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Camera comes back on
EDL	00:31:48,480	00:31:50,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Another eight vultures
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	On top of this pic
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And staring
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:32:00,000	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	A few hours later they go and they make a hole in the back of the neck
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:06,912	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Kind of like kind of right behind the ear and they're trying to connect the brain and then
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:14,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Turn off the shirt they eventually ripped the jeans off
EDL	00:32:15,872	00:32:18,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	By noon is a 50 there are
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:20,736	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Hordes of vultures
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,016	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Attack
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:23,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The abdomen
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:26,880	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Richtofen the stomach and then you see
EDL	00:32:26,880	00:32:33,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Intestines being pulled out and then you have two vultures come in front of the camera and they're playing tug-of-war with the
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,560	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Seize intestines and
EDL	00:32:35,584	00:32:37,120	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They start to take apart
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:43,008	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The limbs will actually like carry them away they will carry linzess like
EDL	00:32:43,008	00:32:44,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Convenient packages of meat
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They can eat later
EDL	00:32:46,848	00:32:52,480	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	27 they dragged what was left of the body about 20 m
EDL	00:32:52,992	00:32:54,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Upper Hill
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:57,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And within 9 days they had picked
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:58,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Picked it clean
EDL	00:33:00,672	00:33:02,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Everything's been pulled apart
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:03,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Anxious
EDL	00:33:04,000	00:33:05,536	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Scattered all over the place
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:07,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	After 9 days
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:09,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There's hardly anything left nine days
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:12,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah so they thought it might take 9 months
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And now it's down to nine days and and that was the pig in the shade the pig in the Little Rock Cut The Bad Pig
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:19,616	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Went way fast
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:23,456	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah that was within 24 hours for Ultra 2 started feeding
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:27,040	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I just got in underneath the rocks and ripped it up because we felt we had really forgotten that
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:28,064	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The rocks
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:29,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Conduct heat
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,904	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So it literally Cooks the body and speeds up the
EDL	00:33:31,904	00:33:32,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	This process
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:34,976	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It will completely defied
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:36,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Expectation
EDL	00:33:36,256	00:33:41,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	This wasn't all you're expecting at all vultures the only scavengers that you were known as
EDL	00:33:42,144	00:33:46,496	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Not the only scavengers so we saw some Ravens to must have dogs
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:51,360	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So this town of arivaca where we working a lot of people dying nearby and they have these
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You know kind of ranch dogs that are pretty wide-ranging
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:33:57,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And people have I'd heard stories of people singing on my. Came home with a
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:59,296	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	With a piece of human bone
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,856	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But these animals
EDL	00:34:01,856	00:34:04,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We're in or on our property eating these pigs
EDL	00:34:04,416	00:34:08,768	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I'm just now thinking it from the point of view of the dog owner on like this dog comes in and gets on the couch like
EDL	00:34:10,304	00:34:11,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That's the same tongue that might have been
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:13,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Knowing on a human arm exactly
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:21,312	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And after the vultures and crows and dogs that have their way with these pigs Jason K told us that the desert started working in small
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:23,104	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Mahler invisible
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,896	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Waze
EDL	00:34:24,896	00:34:30,784	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I have never seen this before like we used to flies and some Beatles but
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,576	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Consuming parts of
EDL	00:34:32,576	00:34:35,648	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Long bones are chipping off pieces of bone
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:42,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I'm carrying them off to this ant hole a meter away
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:42,816	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Not there
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:48,960	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	For for long enough note and they will completely disappear this is an environment in which people can become really easily
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,496	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Just erase
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:55,104	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Well there is something about when you when you were describing
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:34:57,408	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The first moment when the vault is really sort of
EDL	00:34:58,688	00:34:59,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Taryn to the body
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:04,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I haven't by found myself going to recoil and trying to protect my abdomen I still have
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:06,112	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That reaction
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,392	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There's something just
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,184	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	So
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:11,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Overwhelmingly human about this
EDL	00:35:12,000	00:35:13,024	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You can't not take
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:14,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Personally
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:17,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What can we talk about the
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The numbers for second
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:20,960	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because if
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:21,728	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Bodies
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:23,264	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Are decomposing and disappearing
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:24,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	This fast
EDL	00:35:26,080	00:35:27,616	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Does border patrol numbers
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:29,152	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Start to look sick
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:29,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Suspiciously
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:30,944	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Low
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:33,760	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Do you have any sense based on
EDL	00:35:33,760	00:35:35,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The speed of decomposition
EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:36,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	How many people
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:39,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We might be missing you know it just
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:42,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It just depends I mean on the phone when people die
EDL	00:35:42,208	00:35:48,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	At what time of year that I mean if you live in a better way to do is if you compare the number of missing persons reports
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:49,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	With the numbers of recovered bodies
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There's a discrepancy of
EDL	00:35:51,168	00:35:51,936	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	1000
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:53,728	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	These are missing persons reports
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:59,872	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	From America and missing persons reports are filed in the US by families already here
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,664	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Or or
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,736	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Trump sending countries but thousands of missing persons reports
EDL	00:36:05,248	00:36:07,808	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	More than the natural recovered bodies
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:11,392	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Thousands a year how to go missing a year during the process
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:15,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Obviously missing persons reports don't equate to deaths in the desert
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:20,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But pretty much everyone I talk to including some retired border patrol agents
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Agree that the official number is
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:24,192	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When it comes
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:26,496	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To the actual number of deaths
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:27,776	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Nobody knows for sure
EDL	00:36:27,776	00:36:31,104	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Depending on who you ask the real number could be anywhere from
EDL	00:36:31,616	00:36:34,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Twice to 10 times the official count
EDL	00:36:34,944	00:36:38,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And if you think about the fact that that has been happening
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:39,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	420
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:40,320	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Years
EDL	00:36:40,320	00:36:41,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Then what that
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:45,952	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	High School history teacher one cyber Coronado told us at the end of our last episode
EDL	00:36:46,720	00:36:48,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That sounds so crazy
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,536	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because of us
EDL	00:36:50,048	00:36:50,816	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Fences were built
EDL	00:36:52,096	00:36:53,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because the fences were built
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:36:56,192	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Maybe 10000
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:56,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	People have died in the day
EDL	00:36:58,240	00:37:00,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There's no way to verify that number
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:01,312	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Or any number
EDL	00:37:02,080	00:37:04,128	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But the potential scale of it
EDL	00:37:04,640	00:37:06,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Kind of forces you to ask
EDL	00:37:06,688	00:37:07,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Who is responsible
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:10,528	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Some of these people I talked to said that the
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:13,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Mexican government needs to do more to stop people going into these areas
EDL	00:37:14,112	00:37:17,184	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Others blame the Smugglers who bring people over
EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:19,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Some people have said that the migrants themselves
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:20,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Vdara Spa
EDL	00:37:20,256	00:37:23,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They knew they were making this decision to come if they die it's on them
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The other obvious question is
EDL	00:37:27,936	00:37:28,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What About Us
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:29,984	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah
EDL	00:37:31,008	00:37:34,336	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And what's clear you know json is
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:35,104	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Bad
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,896	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	US policy makers one exactly
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:37,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Play clueless about this
EDL	00:37:37,920	00:37:39,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There were points where people were saying things like
EDL	00:37:40,224	00:37:46,368	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If we do this if we funnel them towards Addison or desert of Arizona at we funnel them towards the port of Backwoods of Texas
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,672	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	People are going to get hurt people are going to die
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:51,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But if enough people died perhaps that will be
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:53,536	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The deterrent then that they'll stop coming
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:56,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is that written down
EDL	00:37:56,096	00:38:02,496	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It is oh my God I said death equals two turns there's a chart that eyesight in the book and this is one of the one of the moment
EDL	00:38:02,496	00:38:03,264	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Where I was
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:05,568	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When I was doing the kind of archival research that just
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:09,408	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Just shocked me where there was a point with someone written this policy document
EDL	00:38:09,408	00:38:13,248	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Alanine one of the follow-up reports by the government accountability office
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:18,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Some numbercruncher or some policymakers sitting at a computer and DC
EDL	00:38:18,624	00:38:20,160	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Making an Excel chart
EDL	00:38:20,160	00:38:25,792	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Work they're putting out different metrics to measure the effectiveness of this policy and one of the metrics is
EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:28,352	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	An increase in in in migrant death
EDL	00:38:28,864	00:38:32,960	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There was a recognition that if death goes up it means that this policy is working
EDL	00:38:33,728	00:38:39,104	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I ended up finding the document Jason was referring to it's a report from the government accountability office
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:40,128	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	1997
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And it also mentioned said in other areas death might also
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Go down
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:45,760	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I wanted to talk to Doris meissner about
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:51,392	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Cottage cheese remember the former ins commissioner that help take the Sylvester Rhea's Hold the Line strategy Nash
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,696	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And actually read part of the report
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:38:54,976	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yes
EDL	00:38:54,976	00:38:57,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And then there was this kind of one appendix
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:39:02,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Sin it is 5 and it's indicators for measuring the effectiveness
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,168	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Of the strategy
EDL	00:39:03,168	00:39:04,448	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Tradutor illegal entry
EDL	00:39:04,960	00:39:08,544	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Along the Southwest borders and one of the indicators was death
EDL	00:39:08,544	00:39:10,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Deaths of aliens attempting entry
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:14,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And basically what it says is that
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,712	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is recording at that
EDL	00:39:15,712	00:39:17,248	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If the Attorney General strategy
EDL	00:39:17,760	00:39:20,064	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Successful deaths may increase
EDL	00:39:20,064	00:39:23,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	As enforcement in urban areas vs Aliens 2
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To attempt mountain or desert
EDL	00:39:24,416	00:39:25,440	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Crossings in FL
EDL	00:39:25,440	00:39:26,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Text saying that
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:27,744	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If the strategy
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:30,304	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It if it just increase in these
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Treacherous areas
EDL	00:39:32,096	00:39:34,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That's a sign that the strategy is working
EDL	00:39:39,520	00:39:40,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Think I recall
EDL	00:39:40,800	00:39:42,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Reading that because it's so
EDL	00:39:43,104	00:39:46,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What makes you gasp when you have to really think about
EDL	00:39:46,176	00:39:46,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What the
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:49,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	All of the implications of all these things are
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:51,296	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When you know this is one of those
EDL	00:39:51,296	00:39:53,088	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Paradoxes of
EDL	00:39:53,088	00:39:55,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	How is it that you go about doing work like
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:39:57,440	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It's absolutely
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,976	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We're
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:03,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Ferb so many reasons that there needs to be border security
EDL	00:40:04,608	00:40:06,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But I think it is
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,960	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Fair to say
EDL	00:40:08,960	00:40:09,472	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:15,360	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The idea that we had at the time and the thinking that we put into place at the time
EDL	00:40:16,640	00:40:17,664	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Was too simple
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:23,552	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What was much more difficult to take into account it has been the tenacity
EDL	00:40:24,064	00:40:25,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Of people
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:27,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Coming to the United States
EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:29,440	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Wanted to come to the United States
EDL	00:40:29,952	00:40:31,744	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the length
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:33,536	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To which people will go
EDL	00:40:33,536	00:40:35,072	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In order to do that
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:37,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What that there's another way to read this means the
EDL	00:40:38,656	00:40:42,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The appendix five the sooner the thing that that has you in your words
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:44,032	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You said you know could make you gas
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,080	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	With that sort of says
EDL	00:40:47,360	00:40:49,408	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And one way to read that is that we took
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:51,968	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Problem that was very visible
EDL	00:40:51,968	00:40:54,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And we push it to places we can't see it anymore
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:55,296	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And
EDL	00:40:55,808	00:40:57,600	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We did that with full knowledge
EDL	00:40:58,880	00:40:59,648	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Did that
EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:02,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That people dying means we're doing the right thing
EDL	00:41:02,208	00:41:06,560	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Tatume appendix V begs the question mean what responsibilities do we
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:07,840	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Have
EDL	00:41:08,608	00:41:09,120	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	For this
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:13,984	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It doesn't quite feel like this is something that we can just shrug and say we didn't know this is going to happen
EDL	00:41:14,752	00:41:16,288	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It feels like we knew damn well this
EDL	00:41:16,288	00:41:16,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What's going to happen
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,104	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You know when you asked
EDL	00:41:19,104	00:41:22,432	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The question what is our responsibility and when you say our
EDL	00:41:22,432	00:41:23,200	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I think
EDL	00:41:23,200	00:41:26,272	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And I take that to mean what is our responsibility as a nation
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:30,368	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The answer at the time and the answer still is
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:31,392	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That
EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:36,000	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The enforcement will do everything that I can to
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:37,280	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Prevent
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:39,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	People from Crossing in dangerous areas
EDL	00:41:39,584	00:41:40,352	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But that
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:41,632	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Cannot include
EDL	00:41:41,632	00:41:42,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	No longer
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,704	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Doing enforcement across the bar
EDL	00:41:45,216	00:41:51,616	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Nudura says that you know once they started to realize these numbers it's spiked and if people were going through these areas they started doing
EDL	00:41:51,616	00:41:56,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In a lot of public awareness campaigns information campaigns warning people about the dangers of
EDL	00:41:56,991	00:41:58,015	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The desert
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:03,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Devoted to safety on the Mexican side of the created a whole new search-and-rescue unit cell
EDL	00:42:03,903	00:42:04,927	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	There were
EDL	00:42:04,927	00:42:06,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	All kinds of efforts
EDL	00:42:06,975	00:42:08,255	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To address it
EDL	00:42:08,255	00:42:11,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But I will be absolutely Frank with you
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:18,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The idea of abandoning any kind of strengthening border enforcement
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:20,543	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because of that consequence
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:22,335	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Was not a serious
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I would not appoint a serious
EDL	00:42:23,871	00:42:24,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Discussion
EDL	00:42:24,639	00:42:27,199	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the policy never really changed
EDL	00:42:27,199	00:42:31,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Substantiv wait there was a later report that came out from the government accountability office
EDL	00:42:31,295	00:42:32,319	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	2006
EDL	00:42:32,319	00:42:37,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That basically said you look you've done all these safety measures but the death in the desert are
EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:39,231	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Still going up
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Doris meissner was no longer head of the ins-and-outs
EDL	00:42:43,327	00:42:46,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Point but after reaching out to a whole bunch of people who wrote that report and
EDL	00:42:46,911	00:42:48,191	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the people received it
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:49,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And peering
EDL	00:42:49,471	00:42:50,751	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Nothing back frankly
EDL	00:42:50,751	00:42:55,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I finally got in touch with the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under President Bush at
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:56,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The time Ralph Basham
EDL	00:42:56,639	00:43:00,223	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Now retired and he told me he remembered reading that report
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:03,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	He said that you thought about those deaths all the time everyday
EDL	00:43:03,551	00:43:07,647	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But in the end she said it was just politically infeasible to back off the enforcement
EDL	00:43:07,647	00:43:08,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	At the major Crossing Point
EDL	00:43:08,671	00:43:12,767	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Sort of getting a border patrol to really control dangerous areas like
EDL	00:43:12,767	00:43:13,279	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The desert
EDL	00:43:13,791	00:43:18,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And in the end the US government didn't make any substantive changes in response to the rising desk
EDL	00:43:19,423	00:43:20,191	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And I guess you could
EDL	00:43:20,703	00:43:24,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Read that as a lack of political will or indifference
EDL	00:43:24,799	00:43:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But Jason actually argues that
EDL	00:43:27,103	00:43:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We were giving a
EDL	00:43:28,895	00:43:32,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Blessing to the system that was killing all these people because
EDL	00:43:33,503	00:43:35,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It kept his problem just
EDL	00:43:35,551	00:43:36,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Swept under the rug
EDL	00:43:36,831	00:43:37,343	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah
EDL	00:43:38,879	00:43:39,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Are you saying that
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,183	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The US
EDL	00:43:41,951	00:43:42,719	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Government
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:45,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Whatever portion of it is responsible for this policy
EDL	00:43:46,303	00:43:47,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is knowingly
EDL	00:43:50,143	00:43:50,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Killing people
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:55,263	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I would say it's knowingly putting people In Harm's Way
EDL	00:43:55,775	00:43:58,079	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And I know that there is a high likelihood
EDL	00:43:58,079	00:43:58,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That
EDL	00:43:59,359	00:44:01,151	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Bob certain percent of people are going to die
EDL	00:44:02,175	00:44:07,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It happened I was like they're having nature do the do their dirty work that's kind of what you
EDL	00:44:07,039	00:44:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Feel like it's absolutely I mean I would say 100% that nature is an agent of
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,159	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Border patrol
EDL	00:44:13,183	00:44:18,303	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It's at this kind of unsung hero of the border patrol either not on the payroll but they do all this work
EDL	00:44:19,583	00:44:21,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The environment beats up on migrants
EDL	00:44:21,631	00:44:23,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And then those who don't make it
EDL	00:44:23,423	00:44:25,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It just cleans up the mess as well
EDL	00:44:25,727	00:44:28,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I'm in nobody has to be accountable for this because it just disappears
EDL	00:44:33,407	00:44:37,503	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We asked Customs and Border Protection which oversees border patrol 2
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:39,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Comment whether they had tried to
EDL	00:44:39,295	00:44:41,343	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To change their strategy to avoid migrants
EDL	00:44:42,111	00:44:42,879	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And they decline to answer
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:49,023	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I wonder if I wonder if you feel somehow ambivalent about it like
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:53,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Obviously there are trade-offs for everything every every
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:55,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	You plan has unintended consequences
EDL	00:44:55,935	00:44:59,775	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But but this now this has happened and and these deaths
EDL	00:44:59,775	00:45:01,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Are also happening
EDL	00:45:01,567	00:45:04,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I wonder how you feel about it if you feel somehow I am busy
EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:09,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I feel deeply ambivalent about it I feel deeply
EDL	00:45:09,759	00:45:12,575	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Sorry about it I am very conflicted about it
EDL	00:45:13,087	00:45:14,367	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I also know
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,647	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That
EDL	00:45:15,647	00:45:18,975	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Migration is by its very nature
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Incredibly dangerous Enterprise but you know when it's illegal immigration
EDL	00:45:24,351	00:45:28,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	People coming up in a well before they ever get to the US border
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:29,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	People coming up
EDL	00:45:29,727	00:45:33,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Through Mexico through very dangerous areas where
EDL	00:45:33,055	00:45:39,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	They are robbed and kidnapped and extorted I mean there are awful Terrible Things That Go On
EDL	00:45:39,455	00:45:41,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In this quest for a better life
EDL	00:45:42,015	00:45:43,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	What I wish
EDL	00:45:43,295	00:45:44,319	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is that
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:46,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We would be able as a country
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:52,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Support immigration policies into a fact that it actually allow for people to come here legally
EDL	00:45:52,511	00:45:55,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Kumar economy is asking for
EDL	00:45:55,583	00:45:57,887	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In terms of the jobs that exist in the country
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	This
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:03,007	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	System that we've been involved with for now
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Decades
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:11,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Allowing illegal immigration to occur in sizable numbers
EDL	00:46:11,455	00:46:13,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Having work for people in this country
EDL	00:46:14,271	00:46:15,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is indefensible
EDL	00:46:15,807	00:46:21,695	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And the enforcement agencies are caught in between that they're required
EDL	00:46:21,695	00:46:22,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	2
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Create border security and yet there are these
EDL	00:46:26,047	00:46:26,815	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Terrible
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:27,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Cost
EDL	00:46:28,095	00:46:29,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Those terrible cost
EDL	00:46:29,631	00:46:31,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Would not be there
EDL	00:46:31,423	00:46:34,495	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If we as a country and as a political system
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:35,775	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Would come to grips
EDL	00:46:36,287	00:46:39,615	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	With the issue that is right in front of our eyes
EDL	00:46:39,615	00:46:44,223	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And that we simply won't come together politically to answer
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:46,783	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We are a nation of immigrants
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:49,855	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We are a country that believes in the rule of law
EDL	00:46:50,623	00:46:51,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Can't wait is indefensible
EDL	00:46:54,975	00:46:57,023	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	In light of that history
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:58,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And those values
EDL	00:46:58,559	00:47:00,095	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To have a loud
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:03,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	This kind of an illegal immigration picture
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:08,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	To go on in the way that it has for all these many years
EDL	00:47:12,895	00:47:17,503	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Wooden wall I mean this is going to sound misses an intentionally knife question but
EDL	00:47:18,271	00:47:20,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	If what you're saying is that that
EDL	00:47:20,831	00:47:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	That
EDL	00:47:21,855	00:47:23,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	We need to save lives
EDL	00:47:23,903	00:47:25,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Weather how we feel about
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The issue of immigration
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:29,023	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Is it a wall more humane
EDL	00:47:29,535	00:47:30,815	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Given what you just told us
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:32,863	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Well the walls not going to do anything
EDL	00:47:33,375	00:47:34,399	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I mean we know that
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Yeah I spend a lot of time now most of my time is not then with Smugglers
EDL	00:47:38,239	00:47:39,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Who loved the idea of a wall
EDL	00:47:40,031	00:47:43,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Cuz they're like man I can charge twice as much for this for my services
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Even though
EDL	00:47:44,639	00:47:46,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It's really not going to be that much harder
EDL	00:47:46,687	00:47:51,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Cuz people dig underneath it they crawl over it they fly over at they take a boat around it I mean
EDL	00:47:51,295	00:47:52,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	The wall itself is never going to
EDL	00:47:53,599	00:47:54,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	It's never going to be at
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:55,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Deterrent
EDL	00:47:59,487	00:48:02,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And on top of that I actually I didn't even know this
EDL	00:48:02,559	00:48:03,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	When we talked to Jason
EDL	00:48:04,351	00:48:10,751	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	But if you listen to the things that President Trump has said about the wall since coming into office
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:12,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	2000 miles
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:18,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Because of nature because of mountains and rivers and lots of he would end up just being
EDL	00:48:18,943	00:48:22,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	Even stronger version of this policy
EDL	00:48:25,343	00:48:27,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	And you have a river a river
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:33,535	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp2 |	I need an even stronger funnel interviews very places that are killing people
