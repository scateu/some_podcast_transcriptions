EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:58,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Just more and more and more of these migrant bodies being brought in and we're just crushed by the
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:00,128	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Weights of all the dead
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,408	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	All the missing person

EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It's like working at Mass disaster when
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:07,808	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	People are still dying and plansource
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:08,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Crashing around you
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:09,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And you
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,136	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	You throw your hands up in the air so
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,928	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Sometimes when you just think when's it going to stop
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:16,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And it hasn't stopped
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:21,119	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The number of bodies found last year was in the same range as the year before
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:27,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The number of people crossing did go down after Donald Trump's inauguration but traffic is basically rebounded so

EDL	00:04:41,343	00:04:43,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	In some ways that's a policy
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,183	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Which we talked about in our last episode
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:47,487	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But it's also a human
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:53,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Is Jason still there I'm still here and that's what let us back to the person who we started this whole journey with

EDL	00:05:01,311	00:05:05,663	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Well I feel like maybe we should just start off where we left off
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,967	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Which is that you were going to tell us this
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:09,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The story of
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,783	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Of Maricela

EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:15,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Joel June of 2012
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Okay so we had been
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:22,303	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	About two weeks into the pig experiment is the series of experiments were json
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Team most students
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,887	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Looked at how
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,423	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Pigs decompose in the desert
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,215	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	In order to understand how people.
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I was in the desert and it wasn't until about two weeks into this experiment where we
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:36,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	We're out hiking one day with the group of about 9
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,407	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	People
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:38,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Down in Southern Arizona
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:40,223	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It's on this particular day
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:41,503	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	On this trail that I had hiked
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:43,551	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Many many times
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,319	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Student
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:45,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And run ahead to
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:47,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	To check the fountain was taking pictures of us
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	As we're walking up a hill
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:51,743	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Ethan Roberts yelling at his he says hey you got to come up here
EDL	00:05:51,743	00:05:52,255	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Something has happened
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So I threw my backpack down
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,095	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Anatrace up this hill
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,959	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And by the time I get up there right I see that that he's kind of staring at this

EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:20,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She's got a scrunchie around her wrist
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:26,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The rest of it I mean her body was incredibly bloated them to the point where a little bit was about to
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:29,119	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Them to pop them all the gases that had built up
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,143	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Beside of her
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:30,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Her body cavity
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:36,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I didn't know what to do at this point I mean student start walking up I mean these are we young
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,847	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Students we had someone in the group who was
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,383	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	1819
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	For some of the students this is the first time they've seen a dead body
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:46,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	One of them was crying I tell everyone I said Hey look
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:49,343	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	You got to go sit down and give me a second here to figure out what
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	What is we're going to do here
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:54,719	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The first he called the police we do that and then we kind of
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:06:56,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Had a conversation of God weekend
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:07:00,607	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Photograph this person are we going to record any information is it so we still doing research right now
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,655	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And Jason decided
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Yeah we should
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,703	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	We should document
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,519	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Uno's downgraded green discoloration
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,663	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	About what she was wearing brown to Black discoloration of arms and legs pictures of the body or fingers have started to curl
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,199	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Ankles are swollen to the point
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:15,967	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Leather sneakers
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:17,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Seemed ready to pop off
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Is a steady hissing of intestinal gases
EDL	00:07:19,295	00:07:21,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And then it just got to the point where I was like okay
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	This is enough I don't want to
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,159	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Do this anymore
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:26,719	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And so they covered her with a blanket
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:27,999	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Because
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:29,535	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Jason noticed the birds
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Circling overhead for turkey vulture
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,655	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And so at that point they just sort of sat down and waited
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:36,191	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	For the police to come the sheriff
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	An hour went by
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:39,007	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	2
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:39,775	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	3
EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	For just waiting with the body
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:43,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Is about 5 hours in
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:46,943	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	That a sheriff and three border patrol agents show up
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:50,783	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And they had hiked 3 miles to get to Json with a stretcher
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,087	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Until they bring the stretcher
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The sheriff
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Puts on gloves
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:59,487	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He ask them a few questions like did you guys put
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Put the blanket on there
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And then they roll her into this white body bag
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And as the authorities do that
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:10,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Jason cashews Face Down json gets to see your face for the first time
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,311	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And so he writes a paragraph in his book and it's
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It's pretty gruesome but I'm going to read to you the paragraph that
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He he writes about in his butt
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,271	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	As her body turns I see what is left of her face
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:26,111	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It is frightening and unrecognizable as human
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:29,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The mouth is an aural purple and black
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:29,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Cool that
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:34,815	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I can't see her eyes because of mouth is too hard to look away from
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,143	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The skin around the lips is stretched out of shape
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Has already been melted
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:41,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Her nose is smashed in and pushed up
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She died face-down
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,335	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And the Flesh on the front side of her skull
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:46,847	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Asafa
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:49,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I can't order to fit around the dirt and rocks beneath her
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,271	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The scene is a Pastiche of metallic gray A&P grain
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Whatever Beauty and Humanity that once existed in her face
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:08:58,879	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Has been replaced
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Buy Stone colored cool
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:02,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Stuck in the Middle screen
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:07,071	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It's a look you can never get away from
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:13,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	After this thing that happened and it really
EDL	00:09:13,983	00:09:19,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Just shook me in a lot of different ways he just couldn't shake the question
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:21,407	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Who was this woman
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:23,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	How did she end up face down in the desert
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:29,855	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So that night I remember Jason calling me just called a friend of his
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,647	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	A woman named Robin Reineke
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:36,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And being really clearly shaken and you know asking for advice
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:42,399	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Robin Ashley runs this nonprofit in Tucson called the Colibri Center for human rights
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And they do a lot of work with the missing and with bodies that have been recovered
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So Jason tells her look we've today we had this this thing we found this person out here and could you help us ID her
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:10:00,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Now the thing is Robin's office is actually in the medical examiner's office so that means
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,647	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Just down the hall from Robin is
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,951	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The guy we met at the beginning Bruce Anderson
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:10,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	A couple hundred people are least bones of a person are in here
EDL	00:10:10,047	00:10:13,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Bruce is working on the medical examiner sign
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:19,775	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Anytime and unidentified migrant body comes in Bruce tries to piece together who this person is looking at
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:22,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Dimensions in the shape of the skull markers
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:28,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Robustness of the bones I like looking at the length of the bones or the density of the bones by the fusion of these
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:30,527	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Separate bones
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:36,927	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Weather some bones in the body are fused together which is something that happens right after puberty
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:42,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	What age the person is there sex their weight their height and in the case of the woman that
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:43,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Jason found
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:46,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Her body was surprisingly in relatively good condition Tok
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,191	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Pretty quickly
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	They were able to determine you know
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:52,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Probably in her 30s she's five
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:53,311	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But for
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:54,335	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	They were able to get
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:56,127	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Fingerprints from her as well
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:11:02,783	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Meanwhile on the other side on Robin side so each of these tabs as a person
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Is that right
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,831	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She's dealing with
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:06,623	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Hundreds of missing persons report
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:09,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	All day everyday she spends her days
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:15,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Kitchen calls going through voicemail which is full of relatives searching I'm looking for my uncle he disappeared into
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:22,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	2010 or I'm looking for my daughter she crossed two weeks ago we haven't heard from her and she's also getting tips
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:25,311	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	From different people at different organizations
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:27,103	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Any sexy one of those calls
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,639	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	That leads to a break
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,663	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	In the case
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:30,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Of the body the json

EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:35,807	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	12
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:39,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Hi Jason just a quick update regarding the woman that your group found
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:40,927	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The case number is 1250
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,975	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	1867 and as of yet she's not been identified
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:50,399	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Robin tells Jason that she got a call from an eight organization that had spoken to a guy would cross the desert
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:51,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Start with a big group of people
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:56,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Around the same time and around the same area where Jason found
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,055	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The body
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:01,407	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He said that he recently left behind two fellow Travelers who were in serious Medical
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,175	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Distress
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He said one of them
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,479	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Was an elderly man
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:05,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	70 years old
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:11,135	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And the other was a woman maybe from Guatemala or Ecuador late thirties early forties
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It isn't certain that this group is related
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	2 ml 12:50
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:15,743	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	67
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:16,255	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It's highly likely
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,535	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I will contact
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Guatemalan and Ecuadorian consulate

EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:28,543	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And eventually using all the information they got gathered Robin was able to determine that the body to Jason
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,335	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Found its the body

EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:41,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Robin gets in touch with Jason and tell him Jason and ask

EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:59,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Maybe it was the moment that our kids you've been reading to 4 month started reading back to you
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Or maybe the kid was a piano

EDL	00:14:50,623	00:14:54,975	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	When we left Jason along with Robin from the clery center
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:15:01,375	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Add manage to ID the body of the woman he found in the desert and so now he was trying to get in touch with her family
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:04,959	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I don't know when people disappear when I die in a desert I think that the family makeup
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:08,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	People had been so I was hoping that if I could find this person
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Family
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:10,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I could at least say
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,127	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	This is what it was like when we found her
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	This is what we think had happened
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:19,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The Robin was eventually able to get Json the contact information for maricela's
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:21,855	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Brother-in-law who will call Fernando and
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:23,903	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I make the awkward phone call that says hey
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:26,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I'm the person that found Maricela on the desert
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:30,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And I would like to come and see you if that's possible
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:36,703	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Turns out Fernando actually lives in New York City
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:40,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But he had spoken to Maricela just before she left
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:44,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And when we heard his story we decided okay we would have send a report at Ray C hunt
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:48,991	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	To talk with him
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:53,343	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Yes I went to visit Fernando at his apartment in Queens
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,367	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Jubileeblais
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:58,207	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She was there with his three dogs
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:02,047	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Friendly guy little shorter than me neatly dressed
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:06,399	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	You got in a dark hair longer on top shorter on the sides and
EDL	00:16:08,191	00:16:10,239	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	When I got there
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:13,311	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He pulled out a bunch of photos Maddy Salo
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:19,711	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	This is their marriage their wedding photos

EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:33,279	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So in this picture that Fernando showing me it's his brother and Marcella they're in the church and they're posing at the all
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:37,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Alter cheese in a white satin gown her hair is
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:41,471	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Long and dark and shiny and she got kind of like an oval shaped face
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:48,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	You know she she looks beautiful but even though it's her wedding day that the thing that struck me is
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:50,431	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Is that she's not smiling
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,967	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Not even a little bit
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:58,367	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Is he with you like what she serious like that it is it'll actually that's part of the reason why
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:17:02,975	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	My mother said she didn't like Christmas in the beginning
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:07,327	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She said you know she always has an angry face on
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:10,143	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She looks like somebody who doesn't have a lot of friends
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,679	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And on top of that
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:17,823	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Tornado said she also had a habit of getting his brother in trouble
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:23,199	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	You know she'll tell my brother to sneak out of the house to go see her
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:27,807	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Dancing parties La permission you know those kinds of things
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,319	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:36,511	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Banana says she even sleep on the family / she help out at home
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:40,863	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She treated my mom really well especially his mother
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:44,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Actually I think my mother loves her more than she loved.
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:50,847	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So my cell and Fernando's brother they got married they ended up having three kids
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:52,383	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Two boys and a girl
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:56,735	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Mary said I had a job in a factory that made counterfeit jeans
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I think Levi's
EDL	00:17:58,271	00:18:02,879	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And Fernando's brother he would go around to different Villages selling sodas
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:08,767	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	They just couldn't really managed to make ends meet they were living real rough
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:11,839	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	At the time I mean going when I went to the house and saw with
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:19,007	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So Jason after he connected with Fernando D actually ended up going down to Ecuador to meet
EDL	00:18:19,007	00:18:20,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Marsalis family
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:23,359	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Before she had left him and they were living in a one-room
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,127	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Plywood
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,663	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Shaq with a dirt floor
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:29,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And animals running running to the house and you know what she had told her
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:36,671	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Relatives recycled my kids are literally starving here yo comprendo La Casa Para
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:37,439	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Prodigy
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,207	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Tamia
EDL	00:18:38,207	00:18:44,351	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	At the time I wasn't able to help out as much financially because I was also helping build a house for my parents where they were also going to go
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:48,703	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And so I wasn't able to support them as much or help out with things
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:54,079	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Set School Minneapolis unit place on Del Escuela in so you know what she really wanted to do
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:55,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	You know in order to like Central
EDL	00:18:55,871	00:19:01,759	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Schooling all that she really wanted them to have what she never had never had anything
EDL	00:19:02,271	00:19:03,295	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So that was really
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,599	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The pressure that you was under
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:09,695	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So Fernandez in 2012 he called home
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:13,791	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Are you dumb
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:17,119	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	One time when I come home my mom said that she wanted to talk to me
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:21,983	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So I said okay on the phone and she told me that she wanted to come here
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,567	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She told him that she and his brother they wanted to follow in his footsteps
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,383	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	That if they could come to New York like he had
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:31,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	They can make money send it back home and how about their kids
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,247	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But that was the only way
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:35,039	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Immediately
EDL	00:19:35,039	00:19:38,367	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Fernando was like
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,391	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Absolutely not
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:40,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	No
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:44,255	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:46,559	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Fernando told her no because
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:49,631	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He didn't want her to go through the same thing he went through
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	10 years before
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	When he going to Sunnyvale
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,031	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	2001
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:59,871	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He was 17 years old I'm about to turn 18
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:03,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And his aunt was about to go to New York
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:06,015	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And she convinced him and his parents
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:12,415	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	That if he went to New York he be able to get a job make more money and support his family from there
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,207	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	To have a better life to help
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:16,767	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Things we need it
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:19,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So my father thought about it and gave his permission
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:24,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But he told me not to stay here too long and so he use his grandfather's
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:28,287	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Land as collateral and took out a loan for $12,000
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:30,079	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	$12
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:33,919	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Yeah I do know what the interest rate was on the loan 10%
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:34,687	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	10%
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:35,455	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Yeah
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:40,063	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So one thing that a lot of people have talked about is the fact that prevention to deterrence
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:46,463	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It professionalized the human smuggling business because not only do these migrants need be no guidance
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:49,279	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	From all these South and Central American countries
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,815	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	They also need guidance
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:51,583	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Do the desert
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:54,911	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	So now you have the smuggling business that's
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:56,447	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	More expensive
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:57,727	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And also more dangerous
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:21:00,799	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	108
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:02,591	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Yessir the coyote
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,895	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Cold as fat 15 days maximum

EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,416	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	After couple of weeks
EDL	00:24:28,416	00:24:34,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Fernando is on finally got out of this Hacienda and they start their Trek into the desert
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:39,936	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Fernando's thinks that he went through the same desert that Monticello would try to
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,216	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Cross 10 years later
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:44,288	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	He's actually caught by the border patrol and held for about a month
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,848	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Before he manages to bail himself
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,128	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Out of detention
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And make his way to New York
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:54,528	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And Fernando says he shared all of this with Maricela except his own rate
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But he
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:58,624	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Did tell her that migrants to get raped
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:03,232	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	That he seen it happen that he knows it happens
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:06,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	When I told her all of that she said
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,584	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	None of that what happened to her
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:10,912	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She knew how to defend yourself and you know what you have to
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:16,544	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She would hit people and then he told her you might have to go without food or sleep outside
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,616	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Came up as an import tariff
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:22,688	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	If I said that didn't matter that all that mattered was
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:26,016	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Getting here because the kids are the ones that matter X
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,832	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Any sacrifice made is worth it for your kids
EDL	00:25:29,856	00:25:31,648	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And then he
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:34,976	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Doesn't talk to me anymore that's that's actually the last phone call they ever have
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:39,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Because he thinks that if he cuts her off maybe she'll just give up
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But she goes to one of her brothers
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:48,288	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And her brother says that he would only pay for her to go but he's not going to pay for her husband's ago
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:54,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	She was going to come back herself did you try to tell your brother looks eec you shouldn't let her come here by yourself, it always

EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:03,392	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And that he wanted to go first
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,696	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But her brother has put the condition that she goes
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:07,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And
EDL	00:26:07,488	00:26:10,304	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Because they didn't have another option she said she would go
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:14,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Mid-2012 Maricela left Ecuador

EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Trying to keep going
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,504	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Before maricelis body was sent back to Ecuador
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:40,576	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Fernanda decided they should have it sent to New York first
EDL	00:28:40,576	00:28:44,160	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Don't sass
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:47,232	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	When I talk to my family I said you know
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:50,048	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Her dream was really to arrive here
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:51,328	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And so I thought
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	At least we can fulfill that dream with her body
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,752	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	To be able to have

EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:42,784	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	What she had wanted for them
EDL	00:29:46,624	00:29:51,488	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	When you think about that conversation do you think that there's anything you could have said that would have made her

EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:44,480	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	We have
EDL	00:30:44,480	00:30:47,296	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	About five times as many border patrol agents
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,344	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And get the number of

EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,208	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Has more than tripled during

EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,304	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	About 11 million
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,608	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And more people are coming
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:02,400	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Every year every day
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:05,216	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And more people are dying along the way

EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:32,096	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Appeared in
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:32,864	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Pretty much
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:34,144	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The same place Marisela.
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Which is this
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:40,032	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Text Maverick Maverick I'm going back to the to the Arizona desert basically because
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Marisela has a
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,360	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	The cousin

EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,456	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Who disappeared
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:50,016	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Almost one year to the day that she died
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:04,608	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I was able to kind of triangulate based on interviews with people who he was with and with information from
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:05,888	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Cranberries folks
EDL	00:32:06,400	00:32:08,192	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Where we think he went missing
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:10,240	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And I told his mom that I would not stop looking in
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:12,800	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It took me a couple years to figure out a weighted to
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,592	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	To do that
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,640	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	But right now
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:18,176	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	It will go back and will you see Toronto
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,456	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And see what we can come up with
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:32,256	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And you know
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:35,072	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Better than anyone what happens to bodies in the desert now I think
EDL	00:32:36,608	00:32:37,376	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I mean
EDL	00:32:37,376	00:32:39,424	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Why are you still looking for him

EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:49,920	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	I told his mom
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:55,040	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	Like I won't I won't stop looking for him I'll do whatever I can whatever little thing that I can do
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:58,368	| radiolab_podcast18bordertrilogyp3fix |	And if I can't find him
