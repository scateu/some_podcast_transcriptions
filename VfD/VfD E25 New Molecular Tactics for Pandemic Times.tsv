EDL	00:00:11,780	00:00:17,760	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Stealth technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight with operation. 
EDL	00:00:21,370	00:00:40,610	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research projects agency has been a driver of welcome to Voices from the dark , a window , and the dark is core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:41,000	00:00:43,970	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	My name is iphone motto on your dog , a host
EDL	00:00:43,970	00:00:44,240	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	today
EDL	00:00:44,240	00:00:47,170	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I am excited to have with me for a billion uncle appears
EDL	00:00:47,520	00:00:53,580	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Doctor and fisher , a program manager , since twenty seventeen in the agencies defense sciences office
EDL	00:00:53,580	00:01:14,394	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I talk with him back in twenty eighteen in a previous Voices from global partner , and and I are recording our conversation from our respective homes as we do our part to slow the spread of cold , with one thousand nine hundred and the pandemic disease caused by the new coronal virus , sars , kobe , too , my heart goes out to all of those in the US, and around the world were doing all kinds of rebels
EDL	00:01:14,394	00:01:17,279	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Losses , stresses and anxieties due to the pandemic
EDL	00:01:17,279	00:01:32,740	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Please note that because we are recording outside the studio setting , and on a particular whole new day , you might hear win noises , other ambient sounds , and fisher is a chemist by training with professional experiences that have taken her to the neighborhood research laboratory
EDL	00:01:32,740	00:01:56,520	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	The navy's corporate laboratory , which is just a few years away from its sentences celebration , a benefit of american association for the advancement of science , where she was a science and policy fellow , proud to becoming a dark a program manager in the defense of his , she had been a senior advisor for d so well at the consulting from strategic and and thanks for joining me for the podcast for a second time , it's good to be here
EDL	00:01:56,520	00:01:56,710	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I am
EDL	00:01:56,710	00:01:57,170	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Thank you
EDL	00:01:57,650	00:02:06,246	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	In this pad case , I want to focus on the part for you that you have been able to sword into our scientific and technological responses to the coordinate team pandemic
EDL	00:02:06,246	00:02:11,493	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	These programs include your accelerated molecular discovery program , and then make it programme
EDL	00:02:11,493	00:02:23,200	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And that would stand a chance of circumference of supply chain bono's abilities by enabling low cost fabrication of many important molecules in chemical ingredients that are anywhere , anytime and affordably
EDL	00:02:23,200	00:02:27,013	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So look for to learn more about where you have been taking that program
EDL	00:02:27,013	00:02:31,183	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But let's start with AMD , the accelerate delegator discovery program
EDL	00:02:31,183	00:02:32,500	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	What is the goal of it
EDL	00:02:32,500	00:02:33,597	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	What is it status
EDL	00:02:33,597	00:02:36,740	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And how is it relevant to our pandemic response? 
EDL	00:02:36,740	00:02:39,410	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Sure , I will thank you so exhilarated
EDL	00:02:39,410	00:02:49,360	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Military discovery , or MDSis really a program about helping chemist identifying discover new molecules that meet the property demands that we have to
EDL	00:02:49,360	00:02:52,177	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So we come , we come to the table with challenges
EDL	00:02:52,177	00:02:58,029	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	These challenges could be that I need a new material in the field for some protection measure
EDL	00:02:58,029	00:03:05,301	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	These changes could be that they , there is a new disease on , on on the horizon , and we need to develop a therapeutic for that disease
EDL	00:03:05,301	00:03:26,480	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And really , instead of using our intuition and our hands and experiment , what AMD is really trying to do is help leverage computational resources , including machine learning , leverage automation , to really help us accelerate the rate at which we can identify new molecules within the vast space of a potential molecules that might meet our capability needs. 
EDL	00:03:26,480	00:03:34,829	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Okay , and this is , in contrast to the traditional sort of bench chemistry way of discovering materials , which is a lot of trial and error
EDL	00:03:34,829	00:03:37,680	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	There's a lot of synthesis innovation that has to
EDL	00:03:37,680	00:03:42,258	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And here you are trying to leverage automation , tools , competition and so far threat
EDL	00:03:42,258	00:03:44,970	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	You had some experience , I think , on the bench to. 
EDL	00:03:44,970	00:03:46,090	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Yeah , I did
EDL	00:03:46,090	00:03:53,000	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And I think this is the situation of the way we do things that we still do them today in a laboratory by hand , and that's not a bad thing
EDL	00:03:53,000	00:04:22,423	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	It just , it doesn't that the time scale at which it takes to do those experiments , and then the limitations of of a chemist who , who has a training in a particular space of molecules or synthetic capabilities , release , sort of hinder innovation and being able to look outside of that sort of space in which we work , which , when you consider the vast possibilities based of , but say something like tender , the sixty of potential molecules that might provide us , the capabilities that they were looking for
EDL	00:04:22,423	00:04:45,000	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Really , these tools are to help a chemist , automation and laboratory to experiments faster and machine learning and other models to be able to actually understand properties in a really vast array of molecular spaces that we can be more efficient and effective in finding things like cares two to covering a team whether they be antibiotics or identifiers , too
EDL	00:04:45,000	00:04:45,680	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	To start
EDL	00:04:45,680	00:04:46,660	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	ACVTU. 
EDL	00:04:47,110	00:04:53,948	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Well , we will need to attend the sixty molecules that , if i'm not mistaken , that's a trillion trillion , truly
EDL	00:04:53,948	00:05:01,784	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And trillionaire children molecules , which are china , identify in that vast search base are a particular suited for particular purposes
EDL	00:05:01,784	00:05:06,145	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So , as many as you said , that can be for materials , they can be for farmers suit goals
EDL	00:05:06,145	00:05:11,300	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	They can be for other molecules of interest to the department of defence and military needs
EDL	00:05:11,630	00:05:21,300	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Let's actually do those zero went on on how you thinking about applying this , or how you already are beginning to with the performers who you have under contract for the program
EDL	00:05:21,300	00:05:24,740	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	How are you swerving that into the european nineteen response? 
EDL	00:05:24,740	00:05:27,456	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So that's that's a really great question in
EDL	00:05:27,456	00:05:30,173	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And what we're trying to do is actually love it
EDL	00:05:30,173	00:05:34,830	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	What capabilities we've developed as far in the program , in the context of community
EDL	00:05:34,830	00:05:41,938	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And , you know , AMD , exactly relatively young program , we just got kicked off at the very end of last year
EDL	00:05:41,938	00:05:55,062	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And so from an experimental perspective , or building the capabilities to do the experiments with that with evaluate predictions , but really were worth focused on for covering nineteen right now on the computation outside
EDL	00:05:55,062	00:06:03,369	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And that's both because that were were most mature , but it's also because of the laboratories are shut down when we think about being able to contribute these capabilities
EDL	00:06:03,369	00:06:07,093	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	What can we leverage today when people are home and want to help in the fight
EDL	00:06:07,093	00:06:14,010	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And so one great example of what we're doing that space is some effort at m it right now , which is one of the performers on the program
EDL	00:06:14,010	00:06:18,077	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	They did some early work in the program on developing antibiotics
EDL	00:06:18,077	00:06:21,466	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So there is actually a paper recently in cell
EDL	00:06:21,466	00:06:29,680	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	They're on the cover of sale in february , and they essentially reported that they searched virtually over a hundred million molecules
EDL	00:06:29,680	00:06:39,550	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So again , something no cameras could do come in any relevant time frame , searched for molecules that are known to us that might have enterprise activity
EDL	00:06:39,550	00:06:46,854	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And and what they were able to define is essentially to map these molecules to properties that are relevant for antibiotics activity
EDL	00:06:46,854	00:06:51,733	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	They then even tested these molecules against coastal quarters and bacterial cultures
EDL	00:06:51,733	00:06:59,722	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Excuse me , and were able to to show molecules that were actually of interest for other things like , like diabetes
EDL	00:06:59,722	00:07:07,750	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	There publics that actually had antibiotic activity against bugs that were relatively resistant to to antibiotics
EDL	00:07:07,750	00:07:10,410	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So this was , this was actually really critical finding
EDL	00:07:10,410	00:07:11,620	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	It was pretty good
EDL	00:07:11,620	00:07:20,640	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	All of the , the activity now surrounding surnamed korean , nineteen , and united actually interested in the point out this demonstration of an ability of activity
EDL	00:07:20,640	00:07:23,902	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	There are a lot of focus on now finding an entire viral
EDL	00:07:23,902	00:07:28,130	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So , so we want to be able to do development of iraq for the source
EDL	00:07:28,130	00:07:44,788	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	CUVtwo , but of many of the people that are in the hospital , bacterial infections that is so called secondary effects of of infection of coordinate team bacterial infections are are significant challenge , particularly those that are resistant to to turn and about
EDL	00:07:44,788	00:07:45,610	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Except we have
EDL	00:07:45,610	00:07:54,120	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So my teacher is now looking for an advantage for covering using the same tools and and building an argument in the tools that they develop for this paper that was highlight. 
EDL	00:07:54,120	00:08:05,808	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So if they were able to connect , achieve this results to say , identify him from the vast search base , michael structures , that would be able to potentially event about the function against secondary infection
EDL	00:08:05,808	00:08:11,890	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And like the monument faction , what would actually , what would m it actually deliver , and then what would be the next step? 
EDL	00:08:11,890	00:08:21,830	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Yesterday actually we , we have a beautiful collaboration between and my tea and walter reed army institute for research so known as rare WRAR. 
EDL	00:08:22,200	00:08:35,195	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And essentially what they're gonna be delivering is , here are some candidates molecules that could potentially serve as energy articles in a sort of what we wanted to use and rank ordered them
EDL	00:08:35,195	00:08:44,181	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	What of these molecules are at the FDapproach , so there might be FDapproval , completely different purpose , but we now should competition that they might have in a bacterial activity
EDL	00:08:44,181	00:08:46,940	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Then there are molecules that can be commercially purchased
EDL	00:08:46,940	00:08:52,390	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	They may not be affected , approved , but they are out there on the market , and then there are multiples that are completely new and novel
EDL	00:08:52,390	00:08:56,010	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So what we then do is send that list to rare , and we already got some hits in
EDL	00:08:56,010	00:09:03,060	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And and where is taking a look at this hits now and saying , okay , how can we then build a those into our essays and do the experimental validation? 
EDL	00:09:03,060	00:09:10,510	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Sometimes I need , ultimately that we go forward , potentially into animal tests and to clinical trials with people. 
EDL	00:09:10,510	00:09:11,253	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	That's right
EDL	00:09:11,253	00:09:11,996	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	That's right
EDL	00:09:11,996	00:09:21,470	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And we're leveraging all the resources that we have in the department defense , in terms of those SAand animal testing capabilities so that were ready to go when we do identify. 
EDL	00:09:21,470	00:09:28,370	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	A viable head were in also , because these secondary is infections and conditions like numeral are are common
EDL	00:09:28,370	00:09:32,220	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	This could have lasting effect , even beyond the present. 
EDL	00:09:32,220	00:09:33,441	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Dilemma , that's right
EDL	00:09:33,441	00:09:49,800	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And I think , again , important to emphasize the development of animals that are affected activity against bacteria that are typically resistant to known about exactly how I think listeners , what will know if heard things like I am about a christmas before , you know , where you have been about it
EDL	00:09:49,800	00:09:50,740	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So stepped
EDL	00:09:51,130	00:10:00,200	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So we really have to continue to to to innovate and develop new medicines so that we can address these new boxes emerge. 
EDL	00:10:00,200	00:10:06,120	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I am , thank you for giving them an update on the accelerated molecular discovery programming
EDL	00:10:06,120	00:10:17,450	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Congratulations for getting that launch right at the end of last year , which is , of course , exactly when the cobber nineteen outbreak began before it is , the group went to this global configuration of a pandemic
EDL	00:10:17,450	00:10:23,000	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But another program is relevant here , perhaps in the near term , as well as the long term , is called them
EDL	00:10:23,000	00:10:24,090	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Make it program
EDL	00:10:24,090	00:10:37,350	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	We spoke about this back in our earlier parties , but I like it till listeners roughly what the makeup program is attempting to do , and again , how it potentially could become relevant in situations like we find ourselves in now. 
EDL	00:10:37,350	00:10:39,038	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Well , AMD is , is all about
EDL	00:10:39,038	00:10:47,940	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Discovery is all about , you know , what molecule do I need to address whatever technological challenging facing make it is about
EDL	00:10:47,940	00:10:49,720	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	How do I produce that molecule
EDL	00:10:49,720	00:10:57,090	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So it doesn't matter how many molecules we identify that we might need as an entire violent of material , what really matters
EDL	00:10:57,090	00:11:00,700	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	In addition to that is , how do I make that monkey
EDL	00:11:00,700	00:11:16,532	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	How do I sympathize it and make it is about developing new capabilities so that we can certainly have devices , which not only can help in adults in the sentences of of america , which is currently done by hand , but also that that can make many , many molecules on a single platform
EDL	00:11:16,532	00:11:36,330	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So I give you an examples , if you think of an oil refinery where everything is in piping and two billion , we go from what i'm starting with on the front end of that , and then i'm processing it to some final as effectively , what make it devices do , and they allow you to do that fully automated so that you can take raw starting materials and produce many different products
EDL	00:11:36,330	00:11:45,470	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So is an example over the course of of the last several years and make it with demand straight at the synthesis of over thirty five different drugs from again
EDL	00:11:45,470	00:11:50,030	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Since it , you can buy a purchase from a chemical company all the way to. 
EDL	00:11:50,670	00:11:52,220	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	It would have imagined him he was there
EDL	00:11:52,220	00:12:07,110	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Maybe you campaigned to picture better than me , but this would facilities that are not so big , but that would potentially enable anybody thought of anyway , there are any time to make almost any sympathize of chemical , you know , kind of wherever they are as needed
EDL	00:12:07,110	00:12:16,540	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But one of you describe how this , for example , could play in a public health situation , where particular kind of safe farmers who was needed , but was hard to get. 
EDL	00:12:16,540	00:12:19,430	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	He has to imagine your description is actually , really , really good
EDL	00:12:19,430	00:12:44,060	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And I think it certainly learn itself not to me talking about what the original vision like make it was that instead of having sort of centralized facilities that are producing large amounts of chemicals , arguments of of medicines , we could actually deal with challenges that that are face , whether they're because of work more time , or because we have a supply chain problem , or because there is a pandemic
EDL	00:12:44,060	00:12:46,100	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Now there is a need for certain medicines
EDL	00:12:46,100	00:12:54,280	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	We can certainly take these devices , which are incredibly flexible and on a single device , then sort of tune to address the needed hand
EDL	00:12:54,280	00:12:56,540	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So you can imagine them doing that at a single location
EDL	00:12:56,540	00:13:01,756	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But not only that , because there are essentially the size of be you've done in your table
EDL	00:13:01,756	00:13:13,720	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	You can imagine that they can then have this sort of distributed network of these devices so that we could be now making things at the point of , and that was really always the vision of the making program
EDL	00:13:13,720	00:13:16,740	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And that's , I think , really highlights that need to thrive
EDL	00:13:16,740	00:13:20,840	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Think about , we know as as dark , but does what , what I need , maybe ten or twenty years than a line
EDL	00:13:20,840	00:13:38,590	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And what are the fundamental research investments that I can make today , that can make that a reality , because now that we have the reality that we're facing today , the investment that we made over the last four or five years in this technology , now , a really poisoned potentially can scale them and build them out to make independently that we currently. 
EDL	00:13:38,590	00:13:42,624	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Face , okay , so let me paint a picture about the next pandemic thread
EDL	00:13:42,624	00:13:47,509	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I'm optimistic , and i'm thinking about the other side of covered nineteen already
EDL	00:13:47,509	00:14:02,442	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I'm thinking about the next pandemic threat and putting your two programs together on imagining accelerated molecular discovery , perhaps identifying from that search space of tend to the sixteen articles , an anti viral that that might work
EDL	00:14:02,442	00:14:20,550	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And then i'm thinking about thousands of these make it devices distributed around the world that they might get instructions to work to actually make that antiviral at the point where you can be , you know , most easily distributed to those who needed
EDL	00:14:20,550	00:14:22,100	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And we did that a realistic. 
EDL	00:14:22,100	00:14:28,890	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Picture , I think that's absolutely realistic , and what we're trying to do right now is , is really get our thoughts around
EDL	00:14:28,890	00:14:33,207	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	What are the major technical challenges that we need to address to make that right
EDL	00:14:33,207	00:14:35,610	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So we have invested in the technology
EDL	00:14:35,610	00:14:44,890	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	We've got the platforms demonstrated that can make many different materials , but the research and development platforms , they are not robust , scalable devices
EDL	00:14:44,890	00:14:53,546	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And so now we really certainly think of , as we begin to think about transition these capabilities , I have a partnership currently with the department of health and human services
EDL	00:14:53,546	00:15:17,919	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Assistant secretary for preparative and response , which is much easier to say , expert ASPRto actually straight some of the capabilities that were developed in make it and critical programs that doubt against fundamental research investments that now have built these capabilities and working with aspirin , demonstrate these devices actually for production of an added a superfos in the context of FDAregulatory processes
EDL	00:15:17,919	00:15:27,260	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So again , now we got the devices next to all we need to think about how we deal with the regulatory aspects who are conclusively hand in hand with that capability. 
EDL	00:15:27,260	00:15:47,690	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Very exciting news to hear about both the makeup program and the accelerator molecular discovery program , may you succeed widely in both of those , because not only will that serve the mission of furthering the capabilities of our military patients , but it sounds like it would also do a lot of good for a lot of people in general throughout the world
EDL	00:15:47,690	00:15:49,860	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So you know , do happen now
EDL	00:15:49,860	00:16:14,490	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And as we close into the end here , I want to switch here just for a moment , I have a question about the reality of this pandemic for you as the reality of became more clear , you know , in february , march , and we have been hearing about obviously some of its , some of what was happening earlier than that , but i'm just wondering what some of your personal thoughts were as , as it was becoming clear that this was going to be a global public health threat
EDL	00:16:14,840	00:16:19,750	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And then also how it intersected with your professional role as a dark program manager. 
EDL	00:16:19,750	00:16:22,327	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Well , that's such an interesting question
EDL	00:16:22,327	00:16:29,000	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I think for me that to the biggest thing to look back on was how much changed in such a short period of time
EDL	00:16:29,510	00:16:36,550	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So there is about , you know , a three week period where I think we , as americans , at least eye , I don't want to speak for everybody in their states
EDL	00:16:36,550	00:16:47,398	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But we saw the panel far , and as it began to impact our lives very , very quickly , the realities of all that release sort of came to bear
EDL	00:16:47,398	00:16:54,470	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And I think we know that even before that happened , we were looking to how we could help in the fight
EDL	00:16:54,980	00:17:15,491	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But it's one thing to , can I see something at a distance and something very different when , when it then is impacting every second of your day , and in a world , all relatively fortunate that I can work from home , you know , my performers are arguing things that don't require them to put themselves in danger outside of any third quarantine or travel ban source type to think so
EDL	00:17:15,491	00:17:20,927	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	We can do our part right now , and that's what we're trying to lower to those capabilities to do our part right now
EDL	00:17:20,927	00:17:21,751	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But it's struggle
EDL	00:17:21,751	00:17:22,739	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	It's its challenging
EDL	00:17:22,739	00:17:35,824	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	I think everybody who listening has had some sort of personal , whether it's a female member who is sick or or managing kids , which is what i'm doing in a managing kids with two working parents is challenging , but it's so critically important that we all work hard on this
EDL	00:17:35,824	00:17:37,628	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So that's what we are trying to do
EDL	00:17:37,628	00:17:41,840	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And that's so many colleagues that are predicted another organizations , which is really. 
EDL	00:17:41,840	00:17:43,820	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Encouraging , indeed , work
EDL	00:17:43,820	00:17:45,300	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	We are all in this together
EDL	00:17:45,300	00:17:50,090	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So thank you for sharing those reflections on what you are doing in this , the reality of pandemic
EDL	00:17:50,400	00:17:51,870	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So we are about out of time
EDL	00:17:51,870	00:17:57,600	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But I just wanted to give you an opportunity to share or to ask a question that I should have asked and didn't
EDL	00:17:57,600	00:18:00,000	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	So you can ask that , and as ready for this. 
EDL	00:18:00,000	00:18:05,837	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	To question , I don't really have a question that follows up on anything in terms of communities
EDL	00:18:05,837	00:18:08,561	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	It's just kind of relates to what you just asked about
EDL	00:18:08,561	00:18:10,702	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	How will this team to be , and in what's next
EDL	00:18:10,702	00:18:36,526	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And you mentioned earlier , the next pandemic , what I hope is that that we can all learn in a sort of very important lessons about the response and how an organization like dark is responding , unable to put things out and just really highly again , the importance of the fundamental research investments that we , during , during , along the way that never were intended to influence the magical perspective of addressed the pandemic
EDL	00:18:36,526	00:18:46,960	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	But the way that we can shift that view and focus and still stay true to the main goals program , but build the capability much more rapidly than we would have been able to do under. 
EDL	00:18:46,960	00:18:49,015	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	Couldn't quote normal circumstances , yeah
EDL	00:18:49,015	00:19:07,641	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And just the final thought there , and we wanted to think that I, Ilove seeing adult and the programs that program managers like you in your country do overseas that so often the capabilities are powerful in the and general , and not just going for one specific , one of kind of solution , but there are capabilities that can be applied in many ways
EDL	00:19:07,641	00:19:34,748	| VfD E25 New Molecular Tactics for Pandemic Times |	And I think we're seeing that , and you know , both with your AMD and make a program so nice , nice illustration of that , and I just wanna thank you for making time here and for assuring with me and listeners , which dropped to , but thank you , evan , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from the airport , thanks also to bend silver and thomas shortage for their help in producing this podcast
