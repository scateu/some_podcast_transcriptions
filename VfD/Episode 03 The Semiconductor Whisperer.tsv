EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:37,888	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Their job
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:40,448	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:41,216	00:00:46,848	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	My name is Dan Green since 2013 I've been a program manager and DARPA's Microsystems technology office
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:49,152	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And I'm your DARPA host
EDL	00:00:49,152	00:00:49,920	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Ivan Amato
EDL	00:00:52,224	00:00:58,368	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Tell me a little bit about your background and how it relates to what you hope to accomplish in your time here at DARPA
EDL	00:00:58,368	00:01:04,000	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I came here through a series of fortunate events I got into science from an early age I like physics
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:05,792	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I did physics in college
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:07,584	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I got into semiconductor physics
EDL	00:01:08,096	00:01:09,888	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So semiconductors are the
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:11,680	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Materials that underpin the electronic
EDL	00:01:12,448	00:01:14,496	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In all of our commercial Technologies today
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:15,776	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And
EDL	00:01:16,288	00:01:17,824	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Really fell in love with that area
EDL	00:01:17,824	00:01:20,128	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	At that point time which was in the in the 90s
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:22,944	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	When I started getting into Electronics in in
EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:27,808	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Going out to grad school it was kind of a bad time to be doing Electronics because
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:29,344	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	There is a lot of maturity
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:30,112	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In light of
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:33,952	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Concerned about where it was going to go from there because of
EDL	00:01:33,952	00:01:35,744	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Established players like Intel work
EDL	00:01:36,256	00:01:40,352	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We're heading there hitting the stride and Along came a new material system
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,632	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Call Kelly nitride
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:44,960	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Until I was part of this first wave of Engineers that were brought up
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:50,592	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Looking at gallium nitride to understanding its properties as it applies to transistor technology
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:53,920	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Can you just spend a few seconds talking to us about
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:55,968	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	What is interesting about different kinds of Seneca
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:59,296	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So when you look at the history of semiconductors
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,088	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Straight the transistors came out
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:02,880	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	From the labs of force
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:03,904	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	After the after
EDL	00:02:03,904	00:02:05,952	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Did the second world war so it's been around for a long time
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:08,000	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Maybe interesting pieces that
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:12,352	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	As dominant as silicon is today that was not at all obvious
EDL	00:02:12,352	00:02:13,376	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	When I started
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And in fact when you look at the
EDL	00:02:15,168	00:02:16,960	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The first transistors they were made of germanium
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:23,872	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And they look like crazy little Contraption correct the size of a palm almost they jabbed a couple of
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:28,480	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Wires into this block of material and were able to extrapolate from that very
EDL	00:02:28,992	00:02:30,784	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Very rudimentary experiment that
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,576	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Hey we're really onto something here
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,624	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's obviously translated
EDL	00:02:34,624	00:02:36,416	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Too many billions dollars of
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:38,464	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Commercial activity now and
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,512	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The complexity of this we can do things today is
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:42,048	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Astonishing
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:43,328	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Really the key was
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:47,168	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Going from germanium to silicon and and a lot of the technical reasons that
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,192	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Made silicon
EDL	00:02:48,704	00:02:49,216	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Work
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:51,008	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Relate to the fact that it's just
EDL	00:02:51,008	00:02:54,336	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It warms combinations with other materials called oxide very easily
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,384	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And so having that oxide layer
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:58,944	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Really help control where the electrons flow
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:03,040	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The ability to manipulate the the material structure
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,576	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Is really wet separated
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:05,600	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Silicon
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:06,880	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	From the other competitors of that time
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:12,000	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Nht peace that happened with the you know the semi characters zoo in the 80s and 90s
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:16,352	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Was the dramatic expansion of the materials that were able to manipulate in that matter
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,144	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And so we went from
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:23,520	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Things like Silicon to our notice compound semiconductors where we use combinations of element
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,568	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To create new material sets
EDL	00:03:26,080	00:03:27,360	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So the first
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:28,128	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Material set that
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,944	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Hit the mainstream is called gallium arsenide
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:37,088	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Instead of being at your regular Crystal just made of silicon atoms it has an alternating pattern of gallium and arsenic
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:41,696	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Right and my understanding is going from Silicon to a Compound Semiconductor
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,488	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Igallop arsenide
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,768	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	With hard enough
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:49,376	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That it became a program by DARPA to to try to
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:51,168	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Make sure that material make it useful as a
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,752	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	DARPA made early investment to take
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:58,080	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	What then was experimental technology of gallium arsenide
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:04:01,152	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That was useful for things like amplifiers and
EDL	00:04:01,152	00:04:02,432	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Really scale it up
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:03,712	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To make it manufacturable
EDL	00:04:04,480	00:04:10,880	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because they realize that it was going to enable us to do things like a raise phased-array so what is a phased array phased arrays
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Is it is a
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:14,464	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	A combination of amplifiers in a repeated pattern
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,791	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So that you can project electromagnetic waves
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,583	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So that means things like
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:22,143	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Radars that go on our
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:22,911	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Airplanes and ships
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:26,751	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Can leverage that capability to see what's around them and to communicate
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:30,079	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And what ended up happening was because of the
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:34,943	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The defense interest in between that technology in the end the ability to bring it to a manufacturable state
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:38,015	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I love you will realize that hey would be useful for
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,039	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Commercial sector as well
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,903	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It so that same gallium arsenide technology that came out of the early DARPA
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,183	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So-called mimic program
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,463	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In the 90s
EDL	00:04:46,975	00:04:49,279	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I was really what set off the cell phone release
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,071	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because it enabled
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The amplifiers that let
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:55,167	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Those small handsets that you carry around with you
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,935	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To talk to
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The cell phone towers
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:02,335	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And that expansion of of the semiconductors do we we we started with germanium with
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:05,151	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Talked about silicon we talked about gallium arsenide
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:10,527	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	This might be a good time to consider moving to some of the programs that you've been oversee absolutely
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:14,111	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Kellie Martin I was was really exceptional because it showed
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,927	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	How different material properties can be by moving away from
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:17,439	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Silicon
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:20,255	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But by no means did that exhaust the periodic table
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:22,047	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Pinterest people were looking around
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,327	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	They realized
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That there's a lot of other rocks
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:27,935	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Late 90s early 2000
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,703	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	This was out
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:33,311	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	An individual researcher actually develop the technology to grow high-quality
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,335	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Gallium nitride material
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:37,663	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Elementary materials is special because
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:41,759	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It. It offers a wider band Gap so that's a characteristic energy the material
EDL	00:05:42,271	00:05:43,551	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And it enabled
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:46,367	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Devices to be made which could emit Into the Blue
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:48,159	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,183	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Which was not available before
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:56,095	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That's what off a whole wave in terms of lighting until we're saying that today with our pixelated stoplights and and the LEDs that we see now
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:56,607	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Houses
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:00,191	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But the correlation that was an able that material set
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:02,239	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	How to be more Wylie
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:02,751	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Available
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:07,103	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And enable those of us in electronics domain to use it for other purpose
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,127	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Places like high power amplifier
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:09,663	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Enable us to
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:10,175	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To look at
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,991	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Things like more efficient cell phone towers
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:16,575	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But also higher power a raise for
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:19,135	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The Navy and the and the Army and airforce
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:22,207	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	For the sensors and Communications and the
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,999	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Electronic warfare equipment that we use everyday
EDL	00:06:24,767	00:06:28,095	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Read and I know that one of your own passions has been to try to
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:34,495	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Look at the strengths of these different kinds of semiconductor materials in and then try to put them together to mix-and-match them
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:40,895	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Craze that might not have been so easy to do before partly because their Crystal structures are a little different and they might
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:46,015	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Not stick together well but these are some of the challenges right that you've been taking on as a program manager
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:47,807	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Part of the interesting piece
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,343	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We can learn I try it is
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:52,671	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Nothing much that it provides all these advantages but then it works at all
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:55,999	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's a very different material set then historical Summit
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:06:59,583	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It has a mechanical element that's a part of
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:02,399	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The way that it operates more than just the way that it moves Electronics
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,447	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It has what's gonna Speers Electric
EDL	00:07:05,215	00:07:06,239	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And so it actually
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,287	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Depends upon being compressed
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:09,567	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	By the combination materials
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,359	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In a certain state
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:12,895	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To enable the electrons to exist
EDL	00:07:13,407	00:07:14,431	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Where we can use them
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:18,271	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So we can mix in a little aluminum for there are gallium and nitrogen
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:20,319	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To create a different alloy and we
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:23,135	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Can grow those crystals right on top of each other
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:25,951	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So that they maintain their structure from letter to letter
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:32,863	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And a lot of the development that happened in the early DARPA mimicry was enabling those techniques where we can control that Crystal
EDL	00:07:32,863	00:07:34,143	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Flaring at the atomic scale
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:36,447	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Which enables us to create
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:39,007	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	These types of very finely
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,543	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Characterizes structured
EDL	00:07:40,543	00:07:41,055	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Devices
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:43,103	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Over very large area
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:44,895	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So we can create very complex circuits
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:47,199	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That are structured at that atomics
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,015	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So where all this goes from here
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:51,295	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because it has this
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:55,903	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Funny characteristic of mechanical and electrical coupling that's different is that
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:59,231	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	There's a whole swath of degrees of freedom that haven't really been explored
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,071	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So I entered the field just as it was maturing
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:06,655	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And worked at a company to help bring one of the initial products
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:07,679	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To life in terms of
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,239	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	High power amplifier for the cell phone community
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:13,055	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But my time at DARPA has really been about
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:14,847	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Where Do We Go From Here in terms of
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:16,127	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Leveraging all these
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:18,943	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Hidden attributes of gallium nitride that really haven't been
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:19,711	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I brought the bear yet
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,295	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So things like scaling the gate lights down to the links that we do
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:27,391	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And what that that enables us to do is push up higher and higher
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,207	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So how do we understand that well
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:30,719	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:35,583	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The frequencies that we we commonly encounter for like our cell phone is around to kg
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:40,703	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And really because the scaling advantages and that we can do with gallium nitride
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:44,543	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The higher power density that we can't we can start to realize
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:46,847	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The ability to transmit power
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,127	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Up in the millimeter wave
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,151	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So that's a
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:49,919	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Towards
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,455	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	30 to 300 gigahertz
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:54,527	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's the ability to dress that higher frequency range
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:58,367	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Really opens up a whole part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we have been able to
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:00,927	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Why do you want to go there
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,999	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because that will enable things like 5G
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:04,767	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In the commercial sector
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:07,071	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	There's a lot of activity right now.
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,631	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That's going to help us all stream video from wherever will
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:14,239	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Auburn also enables us to do different things like look at different material properties
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:18,335	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	As we interrogate what's going on with with different materials with
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:20,383	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	This different party like a mini spare
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,455	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So we can actually literally see the world in a different way
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,735	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because we're using light
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:29,599	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That the possibilities of what we can do there at just starting to be explored
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:34,207	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And the capabilities that we're developing with gallium nitride are a building block in a tool to help us
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:39,071	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Then how would you imagine the Technologies
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:41,631	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But you are nurturing you spoke speaking a lot about gallium
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,191	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Imagine that Finding Traction
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:48,031	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Both the National Security and civilian
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,591	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So the
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Technologies were developing with gallium nitride
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:54,943	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Are going to be very are going to be very important
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:56,991	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	For National Security because
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,783	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It doesn't he wants to get into these new parts
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I'll be like him a nice pair
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,343	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So that underpins
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,415	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	All of our capabilities when it comes to things like
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,183	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Communications
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,719	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Or sensing
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,279	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Coming from the civilian sector I didn't really understand until I worked
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:11,327	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	With some of the military
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Is that
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:14,143	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Rethink why do you need to send something
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,167	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:17,983	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And we know it's down the block and we're walking down the street
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,311	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But if you're in the Navy and you're on the ship in the middle of Pacific
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:24,127	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	You're in a very very dark place
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,919	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And you don't know what's around you in the world
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Shenzhen becomes very important
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:29,759	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because you're you're really out in the middle of nowhere
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:30,783	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And that's
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,319	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Part of the
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,623	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The piece that's missing I think when we think about this in
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,647	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Context of art everyday
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,719	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That the military is doing things that are very different
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,487	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	From what we do in the car
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:45,375	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	What we're doing with John Knight Rises enabling the technologies that will help them with those particular mission
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:49,215	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And what will happen at the end of the day is that once we have them
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	People are creative
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,287	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And they will find ways to use those piece
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:54,847	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	There are more relevant to what we doing
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,359	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In our everyday life
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:11:00,223	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So what might be some of the larger societal technological in
EDL	00:11:00,223	00:11:02,271	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Security context in which your
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:04,063	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Program in interest reside
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,367	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's a very interesting time right now in electronics
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,391	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And because
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:11,231	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Historically the US has had such a dominant position in the development
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:14,559	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	From the initial development of transistor Bell labs
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:15,839	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Through the
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The mass roll out of
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:19,423	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	PCS from Intel
EDL	00:11:19,935	00:11:23,263	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And what we've seen it just in the last decade or so
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:25,567	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Is the globalization of that technology has
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,079	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Spread around the world
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:31,711	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	What are the byproducts of the early going where DARPA funded a lot of these gallimard Senate Technologies
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,735	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That rolled into our defense
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,527	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Defense Communications
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:35,807	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Consulting Technologies
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,367	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Was that we had a very comfortable
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:40,159	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Place in the world where we
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,951	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Could make all those components at home
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,487	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And use them
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:45,279	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And in very controlled matters for our perp
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,607	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And with this globalization that's taking place
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:50,399	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's because of the Advent of cell phones
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,679	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Consumer electronics
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,983	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We're seeing now that
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:56,543	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	All these electronic pieces in these different developments
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Are happening all over the world
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,383	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's a really challenges
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,151	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The way that we
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,199	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Consumer electronics
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:04,479	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In the apartment
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:04,991	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Offense
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:07,039	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because now we
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:09,087	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We don't necessarily have all of those
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:11,391	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Best components at home because there's a lot of
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,671	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Activity all over the world
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Until there is
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:17,023	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	There's challenges both understand what pieces
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:18,815	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We should develop
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:19,583	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,375	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Can continue to own at home
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:24,959	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And what pieces we should leverage in that Global Marketplace
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:27,263	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And how to put the the best of those products together
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,311	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So that we can confirm a competitor
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:33,663	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	What you're talkin about here in some ways is the study of the
EDL	00:12:33,663	00:12:34,431	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Technology
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,991	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Ecosystem the engineering ecosystem
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,039	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Innovation ecosystem it makes me think about
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,575	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We're DARPA
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,599	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Listen to these very
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:42,111	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,647	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Siddhartha really is
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,183	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Fantastic in that
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:47,231	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It has the ability to go in and make
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,767	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Significant investment
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,535	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's too advanced
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,303	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Technologies
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,327	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Critical
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:52,607	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Really be a difference-maker
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:53,887	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	For instance
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:55,423	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's in in gallium nitride
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:55,935	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	I mentioned
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:12:57,215	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,263	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Newport's again as it came along
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:02,591	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To advancing what we can do in the RF Spectrum
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,383	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And really that
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,663	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Technology was
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:06,687	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Without in the world
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Because of the LED Market
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,015	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But DARPA came along and
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,295	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Made a significant investment
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:13,343	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In wide bandgap semiconductors or which
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,903	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To push the matter do that
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,439	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That's base
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:18,975	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	For the electronics to me
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,047	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And because of that early investment DARPA

EDL	00:13:30,751	00:13:31,775	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Around the services
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:32,799	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:35,103	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's also dominant
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,151	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Provided the backbone for
EDL	00:13:37,151	00:13:39,199	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Industry players that are serving commercial Market as well
EDL	00:13:39,711	00:13:42,527	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Then can you describe one
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:46,623	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Science fiction technology either that you read about in the past
EDL	00:13:46,623	00:13:50,463	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Come up on your road you woken up in the middle of the night with his dream of a technology
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,791	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It doesn't exist now but that you really wish
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:54,815	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Could exist
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:00,703	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	This is what we do here cuz I know time dreaming about different technology so
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:05,823	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It's such a fascinating time because a lot of these things that we formally just dreamed about our
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,615	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Coming to life around us
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:11,711	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The one Comic Book Guy I did read when I was a kid was Iron Man and so
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,015	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We now have all these Iron Man movies but
EDL	00:14:14,015	00:14:18,879	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	What's fascinating is walking around the building and seeing how parts of those Technologies are trying to make it look
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:21,695	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Less and less crazy you starting to see
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,743	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	People are actually working on exosuit
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:25,535	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	People who are working on
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:27,839	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	How we connect the body to electron
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:29,631	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	How we actually
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,423	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Interface with electronics
EDL	00:14:31,935	00:14:37,311	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So you're talking here about complex and potentially powerful Technologies which means they could lead
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,847	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To both good and
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Perhaps Troublesome results
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,967	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	How do you think about the potential consequences of the technology
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:44,991	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	You're helping
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So I think
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,087	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	That's a
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:51,647	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Explanation question that we do struggle with alot
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,927	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	As we continue to
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,719	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Expand our capability to
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:55,743	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Compute
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:57,023	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:57,535	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Projector
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,583	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Into the electromagnetic spectrum
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:02,399	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Really raises the ability for us to
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,167	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To be always on
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:04,959	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And always connected and it
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,495	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Not only did that
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:07,775	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Erase all the issues that
EDL	00:15:07,775	00:15:08,543	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Received today in terms of
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,591	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Having your cell phone all the time and
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,383	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In that sense always on
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:14,175	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But also this
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,711	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Always aware
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:16,991	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So that there's no way to hide
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:19,551	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Until it becomes a very open and transparent
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:22,367	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Place2be which has pluses and minuses
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,903	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	In terms of how we operate
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:24,927	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	As a democracy in the world
EDL	00:15:25,951	00:15:27,487	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	So I think there's a lot of
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,559	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Implications of technology that are yet to be trifled with
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,607	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	But it's also
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:35,679	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	A a law of physics that technology will advance
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:39,007	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	We will continue to explore the world so
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:40,031	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	It doesn't help
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:42,335	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Do not try to advance
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,103	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And see what's
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,615	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	What's possible
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,407	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	The whole point of Darkness
EDL	00:15:45,407	00:15:46,175	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	To prevent surprise
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:49,759	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	And really part of our job here is to go out to figure out what spots
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,295	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Hope that we can start that process
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:51,807	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Understanding
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:52,831	| Episode 03 The Semiconductor Whisperer |	Early
