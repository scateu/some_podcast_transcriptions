EDL	00:00:20,166	00:00:23,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	technology is a driver of our times since its founding
EDL	00:00:23,166	00:00:25,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War
EDL	00:00:25,333	00:00:27,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	DARPA the Defense Advanced Research
EDL	00:00:27,416	00:00:29,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Projects Agency has been a driver of

* Guest介绍

EDL	00:00:44,875	00:00:46,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	with me in the studio Dev Palmer, a
EDL	00:00:46,708	00:00:50,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	program manager and DARPA's  Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) .
EDL	00:00:50,541	00:00:54,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Since 2012 he has been in that office overseeing  a portfolio of
EDL	00:00:54,333	00:00:56,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	projects all of them with the goal of
EDL	00:00:56,208	00:00:58,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	pushing electronics into smaller, faster
EDL	00:00:58,666	00:01:01,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and generally more capable territory. So
EDL	00:01:01,000	00:01:02,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	welcome Dev to Voices from DARPA. 
EDL	00:01:02,875	00:01:06,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Thank you, Ivan. - Dev, I'd like to start by just

* Background

EDL	00:01:06,750	00:01:08,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	finding out a little bit about you and
EDL	00:01:08,416	00:01:10,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	so maybe you can tell us something about
EDL	00:01:10,375	00:01:12,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	your background and interests and how
EDL	00:01:12,500	00:01:16,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you became a program manager at DARPA.
EDL	00:01:16,125	00:01:19,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Well, like every red-blooded American
EDL	00:01:19,375	00:01:21,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	teenage boy I started playing electric
EDL	00:01:21,458	00:01:24,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	guitar back then you played through an
EDL	00:01:24,541	00:01:26,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	amplifier that used vacuum tubes and
EDL	00:01:26,625	00:01:29,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	there was some cachet (威望) with the soft glow
EDL	00:01:29,666	00:01:31,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	of the vacuum tubes and the warm sound
EDL	00:01:31,875	00:01:35,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that you get when you play your guitar through them
EDL	00:01:35,125	00:01:37,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	but being naturally curious
EDL	00:01:37,208	00:01:40,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	I started to wonder how they worked and
EDL	00:01:40,666	00:01:42,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	how does the guitar take the motion of
EDL	00:01:42,875	00:01:44,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the strings and turn it into an electric
EDL	00:01:44,541	00:01:48,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	signal that led me into studying electro-magnetics
EDL	00:01:48,875	00:01:53,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	ended up pursuing engineering Electrical Engineering as a  career 
EDL	00:01:53,583	00:01:57,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and started working as a government program manager for the  Army Research Office
EDL	00:01:57,666	00:02:01,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	about 15 years ago until I ended up here
EDL	00:02:01,166	00:02:03,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	let's talk a little bit about some of
EDL	00:02:03,750	00:02:06,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the programs then since 2012 that you
EDL	00:02:06,125	00:02:08,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	have been overseeing and I'm thinking
EDL	00:02:08,708	00:02:10,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	perhaps we can start with the Terahertz (太赫兹, 10的12次方)
EDL	00:02:10,666	00:02:12,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronics program
EDL	00:02:12,750	00:02:14,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and I'm gonna sort of steal your thunder
EDL	00:02:14,458	00:02:17,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	slightly here by telling or listeners
EDL	00:02:17,000	00:02:21,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that in 2014 it garnered(获得) a Guinness world record but I'm  gonna let you talk
EDL	00:02:21,000	00:02:23,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	about the program and and what that
EDL	00:02:23,416	00:02:26,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	superlative(最好的) moment was when you heard
EDL	00:02:26,125	00:02:27,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	about that record
EDL	00:02:27,416	00:02:31,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Dev: That was a lot of fun indeed you can
EDL	00:02:31,833	00:02:33,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	think about transistors like you think
EDL	00:02:33,750	00:02:36,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	about guitar strings the low frequency
EDL	00:02:36,833	00:02:40,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	guitar strings can be heavy and loose
EDL	00:02:40,875	00:02:43,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	but as you move up in frequency the
EDL	00:02:43,166	00:02:45,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	strings get thinner and you have to wind
EDL	00:02:45,416	00:02:47,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	them tighter it's kind of the same with
EDL	00:02:47,666	00:02:49,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	transistors when you're working at low
EDL	00:02:49,250	00:02:51,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequencies you can get away with large
EDL	00:02:51,166	00:02:54,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	dimensions and as you move up in
EDL	00:02:54,291	00:02:56,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequency those dimensions have to
EDL	00:02:56,166	00:02:58,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	shrink(缩小) so in the Terahertz electronics
EDL	00:02:58,750	00:03:00,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	program we really took that to an
EDL	00:03:00,583	00:03:03,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	extreme it's like when you're putting
EDL	00:03:03,041	00:03:04,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	new strings on your guitar and you're
EDL	00:03:04,458	00:03:08,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	tuning it up and you're winding(绕) the strings(弦)  tighter(更紧) and tighter you think
EDL	00:03:08,083	00:03:10,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	they can't get any tighter and they're
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	about to break but you still keep
EDL	00:03:12,250	00:03:14,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	winding and finally you hit the note you
EDL	00:03:14,083	00:03:16,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	want it worked kind of the same way in
EDL	00:03:16,416	00:03:18,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the Terahertz electronics progress... - so
EDL	00:03:18,416	00:03:19,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	let me just stop you a little bit before
EDL	00:03:19,958	00:03:22,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you say more about the program because
EDL	00:03:22,500	00:03:24,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	I'm not sure all of our listeners would
EDL	00:03:24,250	00:03:26,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	have heard the term Terahertz and I know
EDL	00:03:26,166	00:03:28,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the a) above middle C on a guitar
EDL	00:03:28,500	00:03:32,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	vibrates at 440 Hertz that's 440
EDL	00:03:32,500	00:03:34,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	vibrations(振动) per second

* 1THz = ?

---	00:03:34,875	00:03:38,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	tell us what 1 terahertz is in
---	00:03:38,208	00:03:43,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	comparison to that 1 terahertz is 10 to the 12th (10的12次方)  vibrations per second which is
---	00:03:43,791	00:03:47,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	1 comma zero zero zero comma zero zero
---	00:03:47,666	00:03:50,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	zero comma zero zero zero comma zero
---	00:03:50,166	00:03:53,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	zero zero cycles per second that's one
---	00:03:53,875	00:03:56,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	trillion that's correct one trillion
---	00:03:56,291	00:03:58,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	cycles per second so that's very hard to
---	00:03:58,583	00:04:00,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	achieve in an electronic circuit right

EDL	00:04:00,833	00:04:04,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	yes very hard in fact when the program
EDL	00:04:04,583	00:04:06,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	started none of the performers believed
EDL	00:04:06,291	00:04:08,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	it could be done and during the program
EDL	00:04:08,708	00:04:12,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	there were many instances when we were
EDL	00:04:12,541	00:04:13,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	thinking that maybe we should just
EDL	00:04:13,916	00:04:16,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	circle the wagons and try to make the
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:18,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronics weren't work better at a
EDL	00:04:18,125	00:04:20,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	lower frequency but one of my colleagues
EDL	00:04:20,375	00:04:22,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Bruce Wallace said that
EDL	00:04:22,958	00:04:25,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Chuck Yeager didn't get famous for
EDL	00:04:25,375	00:04:28,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	flying 85% of the speed of sound so if
EDL	00:04:28,375	00:04:29,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	we were gonna have a terrorist
EDL	00:04:29,458	00:04:31,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronics program we were gonna have
EDL	00:04:31,791	00:04:34,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronics at work that one terahertz
EDL	00:04:34,041	00:04:38,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	so everybody found a new knobs to twist
EDL	00:04:38,416	00:04:41,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and kept working on it and finally we
EDL	00:04:41,708	00:04:45,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	did hit that mark. right okay and and at
EDL	00:04:45,291	00:04:47,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that time that what and perhaps it is
EDL	00:04:47,416	00:04:49,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	now you can let me know what the status
EDL	00:04:49,166	00:04:52,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is but it actually was the fastest
EDL	00:04:52,291	00:04:54,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	switching electronic circuit on the planet
EDL	00:04:54,791	00:04:57,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	it's the fastest linear amplifier on the
EDL	00:04:57,708	00:05:00,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	planet at the time and still is and I
EDL	00:05:00,500	00:05:02,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	imagine it will be for some time to come
EDL	00:05:02,333	00:05:06,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	okay so it took you you know you had to
EDL	00:05:06,041	00:05:08,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	inspire your performers those groups
EDL	00:05:08,791	00:05:10,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that worked on this to to actually
EDL	00:05:10,833	00:05:12,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	achieve this you went through great
EDL	00:05:12,750	00:05:15,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	pains to do this why what what do you
EDL	00:05:15,791	00:05:17,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	get by having a terahertz switch 
EDL	00:05:18,166	00:05:20,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Dev: There's two things you get from moving
EDL	00:05:20,166	00:05:22,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	transistor performance up in frequency
EDL	00:05:22,125	00:05:25,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	1. is you access much wider bandwidths
EDL	00:05:25,416	00:05:27,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	which is like having a bigger pipe to
EDL	00:05:27,708	00:05:28,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	push your data through in a
EDL	00:05:28,833	00:05:32,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	communication system and the other is if
EDL	00:05:32,500	00:05:35,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you work on a transistor enough to to
EDL	00:05:35,041	00:05:37,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	make it capable of working at a
EDL	00:05:37,083	00:05:39,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	terahertz you have to eliminate(消除) all the
EDL	00:05:39,541	00:05:42,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	parasitic capacitances(寄生电容) resistances(电阻)
EDL	00:05:42,041	00:05:45,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	inductances(电感) that limit its performance
EDL	00:05:45,291	00:05:46,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and then when you take that same
EDL	00:05:46,833	00:05:49,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	transistor and operate down at lower
EDL	00:05:49,541	00:05:51,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequencies say in the millimeter wave
EDL	00:05:51,208	00:05:53,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the performance of the transistor is
EDL	00:05:53,583	00:05:56,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	much better you get lower noise better
EDL	00:05:56,458	00:05:59,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	linearity(线性度) better dynamic range(动态范围) and maybe
EDL	00:05:59,000	00:06:01,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	most importantly better power efficiency
EDL	00:06:01,291	00:06:03,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	interesting so you get this circuitry(电路系统)
EDL	00:06:03,750	00:06:06,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that that can switch it a terahertz that
EDL	00:06:06,333	00:06:08,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	then has additional benefits
EDL	00:06:08,916	00:06:10,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	just because you've pushed the
EDL	00:06:10,333	00:06:11,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	technology for it and you can apply it
EDL	00:06:11,875	00:06:13,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	elsewhere in the electronic space
EDL	00:06:13,416	00:06:16,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	exactly right so let's let's move to
EDL	00:06:16,041	00:06:18,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	another program that I guess really gets
EDL	00:06:18,375	00:06:19,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	back to what we were talking about
EDL	00:06:19,750	00:06:21,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	before which is vacuum electronics this
EDL	00:06:21,875	00:06:24,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	one is called INVEST and that stands for
EDL	00:06:24,666	00:06:27,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	innovative vacuum electronics science
EDL	00:06:27,875	00:06:29,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and technology program so I'd love you
EDL	00:06:29,916	00:06:32,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	to tell us a little bit about the origin
EDL	00:06:32,541	00:06:34,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	of that program what problems and or
EDL	00:06:34,208	00:06:35,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	what technologies is it
EDL	00:06:35,875	00:06:39,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is designed to create and what its
EDL	00:06:39,125	00:06:40,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	status is at the moment
EDL	00:06:41,333	00:06:43,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	terahertz electronics program pushed solid-state
EDL	00:06:43,916	00:06:45,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronics up to an extremely high
EDL	00:06:45,458	00:06:47,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequency but if you're trying to get
EDL	00:06:47,750	00:06:49,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	extremely high frequency and extremely
EDL	00:06:49,791	00:06:52,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	high power at the same time vacuum tubes(真空管)
EDL	00:06:52,916	00:06:55,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	are pretty much our only option the
EDL	00:06:55,375	00:06:58,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	problem is that vacuum tubes scale with
EDL	00:06:58,208	00:07:00,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	operating frequency the dimensions get
EDL	00:07:00,000	00:07:01,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	smaller and smaller as you go up in
EDL	00:07:01,875	00:07:03,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequency and so at some point you just
EDL	00:07:03,625	00:07:06,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	can't build them so the INVEST program
EDL	00:07:06,166	00:07:10,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is exploring several different areas one
EDL	00:07:10,625	00:07:13,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is advanced manufacturing for example
EDL	00:07:13,000	00:07:16,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	using 3d printing additive manufacturing
EDL	00:07:16,833	00:07:19,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the vision there is to be able to draw
EDL	00:07:19,791	00:07:22,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the tube in a CAD program ship the CAD
EDL	00:07:22,250	00:07:24,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	file to the printer and end it end up
EDL	00:07:24,458	00:07:27,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	with a millimeter wave tube voila
EDL	00:07:27,291	00:07:29,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	right out of the machines and CAD being
EDL	00:07:29,458	00:07:31,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	a computer-aided design and the idea
EDL	00:07:31,875	00:07:34,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	here then is you have to make the
EDL	00:07:34,208	00:07:36,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	cavities(腔/孔) in which sort of the the the
EDL	00:07:36,625	00:07:39,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequency generation is occurring really
EDL	00:07:39,875	00:07:42,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	small smaller than ever before for the
EDL	00:07:42,875	00:07:44,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequencies are interested in the area
EDL	00:07:44,458	00:07:47,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the cavity(腔体) dimensions get smaller and
EDL	00:07:47,125	00:07:48,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the alignment(对准) requirements get more
EDL	00:07:48,750	00:07:50,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	critical so if you could build the whole
EDL	00:07:50,500	00:07:53,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	tube at once you'd have the dimensions
EDL	00:07:53,208	00:07:56,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and the alignment in one shot there's
EDL	00:07:56,041	00:07:57,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	another thrust(推力) in the program that's
EDL	00:07:57,750	00:07:59,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	looking at modeling because as you move
EDL	00:07:59,791	00:08:02,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	up in frequency, small variations in the
EDL	00:08:02,625	00:08:04,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	manufacturing process can produce large
EDL	00:08:04,791	00:08:06,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	variations in device performance and
EDL	00:08:06,958	00:08:09,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you'd like to be able to know which of
EDL	00:08:09,750	00:08:11,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the dimensional parameters is most
EDL	00:08:11,375	00:08:13,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	important so you need a modeling program
EDL	00:08:13,958	00:08:17,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	to do that then there are other
EDL	00:08:17,083	00:08:20,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	components of the tube the cathode(阴极) and
EDL	00:08:20,250	00:08:22,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the beam(波束) wave interaction structure (波束相互作用结构)
EDL	00:08:22,083	00:08:24,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	where we just went out looking for new
EDL	00:08:24,625	00:08:27,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and interesting ideas maybe that would
EDL	00:08:27,541	00:08:29,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	just blow away the current way of
EDL	00:08:29,916	00:08:32,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	building tubes and eliminate the problem
EDL	00:08:32,625	00:08:35,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	with manufacturing altogether okay so
EDL	00:08:35,125	00:08:37,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	let's say the program ends up being
EDL	00:08:37,500	00:08:39,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	successful and why shouldn't we think
EDL	00:08:39,000	00:08:40,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	otherwise
EDL	00:08:40,500	00:08:43,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	so you end up having a new kind of
EDL	00:08:43,750	00:08:45,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	family of technologies where you've got
EDL	00:08:45,958	00:08:48,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	this high frequency and you've got the
EDL	00:08:48,541	00:08:49,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	high-power
EDL	00:08:49,250	00:08:52,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	where do you imagine these technologies
EDL	00:08:52,333	00:08:56,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	finding an important place so you hear a
EDL	00:08:56,083	00:08:59,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	lot about 5g as the next generation of
EDL	00:08:59,208	00:09:00,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	cellphone communications
EDL	00:09:00,625	00:09:02,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	they're talking about using frequencies
EDL	00:09:02,583	00:09:04,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that are in the millimeter wave region
EDL	00:09:04,333	00:09:07,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	of the spectrum but still hard to get
EDL	00:09:07,458	00:09:10,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	devices that operate in that range
EDL	00:09:10,500	00:09:12,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	especially with enough power to close a
EDL	00:09:12,500	00:09:14,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	communications link over a long distance
EDL	00:09:14,458	00:09:17,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	so that's where the INVEST program comes
EDL	00:09:17,041	00:09:19,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	in you get millimeter wave operation and
EDL	00:09:19,958	00:09:23,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	high-power in an affordable power
EDL	00:09:23,291	00:09:25,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	efficient device and again using your
EDL	00:09:25,708	00:09:27,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	pipe metaphor(比喻) which I really like you
EDL	00:09:27,375	00:09:29,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	have you will have bigger pipes on
EDL	00:09:29,250	00:09:31,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	connecting our cell phones to the system
EDL	00:09:31,291	00:09:33,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	with this technology that might come out
EDL	00:09:33,250	00:09:36,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	of the INVEST program yes absolutely
EDL	00:09:36,041	00:09:37,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you're not gonna find a vacuum tube in
EDL	00:09:37,916	00:09:40,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	your handset I'm pretty sure but it
EDL	00:09:40,291	00:09:42,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	could see some use at base stations and
EDL	00:09:42,166	00:09:43,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	definitely in military communication
EDL	00:09:43,791	00:09:45,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	systems all right and so let's talk
EDL	00:09:45,708	00:09:47,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	about just one more program and this is
EDL	00:09:47,916	00:09:51,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	one of your latest which is a mouthful
EDL	00:09:51,166	00:09:53,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	to say one of these short forms I like
EDL	00:09:53,541	00:09:56,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is M cubic (M的立方, MMM三个词，后文有提到) if you actually write that
EDL	00:09:56,291	00:09:59,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	out that's M3 I see but the real long
EDL	00:09:59,750	00:10:03,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	form I'll say it'll take two seconds or
EDL	00:10:03,125	00:10:05,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	three magnetic miniaturized and
EDL	00:10:05,583	00:10:08,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	monolithically integrated components
EDL	00:10:08,125	00:10:10,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	program did I actually say that right
EDL	00:10:10,333	00:10:12,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	yes that's exactly alright so I feel
EDL	00:10:12,916	00:10:14,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	like I've accomplished something
EDL	00:10:14,041	00:10:16,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	okay well the primary goal of the
EDL	00:10:16,166	00:10:18,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	program is to be able to hit a great
EDL	00:10:18,375	00:10:20,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	magnetic materials with the
EDL	00:10:20,166	00:10:22,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	semiconductor devices that everybody
EDL	00:10:22,250	00:10:26,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	knows it loves today if you dive a
EDL	00:10:26,750	00:10:29,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	little deeper into it we've achieved an
EDL	00:10:29,458	00:10:31,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	incredible degree of integration of
EDL	00:10:31,166	00:10:33,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronic components like resistors (电阻)
EDL	00:10:33,125	00:10:35,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	transistors (晶体管) and capacitors (电容) largely
EDL	00:10:35,833	00:10:38,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	because you have a large pallet(托盘) of
EDL	00:10:38,750	00:10:40,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	materials to work with that have
EDL	00:10:40,708	00:10:42,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	properties that are relevant to
EDL	00:10:42,000	00:10:44,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronic components with magnetic
EDL	00:10:44,625	00:10:47,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	components there are only three elements
EDL	00:10:47,208	00:10:50,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that have intrinsic(固有的) magnetic properties
EDL	00:10:50,208	00:10:53,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	so it's been very difficulty to find a
EDL	00:10:53,541	00:10:54,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	way to integrate those with
EDL	00:10:54,791	00:10:56,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	semiconductor processes
EDL	00:10:56,416	00:10:58,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	what we're trying to do with the program
EDL	00:10:58,500	00:11:00,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is leverage some work that's been
EDL	00:11:00,750	00:11:02,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	in material science on magnetic
EDL	00:11:02,625	00:11:05,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	materials over the last decade or so
EDL	00:11:05,416	00:11:08,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	with microwave engineering to produce
EDL	00:11:08,666	00:11:11,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	integrated components where you can
EDL	00:11:11,291	00:11:13,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	actually access that magnetic physics in
EDL	00:11:13,625	00:11:16,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	an electronic circuit in a very compact
EDL	00:11:16,166	00:11:19,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	form factor so let me ask you this
EDL	00:11:19,000	00:11:20,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	because I'm already amazed by the chips
EDL	00:11:20,958	00:11:23,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	in our lives right they can do so many
EDL	00:11:23,583	00:11:26,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	things they have there's part of so many
EDL	00:11:26,416	00:11:29,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	technologies what more are you gonna get
EDL	00:11:29,375	00:11:32,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	by taking small magnetic components now
EDL	00:11:32,625	00:11:34,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and integrating them into those those
EDL	00:11:34,375	00:11:38,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	ubiquitous chips from the user point of
EDL	00:11:38,291	00:11:40,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	view you probably won't see anything
EDL	00:11:40,416	00:11:42,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	much different but from the
EDL	00:11:42,250	00:11:44,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	technologists point of view lower
EDL	00:11:44,083	00:11:45,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	frequency systems use magnetic
EDL	00:11:45,708	00:11:47,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	components all the time but they're
EDL	00:11:47,625	00:11:51,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	large and heavy and tend to be difficult
EDL	00:11:51,583	00:11:53,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	to integrate so you kind of push that
EDL	00:11:53,625	00:11:55,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	functionality out to the edges of the
EDL	00:11:55,625	00:11:58,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	circuits and use it in a non-ideal way
EDL	00:11:59,333	00:12:01,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	so give me an example or two though of a
EDL	00:12:01,625	00:12:03,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	specific technology where these magnetic
EDL	00:12:03,541	00:12:06,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	components are central to it even though
EDL	00:12:06,375	00:12:08,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	they're not yet integrated onto the
EDL	00:12:08,125	00:12:10,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	chips themselves but they're somehow in
EDL	00:12:10,000	00:12:11,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the overall system so what might be an
EDL	00:12:11,333	00:12:12,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	overall system that again has the
EDL	00:12:12,833	00:12:14,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	electronics in it and some of these
EDL	00:12:14,250	00:12:15,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	magnetic components we're talking about
EDL	00:12:15,916	00:12:18,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	well picture a walkie-talkie for example
EDL	00:12:18,541	00:12:20,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you've got a transmitter and a receiver
EDL	00:12:20,791	00:12:23,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	but you've only got one antenna there's
EDL	00:12:23,875	00:12:26,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	a magnetic component that isolates the
EDL	00:12:26,833	00:12:28,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	transmitter from the receiver and
EDL	00:12:28,416	00:12:29,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	connects both of them through the
EDL	00:12:29,708	00:12:32,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	antenna at the same time if you didn't
EDL	00:12:32,666	00:12:33,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	have that you'd have to have two
EDL	00:12:33,791	00:12:36,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	antennas now I put higher frequencies
EDL	00:12:36,583	00:12:40,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you can still do that but the
EDL	00:12:40,583	00:12:43,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	performance of the components drops off
EDL	00:12:43,125	00:12:46,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	substantially because they're separate
EDL	00:12:46,333	00:12:48,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	from the electronics what we're hoping
EDL	00:12:48,541	00:12:52,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	to do with M cubic (MMM) is bringing that
EDL	00:12:52,250	00:12:55,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	functionality back into interaction with
EDL	00:12:55,083	00:12:56,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the electronic circuits so you can have
EDL	00:12:56,833	00:13:00,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that same kind of ease of operation up
EDL	00:13:00,041	00:13:01,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	at the higher frequencies right now you
EDL	00:13:01,958	00:13:04,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	have to try to mimic(效仿) that magnetic(磁)
EDL	00:13:04,708	00:13:06,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	physics with electronic components and
EDL	00:13:06,583	00:13:08,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	there's really nothing that does quite
EDL	00:13:08,750	00:13:12,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the same job right and for those
EDL	00:13:12,000	00:13:14,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	engineer types
EDL	00:13:14,000	00:13:15,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	out there who are listening I think the
EDL	00:13:15,541	00:13:17,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	component you were referring to just now
EDL	00:13:17,083	00:13:18,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is that known as a circulator (环形器)
EDL	00:13:18,666	00:13:22,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Wow Ivan that's great yes it is yes I
EDL	00:13:22,166	00:13:23,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	just impressed you Dev, and just you
EDL	00:13:23,791	00:13:25,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	mentioned three components we're not
EDL	00:13:25,000	00:13:26,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	going to talk about them but I'm just
EDL	00:13:26,208	00:13:27,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	now intrigued(引起..好奇心) by what they are so
EDL	00:13:27,666	00:13:28,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	circulator is one of them and what are
EDL	00:13:28,958	00:13:31,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the other two well in the program we're
EDL	00:13:31,791	00:13:34,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	looking at frequency selective limiter
EDL	00:13:34,208	00:13:38,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	which can through the natural physical
EDL	00:13:38,041	00:13:41,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	process cancel out interfering signals
EDL	00:13:41,791	00:13:43,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	whether they're intentional or not and
EDL	00:13:43,416	00:13:47,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	also at integrated inductors which have
EDL	00:13:47,541	00:13:49,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	been kind of a holy grail(圣杯) for millimeter
EDL	00:13:49,708	00:13:51,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	wave circuits for a long time and just
EDL	00:13:51,958	00:13:54,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	give me one reason why they're they've
EDL	00:13:54,708	00:13:57,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	been so coveted(梦寐以求的) well right now since you
EDL	00:13:57,458	00:13:59,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	don't have access to magnetic materials
EDL	00:13:59,583	00:14:02,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	on chip the inductors(电感) tend to take up a
EDL	00:14:02,458	00:14:04,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	substantial(可观的) percentage of the circuit
EDL	00:14:04,625	00:14:06,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	board space if you have a magnetic
EDL	00:14:06,875	00:14:08,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	material you can shrink(缩) those down
EDL	00:14:08,458	00:14:10,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	substantially(可观地) make the whole chip
EDL	00:14:10,375	00:14:12,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	smaller that means it works better and
EDL	00:14:12,458	00:14:14,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	It's also cheaper but can you say in a
EDL	00:14:14,458	00:14:16,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	sentence or two what function the
EDL	00:14:16,041	00:14:19,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	inductor typically has the inductor
EDL	00:14:19,458	00:14:22,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	smooths out high frequency signals it
EDL	00:14:22,750	00:14:24,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	tends to pass lower frequency signals
EDL	00:14:24,916	00:14:28,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and stops higher frequency signals so at
EDL	00:14:28,500	00:14:30,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	very low frequencies they're used to
EDL	00:14:30,250	00:14:32,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	filter power supplies make those quiet
EDL	00:14:32,333	00:14:34,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	power supplies at higher frequencies
EDL	00:14:34,708	00:14:36,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	they're used as part of filter circuits
EDL	00:14:36,916	00:14:38,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	to select out the frequencies you want
EDL	00:14:38,750	00:14:39,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and the frequencies you don't want.
EDL	00:14:40,500	00:14:42,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Ivan: so thanks you know for talking about all of
EDL	00:14:42,208	00:14:44,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	those programs there are others that you
EDL	00:14:44,583	00:14:47,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	are also overseeing but we're not going
EDL	00:14:47,500	00:14:49,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	to talk about all of them now but what I
EDL	00:14:49,958	00:14:51,416	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	would like to talk about is these
EDL	00:14:51,416	00:14:53,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	programs and you as a program manager in
EDL	00:14:53,958	00:14:56,333	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	a place like DARPA and what I'm getting
EDL	00:14:56,333	00:14:58,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	at here is you know DARPA is just part
EDL	00:14:58,958	00:15:01,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	of the overall innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:15:01,666	00:15:04,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you've been here since 2012 you you've
EDL	00:15:04,000	00:15:05,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	got these programs we've talked about so
EDL	00:15:05,791	00:15:07,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you know what is it like to be here and
EDL	00:15:07,750	00:15:11,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and how do you think DARPA is unique in
EDL	00:15:11,500	00:15:16,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the innovation ecosystem coming to DARPA
EDL	00:15:16,958	00:15:18,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is like grabbing the nose cone(鼻锥) of a
EDL	00:15:18,875	00:15:22,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	rocket and holding on for dear life it's
EDL	00:15:22,000	00:15:24,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	a fast moving place that has a
EDL	00:15:24,541	00:15:27,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	significant impact on the trajectory(轨迹) of
EDL	00:15:27,291	00:15:29,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	technology for the nation and being part
EDL	00:15:29,708	00:15:31,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	of that is an incredible thrill(兴奋, 名词)
EDL	00:15:32,208	00:15:34,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	the idea that you can
EDL	00:15:34,666	00:15:37,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	come up with a technical idea that's interesting to you
EDL	00:15:38,458	00:15:41,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	and create a community to pursue that ideas
EDL	00:15:41,625	00:15:44,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is an experience you won't get anywhere else
EDL	00:15:45,333	00:15:46,958	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you can take flyer bets on crazy
EDL	00:15:46,958	00:15:48,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	things like integrating magnetics with
EDL	00:15:48,666	00:15:51,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	semiconductors and people will actually
EDL	00:15:51,458	00:15:52,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	soldier up (挺身而出) and tell you how they're
EDL	00:15:52,833	00:15:55,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	gonna do it right so what you just said
EDL	00:15:55,083	00:15:56,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	about creating communities is just
EDL	00:15:56,500	00:15:58,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	something that that you know I guess
EDL	00:15:58,583	00:16:00,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	I've observed here too and in the short
EDL	00:16:00,041	00:16:02,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	time I've been here and I think maybe
EDL	00:16:02,166	00:16:03,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	perhaps one of the most valuable things
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that happens here at DARPA which is is
EDL	00:16:05,666	00:16:08,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	is that you the program managers do
EDL	00:16:08,208	00:16:11,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	bring together handfuls of research
EDL	00:16:11,166	00:16:13,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	groups that otherwise probably would not
EDL	00:16:13,125	00:16:15,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	have gotten together but in getting
EDL	00:16:15,083	00:16:17,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	together now create and bring bring
EDL	00:16:17,625	00:16:19,750	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	together mindsets skill sets tool sets
EDL	00:16:19,750	00:16:22,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	ways of doing ways of thinking that are
EDL	00:16:22,375	00:16:24,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	unique and and therefore can push into
EDL	00:16:24,250	00:16:27,125	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	new technological territory did I
EDL	00:16:27,125	00:16:29,041	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	overstate(夸大) things or is that about kind
EDL	00:16:29,041	00:16:30,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	of right no that's about right it's very
EDL	00:16:30,916	00:16:33,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	exciting can you name one science
EDL	00:16:33,375	00:16:35,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	fiction technology that you just wish
EDL	00:16:35,625	00:16:39,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	could become real well Ivan since I
EDL	00:16:39,500	00:16:41,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	commute weekly between DARPA and my home
EDL	00:16:41,500	00:16:43,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	in North Carolina that would be
EDL	00:16:43,458	00:16:46,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	teleportation(瞬间移动) of course but I don't
EDL	00:16:46,166	00:16:47,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	think we'll ever get there we don't have
EDL	00:16:47,583	00:16:49,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	any wireless communication technology
EDL	00:16:49,708	00:16:51,250	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that can transfer the amount of
EDL	00:16:51,250	00:16:53,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	information it would take to completely
EDL	00:16:53,208	00:16:56,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	disassemble and reconstruct a human in
EDL	00:16:56,000	00:16:58,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	any reasonable amount of time
EDL	00:16:58,083	00:17:00,625	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	imagine having to encode the information
EDL	00:17:00,625	00:17:02,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	that's in every strand of DNA and every
EDL	00:17:02,875	00:17:03,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	cell of your body
EDL	00:17:03,875	00:17:07,000	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	every memory you've ever had every scene
EDL	00:17:07,000	00:17:10,541	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you've ever seen take that apart turn it
EDL	00:17:10,541	00:17:12,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	into bits send it somewhere and then
EDL	00:17:12,875	00:17:15,500	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	rebuild it in the physical world driving
EDL	00:17:15,500	00:17:19,083	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	might be faster well I do hope that
EDL	00:17:19,083	00:17:21,375	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	teleportation does become a reality at
EDL	00:17:21,375	00:17:22,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	some point in the future it's a very
EDL	00:17:22,833	00:17:24,916	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	lease to make you're commuting and
EDL	00:17:24,916	00:17:26,458	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	traveling around a little bit easier
EDL	00:17:26,458	00:17:28,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	I've really enjoyed the entire
EDL	00:17:28,666	00:17:30,708	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	conversation Dev, I just want to thank
EDL	00:17:30,708	00:17:32,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	you for coming into the studio Thank You
EDL	00:17:32,791	00:17:34,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	Ivan it's been a real pleasure and
