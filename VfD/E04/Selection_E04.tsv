* 1THz = ?

EDL	00:03:34,875	00:03:38,208	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	tell us what 1 terahertz is in
EDL	00:03:38,208	00:03:43,791	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	comparison to that 1 terahertz is 10 to the 12th (10的12次方)  vibrations per second which is
EDL	00:03:43,791	00:03:47,666	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	1 comma zero zero zero comma zero zero
EDL	00:03:47,666	00:03:50,166	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	zero comma zero zero zero comma zero
EDL	00:03:50,166	00:03:53,875	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	zero zero cycles per second that's one
EDL	00:03:53,875	00:03:56,291	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	trillion that's correct one trillion
EDL	00:03:56,291	00:03:58,583	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	cycles per second so that's very hard to
EDL	00:03:58,583	00:04:00,833	| VfD E04 The Terahertzian |	achieve in an electronic circuit right
