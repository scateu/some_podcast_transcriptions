EDL	00:00:11,790	00:00:17,740	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Still, technology, the internet GPS in the palm of your hand, are tonight with operation. 
EDL	00:00:19,130	00:00:26,240	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight, the midst of the cold war, doubt that offends
EDL	00:00:26,240	00:00:30,230	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Advance research projects has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:30,650	00:00:33,050	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Welcome to Voices from darker
EDL	00:00:33,050	00:00:39,800	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A window went to dark as core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:40,540	00:00:42,990	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	My name is iphone a motto, and I'm your dark host
EDL	00:00:43,320	00:00:51,950	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio for rebel, for rule, a program manager since twenty four, team in dollars, defence office
EDL	00:00:51,950	00:01:24,096	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Throughout her career, fruit has been working on mathematical innovations and applying them in areas ranging from spacecraft control, vibration control and structures, and even to the vaccine problem of quantifying uncertainty in the mathematical models that scientists use to study complex phenomenon like weather and biological process, and the engineers used to design, simulate, manufacturer and upgrade many of the complex technologies important in military and civilian and settings
EDL	00:01:24,096	00:01:27,850	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Thanks for your first spending some time with me today and. 
EDL	00:01:28,730	00:01:29,130	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Thank you
EDL	00:01:29,130	00:01:30,640	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Ivan, good to be here. 
EDL	00:01:31,500	00:01:36,870	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I'd love to start out freedom and learning a little bit about you about your background, education
EDL	00:01:36,870	00:01:44,100	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Some of the important thing that happened throughout your area, that ultimately let you hear to dark
EDL	00:01:44,100	00:01:45,140	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So tell us a little bit. 
EDL	00:01:46,080	00:02:00,060	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well, let me tell you a little bit about my background, and till you that the july my relationship, mathematics has been a developing one, and I have to say that over the years, it has really tipped
EDL	00:02:00,060	00:02:09,270	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I was born and raised in iraq, which has a long tradition of excellent, rigorous mathematical and technical education
EDL	00:02:09,270	00:02:15,040	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I received my bachelor degrees boarding, applied math and physics from user birthday
EDL	00:02:15,040	00:02:21,810	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	From then I went the beautiful campus of the university of his concern medicine
EDL	00:02:22,230	00:02:31,070	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And then I went to brown to get my psd in applied mathematics after getting my PSD, Icame back to uh
EDL	00:02:31,560	00:02:39,060	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Neighborhood is called the california to naval postgraduate monitoring, and spent several years as a professor in the department of
EDL	00:02:39,660	00:02:46,970	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And while I was there, I was contacted by a colleague of mine was working in a very similar research
EDL	00:02:46,970	00:03:17,240	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	She suggested whether I would consider getting a job as a program manager for computer israel mathematics that efforts of the scientific research is, for example, it is all intense, makes you feel basic on the same block as I was not even sure what that is, but having my colleague and friend in a position and watching her what she was able to to achieve was actually an inspiration
EDL	00:03:17,240	00:03:19,100	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And that's when I said, yes. 
EDL	00:03:19,100	00:03:21,530	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And how then was did you make a direct connection
EDL	00:03:21,530	00:03:24,410	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	He was dark, I suppose to be APMelsewhere. 
EDL	00:03:24,410	00:03:32,370	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The interesting thing was that about maybe couple years into my job with some program managers from top approach me
EDL	00:03:32,370	00:03:50,900	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And they said, I interested in going in, coming to dark, and and I have to say, if I thought of getting a position there for a server, scary and kind of out of character, I thought the current job would be the scariest thing to do
EDL	00:03:51,420	00:03:56,360	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I had become familiar with the research that being supported by dark and dark mission
EDL	00:03:56,970	00:04:09,870	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And oh, I was having a hard time to see how supporting basic research and mathematics could be of any relevance to what darker was doing and making that a connection. 
EDL	00:04:09,870	00:04:18,120	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You certainly have done that with programs which we will talk about it and a little while you really have a discover that it really is a connection between you
EDL	00:04:18,120	00:04:29,200	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And the programs are adopted before we actually talk about those I wanted to pull back a little bit and find out how you and mathematics became like foreign partners
EDL	00:04:29,200	00:04:38,483	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I ask you this, because I can see true for me, I'm sure many listeners that your mathematics just want those bills that from so many of us is, is difficult
EDL	00:04:38,483	00:04:42,409	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We, we kind of push it away that the earliest time that we can
EDL	00:04:42,409	00:04:45,411	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And yet you really had this partnership threat
EDL	00:04:45,411	00:04:46,797	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	How did you develop this
EDL	00:04:46,797	00:04:50,030	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What I imagine as a kind of love for this discipline. 
EDL	00:04:50,560	00:05:04,359	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Some are interested in mathematics, so was not actually from the point of view of being interested in abstract, or just because this, this was the way my mind worked
EDL	00:05:04,359	00:05:15,080	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I was always interested in problems solving, but it was also interested in gaining better understanding into the physical the world
EDL	00:05:15,810	00:05:29,960	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	so I didn't want to become an engineer, even though at the time, seemed like all the smart kids who, with strong mathematical villages would like to go to engineering, or they would go to mathematical 口。
EDL	00:05:30,900	00:05:36,660	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But then I decided to know I wanted to try to become more of a scientist of thinking of physics
EDL	00:05:36,660	00:05:54,080	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The only thing is that I started as a physics undergrad, but it only took me taking a semester long course in their scientific realized, I don't have a lot of talent that I realized initially come with a lot of pleasure and enjoy spending my time
EDL	00:05:54,620	00:06:15,270	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So then I decided that actually, what really gives me a lot of pleasure and steady heart is what is actually the more medical aspect of the physics courses, and I found out that, oh, I can, I do very quickly become a double major in polite mathematics, a language physics
EDL	00:06:15,270	00:06:16,990	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So that's how it started. 
EDL	00:06:16,990	00:06:20,307	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So I wouldn't interest me about applied math
EDL	00:06:20,307	00:06:33,798	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is that in that way of engaging mathematics, you are looking at these symbols, working with these symbols that made many of us associated with math, and you are finding out how they related to the real world in pretty dramatic ways
EDL	00:06:33,798	00:06:41,090	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One way of making this concrete in this conversation might be for you to tell us about how old you applied
EDL	00:06:41,090	00:06:47,530	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A kind of mathematics is a kind of an innovation for which you now have some mathematical energy named after you
EDL	00:06:47,940	00:06:55,670	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And how is that lead to operational changes with respect to the international space station
EDL	00:06:55,670	00:07:01,110	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So can you tell us that story about the new that math to space station connection? 
EDL	00:07:02,150	00:07:13,125	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So the research that are doing during my patient afterwards, have to do with control and optimization of natural systems that. 
EDL	00:07:13,125	00:07:17,310	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Model by a person offensively quiz, I bought the natural system. 
EDL	00:07:18,460	00:07:33,263	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A sound waves, for example, control of electric magnetic waves structures or any combination of interaction of these are different physical phenomenon
EDL	00:07:33,263	00:07:39,517	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So in the case of, for example of spacecraft control is that we are looking at the situation
EDL	00:07:39,517	00:07:43,020	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Where are you looking at complex known near dynamics
EDL	00:07:43,820	00:07:45,100	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We're in this case. 
EDL	00:07:46,190	00:07:49,180	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So that means little changes can lead to big results
EDL	00:07:49,180	00:07:49,820	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	possibly. 
EDL	00:07:49,820	00:07:56,060	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Even even though the senior engineer system, right, this is not necessarily like climate that you would say, well, be necessary
EDL	00:07:56,060	00:07:58,270	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Don't have any control over the initiative
EDL	00:07:58,270	00:08:07,490	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Random is of the situation we talking about the engineering system that we would like to perform certain manufacturers in an optimal fashion
EDL	00:08:07,790	00:08:11,740	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you are expecting your system in the skype
EDL	00:08:11,740	00:08:18,050	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	He needs to perform certain manufacturers that would lead to minimize a certain objectives
EDL	00:08:18,050	00:08:19,850	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So in this case, you are trying to do it
EDL	00:08:20,390	00:08:29,475	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Sometimes it means you trying to do it with minimum energy, your minimum feelings of parents, you are depending. 
EDL	00:08:29,475	00:08:39,530	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But so listeners can can understand why that's something to go for is prepared on a spacecraft can cost ten thousand dollars a pound pound
EDL	00:08:39,530	00:08:40,850	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you can minimize. 
EDL	00:08:40,850	00:08:54,300	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And give that with the analysis, of course, but also cost of, like, in the case of the necessary station, the cost of refueling, it could be a millions of enough that the situation
EDL	00:08:54,300	00:08:57,900	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you really have to use everything in the most cost efficient
EDL	00:08:58,580	00:09:00,913	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I love to OPPO manner
EDL	00:09:00,913	00:09:08,223	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So in this case, for me, I should have to say that the whole success story here, I owe you
EDL	00:09:08,223	00:09:20,260	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Basically, my colleagues were able to basically get the theory and the guidance that we developed and basically work really hard to to employment and. 
EDL	00:09:20,570	00:09:22,490	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Space station, right
EDL	00:09:22,490	00:09:46,600	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And if we would just say simply what the result was, if my reading is correct is that you were able to come up with a way of using certain systems like giraffe scopes on the space station to achieve very dramatic changes like united returns hungry, native relocations without the use of propeller released, minimizing to a great degree, the need for. 
EDL	00:09:46,600	00:09:47,590	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Right exactly
EDL	00:09:48,090	00:09:59,610	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And if this would not have happened, had been not come up with up an efficient and accurate way of implementing this arm. 
EDL	00:10:00,000	00:10:12,761	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Right and, but, but the actual controls that went to those gallery scopes emerge from the mathematical framework that you are able to develop into this sort of drugs, that line all the way from this most abstract way of thinking is mathematics
EDL	00:10:12,761	00:10:13,350	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	All the way
EDL	00:10:13,350	00:10:18,782	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Million dollar, multimillion dollars savings of how you operate the international space station
EDL	00:10:18,782	00:10:23,590	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Let me assert a one of the miracles of math in this connection to the real world
EDL	00:10:23,590	00:10:32,360	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So excellence, lets say the way to you in the upper and two programs that you are working on here
EDL	00:10:32,810	00:10:42,707	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So one of them goes by the equipment here that stands for enabling quantification of uncertainty in physical systems
EDL	00:10:42,707	00:10:49,330	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And the other one goes by the acronym model that stems models, dynamics and learning
EDL	00:10:49,330	00:10:56,800	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So let's start with equips, and again, that stands for enabling quantification of uncertainty in physical systems
EDL	00:10:56,800	00:10:58,330	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	This sounds fascinating
EDL	00:10:58,330	00:11:08,520	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The idea of quantifying a uncertainty tells about the program what the goals are and what the sadness is not the money. 
EDL	00:11:09,660	00:11:18,420	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The goals of the program, after saying a sort of lofty fashion, which is not always my normal state of. 
EDL	00:11:18,420	00:11:19,640	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We have a statement
EDL	00:11:19,640	00:11:22,400	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We were just talking about the international space station, and that's pretty well. 
EDL	00:11:23,410	00:11:41,610	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yes, but I do have to say that I had very lofty goals for the program, and the way in my mind I was thinking of the program, and I still do it is to translate, change the way we go through our modeling and simulation
EDL	00:11:42,610	00:12:03,218	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Oh, what you are saying, physical world engineering system, we do have a long history, basically, almost all of scientific history of of modelling, physical systems and physical phenomenon, and using mathematics
EDL	00:12:03,218	00:12:33,610	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And but what I am saying about changing the practice of modeling is, in some ways, taking into account how good or how bad we are as models as some was like bringing such certain level of honesty to our modelling innocence said, we have to consider the fact that it doesn't matter how good we think our models are at the end are just going to be an approximation
EDL	00:12:34,130	00:12:37,520	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It just going to be sarah guide for the physical reality
EDL	00:12:38,660	00:12:59,445	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The fact that in in the process, sometimes we are not quite clear about the, let's say, the description of which we are, what the output of our models are and what the physical world is, the it's going to create a lot of issues when we try to analyze the system as far as physical modeling goes
EDL	00:12:59,445	00:13:07,780	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Probably one of the most successful stories is basically the navy soak secretion. 
EDL	00:13:07,780	00:13:18,380	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you might apply the number of stock succession, for example, if you want to try to describe how the queen, you point to your coffee goes into that fluid
EDL	00:13:18,380	00:13:30,275	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And you see the beautiful swords, or it might be the way masses of air in the atmosphere are flowing and intermediately unsufferable that the range they were talking. 
EDL	00:13:30,275	00:13:45,106	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yes, exactly, yeah, so error, you know, basically flow a barrel where, you know, the airplane rings are is basically the fundamental love every space in china at the celebrity decreasing
EDL	00:13:45,106	00:14:05,600	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But the problem with it is that you, then you talk to those people who are looking at basically physical flows, fluid flows, and they do still scratch their head, and it still could say that we are talking in certain situation looks like in hypersonic, but it is not at all clear that this is the question
EDL	00:14:05,600	00:14:08,010	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Even how would you be talking about
EDL	00:14:08,010	00:14:19,670	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You were still talking about fluids, but it's at the scale, and so the physical condition that is not at all clear that this is the right equation to even try to simulate
EDL	00:14:20,060	00:14:22,210	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yes, we do have airplanes that fly
EDL	00:14:22,210	00:14:23,920	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We do have any air space
EDL	00:14:23,920	00:14:30,420	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The industry has been one of our more successful modern industry is not just twenty century
EDL	00:14:30,420	00:14:39,940	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It will be even more in twenty years in the future century, but it makes a little worried that some of the work and mathematical work that is being done
EDL	00:14:40,260	00:14:46,600	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's based on certain assumptions that are and physical models that may actually not hold. 
EDL	00:14:46,600	00:14:53,798	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Crack me from wrong, but as you speaking, I'm realizing, well, we have these technology wish lists
EDL	00:14:53,798	00:15:02,653	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We want high personnel vehicles and hypersonic technology things that celebrating festival speed of sound
EDL	00:15:02,653	00:15:13,490	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Were you thinks we've got mathematical equations and traditions, and mathematically roughly in the economic phenomenon that are applicable in designing a hypersonic vehicle
EDL	00:15:13,490	00:15:15,145	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But we actually don't know
EDL	00:15:15,145	00:15:18,870	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We don't know if it's an accurate representation of of that. 
EDL	00:15:18,870	00:15:27,500	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In a supersonic arena, this need for qualifying are answering to a lack of knowledge and all
EDL	00:15:27,500	00:15:32,627	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So the kind of error and description set up between the mathematical models and physical reality
EDL	00:15:32,627	00:15:51,556	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And our engineering system comes from engineers themselves, because one of the things is that they are looking right now in situations that the only way they can, that is a certify that is a design, or whatever they build is by using something right
EDL	00:15:51,556	00:16:15,580	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And in this case, they'd probably try to do it using well, in certain situation, you can test, and maybe you can, if you do taste some any kind of testing, maybe you can do it, maybe certain components of it, but full testing on the system for examples and play when I certainly have to be done on the entire one is, after you already built
EDL	00:16:16,890	00:16:23,890	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That's a little too late in order to come up with ways of changing the design or changing the way it's being built, right
EDL	00:16:23,890	00:16:31,660	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So it would like to be involved in that process as a mathematician and as an engineer little earlier into that
EDL	00:16:32,050	00:16:39,350	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So the only way to do that, the testing is not going to help festival in certain situation is that it may be too expensive
EDL	00:16:39,350	00:16:43,130	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's too late and sometimes impossible to
EDL	00:16:43,620	00:16:44,877	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's using simulation
EDL	00:16:44,877	00:16:59,400	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The whole thing of a simulation is based on having a mathematical model and having the simulation tools, like basically the numerical methods and all that, and the computational tools platform
EDL	00:16:59,400	00:17:04,200	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So the computers that you can actually do this simulation
EDL	00:17:04,200	00:17:10,610	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So this is when you see that maths comes in right there, and this is the only way that we can test
EDL	00:17:10,610	00:17:11,756	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Doubt these
EDL	00:17:11,756	00:17:25,630	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	These new designs are new that are not a bit, but you have basically the elements of the design so you can at least tested out using the simulation before before you build. 
EDL	00:17:26,840	00:17:33,070	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So I think I heard you once talk about this is almost like a mathematics of honesty
EDL	00:17:33,070	00:18:01,130	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yeah, meaning it is which you and I love the phrase now that you talking about this word of simulation, which is based on mathematics and improves mathematical models operating in the form of computer models of the, but in there, in that kind of abstracted place and abstract, the operation, you're trying to develop a framework with the creeps that is kind of the reality in the man
EDL	00:18:01,130	00:18:01,940	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	exactly
EDL	00:18:01,940	00:18:11,190	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And how well is this representing, ultimately, the real world technology that we want to emerge out of this mathematics and model? 
EDL	00:18:12,050	00:18:15,510	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That yes, that's a very nice accusation
EDL	00:18:15,510	00:18:28,910	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And what is so fascinating about this is that the fields goes very quickly from some may in the beginning, we think some philosophical ha, a rumination about what is reality
EDL	00:18:28,910	00:18:30,710	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What is representation of reality
EDL	00:18:30,710	00:18:57,150	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What is the relationship of mathematics of physical world, very quickly, two, some beautiful theory, the interesting result that I expect from equips is to see whether it's possible to come up with some common frameworks and common rules that could deal with some of the major challenges within looking at very different application problems
EDL	00:18:57,150	00:19:15,697	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	This is, this is going to be an interesting approaches to to observe and see what results come out of it, because the performance at this point are looking at system as different as possible from each other, from airspace structures to integrated circuits and to chemical networks
EDL	00:19:15,697	00:19:18,830	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So we'll see whether something a common love. 
EDL	00:19:19,170	00:19:25,800	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Come out of the africa, but so maybe that's a nice queue to talk a little bit about model, the models dynamic. 
EDL	00:19:25,800	00:19:37,130	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Program, so there is actually a very nice link between the programming creeps and model one issue that I need to emphasize about equips
EDL	00:19:37,130	00:19:50,062	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Because right now, a funny talked about it, basically, as you mention, it's about trying to capture or make honesty as part of a modeling process
EDL	00:19:50,062	00:19:56,227	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But I haven't really told you about the challenges that we have enough in our process
EDL	00:19:56,227	00:20:03,110	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And one of the biggest challenges is that the complex for all that we are looking at the complex system we are looking at. 
EDL	00:20:03,460	00:20:06,800	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	They are high dimensional when you say high dimension
EDL	00:20:07,580	00:20:10,710	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What do you mean by the sounds like as many parts we have to think about. 
EDL	00:20:10,710	00:20:22,280	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Right, uh exactly so, so, so a lot of times when we think of dimension, and you've heard that you're thinking about that, there are three physical, and then we have a dimension of time
EDL	00:20:22,280	00:20:41,260	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So we think our physical world is basically like a four dimensional space time, but the way we are using dimension basically, here is what we think exactly, the degree of freedom are basically the number of vegetables that we need in order to build on model
EDL	00:20:41,260	00:20:42,250	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What repent. 
EDL	00:20:42,680	00:20:50,210	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Moreover, the robot with ten jones is that the world, I could think that very simply is a ten dimensional problem. 
EDL	00:20:50,210	00:20:50,910	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	exactly
EDL	00:20:50,910	00:20:51,330	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	so. 
EDL	00:20:52,230	00:20:53,740	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But it could be a thousand. 
EDL	00:20:53,740	00:20:55,000	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It could be very cleared out
EDL	00:20:55,000	00:20:56,060	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yeah, exactly
EDL	00:20:56,060	00:21:32,379	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And the interesting part is that you look at the robot, and you look at the, okay, when I wanna write down, basically, when I am thinking about the, the number of variables or modes, whatever that I can express the physical variable that I'm interested, but at the same time, sometimes when I want to do any kind of approximation, right of each of these ten variables or ten dimension for each dimension, I am actually need additional dimensions in order to move approximately
EDL	00:21:32,379	00:21:37,295	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So this is like at every step of a modeling here and an approximation
EDL	00:21:37,295	00:21:39,998	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We are introducing more dimensions here
EDL	00:21:39,998	00:21:49,305	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So starting a tendering attendant what we say, interventional system, and they've been, for example, for each dimension, I made another ten. 
EDL	00:21:49,305	00:21:52,365	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well, just it just a simple way of saying, hell
EDL	00:21:52,365	00:22:03,750	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Ten dimensions most applies in a robot case that each joint itself has has the three special dimensions and the temperatures of each one has four, so suddenly already. 
EDL	00:22:03,750	00:22:19,946	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So sometimes there those dimensions have to do with the physical had relate to the physical representation, but somebody's sometimes dimension comes from a approximation and modeling and mathematical work that we need to do
EDL	00:22:19,946	00:22:20,180	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	so
EDL	00:22:20,180	00:22:22,516	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's, it's an extremely good question
EDL	00:22:22,516	00:22:41,830	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I slept what when we talk about high dimensionality, what you are saying, and this is what happens with the systems that we are looking at that representation of these physical systems require lots of dimensions, lots of vegetables, lots. 
EDL	00:22:42,130	00:22:50,140	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Hi, dimension and and higher the dimensionality, the harder, the harder it is to compute to put into a computer next round simulation. 
EDL	00:22:50,140	00:23:01,760	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It goes back to how much computing can we do, and people say, well, right now, we do have extremely good, extremely fast and computing platforms
EDL	00:23:02,070	00:23:03,100	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And that is true
EDL	00:23:03,100	00:23:19,160	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And that's why, at this point, we can do computing physical system that twenty years ago was not possible, but the more you do, the higher demand of your analysis tools now about model
EDL	00:23:19,160	00:23:26,280	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Uh, the model is a sort of an acronym for models, dynamics and learning
EDL	00:23:27,150	00:23:36,140	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I would say that the goal of the program is extracting mathematical models from dynamic data sets. 
EDL	00:23:36,790	00:23:45,690	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The goal of a program I was so what you stopped when you say, dynamic data said something, a lot of data dynamics makes me think of motion or time that I get
EDL	00:23:45,690	00:23:46,765	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That writer, would you want to? 
EDL	00:23:46,765	00:23:58,629	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Absolutely what I mean by dynamic data set is a data set that you get from dynamical system, which our system, whose behavior changes respect the time for you for your dynamic system player
EDL	00:23:58,629	00:24:04,980	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Absolutely, I mean it life is dynamic, is a great example of a dynamical system
EDL	00:24:04,980	00:24:07,670	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One of the reasons that I wanted to have
EDL	00:24:07,670	00:24:23,570	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	This program was also against saying that existing tools that behalf of modeling cannot handle us on the complex dynamical systems that we need to analyze
EDL	00:24:23,570	00:25:03,694	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We are looking again, very similar, but we're looking, for example, the system, such as whether, you know, if you biological systems, even in general system, like communication networks, or, you know, human social networks, these are all the examples of dynamical systems, but we don't have very good analytical and mathematical models to to express the complex behavior of the systems that if you just look at the data set from something like turbulent floor, it's fascinating because you see these
EDL	00:25:03,694	00:25:09,405	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	These borders sees this horse, this, it is a beautiful pattern. 
EDL	00:25:09,405	00:25:12,858	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Learning this is applicable in reverse, but it is also applicable
EDL	00:25:12,858	00:25:14,010	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And gentleman, exactly. 
EDL	00:25:14,010	00:25:24,370	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Exactly, that was so beautiful about these are all these different conflicts phenomena that can be expressed, that when you see it, some communality in there
EDL	00:25:24,370	00:25:37,682	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And in this case, what we trying to learn is that what are the common patterns that can be learned and basically expressed dynamics of these systems in terms of evolution of these patterns
EDL	00:25:37,682	00:25:39,045	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yeah, I suggest them
EDL	00:25:39,045	00:25:43,730	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We don't have the mathematical tools yet to deal with the data
EDL	00:25:43,730	00:25:45,980	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So people say, why, you know, look at us
EDL	00:25:45,980	00:25:55,350	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We not only be a data, big data, we also the age of lake on machine learning and all these different ways that we can handle date of any size
EDL	00:25:56,740	00:26:05,500	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But what I'm saying is that the existing techniques cannot handle the fact that data is dynamic and changes, which is expected time
EDL	00:26:07,220	00:26:20,910	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I actually not going back and say, look, go back to the beginning of the dynamical system theory and trying to develop different way of modeling, extracting these models from dynamic
EDL	00:26:20,910	00:26:21,430	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It said. 
EDL	00:26:21,870	00:26:27,090	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Give me one example of a phenomenon of a system of technology that cannot really be model
EDL	00:26:27,090	00:26:32,650	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well, now that if your model program is successful, will be modeled. 
EDL	00:26:34,750	00:26:42,900	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A vast performance motorcycle to start with something that we think we have some grasps both and use the basic as a task case
EDL	00:26:42,900	00:26:47,030	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I'm going back again to the classical problem of a basic, turbulent flow
EDL	00:26:47,030	00:27:02,570	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	My hope is that they can apply the meteorologist mathematical methods that they develop two systems that are much, and the assistance, for example, is the data
EDL	00:27:02,570	00:27:04,160	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Did you get, for example, from? 
EDL	00:27:04,550	00:27:06,090	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Never science
EDL	00:27:06,090	00:27:15,340	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you're talking about things like how brain signals, propaganda, or how patterns of new relativity associate with the century stimuli, or the way we move. 
EDL	00:27:15,760	00:27:30,360	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Absolutely, it could be a data that you can get even from a social networks and social systems, and basically two systems for which we really are reluctant, the proper mathematical. 
EDL	00:27:30,360	00:27:38,090	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Modelling that strategies before time result here, I just want to one question about being employed
EDL	00:27:38,090	00:27:45,120	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mathematician at a place like dark one of the phrases here, a lot here is the innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:27:45,430	00:27:56,010	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And what that means is it really is referring to come all the players and all the stakeholders that it takes another go from sort of an idea about the technology to technology that you have in hand
EDL	00:27:56,010	00:27:58,000	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That's that's operational in the field
EDL	00:27:58,000	00:28:03,620	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So as an applied mathematician, what do you think you can do here, you might not be able to do elsewhere. 
EDL	00:28:04,420	00:28:13,130	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I say, darkness, probably the best place to be if you are and applied mathematician, in fact, I just say for your mathematician
EDL	00:28:13,130	00:28:26,440	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And like to solve problems, one of the greatest thing about dark is that there is a wealth of information, wealth of problems that important
EDL	00:28:26,440	00:28:37,790	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I have to say that very, very cool, the coolness factor for problems to solve for a mathematician
EDL	00:28:37,790	00:29:11,570	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Here is enormous because you feel that not only your solving a problem that has importance, the second modern impact, as far as you know, you solving important problems and national security, but you also feel like the problems are that in some ways, there is, there is so much to contribute the richness of the problem are just as maybe the biggest driver, a motivating factor for anybody, certainly for a mathematician
EDL	00:29:11,570	00:29:47,990	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I just wanted to add that is that, and I've been saying that to my, my friends, to my colleagues, anybody who would listen that why mathematics actually very important to to an encouraging to come, future program managers is that when you are encountered by important problems, and you see that your ideas, the rule you have as a mathematician that not only you try to look at these particular problems, but you try to abstract out and coming with different representation
EDL	00:29:47,990	00:29:52,180	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That would you better solution for these problems
EDL	00:29:52,180	00:29:55,730	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you basically see that your ideas are at work
EDL	00:29:55,730	00:29:57,750	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I mean, what better satisfaction are they? 
EDL	00:29:58,060	00:30:15,150	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well, freedom, it's been a little like for me to talk to you about your love of mathematics is coming out here right now, and to get some sense of of how mathematics that is have that role in the umbrella innovation ecosystem in a particular here at the dark
EDL	00:30:15,150	00:30:17,370	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So I just want to thank you for spending this time with us. 
EDL	00:30:17,760	00:30:18,680	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Thank you ever
EDL	00:30:18,680	00:30:19,370	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's been pleasure. 
EDL	00:30:20,370	00:30:27,880	| VfD E08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with freedom, and I, Ihope you join us again for the next Voices from dark
