EDL	00:00:22,480	00:00:24,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	since its founding in 1958 in the midst
EDL	00:00:24,720	00:00:26,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	of the cold war. DARPA the Defense
EDL	00:00:26,800	00:00:28,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Advanced Research Projects Agency has
EDL	00:00:28,960	00:00:30,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	been a driver of technology.

EDL	00:00:30,960	00:00:33,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Welcome to voices from DARPA, a window
EDL	00:00:33,200	00:00:34,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	onto the history people and
EDL	00:00:34,559	00:00:38,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	accomplishments that have earned DARPA a place among the most admired
EDL	00:00:38,000	00:00:41,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	institutions and cultures of innovation.

EDL	00:00:41,200	00:00:43,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host. 
EDL	00:00:43,800	00:00:47,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	In this episode of Voices from DARPA we will hear from some of the
EDL	00:00:47,360	00:00:49,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	stakeholders in an institutional
EDL	00:00:49,520	00:00:52,239	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	five-year experiment called the embedded
EDL	00:00:52,239	00:00:56,239	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	entrepreneurship program EEI for short

EDL	00:00:56,239	00:00:58,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the vision of EEI now in its second year
EDL	00:00:58,800	00:01:01,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	is to help entrepreneurs survive the
EDL	00:01:01,039	00:01:03,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	unavoidable and harrowing(令人悲伤的) phase of
EDL	00:01:03,280	00:01:05,438	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	startup and entrepreneurial culture
EDL	00:01:05,438	00:01:08,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	often referred to as the valley of death

The Valley of Death.

EDL	00:01:08,080	00:01:11,668	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that's when anything insufficient funding, poor cost projections,

EDL	00:01:28,799	00:01:31,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	this innovative institutional concept

EDL	00:01:31,040	00:01:34,079	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	EEI began as a glimmer(微光) in people's eyes

EDL	00:01:38,479	00:01:40,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the embedded entrepreneurship initiative
EDL	00:01:40,400	00:01:42,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	is you know like anything else at DARPA
EDL	00:01:42,720	00:01:43,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it's a
EDL	00:01:43,600	00:01:48,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it's an experiment we have specific metrics that we have to hit and
EDL	00:01:48,880	00:01:54,079	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	you know every year we'll continue to measure its value, we'll continue to
EDL	00:01:54,079	00:01:59,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	iterate and learn to optimize this model for impact
EDL	00:01:59,680	00:02:02,399	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and at the end of the fifth year then
EDL	00:02:02,399	00:02:04,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	whoever the director is at that time
EDL	00:02:04,240	00:02:09,038	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we'll we'll take a look at it and see if it's really helping us achieve the DARPA
EDL	00:02:09,038	00:02:13,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	mission of creating new capabilities
EDL	00:02:13,040	00:02:19,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that are in the hands of the warfighter and national security end users

EDL	00:02:19,040	00:02:22,489	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	It's that last bit that part about getting technologies beyond 
EDL	00:02:22,489	00:02:26,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the valley of death and into the hands of war fighters and national security users
EDL	00:02:26,800	00:02:29,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that EEI is designed to make happen more
EDL	00:02:29,200	00:02:31,599	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	often than it has in the past. There are
EDL	00:02:31,599	00:02:33,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	plenty of business and technology
EDL	00:02:33,120	00:02:35,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	accelerator models out there Tech
EDL	00:02:35,280	00:02:37,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Transfer Offices at Universities try to
EDL	00:02:37,280	00:02:42,239	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	help faculty license patents or get startups going for one there are various
EDL	00:02:42,239	00:02:44,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	business boot camps that promise to turn
EDL	00:02:44,160	00:02:46,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technical teams into business wizards in
EDL	00:02:46,560	00:02:48,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	three to six week programs venture
EDL	00:02:48,720	00:02:51,519	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	capital firms bet on winners and feed
EDL	00:02:51,519	00:02:53,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	those chosen companies various levels of
EDL	00:02:53,360	00:02:56,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	funding and sometimes business expertise
EDL	00:02:56,000	00:02:59,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to help move concepts toward commercial products and services

EDL	00:02:59,840	00:03:02,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Gerst says DARPA poses unique challenges
EDL	00:03:02,480	00:03:04,700	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	when it comes to accelerating development 

** Gerst

EDL	00:03:04,700	00:03:06,879	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	in the innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:03:06,879	00:03:08,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	DARPA is
EDL	00:03:08,560	00:03:11,519	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	very early stage you know we're taking
EDL	00:03:11,519	00:03:12,959	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	things from
EDL	00:03:12,959	00:03:15,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	idea often to you know proof of
EDL	00:03:15,360	00:03:16,959	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	principle or
EDL	00:03:16,959	00:03:19,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	first prototype and really understanding
EDL	00:03:19,920	00:03:23,519	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	what performance can be gained and that
EDL	00:03:23,519	00:03:26,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	in business terms that's pre-seed stage

EDL	00:03:26,560	00:03:29,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	So it's unique in that it's very early
EDL	00:03:29,360	00:03:30,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	DARPA is
EDL	00:03:30,640	00:03:33,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	unique in that most of its portfolio
EDL	00:03:33,840	00:03:35,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	focuses on the
EDL	00:03:35,360	00:03:38,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	hard tech, deep tech space that you know
EDL	00:03:38,640	00:03:41,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	materials science, biotechnology,
EDL	00:03:41,080	00:03:43,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	microelectronics that take
EDL	00:03:43,200	00:03:45,527	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	a long time to mature. 

** other accelerators were designed for software

EDL	00:03:45,527	00:03:51,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	A lot of the original business accelerators were designed for software
EDL	00:03:51,280	00:03:56,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and not hardware and definitely not material science.

EDL	00:03:56,400	00:03:58,879	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and and then the last reason why it's
EDL	00:03:58,879	00:04:01,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	unique is that it's very
EDL	00:04:01,840	00:04:04,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	high risk but potentially high impact
EDL	00:04:04,560	00:04:05,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and so
EDL	00:04:05,840	00:04:08,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the result of that you know in my world
EDL	00:04:08,640	00:04:10,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	is that you don't see
EDL	00:04:10,560	00:04:13,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	many straightforward business models
EDL	00:04:13,120	00:04:15,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	where DARPA has you know developed a
EDL	00:04:15,040	00:04:16,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technology that's just slightly
EDL	00:04:16,880	00:04:18,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	incrementally better from what's out
EDL	00:04:18,639	00:04:21,839	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	there today and it it nicely fits within
EDL	00:04:21,839	00:04:23,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to the existing system
EDL	00:04:23,919	00:04:25,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	you know the existing market system and
EDL	00:04:25,919	00:04:29,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the existing supply chain often DARPA is
EDL	00:04:29,680	00:04:32,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	going after things that have off the
EDL	00:04:32,080	00:04:34,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	charts performance that have the
EDL	00:04:34,960	00:04:37,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	potential to to really upend the
EDL	00:04:37,120	00:04:39,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	existing market structure
EDL	00:04:39,520	00:04:41,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that require new thinking around
EDL	00:04:41,840	00:04:44,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	business models and partnerships
EDL	00:04:44,240	00:04:47,199	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	sometimes DARPA develops some really
EDL	00:04:47,199	00:04:49,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	unique things where we're thinking oh
EDL	00:04:49,280	00:04:51,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	this could create an entirely new space
EDL	00:04:51,919	00:04:54,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	a new industry and that needs to be from
EDL	00:04:54,800	00:04:57,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	a commercialization standpoint supported
EDL	00:04:57,280	00:04:59,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	in an entirely different way and so
EDL	00:04:59,840	00:05:03,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we designed this program to uniquely fit
EDL	00:05:03,440	00:05:06,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the DARPA model EEI came out of the
EDL	00:05:06,160	00:05:08,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	gates in a mad sprint
EDL	00:05:08,000	00:05:10,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	following a pilot stage the initiative
EDL	00:05:10,240	00:05:12,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	began ramping up to full-scale status in
EDL	00:05:12,560	00:05:15,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	october 2020 in what is initially
EDL	00:05:15,039	00:05:16,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	planned as a five-year institutional
EDL	00:05:16,639	00:05:19,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	experiment already EEI is engaged with
EDL	00:05:19,520	00:05:22,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	more than 50 research teams each one
EDL	00:05:22,240	00:05:25,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	with big big plans we have
EDL	00:05:25,360	00:05:29,199	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	54 research teams some of them are still
EDL	00:05:29,199	00:05:30,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	thinking about if they should become a
EDL	00:05:30,800	00:05:32,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	company
EDL	00:05:32,560	00:05:34,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	some of them are in a corporate research
EDL	00:05:34,880	00:05:36,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	lab and they're you know investigating
EDL	00:05:36,720	00:05:38,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the hypothesis that there's a compelling
EDL	00:05:38,639	00:05:40,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	business case here and trying to
EDL	00:05:40,639	00:05:43,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	determine if they should spin it out or
EDL	00:05:43,280	00:05:44,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	license it but
EDL	00:05:44,720	00:05:47,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	54 unique technologies that we're
EDL	00:05:47,680	00:05:50,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	helping plan the path forward for a
EDL	00:05:50,080	00:05:52,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	typical EEI effort begins when a DARPA
EDL	00:05:52,320	00:05:54,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	program manager a pm approaches Gerst
EDL	00:05:54,800	00:05:56,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and her colleagues at DARPA about a
EDL	00:05:56,560	00:05:58,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	research team of scientists and
EDL	00:05:58,160	00:06:00,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	engineers that the pm is working with
EDL	00:06:00,560	00:06:02,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and that has a great idea that might not
EDL	00:06:02,720	00:06:03,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	make it through the valley of death
EDL	00:06:03,919	00:06:06,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	without the sort of help EEI can offer
EDL	00:06:06,880	00:06:09,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the central pillar of EEI's model girth
EDL	00:06:09,360	00:06:11,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	says is to provide funding in the
EDL	00:06:11,440	00:06:13,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	quarter million dollar range for
EDL	00:06:13,120	00:06:15,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	embedding a seasoned and vetted
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	entrepreneur into a technical team for a
EDL	00:06:17,520	00:06:19,759	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	year or even two years the embedded
EDL	00:06:19,759	00:06:22,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	entrepreneur adds crucial sober business
EDL	00:06:22,720	00:06:25,199	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and commercialization insight and acumen
EDL	00:06:25,199	00:06:27,759	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to the optimistic and often idealistic
EDL	00:06:27,759	00:06:29,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technical mindset that the researchers
EDL	00:06:29,440	00:06:32,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	bring into the mix it takes both to get

EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:48,479	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	out there is we're providing longer term
EDL	00:06:48,479	00:06:50,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	entrepreneurial support

EDL	00:06:50,400	00:06:52,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	a lot of the business accelerators today
EDL	00:06:52,880	00:06:56,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	are you know three weeks to six week
EDL	00:06:56,080	00:06:57,599	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	programs
EDL	00:06:57,599	00:07:00,764	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	which didn't align well with our timeline

EDL	00:07:00,764	00:07:03,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the 2nd thing that we're doing
EDL	00:07:03,360	00:07:06,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that's really unique is we're running
EDL	00:07:06,240	00:07:10,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	this in parallel with the research so
EDL	00:07:10,000	00:07:13,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	what our scientific teams are learning when
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:15,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	they're going out and they're doing
EDL	00:07:15,520	00:07:17,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	customer discovery
EDL	00:07:17,919	00:07:19,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	you know they're understanding what the
EDL	00:07:19,840	00:07:22,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	market values what features make sense
EDL	00:07:22,720	00:07:24,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	what performance envelopes are required
EDL	00:07:24,720	00:07:26,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	they're taking that learning and they're
EDL	00:07:26,800	00:07:28,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	bringing it back and they're modifying
EDL	00:07:28,639	00:07:32,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	their research so their end prototype
EDL	00:07:32,000	00:07:33,599	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the end result
EDL	00:07:33,599	00:07:37,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	is a lot closer to what the market would
EDL	00:07:37,120	00:07:38,743	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	value and pay for.

EDL	00:07:38,743	00:07:40,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Running that work in parallel
EDL	00:07:40,960	00:07:44,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	speeds things up significantly that was
EDL	00:07:44,080	00:07:46,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	a big problem when I first came in.
EDL	00:07:46,800	00:07:48,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Program managers were coming to me like
EDL	00:07:48,560	00:07:50,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	when they had a month left on the
EDL	00:07:50,720	00:07:52,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	research program and the prototype had
EDL	00:07:52,720	00:07:55,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	already been built and then we'd go out
EDL	00:07:55,039	00:07:57,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and find out like
EDL	00:07:57,840	00:08:00,879	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it's vastly more expensive than what
EDL	00:08:00,879	00:08:02,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	anyone will pay for or
EDL	00:08:02,800	00:08:04,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	this uh
EDL	00:08:04,080	00:08:04,879	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	this
EDL	00:08:04,879	00:08:06,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	feature that you focused most of the
EDL	00:08:06,800	00:08:09,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	research effort on they don't value but
EDL	00:08:09,280	00:08:10,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	this
EDL	00:08:10,080	00:08:12,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	sub feature that could really be
EDL	00:08:12,000	00:08:14,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	optimized further they do value and so a
EDL	00:08:14,639	00:08:17,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	lot of these teams were having to go
EDL	00:08:17,039	00:08:18,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	back
EDL	00:08:18,080	00:08:21,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	uh rebuild a prototype to make it look
EDL	00:08:21,840	00:08:24,479	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	more like a minimum viable(切实可行的) product and
EDL	00:08:24,479	00:08:27,599	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that's really costly and it takes time

* 3/3 Paid expert/business mentors

EDL	00:08:27,599	00:08:30,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the final thing that we did differently
EDL	00:08:30,960	00:08:32,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	from
EDL	00:08:32,000	00:08:33,599	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	others is we
EDL	00:08:33,599	00:08:35,839	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it it sounds uninteresting but it's
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	actually the biggest impact thing is we
EDL	00:08:37,760	00:08:40,958	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	have paid expert mentors

EDL	00:08:40,958	00:08:43,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	paid expert business mentors

EDL	00:08:43,440	00:08:47,089	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	most programs have volunteer mentors 
EDL	00:08:47,089	00:08:50,399	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	when I was you know after grad school at MIT
EDL	00:08:50,399	00:08:53,279	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	I worked at a MIT spin out and we had
EDL	00:08:53,279	00:08:55,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	these great volunteer mentors that
EDL	00:08:55,680	00:08:59,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	helped us like one hour a quarter and [hehehe]
EDL	00:08:59,120	00:09:01,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	they had these phenomenal experts and
EDL	00:09:01,360	00:09:03,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	gave amazing advice that ended up making
EDL	00:09:03,920	00:09:05,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the difference for us but we definitely
EDL	00:09:05,680	00:09:08,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	didn't have access to enough of their time.

EDL	00:09:08,880	00:09:10,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	This is where a foundational component
EDL	00:09:10,880	00:09:13,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	of EEI a partnership with In-Q-Tel
EDL	00:09:13,600	00:09:14,884	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Emerge comes in.

EDL	00:09:14,884	00:09:16,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	In-Q-Tel emerge is a
EDL	00:09:16,320	00:09:18,959	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	subsidiary of In-Q-Tel a more than
EDL	00:09:18,959	00:09:21,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	20-year-old non-profit venture capital
EDL	00:09:21,040	00:09:22,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	firm with roots in the intelligence
EDL	00:09:22,880	00:09:25,839	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	community. It now has established itself
EDL	00:09:25,839	00:09:27,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	as a unique place at the intersection of
EDL	00:09:27,920	00:09:29,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	venture capital, government, national
EDL	00:09:29,920	00:09:32,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	security and the startup community

EDL	00:09:32,160	00:09:34,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Scott Cunningham of In-Q-Tel emerge
EDL	00:09:34,480	00:09:36,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	works with Gerst and her EEI team at
EDL	00:09:36,720	00:09:38,959	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	DARPA and with DARPA program managers
EDL	00:09:38,959	00:09:41,279	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and their research performers those are
EDL	00:09:41,279	00:09:43,519	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the Principal Investigators, PIs and
EDL	00:09:43,519	00:09:45,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	other research team members that PMs
EDL	00:09:45,680	00:09:47,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	contract with to investigate new
EDL	00:09:47,440	00:09:49,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technological ideas and territories.

* Scott:

EDL	00:09:49,920	00:09:53,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	DARPA is absolutely fantastic at
EDL	00:09:53,040	00:09:55,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	coaching new technologies into being
EDL	00:09:55,440	00:09:57,279	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	many of these new technologies are so
EDL	00:09:57,279	00:09:59,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	new that they go into new markets
EDL	00:09:59,760	00:10:01,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and if you know anything about getting
EDL	00:10:01,920	00:10:04,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technology to market when you have a new
EDL	00:10:04,160	00:10:07,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technology and a new market. It's tough.

EDL	00:10:07,360	00:10:09,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	There's a dramatic
EDL	00:10:09,200	00:10:11,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	need for capital it's highly risky on
EDL	00:10:11,920	00:10:14,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	both the technology and market side and
EDL	00:10:14,240	00:10:16,959	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that's a classic valley of death story

EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:18,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	So what we
EDL	00:10:18,640	00:10:20,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	try to do with all of our performers and
EDL	00:10:20,720	00:10:24,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	with our PMs is take the the PM's needs
EDL	00:10:24,000	00:10:26,399	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and the Department of Defense's needs
EDL	00:10:26,399	00:10:28,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	identify the risk elements in the
EDL	00:10:28,320	00:10:30,399	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	commercialization piece
EDL	00:10:30,399	00:10:32,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	not the technical the PM and the and the
EDL	00:10:32,560	00:10:34,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Principal Investor have that but in the
EDL	00:10:34,480	00:10:36,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	commercialization piece
EDL	00:10:36,320	00:10:38,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and help our colleagues reduce that
EDL	00:10:38,240	00:10:40,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	uncertainty which makes it much more
EDL	00:10:40,560	00:10:42,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	attractive to
EDL	00:10:42,000	00:10:44,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	american investors.

EDL	00:10:44,000	00:10:46,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	so if you have a new widget or even a
EDL	00:10:46,800	00:10:50,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	new vaccine type or a new way to get a vaccine
EDL	00:10:50,720	00:10:53,930	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	or a new way to interfere in a supply chain 
EDL	00:10:53,930	00:10:56,418	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	or cook something out of a supply chain
EDL	00:10:56,418	00:10:58,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	there's an element of risk it
EDL	00:10:58,160	00:11:00,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	doesn't match up and you have to [..] is that
EDL	00:11:00,480	00:11:02,702	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it just drop into the current supply chain 
EDL	00:11:02,702	00:11:04,305	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	or is it very different 
EDL	00:11:04,305	00:11:07,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to the extent it's different you need somebody
EDL	00:11:07,120	00:11:08,399	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to think through all the different
EDL	00:11:08,399	00:11:10,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	pieces the regulatory piece the
EDL	00:11:10,800	00:11:13,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	logistics the infrastructure the waste
EDL	00:11:13,600	00:11:16,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	all that sort of stuff so we work with
EDL	00:11:16,320	00:11:19,067	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	performers and work with the program managers 
EDL	00:11:19,067	00:11:20,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to identify those elements and
EDL	00:11:20,800	00:11:21,772	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	work on them. 

EDL	00:11:21,772	00:11:23,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	That includes things like
EDL	00:11:23,440	00:11:25,839	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	intellectual property strategies,
EDL	00:11:25,839	00:11:28,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	market segmentations finding people to
EDL	00:11:28,880	00:11:30,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	put together the right pitch deck for
EDL	00:11:30,640	00:11:32,560	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	them and then actually matching up with
EDL	00:11:32,560	00:11:33,715	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	people who have money.

EDL	00:11:33,715	00:11:36,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Those business (经验丰富的) savvy people Cunningham refers to
EDL	00:11:36,640	00:11:38,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	constitute primary ingredients of what
EDL	00:11:38,640	00:11:41,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Gerst and her EEI colleagues hope will
EDL	00:11:41,040	00:11:43,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	become their lasting contribution to
EDL	00:11:43,040	00:11:45,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	DARPA's track record of delivering new
EDL	00:11:45,120	00:11:47,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technologies to warfighters and not
EDL	00:11:47,200	00:11:49,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	infrequently to the public at large
EDL	00:11:49,680	00:11:52,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	these are not people employed at all by
EDL	00:11:52,160	00:11:55,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	In-Q-Tel or by DARPA. These are people
EDL	00:11:55,200	00:11:58,079	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that we intend to embed so that all
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:11:59,839	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	their work products become the work
EDL	00:11:59,839	00:12:03,279	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	product on and owned by and and are the
EDL	00:12:03,279	00:12:07,519	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	confidential information of the company itself

EDL	00:12:07,519	00:12:09,839	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	So where we find these people? We make
EDL	00:12:09,839	00:12:12,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	suggestions the performers if they can
EDL	00:12:12,639	00:12:15,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	find them make suggestions there are
EDL	00:12:15,120	00:12:18,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	some performers in certain locations
EDL	00:12:18,160	00:12:21,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	San Francisco Bay Area, Boston
EDL	00:12:21,200	00:12:24,399	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that there's a good environment around
EDL	00:12:24,399	00:12:27,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	for entrepreneurs and it's easier to find people
EDL	00:12:27,680	00:12:33,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	folks that we support in more remote locations which don't have that ecosystem
EDL	00:12:33,680	00:12:36,079	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we go out and find individuals that they
EDL	00:12:36,079	00:12:38,079	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	could consider and they do the
EDL	00:12:38,079	00:12:40,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	interviewing, they do the hiring and then
EDL	00:12:40,160	00:12:42,399	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we simply provide a non-object to make
EDL	00:12:42,399	00:12:45,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	sure that the people that are being hired
EDL	00:12:45,040	00:12:47,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	are actually capable and and competent(有能力的)
EDL	00:12:47,760	00:12:51,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	at doing the elements of our work statement
EDL	00:12:51,200	00:12:53,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that we're encouraging to do.

* Host says

EDL	00:12:53,760	00:12:55,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	We are talking DARPA here so that means
EDL	00:12:55,680	00:12:57,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we are talking about visionary defense
EDL	00:12:57,680	00:12:59,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technologies or at least technologies
EDL	00:12:59,440	00:13:01,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that are very hard to realize so the
EDL	00:13:01,760	00:13:03,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	portfolio that Gerst, Cunningham and
EDL	00:13:03,680	00:13:06,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	their EEI colleagues is hoping to usher(引领)
EDL	00:13:06,160	00:13:08,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	into field operation and commercial
EDL	00:13:08,160	00:13:11,519	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	reality sounds like a technophiles(技术狂热者) wonderland

A Norfolk-based biotech company is getting an additional $1.5 million from area investment groups to develop a cutting-edge treatment for tendon and ligament injuries.
757 Angels and the Center for Innovative Technology are the biggest of the latest investors, putting in $660,000 and $250,000, respectively.
The Embody funding is a successful example of how local investors can jump-start financial support from other sources, 757 Angels Executive Director Monique Adams said.

EDL	00:15:14,160	00:15:16,079	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	That's Jeffrey Conroy, Embody's Chief
EDL	00:15:16,079	00:15:17,920	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Executive Officer, which makes him the
EDL	00:15:17,920	00:15:19,839	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	company's number one storyteller.
EDL	00:15:19,839	00:15:21,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	He says the company's partnership with
EDL	00:15:21,440	00:15:24,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	DARPA began when it was selected in 2015
EDL	00:15:24,720	00:15:26,959	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	as a performer for the atoms to product
EDL	00:15:26,959	00:15:29,199	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	program a typically ambitious program in
EDL	00:15:29,199	00:15:31,706	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the agency's Defense Sciences Office. 
EDL	00:15:31,706	00:15:34,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	The program ran from 2015 to 2020 as the
EDL	00:15:34,720	00:15:36,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	program's name suggests it was all about
EDL	00:15:36,800	00:15:39,982	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	building things with atomic level fabrication control. 

EDL	00:15:39,982	00:15:41,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Here's how Conroy

EDL	00:15:46,079	00:15:48,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	When we were funded under the Atoms to
EDL	00:15:48,639	00:15:51,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Products(A2P) program from DARPA it was
EDL	00:15:51,440	00:15:54,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	basically a molecular level additive
EDL	00:15:54,000	00:15:56,800	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	manufacturing program so we were
EDL	00:15:56,800	00:15:59,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	effectively funded to innovate in
EDL	00:15:59,600	00:16:01,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	manufacturing methods
EDL	00:16:01,680	00:16:04,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	using materials at the molecular level
EDL	00:16:04,320	00:16:06,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to build structures.
EDL	00:16:06,320	00:16:08,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	In our case it just so happens that we
EDL	00:16:08,639	00:16:10,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	chose to use
EDL	00:16:10,240	00:16:14,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	a biologic molecule collagen(胶原蛋白) as our substrate(底物)
EDL	00:16:14,639	00:16:17,680	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and develop a manufacturing method to

EDL	00:16:28,000	00:16:29,040	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and so
EDL	00:16:29,040	00:16:32,639	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	We use clinical grade collagen.
EDL	00:16:32,639	00:16:34,967	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	We combine it with another polymer(聚合物) 
EDL	00:16:34,967	00:16:36,959	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we create a copolymer
EDL	00:16:36,959	00:16:39,519	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	in a benign solvent(良心溶剂) chemistry and then
EDL	00:16:39,519	00:16:42,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we developed kind of a modified

EDL	00:17:00,160	00:17:02,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	collagen until we found the right

EDL	00:17:05,760	00:17:09,599	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	fibers that allowed us to build this

EDL	00:17:16,640	00:17:20,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and so we used manufacturing technology

EDL	00:17:23,679	00:17:25,439	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to engineer these structures which

EDL	00:19:17,520	00:19:19,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	relevant experience to get all of that
EDL	00:19:19,520	00:19:21,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	brilliance to the finish line whether
EDL	00:19:21,520	00:19:23,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that be a new way to make missile fuel

EDL	00:19:38,960	00:19:41,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the product's launch in late 2020 is
EDL	00:19:41,120	00:19:42,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	heartening(令人振奋的)

* GUEST

EDL	00:19:42,320	00:19:44,799	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	We've had a tremendous response after
EDL	00:19:44,799	00:19:48,160	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	launching the product at the end of 2020.
EDL	00:19:48,160	00:19:50,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Now we've completed our first 200
EDL	00:19:50,320	00:19:53,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	patients we'll do just about 500
EDL	00:19:53,520	00:19:55,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	patients this year and
EDL	00:19:55,679	00:19:59,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we're able to demonstrate that in 30 to
EDL	00:19:59,520	00:20:02,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	50 weeks our implant is gone and the
EDL	00:20:02,559	00:20:05,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	patient is left with new aligned
EDL	00:20:05,200	00:20:07,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	connective tissue and that is expressing
EDL	00:20:07,760	00:20:09,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	native collagen in place.

EDL	00:20:09,840	00:20:12,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	So we've created a mechanism to
EDL	00:20:12,080	00:20:13,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	stimulate
EDL	00:20:13,280	00:20:16,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	new natural tissue growth that thickens
EDL	00:20:16,400	00:20:18,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	a surgical repair and over time what we
EDL	00:20:18,960	00:20:21,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	hope to prove is that we've reduced the
EDL	00:20:21,200	00:20:23,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	patient's risk of re-injury and we've
EDL	00:20:23,760	00:20:27,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	accelerated the opportunity to return to
EDL	00:20:27,120	00:20:29,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	normal activity. That's kind of the the
EDL	00:20:29,679	00:20:31,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	background on the
EDL	00:20:31,520	00:20:33,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technology that was funded by DARPA and
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:36,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	how we translated that investment
EDL	00:20:36,640	00:20:41,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	into producing FDA-regulated medical devices,
EDL	00:20:41,440	00:20:44,799	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	really for the benefit of sports medicine patients

* HOST

EDL	00:20:44,799	00:20:46,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Conroy credits his young company's
EDL	00:20:46,400	00:20:47,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	partnership with the Embedded
EDL	00:20:47,760	00:20:49,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Entrepreneurship Initiative as
EDL	00:20:49,760	00:20:51,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	accelerating the launch of Tapestry and
EDL	00:20:51,919	00:20:54,096	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	opening the way for other products 

* Conroy:

EDL	00:20:54,096	00:20:57,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we came in contact with Kacy's EEI program
EDL	00:20:57,120	00:20:58,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and
EDL	00:20:58,559	00:21:02,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that office had a very clear mandate
EDL	00:21:02,240	00:21:04,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	from the start which was
EDL	00:21:04,320	00:21:07,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	okay, we're a funding mechanism we fund
EDL	00:21:07,120	00:21:10,159	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	moonshot technologies, we're great at that,
EDL	00:21:10,159	00:21:13,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we are trying to look a little bit
EDL	00:21:13,600	00:21:15,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	closer to the market and understand what
EDL	00:21:15,679	00:21:17,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	else do these companies need to be able
EDL	00:21:17,360	00:21:20,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to get commercial. So what what are the
EDL	00:21:20,400	00:21:22,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	indications of success early that will
EDL	00:21:22,960	00:21:25,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	lead to commercial translation.
EDL	00:21:25,520	00:21:26,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and
EDL	00:21:26,320	00:21:29,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	EEI came out of research and engagement
EDL	00:21:29,600	00:21:32,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that Kacy's office and Scott Cunningham
EDL	00:21:32,400	00:21:34,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	had had started
EDL	00:21:34,480	00:21:37,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	our early EEI work was
EDL	00:21:37,600	00:21:40,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	they helped us develop a very detailed
EDL	00:21:40,000	00:21:42,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	market model to understand what adoption
EDL	00:21:42,880	00:21:44,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	would look like what we could expect
EDL	00:21:44,880	00:21:46,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	what our pricing models might look like
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:48,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	what our revenue forecast might look
EDL	00:21:48,720	00:21:51,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	like, it was really detailed as as you
EDL	00:21:51,280	00:21:53,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	would expect from DARPA analytical tool
EDL	00:21:53,840	00:21:54,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that is
EDL	00:21:54,880	00:21:58,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	eerily tracking reality as we get
EDL	00:21:58,240	00:22:01,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	commercial here so we're really happy
EDL	00:22:01,440	00:22:04,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	fundamentally for me DARPA has been
EDL	00:22:04,640	00:22:06,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	if not anything
EDL	00:22:06,240	00:22:08,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	one of the most important relationships
EDL	00:22:08,480	00:22:11,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	in the creation of this company
EDL	00:22:11,520	00:22:14,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and that means that not only were they a
EDL	00:22:14,240	00:22:16,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	formative validating partner in the
EDL	00:22:16,720	00:22:18,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technology and bringing a product
EDL	00:22:18,559	00:22:21,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	through FDA but they recognized that
EDL	00:22:21,840	00:22:24,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	okay now the next set of challenges are
EDL	00:22:24,080	00:22:26,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	commercial challenges. yes you've got to
EDL	00:22:26,080	00:22:27,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	have great tech but now you've got to
EDL	00:22:27,760	00:22:30,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	have market needs that are attainable(可达到的)
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:32,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	you've got to have markets that you can
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,799	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	1) get your fair share then figure out
EDL	00:22:34,799	00:22:36,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	how to get more than your fair share
EDL	00:22:36,960	00:22:39,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and EEI specifically
EDL	00:22:39,679	00:22:42,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	helped us go from kind of a consultative
EDL	00:22:42,640	00:22:44,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	discussion where we got
EDL	00:22:44,640	00:22:46,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	input on forecasts and input on
EDL	00:22:46,960	00:22:48,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	commercial models

EDL	00:22:48,640	00:22:51,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	2) okay now we're willing to put some
EDL	00:22:51,120	00:22:53,280	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	resources directly into the company so
EDL	00:22:53,280	00:22:55,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that you can augment your team with
EDL	00:22:55,120	00:22:56,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	skill sets you don't have
EDL	00:22:56,960	00:22:58,960	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	their skills that you need we're going
EDL	00:22:58,960	00:23:01,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to enable them coming into the company
EDL	00:23:01,039	00:23:03,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	18 months or at least 12 months before
EDL	00:23:03,600	00:23:05,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we would have been able to afford them
EDL	00:23:05,120	00:23:06,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	ourselves
EDL	00:23:06,400	00:23:09,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and it was transformational it really
EDL	00:23:09,679	00:23:13,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	helped us create a framework for
EDL	00:23:13,039	00:23:14,155	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	external success 
EDL	00:23:14,155	00:23:16,723	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	not just how do you hit a project milestone 
EDL	00:23:16,723	00:23:20,375	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	but now how do you hit the hot buttons of your customer 
EDL	00:23:20,375	00:23:22,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and how do you start to generate the evidence
EDL	00:23:22,640	00:23:24,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that's going to help you scale and
EDL	00:23:24,640	00:23:26,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	generate a long-term successful
EDL	00:23:26,320	00:23:28,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	sustainable business. So it's been uh
EDL	00:23:28,480	00:23:30,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it's been a great experience to be a
EDL	00:23:30,559	00:23:33,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	part of it and I'm really thankful for
EDL	00:23:33,200	00:23:35,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Kacy's team and
EDL	00:23:35,440	00:23:37,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	John Mayne and the Atoms to Products team
EDL	00:23:37,440	00:23:39,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and everyone at DARPA.

EDL	00:23:39,360	00:23:41,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Embody is just one of the earliest
EDL	00:23:41,039	00:23:43,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	adopters of the EEI model there are more
EDL	00:23:43,520	00:23:46,159	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	than 50 others and Gerst says the target
EDL	00:23:46,159	00:23:48,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	number of partner research teams by year
EDL	00:23:48,559	00:23:51,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	5 of EEI is 150.

EDL	00:23:51,760	00:23:53,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	She notes that the collective portfolio
EDL	00:23:53,520	00:23:55,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	of these technologies already is
EDL	00:23:55,200	00:23:56,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	reflecting the broad spectrum of
EDL	00:23:56,640	00:23:58,799	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	technology development that mothership
EDL	00:23:58,799	00:24:00,083	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	DARPA is known for.

* Kacy:

EDL	00:24:00,083	00:24:02,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	We have software to
EDL	00:24:02,080	00:24:05,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	identify deep fakes, we have design tools
EDL	00:24:05,679	00:24:08,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to increase the speed of designing
EDL	00:24:08,880	00:24:12,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	integrated circuits, we have Covid19
EDL	00:24:12,240	00:24:15,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	diagnostics medical devices,
EDL	00:24:15,840	00:24:17,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	quantum sensors,
EDL	00:24:17,520	00:24:20,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	so it covers a pretty broad area.

* HOST: U.S Investors / Foreign Investors

EDL	00:24:20,880	00:24:23,120	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Another key metric that EEI values is
EDL	00:24:23,120	00:24:25,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	how much investor capital for EEI
EDL	00:24:25,520	00:24:27,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	partner companies the initiative is
EDL	00:24:27,360	00:24:29,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	helping to attract especially from U.S
EDL	00:24:29,600	00:24:31,566	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	investors rather than foreign ones 

* Kacy:

EDL	00:24:31,566	00:24:35,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	the biggest win for the program is that all
EDL	00:24:35,520	00:24:38,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	of the funding that we've helped these teams
EDL	00:24:38,320	00:24:41,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	raise a hundred percent has been with
EDL	00:24:41,600	00:24:44,159	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	U.S investors rather than foreign
EDL	00:24:44,159	00:24:46,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	investors and you know one of the main
EDL	00:24:46,720	00:24:48,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	challenges that the embedded
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	entrepreneurship initiative was stood up
EDL	00:24:50,559	00:24:52,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	to address was that
EDL	00:24:52,880	00:24:55,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	because of that valley of death because
EDL	00:24:55,360	00:24:59,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we had a lot of teams standing up and giving
EDL	00:24:59,039	00:25:01,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	entirely technical pitches that didn't
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:05,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	garner(获得) any investor interest. There was a
EDL	00:25:05,039	00:25:08,640	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	lot of foreign interest and foreign
EDL	00:25:08,640	00:25:11,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	funding offers into those companies and
EDL	00:25:11,679	00:25:14,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	so our initial hypothesis(假说) was
EDL	00:25:14,480	00:25:17,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	hey if if we can help them build up a
EDL	00:25:17,600	00:25:20,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	compelling business plan, go to market
EDL	00:25:20,400	00:25:24,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	strategy, then they will be able to
EDL	00:25:24,320	00:25:26,422	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	attract U.S investment 

** First year: 20x

EDL	00:25:26,422	00:25:27,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	And after the

** HOST:
EDL	00:25:50,802	00:25:51,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	but wait
EDL	00:25:51,520	00:25:52,720	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	there's more
EDL	00:25:52,720	00:25:55,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	as of the end of november EEI had helped
EDL	00:25:55,440	00:25:57,520	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	participant teams spin out more than a
EDL	00:25:57,520	00:25:59,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	dozen new companies stand up nine
EDL	00:25:59,840	00:26:02,400	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	manufacturing sites and close 17
EDL	00:26:02,400	00:26:04,240	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	development agreements with larger
EDL	00:26:04,240	00:26:05,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	companies

EDL	00:26:05,600	00:26:07,600	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	Gerst knows DARPA too well to go on the
EDL	00:26:07,600	00:26:09,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	record saying that EEI itself will make
EDL	00:26:09,919	00:26:12,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it past its own valley of death this
EDL	00:26:12,000	00:26:13,840	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	five-year experiment in which it has to
EDL	00:26:13,840	00:26:16,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	show it actually helps DARPA succeed in
EDL	00:26:16,080	00:26:17,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	its mission.
EDL	00:26:17,440	00:26:19,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	But DARPA is future oriented and
EDL	00:26:19,200	00:26:22,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	optimistic and so is Kacy

** Kacy:

EDL	00:26:22,000	00:26:25,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	so I hope that when
EDL	00:26:25,200	00:26:28,080	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	our whole team the whole EEI founding
EDL	00:26:28,080	00:26:30,000	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	team when we look back
EDL	00:26:30,000	00:26:31,679	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	you know we're old and
EDL	00:26:31,679	00:26:33,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we're looking back on our lives I hope
EDL	00:26:33,440	00:26:35,200	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	we can say
EDL	00:26:35,200	00:26:36,320	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	yeah
EDL	00:26:36,320	00:26:39,039	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that made a huge difference and there
EDL	00:26:39,039	00:26:40,799	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	already are several
EDL	00:26:40,799	00:26:42,880	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	companies that have come out of this
EDL	00:26:42,880	00:26:44,480	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	where we can say
EDL	00:26:44,480	00:26:46,559	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	that wouldn't exist without this
EDL	00:26:46,559	00:26:47,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	resource
EDL	00:26:47,919	00:26:50,799	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	and what we did was really important
EDL	00:26:50,799	00:26:53,360	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	thinking through this new model or that
EDL	00:26:53,360	00:26:55,440	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	would probably exist but it would be
EDL	00:26:55,440	00:26:57,919	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	owned by one of our adversaries and now
EDL	00:26:57,919	00:27:01,760	| VfD E52 The Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative |	it's it's based in the U.S

* NOTES

In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, listeners will learn about an
emerging component of DARPA’s institutional culture for delivering technologies
that strengthen the nation and redefine what is possible. 

Called the Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative (EEI) (https://EEI.darpa.mil/),
this effort is designed to help creative scientists and engineers usher their
new high-technology visions all of the way to real in-field, hold-in-your-hand,
useful-in-the-world technologies. 

The mission of EEI, now entering its second year following a pilot phase, is to
provide early-stage technology-development teams with veteran innovators who
bring with them the proven business savvy it takes to make it through the
proverbial Valley of Death. 

That’s when anything from insufficient funding, missed deadlines, unexpected
supply-chain issues, intellectual property disputes, market fluctuations, a
federal policy change, or any number of other hazards can kill off even the best
of technology ideas.

Listeners will hear from Kacy Gerst, DARPA’s Chief of Commercial Strategy; Scott
Cunningham, a Senior Commercialization Advisor with In-Q-Tel-Emerge, a
technology-acceleration organization that is partnering with DARPA to make EEI
work; and Jeff Conroy, CEO of Embody, an emerging biotechnology company that
credits EEI with accelerating its success in launching what is now its first
FDA-approved biomedical technology for improving ligament and tendon repair, a
common need for athletes and military personnel. 

Gerst is happy to note that EEI already is working with more than 50
entrepreneurial teams and she expects the initiative to ramp up over the next
few years to a portfolio of 150 such teams.
