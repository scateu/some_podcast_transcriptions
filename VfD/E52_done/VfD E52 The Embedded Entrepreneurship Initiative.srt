00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
Technology is a driver of our times

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,720
since its founding in 1958 in the midst

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,800
of the cold war. DARPA the Defense

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
Advanced Research Projects Agency has

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
been a driver of technology.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
Welcome to voices from DARPA, a window

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,559
onto the history people and

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,000
accomplishments that have earned DARPA a place among the most admired

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
institutions and cultures of innovation.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,800
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,360
In this episode of Voices from DARPA we will hear from some of the

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,520
stakeholders in an institutional

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,239
five-year experiment called the embedded

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239
entrepreneurship program EEI for short

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,800
the vision of EEI now in its second year

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,039
is to help entrepreneurs survive the

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,280
unavoidable and harrowing(令人悲伤的) phase of

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,438
startup and entrepreneurial culture

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,080
often referred to as the valley of death

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,668
that's when anything insufficient funding, poor cost projections,

25
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:16,400
missed deadlines supply chain issues inability to scale up from a prototype phase

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
intellectual property disputes market fluctuations a federal policy change or

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,479
any number of other hazards can kill off even the best of technology ideas like

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
the origin of any innovative technology

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
this innovative institutional concept

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,079
EEI began as a glimmer(微光) in people's eyes

31
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,479
including those of Kacy Gerst, DARPA's Chief of Commercial Strategy

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
the embedded entrepreneurship initiative

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
is you know like anything else at DARPA

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,600
it's a

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,880
it's an experiment we have specific metrics that we have to hit and

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,079
you know every year we'll continue to measure its value, we'll continue to

37
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,680
iterate and learn to optimize this model for impact

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,399
and at the end of the fifth year then

39
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,240
whoever the director is at that time

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,038
we'll we'll take a look at it and see if it's really helping us achieve the DARPA

41
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,040
mission of creating new capabilities

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,040
that are in the hands of the warfighter and national security end users

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,489
It's that last bit that part about getting technologies beyond

44
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:26,800
the valley of death and into the hands of war fighters and national security users

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,200
that EEI is designed to make happen more

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,599
often than it has in the past. There are

47
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
plenty of business and technology

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
accelerator models out there Tech

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Transfer Offices at Universities try to

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
help faculty license patents or get startups going for one there are various

51
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,160
business boot camps that promise to turn

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
technical teams into business wizards in

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
three to six week programs venture

54
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,519
capital firms bet on winners and feed

55
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,360
those chosen companies various levels of

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
funding and sometimes business expertise

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
to help move concepts toward commercial products and services

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,480
Gerst says DARPA poses unique challenges

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,700
when it comes to accelerating development

60
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,879
in the innovation ecosystem

61
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,560
DARPA is

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,519
very early stage you know we're taking

63
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,959
things from

64
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
idea often to you know proof of

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,959
principle or

66
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
first prototype and really understanding

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
what performance can be gained and that

68
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,560
in business terms that's pre-seed stage

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,360
So it's unique in that it's very early

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,640
DARPA is

71
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,840
unique in that most of its portfolio

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
focuses on the

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
hard tech, deep tech space that you know

74
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,080
materials science, biotechnology,

75
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,200
microelectronics that take

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,527
a long time to mature.

77
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:51,280
A lot of the original business accelerators were designed for software

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,400
and not hardware and definitely not material science.

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
and and then the last reason why it's

80
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,840
unique is that it's very

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
high risk but potentially high impact

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
and so

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,640
the result of that you know in my world

84
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
is that you don't see

85
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,120
many straightforward business models

86
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
where DARPA has you know developed a

87
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
technology that's just slightly

88
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,639
incrementally better from what's out

89
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,839
there today and it it nicely fits within

90
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,919
to the existing system

91
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,919
you know the existing market system and

92
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
the existing supply chain often DARPA is

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,080
going after things that have off the

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
charts performance that have the

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
potential to to really upend the

96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,520
existing market structure

97
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
that require new thinking around

98
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,240
business models and partnerships

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,199
sometimes DARPA develops some really

100
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,280
unique things where we're thinking oh

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,919
this could create an entirely new space

102
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,800
a new industry and that needs to be from

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,280
a commercialization standpoint supported

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
in an entirely different way and so

105
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,440
we designed this program to uniquely fit

106
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
the DARPA model EEI came out of the

107
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
gates in a mad sprint

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
following a pilot stage the initiative

109
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
began ramping up to full-scale status in

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
october 2020 in what is initially

111
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
planned as a five-year institutional

112
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,520
experiment already EEI is engaged with

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
more than 50 research teams each one

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
with big big plans we have

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
54 research teams some of them are still

116
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,800
thinking about if they should become a

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
company

118
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
some of them are in a corporate research

119
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
lab and they're you know investigating

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
the hypothesis that there's a compelling

121
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,639
business case here and trying to

122
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,280
determine if they should spin it out or

123
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
license it but

124
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
54 unique technologies that we're

125
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
helping plan the path forward for a

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,320
typical EEI effort begins when a DARPA

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,800
program manager a pm approaches Gerst

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
and her colleagues at DARPA about a

129
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
research team of scientists and

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,560
engineers that the pm is working with

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
and that has a great idea that might not

132
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
make it through the valley of death

133
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,880
without the sort of help EEI can offer

134
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
the central pillar of EEI's model girth

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
says is to provide funding in the

136
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
quarter million dollar range for

137
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,039
embedding a seasoned and vetted

138
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,520
entrepreneur into a technical team for a

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,759
year or even two years the embedded

140
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,720
entrepreneur adds crucial sober business

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
and commercialization insight and acumen

142
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
to the optimistic and often idealistic

143
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,440
technical mindset that the researchers

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,080
bring into the mix it takes both to get

145
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,919
promising technology into practical

146
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,520
shape manufactured and into the hands of end users

147
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
here's how Gerst explains EEI's special sauce

148
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
one thing we're doing differently from

149
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,759
the typical business boot camps that are

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,479
out there is we're providing longer term

151
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,400
entrepreneurial support

152
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
a lot of the business accelerators today

153
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,080
are you know three weeks to six week

154
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,599
programs

155
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,764
which didn't align well with our timeline

156
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:03,360
the 2nd thing that we're doing

157
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,240
that's really unique is we're running

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
this in parallel with the research so

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,919
what our scientific teams are learning when

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,520
they're going out and they're doing

161
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,919
customer discovery

162
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,840
you know they're understanding what the

163
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,720
market values what features make sense

164
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
what performance envelopes are required

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
they're taking that learning and they're

166
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,639
bringing it back and they're modifying

167
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
their research so their end prototype

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,599
the end result

169
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,120
is a lot closer to what the market would

170
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,743
value and pay for.

171
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:40,960
Running that work in parallel

172
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
speeds things up significantly that was

173
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,800
a big problem when I first came in.

174
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
Program managers were coming to me like

175
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
when they had a month left on the

176
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
research program and the prototype had

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,039
already been built and then we'd go out

178
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,840
and find out like

179
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,879
it's vastly more expensive than what

180
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
anyone will pay for or

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
this uh

182
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,879
this

183
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
feature that you focused most of the

184
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
research effort on they don't value but

185
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,080
this

186
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
sub feature that could really be

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
optimized further they do value and so a

188
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
lot of these teams were having to go

189
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,080
back

190
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,840
uh rebuild a prototype to make it look

191
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,479
more like a minimum viable(切实可行的) product and

192
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
that's really costly and it takes time

193
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,960
the final thing that we did differently

194
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,000
from

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,599
others is we

196
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,839
it it sounds uninteresting but it's

197
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
actually the biggest impact thing is we

198
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,958
have paid expert mentors

199
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,440
paid expert business mentors

200
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,089
most programs have volunteer mentors

201
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,399
when I was you know after grad school at MIT

202
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,279
I worked at a MIT spin out and we had

203
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,680
these great volunteer mentors that

204
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
helped us like one hour a quarter and [hehehe]

205
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
they had these phenomenal experts and

206
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
gave amazing advice that ended up making

207
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
the difference for us but we definitely

208
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
didn't have access to enough of their time.

209
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
This is where a foundational component

210
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,600
of EEI a partnership with In-Q-Tel

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,884
Emerge comes in.

212
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,320
In-Q-Tel emerge is a

213
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
subsidiary of In-Q-Tel a more than

214
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,040
20-year-old non-profit venture capital

215
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
firm with roots in the intelligence

216
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,839
community. It now has established itself

217
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,920
as a unique place at the intersection of

218
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
venture capital, government, national

219
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,160
security and the startup community

220
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
Scott Cunningham of In-Q-Tel emerge

221
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,720
works with Gerst and her EEI team at

222
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,959
DARPA and with DARPA program managers

223
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,279
and their research performers those are

224
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
the Principal Investigators, PIs and

225
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,680
other research team members that PMs

226
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
contract with to investigate new

227
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,920
technological ideas and territories.

228
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,040
DARPA is absolutely fantastic at

229
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
coaching new technologies into being

230
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,279
many of these new technologies are so

231
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,760
new that they go into new markets

232
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
and if you know anything about getting

233
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
technology to market when you have a new

234
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
technology and a new market. It's tough.

235
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
There's a dramatic

236
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
need for capital it's highly risky on

237
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
both the technology and market side and

238
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,959
that's a classic valley of death story

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,640
So what we

240
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
try to do with all of our performers and

241
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
with our PMs is take the the PM's needs

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
and the Department of Defense's needs

243
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
identify the risk elements in the

244
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,399
commercialization piece

245
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,560
not the technical the PM and the and the

246
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
Principal Investor have that but in the

247
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
commercialization piece

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
and help our colleagues reduce that

249
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
uncertainty which makes it much more

250
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,000
attractive to

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
american investors.

252
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
so if you have a new widget or even a

253
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,720
new vaccine type or a new way to get a vaccine

254
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,930
or a new way to interfere in a supply chain

255
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,418
or cook something out of a supply chain

256
00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:58,160
there's an element of risk it

257
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
doesn't match up and you have to [..] is that

258
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,702
it just drop into the current supply chain

259
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:04,305
or is it very different

260
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:07,120
to the extent it's different you need somebody

261
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,399
to think through all the different

262
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
pieces the regulatory piece the

263
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,600
logistics the infrastructure the waste

264
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
all that sort of stuff so we work with

265
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,067
performers and work with the program managers

266
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,800
to identify those elements and

267
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,772
work on them.

268
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:23,440
That includes things like

269
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
intellectual property strategies,

270
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,880
market segmentations finding people to

271
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,640
put together the right pitch deck for

272
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
them and then actually matching up with

273
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,715
people who have money.

274
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:36,640
Those business (经验丰富的) savvy people Cunningham refers to

275
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
constitute primary ingredients of what

276
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
Gerst and her EEI colleagues hope will

277
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
become their lasting contribution to

278
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
DARPA's track record of delivering new

279
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
technologies to warfighters and not

280
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,680
infrequently to the public at large

281
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,160
these are not people employed at all by

282
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
In-Q-Tel or by DARPA. These are people

283
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,079
that we intend to embed so that all

284
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,839
their work products become the work

285
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
product on and owned by and and are the

286
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,519
confidential information of the company itself

287
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,839
So where we find these people? We make

288
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,639
suggestions the performers if they can

289
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,120
find them make suggestions there are

290
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
some performers in certain locations

291
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,200
San Francisco Bay Area, Boston

292
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,399
that there's a good environment around

293
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,680
for entrepreneurs and it's easier to find people

294
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,680
folks that we support in more remote locations which don't have that ecosystem

295
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,079
we go out and find individuals that they

296
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,079
could consider and they do the

297
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
interviewing, they do the hiring and then

298
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,399
we simply provide a non-object to make

299
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,040
sure that the people that are being hired

300
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,760
are actually capable and and competent(有能力的)

301
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,200
at doing the elements of our work statement

302
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,760
that we're encouraging to do.

303
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
We are talking DARPA here so that means

304
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
we are talking about visionary defense

305
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,440
technologies or at least technologies

306
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,760
that are very hard to realize so the

307
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
portfolio that Gerst, Cunningham and

308
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,160
their EEI colleagues is hoping to usher(引领)

309
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
into field operation and commercial

310
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,519
reality sounds like a technophiles(技术狂热者) wonderland

311
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
Many of them are involved in war fighter performance

312
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,120
everything from sleep to

313
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,399
vaccines to making sure our guys

314
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
if they end up in a far away place and

315
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
get exposed to

316
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,720
unusual things that we can detect it

317
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,160
that we can actually make sure their

318
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,480
bodies are are capable of responding to

319
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
it in unique ways we are working with

320
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
operational biotech supporting our

321
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
troops in physical structures

322
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
Can we

323
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
create novel structures to as you land a

324
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
helicopter to decrease the dust in the

325
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,880
air using biologicals some nutrients

326
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,600
that coalesce(合并, 烧结的结) the sand underneath the

327
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
helicopter and keep dust down

328
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,279
can we create artificial reefs to both

329
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,320
land on and protect against global warming

330
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,519
Can we

331
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,800
make bricks

332
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,519
in faraway places without cement and

333
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,920
lower carbon footprints and creating

334
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
coalesce aggregate materials and low carbon ways

335
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,199
of doing this

336
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,000
each of these is a specific company and

337
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,279
a specific

338
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,519
embedded entrepreneur that we have

339
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,720
supported

340
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,079
In addition,

341
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,480
some things that your listeners may find

342
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,346
slightly odd.

343
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:28,880
We support individuals who are

344
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
bringing materials to

345
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
agricultural uses

346
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,320
in the conversion of materials that are

347
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
contaminated(被污染的) with such things as

348
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,240
mycotoxin(毒枝菌素) into

349
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,720
high quality ingredients(成分) by feeding

350
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
through insects(昆虫)

351
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,800
One company that has scored some of the

352
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,320
earliest successes with its

353
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,680
participation in EEI is Embody, a biotech

354
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
firm based in Norfolk, Virginia. In 2020

355
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
the company launched its FDA-approved

356
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
orthopedic(整形手术) surgery product called

357
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,720
Tapestry. Already in more than 200

358
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
patients, the technology is showing

359
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,639
promise for greatly improving the repair

360
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,639
of tendon(筋,腱) and ligament(韧带) injuries which

361
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,160
are common in both athletes and

362
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,105
warfighters.

363
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:10,560
Let me tell you about

364
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,160
Embody's, kind of, technological approach

365
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,079
That's Jeffrey Conroy, Embody's Chief

366
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,920
Executive Officer, which makes him the

367
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
company's number one storyteller.

368
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,440
He says the company's partnership with

369
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
DARPA began when it was selected in 2015

370
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
as a performer for the atoms to product

371
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,199
program a typically ambitious program in

372
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,706
the agency's Defense Sciences Office.

373
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:34,720
The program ran from 2015 to 2020 as the

374
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
program's name suggests it was all about

375
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,982
building things with atomic level fabrication control.

376
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,120
Here's how Conroy

377
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,040
explains the basic technology behind the

378
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,079
company's new orthopedic surgery product

379
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,639
When we were funded under the Atoms to

380
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,440
Products(A2P) program from DARPA it was

381
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,000
basically a molecular level additive

382
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
manufacturing program so we were

383
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
effectively funded to innovate in

384
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
manufacturing methods

385
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,320
using materials at the molecular level

386
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
to build structures.

387
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,639
In our case it just so happens that we

388
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,240
chose to use

389
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,639
a biologic molecule collagen(胶原蛋白) as our substrate(底物)

390
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
and develop a manufacturing method to

391
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
engineer(设计)

392
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,040
surgical implants that would cause your

393
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,920
own cells to grow new tendon and ligament tissue

394
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
over a surgical repair.

395
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
and so

396
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,639
We use clinical grade collagen.

397
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,967
We combine it with another polymer(聚合物)

398
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,959
we create a copolymer

399
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,519
in a benign solvent(良心溶剂) chemistry and then

400
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,160
we developed kind of a modified

401
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,320
electrospinning(电纺丝), pneumatic(气动) spinning(纺丝)

402
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
technology where we reinvented the

403
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,013
physical structure of the system

404
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:52,079
the solvent chemistry

405
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,320
the material science in terms of

406
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,954
everything we could have understood

407
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:57,120
in terms of

408
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,160
possible combinations of polymers and

409
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,880
collagen until we found the right

410
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,760
tunable characteristics to engineer

411
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,599
fibers that allowed us to build this

412
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,799
surgical implant that really mimics(模仿) the

413
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,280
native microarchitecture of your own

414
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,640
tendon tissue (肌腱组织)

415
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,160
and so we used manufacturing technology

416
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,679
and a biologic material and biomaterials

417
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,439
to engineer these structures which

418
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,919
harness your own body's power and your

419
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,840
own cells power to grow new tendon tissue.

420
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,080
In other words typical DARPA super cool

421
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559
technology helping companies prove an

422
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,960
audacious concept is what DARPA programs

423
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
like the Atoms to Product program are

424
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,649
all about.

425
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,280
But Conrad notes that small

426
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
companies like his not only have to

427
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
traverse(穿越) a technological valley of death

428
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,360
but to be fully successful a

429
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,120
translational and commercialization

430
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,576
valley of death as well

431
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:56,000
EEI was presented to us as an opportunity to get

432
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,080
an additional resource was the $250,000

433
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
that we were able to use to support the

434
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
hiring of a Chief Commercial Officer and

435
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,240
at a point in time 18 months before a

436
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,480
product launch where that person could

437
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,815
have a tremendous multiplier effect

438
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:13,847
in terms of

439
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:16,000
preparing to be commercial

440
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,740
building early relationships

441
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,913
building clinical relationships

442
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:23,080
building all of the framework

443
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,679
for commercial success that you don't think about.

444
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,679
customer service, how do we take orders

445
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,919
how do we, how do we do training, how do

446
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
we service and support customers

447
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,919
well beyond the positioning and the

448
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,320
differentiation what I can tell you is

449
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
that it turned into

450
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
one of the best decisions we made as a

451
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
team here in our six year history

452
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,000
because

453
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,280
we needed to refine the story we needed

454
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,440
to get our tentacles(触手) into the

455
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,760
marketplace. We needed to engage surgeons

456
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
earlier the result was not only was able

457
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
to bring seasoned executive Rob Brown

458
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
who's our Chief Commercial Officer, I was

459
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,960
able to recruit

460
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,000
a real high performance executive and at

461
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,679
the same time we were able to discover

462
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,640
new opportunities for a business

463
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
Now there are plenty of companies with

464
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
great ideas and an abundance(丰富) of science

465
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,000
and engineering talent but that still

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,520
lack the knowledge skill set and

467
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
relevant experience to get all of that

468
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
brilliance to the finish line whether

469
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
that be a new way to make missile fuel

470
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,919
or an autonomous naval vessel or in

471
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,400
Embody's case a new FDA-approved

472
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
biomaterial-based implant for in effect

473
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
getting damaged tendons and ligaments to

474
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
repair themselves.

475
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,120
Conroy says the boots on the ground, data

476
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,960
from surgeons and their patients since

477
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
the product's launch in late 2020 is

478
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,320
heartening(令人振奋的)

479
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,799
We've had a tremendous response after

480
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,160
launching the product at the end of 2020.

481
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,320
Now we've completed our first 200

482
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,520
patients we'll do just about 500

483
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,679
patients this year and

484
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,520
we're able to demonstrate that in 30 to

485
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,559
50 weeks our implant is gone and the

486
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,200
patient is left with new aligned

487
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
connective tissue and that is expressing

488
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,840
native collagen in place.

489
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
So we've created a mechanism to

490
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
stimulate

491
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,400
new natural tissue growth that thickens

492
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,960
a surgical repair and over time what we

493
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,200
hope to prove is that we've reduced the

494
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,760
patient's risk of re-injury and we've

495
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,120
accelerated the opportunity to return to

496
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,679
normal activity. That's kind of the the

497
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,520
background on the

498
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,919
technology that was funded by DARPA and

499
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,640
how we translated that investment

500
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,440
into producing FDA-regulated medical devices,

501
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,799
really for the benefit of sports medicine patients

502
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,400
Conroy credits his young company's

503
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
partnership with the Embedded

504
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Entrepreneurship Initiative as

505
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,919
accelerating the launch of Tapestry and

506
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,096
opening the way for other products

507
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:57,120
we came in contact with Kacy's EEI program

508
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,559
and

509
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,240
that office had a very clear mandate

510
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,320
from the start which was

511
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,120
okay, we're a funding mechanism we fund

512
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,159
moonshot technologies, we're great at that,

513
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
we are trying to look a little bit

514
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,679
closer to the market and understand what

515
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,360
else do these companies need to be able

516
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,400
to get commercial. So what what are the

517
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
indications of success early that will

518
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
lead to commercial translation.

519
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,320
and

520
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,600
EEI came out of research and engagement

521
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
that Kacy's office and Scott Cunningham

522
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,480
had had started

523
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,600
our early EEI work was

524
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
they helped us develop a very detailed

525
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,880
market model to understand what adoption

526
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
would look like what we could expect

527
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
what our pricing models might look like

528
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
what our revenue forecast might look

529
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,280
like, it was really detailed as as you

530
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,840
would expect from DARPA analytical tool

531
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
that is

532
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
eerily tracking reality as we get

533
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,440
commercial here so we're really happy

534
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
fundamentally for me DARPA has been

535
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,240
if not anything

536
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
one of the most important relationships

537
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,520
in the creation of this company

538
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
and that means that not only were they a

539
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,720
formative validating partner in the

540
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
technology and bringing a product

541
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,840
through FDA but they recognized that

542
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,080
okay now the next set of challenges are

543
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
commercial challenges. yes you've got to

544
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
have great tech but now you've got to

545
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,400
have market needs that are attainable(可达到的)

546
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
you've got to have markets that you can

547
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,799
1) get your fair share then figure out

548
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,960
how to get more than your fair share

549
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,679
and EEI specifically

550
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,640
helped us go from kind of a consultative

551
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
discussion where we got

552
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
input on forecasts and input on

553
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
commercial models

554
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
2) okay now we're willing to put some

555
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
resources directly into the company so

556
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
that you can augment your team with

557
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
skill sets you don't have

558
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
their skills that you need we're going

559
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,039
to enable them coming into the company

560
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,600
18 months or at least 12 months before

561
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
we would have been able to afford them

562
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,400
ourselves

563
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,679
and it was transformational it really

564
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,039
helped us create a framework for

565
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,155
external success

566
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,723
not just how do you hit a project milestone

567
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:20,375
but now how do you hit the hot buttons of your customer

568
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,640
and how do you start to generate the evidence

569
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
that's going to help you scale and

570
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,320
generate a long-term successful

571
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,480
sustainable business. So it's been uh

572
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,559
it's been a great experience to be a

573
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,200
part of it and I'm really thankful for

574
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
Kacy's team and

575
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
John Mayne and the Atoms to Products team

576
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
and everyone at DARPA.

577
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
Embody is just one of the earliest

578
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,520
adopters of the EEI model there are more

579
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,159
than 50 others and Gerst says the target

580
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,559
number of partner research teams by year

581
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,760
5 of EEI is 150.

582
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,520
She notes that the collective portfolio

583
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,200
of these technologies already is

584
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
reflecting the broad spectrum of

585
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,799
technology development that mothership

586
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,083
DARPA is known for.

587
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,080
We have software to

588
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,679
identify deep fakes, we have design tools

589
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,880
to increase the speed of designing

590
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
integrated circuits, we have Covid19

591
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
diagnostics medical devices,

592
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
quantum sensors,

593
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,880
so it covers a pretty broad area.

594
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,120
Another key metric that EEI values is

595
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
how much investor capital for EEI

596
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
partner companies the initiative is

597
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,600
helping to attract especially from U.S

598
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,566
investors rather than foreign ones

599
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:35,520
the biggest win for the program is that all

600
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,320
of the funding that we've helped these teams

601
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,600
raise a hundred percent has been with

602
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,159
U.S investors rather than foreign

603
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,720
investors and you know one of the main

604
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
challenges that the embedded

605
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,559
entrepreneurship initiative was stood up

606
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,880
to address was that

607
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,360
because of that valley of death because

608
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
we had a lot of teams standing up and giving

609
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,440
entirely technical pitches that didn't

610
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,039
garner(获得) any investor interest. There was a

611
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,640
lot of foreign interest and foreign

612
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,679
funding offers into those companies and

613
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,480
so our initial hypothesis(假说) was

614
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,600
hey if if we can help them build up a

615
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
compelling business plan, go to market

616
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,320
strategy, then they will be able to

617
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,422
attract U.S investment

618
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:27,520
And after the

619
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,720
first year of running the program -- we've

620
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,600
just concluded our first year -- we've

621
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,240
helped our EEI teams raise 20x

622
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,400
what the government has put in through

623
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
the EEI program

624
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,279
in all U.S funding

625
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,240
from U.S investors right now it's at

626
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,802
like 244 million dollars

627
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:51,520
but wait

628
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,720
there's more

629
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,440
as of the end of november EEI had helped

630
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
participant teams spin out more than a

631
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,840
dozen new companies stand up nine

632
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,400
manufacturing sites and close 17

633
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,240
development agreements with larger

634
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,600
companies

635
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Gerst knows DARPA too well to go on the

636
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,919
record saying that EEI itself will make

637
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,000
it past its own valley of death this

638
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,840
five-year experiment in which it has to

639
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,080
show it actually helps DARPA succeed in

640
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,440
its mission.

641
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
But DARPA is future oriented and

642
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
optimistic and so is Kacy

643
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,200
so I hope that when

644
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
our whole team the whole EEI founding

645
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,000
team when we look back

646
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,679
you know we're old and

647
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,440
we're looking back on our lives I hope

648
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,200
we can say

649
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,320
yeah

650
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,039
that made a huge difference and there

651
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,799
already are several

652
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,880
companies that have come out of this

653
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
where we can say

654
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,559
that wouldn't exist without this

655
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,919
resource

656
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,799
and what we did was really important

657
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,360
thinking through this new model or that

658
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,440
would probably exist but it would be

659
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,919
owned by one of our adversaries and now

660
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,760
it's it's based in the U.S

661
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,000
Thanks listeners for sharing this time

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,919
