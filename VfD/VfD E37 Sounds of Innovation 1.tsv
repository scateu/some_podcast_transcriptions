EDL	00:00:03,960	00:00:16,935	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Going to a science engineering laboratory , close your eyes and listen in a biomedical lab , you might hear an operation tribute as it separates the components of assembled in a chemical analysis lab . 
EDL	00:00:16,935	00:00:29,780	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	You might hear the wind of a turban pump as a evacuates , the chamber of a , in a missile proportion research facility , you may hear the aggressive white noise from a textbook of a new jet fuel in each setting . 
EDL	00:00:29,780	00:00:31,420	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	You can hear a sonic fingerprint . 
EDL	00:00:31,420	00:00:32,100	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	What goes on . 
EDL	00:00:33,200	00:00:37,590	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Welcome to a new periodic feature of our Voices from darker pipelines . 
EDL	00:00:37,590	00:00:39,580	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	We are calling it sounds of innovation . 
EDL	00:00:39,900	00:00:52,600	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	My name is , I have a matter on your dog host , rather than hearing the voices of program managers , which is normally what you get enough Voices from doctor parkers in each sounds of innovation episode , you will hear a few snippets of research escapes . 
EDL	00:00:52,600	00:00:58,814	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	They're part of jobless world and learn just a little bit about what new capabilities those songs could lead to . 
EDL	00:00:58,814	00:00:59,980	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Let's get right to. 
EDL	00:01:08,900	00:01:17,057	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	That's a signal with a set of towns just a tad above the highest piano generated by an underwater modem for sending and receiving data through water . 
EDL	00:01:17,057	00:01:32,180	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	This is the sort of communications and networking component that researchers in darkness , timely information for marijuana engagement program , timely for short , are working toward as they strive to realize a strategic framework known as music warfare . 
EDL	00:01:32,550	00:01:40,970	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Think you have many discribed military assets in the and on and under the ocean , as though there are music tiles of a logical hearing to picture . 
EDL	00:01:40,970	00:01:59,980	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Now think about dynamically integrating and reintegrating those towels into the most effective military action possible , and in any given situation and moment for that to become possible with assets across all military developments , including ones under water motors and signals like the one you just heard , probably will be part of the museum . 
EDL	00:02:01,170	00:02:03,190	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Brace yourself for the next sound of innovation. 
EDL	00:02:13,170	00:02:30,470	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	That intense white noise is coming from a new experimental bioscience eclipse of you made with the help of genetically engineer as a campus and creates thrust in the first of its kind ground test of a liquid fuel rampage at the weapons division of the neighborhood center in china . 
EDL	00:02:30,470	00:02:42,069	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Lake , california , in the mix of hydrocarbons in the fuel , which normally derived from petroleum , distributes not e sales , is just one of the many deliverables emerging from doctors living founders program . 
EDL	00:02:42,069	00:03:16,740	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	In this case , from the biotechnology emmas a performer on the program based in memory of california , notable here is a gallon for gallon , the spiral synthetic fuel , dubbed by amazon as bio renewable one packs energy comparable to jet fuel , JPten , the current go to synthetic for missile platforms like the thomas hawk , says an achiever program manager for the living founders program , biologically produced fuels can have advantages in costs and performance over comfortable synthetically produced and could be an additional source of military grade fuels during times of great demand . 
EDL	00:03:17,300	00:03:19,570	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Here's the sound of another kind of jet. 
EDL	00:03:38,110	00:03:43,548	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	What you just heard was a laboratory test of a drilled that relies on high pressure drafts of water . 
EDL	00:03:43,548	00:03:49,209	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	In this case , at one hundred and twenty five pounds per square range , jet out of another to cut through soil . 
EDL	00:03:49,209	00:04:10,230	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	The clip captures just a few seconds of the workers that researchers at the colorado school of mines are doing for their part in darkness under minor project , the goal of under miner is to develop new , new , two more than techniques and to adapt ones from oil and gas , utility , geological , environmental and other industries for quickly borrowing tunnels to open new technology . 
EDL	00:04:10,230	00:04:22,470	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Such a preposition in supplies in advance of military operation were providing ongoing resupply channels as troops move through an area , the ability to rapidly bore tunnels also could be helpful in rescue mission . 
EDL	00:04:22,870	00:04:28,020	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Here's a partial spoiler alert , the next sound of innovation is also from the other minor program. 
EDL	00:04:47,870	00:05:05,525	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	That sound clip was harvested by the engineering team from general electric , which is developing an earth warm , inspired tunnel , boring robot under contract with under minor program , rather than the size of saying toronto earth's warming your backyard , the robotic earthworm is six feet long and two inches wide . 
EDL	00:05:05,525	00:05:15,111	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	The robot snows will the boring tools penetrates earthly environments as a series water activated chambers mimicked the rising motion of an earthward . 
EDL	00:05:15,111	00:05:30,790	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	As a result , the system boats boards forward as the segments have come back and stable as the walls of the fresh brown , the sounds in the clip derives from inlet and exhaust files as they managed the water in fleeting and exhausting from the robots , bladder , like artificial muscles . 
EDL	00:05:31,300	00:05:34,040	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	The GEteam hopes to live over about account . 
EDL	00:05:34,040	00:05:39,390	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	They'll be able to borrow tonight more than five football fields in land in a time it takes to watch . 
EDL	00:05:40,040	00:05:44,690	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	Thanks for listening to this first episode of darkness , sounds of innovation series . 
EDL	00:05:45,280	00:06:00,733	| VfD E37 Sounds of Innovation 1 |	We will be posting more episodes in the series intimately as a feature of the boys is from darker parkers , thanks to benjamin for his partnership and producing this problem for more information about the programs , which sounds you just heard , as well as about other breaks of technologies .
