EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:26,944	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Because you will know most people men
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,456	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Where women
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:28,992	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Bolt with panic
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,808	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The instant you say something like the periodic

EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:33,088	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Helmets
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,160	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Yeah so so that actually goes back
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:36,928	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	2
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Elementary School
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,512	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Sitting down at the kitchen table in my house
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:41,536	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Growing up
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,072	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And my parents bought
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,840	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Chemistry
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:46,656	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Things I don't think you could probably buy today
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:49,216	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It wouldn't be in the store today I had literally had a rack
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:55,616	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	On it with all sorts of different chemicals a very dangerous chemicals that are probably don't even want to know what they were
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And it had experiments
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:02,272	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	From an early age my my mom specifically my parents both
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:03,040	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Sort of
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,576	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Just encouraged
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:06,112	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	This sort of
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,928	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Exploratory experimental nature and I just watched on.
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:15,328	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Then through High School sort of Oliver science that can really choose an end it was really solidified
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,864	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In my undergraduate
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:18,656	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Education at the College of Wooster
EDL	00:03:18,656	00:03:19,168	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Wooster Ohio
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:20,704	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Just
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:23,776	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Do you know there was something about chemistry and the way it was taught
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,824	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that department that really
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:26,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Just kind of
EDL	00:03:26,592	00:03:27,104	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Catalyzed
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Essentially the resting of
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,664	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The Graduate
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,176	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Career in post
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:36,832	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Tell me just a little bit about that dissertation project where you used to electrically conductive diamond
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,600	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Right
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:43,744	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So the the group I was in at Michigan state was really focused on
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:47,584	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Developing electrically conducting Diamond electrodes for variety of application
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,656	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And I was in the dissection of the lab that was working on Power and energy
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:56,288	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So we're actually trying to develop new and ultra-stable materials
EDL	00:03:56,288	00:03:56,800	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	4 fuel cells
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:02,176	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That really was both a project related to my love of chemistry but with a very practical app
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:02,944	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Application
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:05,504	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that was in need of the early 2000 where
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:08,320	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	There was a lot of work on fuel cell development in a lot of work
EDL	00:04:08,320	00:04:09,088	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Conservatory
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,368	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Alternative Energy continues today
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:15,232	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That was really the Genesis of their technology
EDL	00:04:15,232	00:04:18,815	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Mexico relies on fuels even something like hydrogen but maybe hydrocarbons
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	End
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,119	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Mine produces from that
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:24,703	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	At the electricity that's right that's right and I'm one of the one of the problems at the time was
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:29,311	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The stability of the electrodes and tells an electrons are what converts word of the
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,871	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The fuel if you all of the hydrogen atom and example
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,151	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Case 2 electron
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:33,663	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Electricity
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:36,223	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And we were trying to enhance acid
EDL	00:04:36,223	00:04:36,991	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To believe this materials
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:41,855	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Okay then be before you move on to your stencil Naval research laboratory and you just want to
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:44,159	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Confirm that you did not walk with any of those
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:46,463	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Diamond electrode you left him
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:50,303	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I left them unfortunately no they're not as beautiful as you might imagine
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:52,863	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	There are there decent films of
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:57,471	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Really sort of Greg utilitarian absolutely
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:00,287	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So tell me about Naval Research lab
EDL	00:05:00,287	00:05:03,359	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The reason I wanted a little bit about that is is because I actually work
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,407	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Four in a row for a while
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:07,455	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What tire to write a
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:13,599	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Institutional history for their 75th Anniversary so I got to know the place pretty well it didn't read me to see that you at work there
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:16,415	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Yes I work there
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:21,535	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I came right out of graduate school to postdoc at a naval research lab working with them Deborah wallison and Jeff Long
EDL	00:05:22,047	00:05:23,071	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:05:23,071	00:05:28,703	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	They worked on Power and energy related applications not with diamond but but with other electrode type
EDL	00:05:29,471	00:05:35,359	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And so I was essentially taking my interest in and sort of power and energy and alternative energy sources
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:38,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm to a group that had a long history of
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,783	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So I spent about two years they're working
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:44,575	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Actually I got to know.
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:50,975	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The funny thing also I work at Triple E S
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:54,303	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	As well the American Association for the advancement of science
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:56,863	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Where you from learned a thing or two about
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:58,399	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Science and Technology
EDL	00:05:58,399	00:05:59,679	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Policies that interesting
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:03,263	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Shifting away from from the lab and into this other
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:08,639	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Component of the whole science Enterprise yeah so I actually learn about the aaa's fellowship when I was in graduate school
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:15,551	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And it's you know it's a one-year potentially a two-year program if you if you renew for a second year
EDL	00:06:16,063	00:06:17,087	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Where
EDL	00:06:17,087	00:06:21,439	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Scientist and Engineers come to DC and either either serve on Capitol Hill and work work
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:24,767	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Four members of Congress or Congressional committee or working executive
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:29,119	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I meant I spent my time as a triple as fellow working at the national
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,655	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Science Foundation and that was my first
EDL	00:06:31,167	00:06:36,799	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Kind of Entry if you will into policy by the purse strings essentially
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:40,639	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	How do we serve change the scientific Endeavors by funding
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Specific areas
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:42,943	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Technology
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,223	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Queso
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:47,551	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm also realizing there is something weird about
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:54,463	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I guess both of rcb's because I'm swerving you now into your darpet experience and you know I've got DARPA
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,231	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	On my resume
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:58,559	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	As well I think this is for this is it I'm not going to mention it again but there are
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:07:01,887	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Parallel
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,447	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:09,055	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What is the Western experience you've started as a seed a contract worker
EDL	00:07:09,055	00:07:12,383	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And then you became a program manager in the defense
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:16,479	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Science is opposite talked about the early seed of phase
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,015	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And then how that
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,063	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Segwayed into
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,831	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Your program manager
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,111	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Yes it is
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,647	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's a really interesting
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,927	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Thread because
EDL	00:07:26,463	00:07:26,975	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Shapes
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:32,095	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What my interests are today all the all the way back to the first day that I worked
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,679	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So actually
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:39,519	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Heard about DARPA from a friend who worked for a company that had
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:41,567	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Cita contract here
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:47,455	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And while he didn't work at our but he said hey there's this opportunity is it something you'd be interested in this was right after
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,759	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Aaa's Fellowship was winding up
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:51,551	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And I
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,599	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I know that sounds pretty interesting and
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:55,391	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The opportunity was was
EDL	00:07:55,391	00:07:56,671	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Working with a mathematician
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,463	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The defenses off
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:07:58,975	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It's been man
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:07:59,999	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,047	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Ben was
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:06,911	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Is sort of a genius mathematician who wanted to surround himself by
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,935	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	People who
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,215	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	New other things
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Chemistry biology
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:11,519	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Physics those are
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,335	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The things in it so he was really looking for someone to come in
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,407	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm to provide a lens to chemistry
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,943	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's her if he could then
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:20,223	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Think about how to apply math
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:21,503	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In that space
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,783	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:27,647	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It was probably one of the scariest first days of my life but I just had to do it anyway
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,927	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It was an amazing offer
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:29,439	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Opportunity
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,999	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And really the sort of
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,815	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The math and the programs that that
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:35,839	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	He had going
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:39,423	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Still again as I as I mentioned her to impact my thought process
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:41,215	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What's the time in super guns I have today
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,983	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm have
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,799	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	AI components machine learning based components
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,847	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Complexity those are just things were
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:47,871	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Who sings that song
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:50,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Address for a fundamental level
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,967	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Many years ago when I started
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:56,575	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And I sort of weave through you know is as
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:09:00,671	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Is DARPA goes none of us are here for for all that long
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,975	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And so I'm worked for
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:06,047	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Material scientist in a chemistry to getting back a little bit closer
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,815	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	My roots
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:10,143	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But still being able to bring in those things I learned from Bandon from his
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,679	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Performers in the programs that he
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:19,615	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Right in just for listening to who might not know what how does for the basic structure here works is a program manager
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:24,735	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Who is in charge of a portfolio of programs we're going to talk about that in your case
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:28,831	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Soon but then each program manager has has one or several
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,111	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Sito's who
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:35,487	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Assistance so what what might be a typical role for a seat on a typical program
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,535	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Remind me what would say when it comes to
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:39,071	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	At working with
EDL	00:09:39,071	00:09:39,839	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Those
EDL	00:09:39,839	00:09:40,863	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Research groups
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:42,655	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To become part of the overall
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,167	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Program Everett
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:50,079	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Yes it really it really depends on on the program itself in the program manager but generally speaking
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:54,943	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You serve as you can cover the subject matter expert where you have your the person in the room with that
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,735	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Expertise in chemistry
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,831	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And when questions arise about for example how to apply mathematics
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:02,623	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Tucanes relay question
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,415	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You can think about well
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:09,279	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You know if I think about a material I think about some structural considerations of that material
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:12,607	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Those have Dimensions associated with them how that is that
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,655	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Could that be addressed by mathematics
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,167	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Michael design
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,191	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Formatear live
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:21,055	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So it's it's it's providing that subject matter expertise but then also
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:24,639	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	How do you bring that perspective of that field
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Into
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,711	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The program at hand
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:29,503	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Because it's always about her.
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:30,783	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Program is exploring
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:32,831	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And how various
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:36,927	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A disciplines in an and approaches can impact that
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,207	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So subject matter expertise
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,535	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Providing
EDL	00:10:41,535	00:10:47,423	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Assertive reviews of of literature and things like that and then some some help with sort of program strategy
EDL	00:10:47,423	00:10:47,935	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Shiso
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:51,775	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	DARPA programs are all about how you manage
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,311	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Them
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,871	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To function most efficiently and towards a
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:58,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Specific goal into that requires a team of people I think
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:10:59,711	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Really kind of
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:01,503	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Think through all the different ways
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,039	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	With which that
EDL	00:11:04,831	00:11:09,439	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It's a year-and-a-half when you became a p.m. a program manager
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:11,743	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Most
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:14,815	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	PM's end up managing just a few programs
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:17,887	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In their several positions but you are as we
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,983	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I think you've got seven perhaps even more than that
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,031	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Awesome inherited from
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:24,799	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Previous
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,567	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Another
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,591	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Program managers in
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,151	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Awesome that you've pitched and were able to get
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,687	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Approved through the hiring
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:31,455	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Vetting process
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,039	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We can't talk about all these in in-depth do I would really love to
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:41,951	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Let's just talk about a few and let's start with the make it program which I actually can tell you it was started by
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,999	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Former program manager here Tyler
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,791	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	McQuaid who
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:50,911	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I have a special fund this work because he was my first guest here on the Voices from DARPA podcast
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,959	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So you taking the Baton
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:56,031	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	221 D make it
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:58,079	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Program so tell us a little bit about
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,895	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What's the goal is and what the status is now
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:03,967	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The primary goal of the make it program is to
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:05,759	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Fully automate the synthesis
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:06,527	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of small molecule
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:13,695	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And what I mean by that is is we have a small molecule like Ibuprofen that might be some sort of pain medication or is
EDL	00:12:13,695	00:12:14,719	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Small molecule
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,047	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Energetic or a small molecule agrochemical there
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:22,655	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Chemicals are the building block materials for for what we have on it on a daily basis
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We need to
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,703	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To figure out how to make them
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:31,359	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So by and large right now that's a that's a by hand process an expert chemist we go into a lab and and mix things up in
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:33,919	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Beakers and test tubes in round bottom flask
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,967	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I really Define
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:38,015	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A route to a molecules that route is like a rat
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That you might have it
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,343	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The kitchen to bake a cake with a certain Tech
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:41,855	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Textron a certain fly
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,159	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And you don't know in advance
EDL	00:12:44,671	00:12:45,951	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What that route is
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:48,255	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So you go in and you test out there is steps
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,023	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To get to
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,047	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A particular Malik
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:54,399	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So molecule might take a five-step synthetic route which means I need to
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,959	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Go from set of starting materials
EDL	00:12:56,959	00:12:57,727	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And do
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:58,751	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Five different
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,031	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Experiments
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:00,799	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Five different
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,079	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Transformations if you will
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	How to get to the actual product
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:06,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It takes much longer than you might imagine in your head
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:11,551	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To design a route to molecule that that no one's done before it might take me
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,319	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	32426
EDL	00:13:13,087	00:13:13,599	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To do
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,159	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So what we're trying to do with make it is actually
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,951	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Provide
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,743	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Computational tools
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,767	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That can help us
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,791	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Define that route
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:23,327	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Through machine learning
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:25,119	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And then
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:25,887	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Build
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A device
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,447	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The Implement that route
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:29,983	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Completely hands-free
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:33,823	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And we are just need to stop you here with that machine learning as a
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,103	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Applied to chemical synthesis
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:40,223	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Which is very interesting sounding to me I mean if it sounds like you have to
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,295	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Gather a tremendous amount of some sort of
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:47,647	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Data from the chemical literature to feed to your machine
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:49,183	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So that it can pull out of that
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,743	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Likely series of steps
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:58,143	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That would work that I get that right that's absolutely right and there are there is existing
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:14:00,447	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Data from the last hundred years of
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:01,983	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of chemistry and what's in the literature
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:06,335	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But we actually are having to generate a lot of fun as well because his
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:07,615	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	As you might know
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:11,711	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The data that you need to train machine learning algorithms is both what
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:12,479	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Works
EDL	00:14:12,479	00:14:13,759	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Or the positive result
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:17,599	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And you also need what doesn't work and it turns out that scientists typically don't
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,135	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Publish what doesn't
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,695	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We might have it captured in our lab notebook
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:25,535	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But we don't publish that information and it's not available in database
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:28,351	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that's what you need so that your machine learning doesn't take you down a dead-end
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:33,215	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So that's right it needs to know what doesn't work and we've actually had to both
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:37,567	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So it's generate that computationally so we generate sort of negative results if you will
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,127	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We've also built a rapid screening platform
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:42,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That we can rapidly test
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,223	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Various reactions and we're collecting
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,991	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	All of the data
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:46,271	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	4
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,551	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The molecules that are made
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,111	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And then those molecules that aren't
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:53,951	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Homemade sodas reactions that don't work we want all of that information to then feed into
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:54,463	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Machine learning
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:57,023	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Then help us understand
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What's the best path
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A recipe to
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:04,191	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Quesadillas machine learning but also in this if I'm not mistaken
EDL	00:15:04,191	00:15:05,471	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It's machine
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:06,751	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Make it right so so
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:10,591	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	This whole thing is really automated your machine learning a saying
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:12,895	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Going to try these 10 different synthetic routes and then
EDL	00:15:12,895	00:15:19,295	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A bunch of gadgets are going ahead and doing it right right so we're trying to accelerate both that the brain is a chemist in terms of
EDL	00:15:19,295	00:15:23,647	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of having to sort through and sit through what route to use and what route
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,463	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The test and also then the implementation of that
EDL	00:15:26,975	00:15:27,487	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	On a device
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:30,047	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So that will be a fully automated
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,559	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Process
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:36,447	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And not only automated from the perspective of making one molecule but we want one device
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The commit
EDL	00:15:37,215	00:15:37,727	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Mini mall
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,007	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Nuts
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:41,311	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A pretty complex undertaking
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:44,639	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So as I Envision the whole system
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:50,015	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It's it's sort of making me think a little bit of sort of like a a molecular version of the
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:50,783	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Star Trek
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,343	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Replicator or something like that but where
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,135	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Maybe I would I would bring this make it
EDL	00:15:55,647	00:15:56,671	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Gadgetry
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,231	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Somewhere to a battlefield where
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:00,511	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I might need this or that
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:04,863	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Can you take us through an actual scenario let's say you're sick
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:05,631	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Successful with makeup
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:07,423	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You have these make it
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:09,215	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Do Technologies these gadgets
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:12,287	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Boxes that you can ship somewhere who might want that and what were they used for
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:17,919	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I think about this in instead of two main ways one is one is from the perspective of
EDL	00:16:17,919	00:16:22,527	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	If there are times where you might need to generate some
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,343	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Some medicine for example remotely in the field
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:28,671	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	This device would allow you to do that it would allow a non-expert to come up to the device
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:33,535	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And so you know I want medicine X and the device would then be able to
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:39,167	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Define the route to that medicine what is the most efficient route most cost-effective route the most environmentally friendly route
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,447	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Be able to make that medicine
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:47,359	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I also think about it from the perspective of a reproducibility and enabling synthesis
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:47,871	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	4
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:52,223	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Four fields for research tool for fields that don't
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Have synthetic X
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,575	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So for example in the field of molecular biology
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:59,135	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Perhaps they could have him make a device in their lab
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:00,671	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And generate
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,487	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Small amounts of chemicals that they might need in their research
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,559	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Without having to purchase sort of large
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:11,423	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Large products or in a products that aren't necessarily available commercially they be able to then use this
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,215	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To enable their research
EDL	00:17:14,495	00:17:16,031	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Interesting okay well
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:18,591	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Good luck with that with make it may you take it
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,871	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To the finish line
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:23,199	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I want to move to another program
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Which
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,527	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I find this absolutely fascinating molecular
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:28,319	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Informatics
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:32,671	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You know me we've also gotten familiar with the idea of thinking of DNA
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:35,999	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Deoxyribonucleic acid as an information can
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:36,511	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Containing molecules
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,303	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Contains genetic and
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,607	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Say it's sort of
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:41,375	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Has the
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,167	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The genetic or the molecular in
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,959	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Information blueprint of a of a person
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:48,799	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But you're you're taking this idea of molecular information to
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:51,103	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Entirely different
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:54,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'd rather audacious places so can you talk about
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:54,943	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Molecular
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:57,247	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Yeah sure so
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,039	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Looking for my taxes at kind of a
EDL	00:18:01,087	00:18:04,927	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Crazy instantiation of of really what would you do
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,487	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	If you could actually store data
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,047	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The physical form of a molecule
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:12,607	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So nature does that as you mentioned in DNA
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:15,935	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's that's how that's how we store information for genetic codes
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:22,591	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And then there is work going on to store actual Digital Data zeros and ones of our our digital world
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,127	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:26,175	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	DNA so DNA has these four building blocks
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:28,479	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And you can essentially
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:29,247	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Code
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,319	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The zeros and ones of our Digital Data into these four building blocks
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:37,951	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But when we started to think about this in in terms of of
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,767	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	How we could both accelerate
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:47,423	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Ultra dense data storage so that's the benefit that molecules provide is is it from a density person
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,191	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Effective
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:52,287	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You can store much more data in a very small physical form
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,871	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But also then as compared to say
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:19:01,759	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The transistor base magnetic memory things like that take memory yeah
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,831	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But then if
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:09,695	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	If you do that they're there their serve to threats or what is that nature uses for building block
EDL	00:19:09,695	00:19:10,719	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Box for molecule
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:11,487	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Ulta store
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,255	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Our
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:12,767	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Complex
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,559	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Instruct
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,327	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Options for life
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,631	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But there are millions of Malik
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,959	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Nny limit ourselves to those for
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:27,359	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So we started think about this from the perspective of if we could actually sort of address
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,895	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	An access
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:31,711	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The Richer palliative chemistry to store data
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:37,087	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What could that been enable from either a density perspective or a computational
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:40,927	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that's where we started to see this this mix between
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:42,463	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Storing data
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,023	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	An archiving it
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:45,535	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Which is which
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:52,447	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Time is really good with DNA right now you you write the data onto a DNA strand and you put it in the refrigerator and our climate
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:52,959	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Earlier
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,007	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But
EDL	00:19:55,007	00:19:58,335	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Could you actually use that information in the molecular
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,871	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Perform so could you compute
EDL	00:20:00,383	00:20:00,895	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	On
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,431	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That molecule
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:06,271	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	For some function so computations are like
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:10,111	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You know you might want to do an addition or multiplication or you might want to do
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:12,927	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm a search of a large dataset
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:15,743	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So a large image that do some sort of machine learning on that day
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:20,351	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And what molecules offer is
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:21,887	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Not only
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,679	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The ability to store
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:26,239	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Data in a very very dense way
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,775	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But also
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,055	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Very highly parallel
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,359	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And what I mean by that is
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:35,455	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Chemical reactions happen
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,479	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Relatively
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:38,271	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Quickly and
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,039	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	They happen
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:41,855	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Essentially simultaneously
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:43,647	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So if you have a beaker full of molecules
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:46,975	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You'll have multiple reaction pads all happening at the same time
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:51,583	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	As opposed to the sort of Serial processing or one right after the other process
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,863	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Something that we might think about
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,191	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Are there particular kinds of
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,983	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Problems where
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:21:00,287	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	This molecular computation
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,823	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Would be better than then
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,591	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What kind of convention
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,383	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's exactly what we're exploring
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:07,711	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You know we have hypotheses about where that might be true
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,783	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We have some approaches that are looking at things like
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,063	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Similarity search
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:14,623	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Trey very large set of images
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,391	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,440	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Can I find all of the images that have a red shirt
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,976	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Can I do that much money
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,488	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Faster
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:20,768	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In a convention
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:21,536	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The computer might be
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,304	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Able to do it
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:25,632	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We're looking at problems in involving signal processing
EDL	00:21:26,144	00:21:31,776	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And optimization so so how can you optimize a response how can you get sword of the best
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,056	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Function from that room
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:34,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:36,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What we're really looking at is is
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,176	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Can molecules able
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,944	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Us to do things like
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:39,968	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Faster
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:42,528	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And or can they enable us
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:44,832	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To do sort of a computation
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,344	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:48,672	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A conventional computer that sits on your desktop would not be able to
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,256	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I just want to drilling on one part of this
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:54,560	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To see if you can help me understand say how
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,376	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Hey the result of a chemical reaction
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,144	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm saying this
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:58,912	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Molecular
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,424	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Computation
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,984	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Camille corresponds to a
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,264	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Redshirt in an image where
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,568	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	How does that
EDL	00:22:05,568	00:22:06,336	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Molecule
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:07,616	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Map
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:08,128	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To the
EDL	00:22:08,640	00:22:11,456	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So that depends on how you encode the
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:15,808	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'll give you a an example that's kind of easy to Grass will go back to DNA for
EDL	00:22:16,576	00:22:19,136	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Two DNA again has these these four base pairs
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:21,184	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And we put them together in a string
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:24,000	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that string
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We can then
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,608	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	With that string in the code that we use for that string weather it
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:32,448	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Actg or gcta whatever we design
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:33,728	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Code
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:34,752	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	For a red shirt
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:36,544	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We could actually
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,056	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Then
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,360	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Synthesizes DNA strand
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:43,200	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	An image that has a red shirt in it will have that red shirt
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:43,712	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Code
EDL	00:22:44,224	00:22:47,040	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So in some if I have a string of 100
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:48,832	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of these A T C and G
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,928	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The code for that red shirt will be embedded within that
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:56,256	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And we'd actually search for that very quickly from within a molecular
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,024	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Way
EDL	00:22:57,024	00:23:01,632	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And and with DNA we might do that with some complementary strand so
EDL	00:23:01,632	00:23:06,752	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	If folks understand that that DNA has is assertive a double-stranded process
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,032	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We're working in
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,104	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Encoding on the encoding and data storage side
EDL	00:23:11,616	00:23:12,128	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Single strand
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:15,200	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So we can use that that sort of base pairing
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:19,040	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm phenomenon that that nature uses and DNA
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:21,088	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To then how do we reach in
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:22,112	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To that
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:26,464	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Liquid stew of of data and then only pluck out
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:28,000	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Those strands that have
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,024	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That code
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:29,792	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	For a red shirt
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:35,168	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That sounds absolutely amazing one thing that I think would be interesting to maybe
EDL	00:23:35,168	00:23:35,680	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Try to give
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:37,984	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Listen to sense of is just
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:39,520	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	How dense
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:43,104	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The storage can be I mean you know sometimes you hear
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:44,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	People talking about
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:48,224	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Storing the entire contents of the Library of Congress
EDL	00:23:48,224	00:23:50,016	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And something the size of a sugar
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,296	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Cube like the Library of Congress
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:53,344	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Become a and information unit
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,136	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So when you talk about
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:58,208	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	DNA as storage, how much
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:00,000	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Say I mean this might be difficult
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:02,048	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But in in DNA that could
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:03,840	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Packages sugar cube
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:05,632	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	How much would that be
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:06,400	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,448	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Wouldn't one of the best kind of
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:14,336	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Images I can provide as if you took all of the data that have been generated in the history of
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:14,848	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Time
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,384	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Up until like
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,408	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	2015 or 26
EDL	00:24:18,688	00:24:19,712	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	If you swear that in DNA
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:23,808	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You could pack all of that into something besides NSU
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:26,112	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Absolute Style
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:31,232	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Tiptoe to put an exclamation point on that what we're trying to do a molecular for Maddox is
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,512	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Is
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:37,632	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Provide sort of practical DNA storage solutions that we can compute on as I mentioned but then
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,936	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Access that broader
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:42,752	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Pallet of molecules which might provide
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:43,776	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Even higher.
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,824	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Right on that case
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:51,200	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Biological evolution leads to DNA with these four building blocks acting
EDL	00:24:51,200	00:24:52,992	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But that doesn't mean we have to stop there
EDL	00:24:52,992	00:24:54,016	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Our purposes is
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:54,784	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Or something else
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:55,296	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Alligator storage
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,576	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You might have
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:57,856	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Additional building block
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,392	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Boxer wants a different different functions
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:04,256	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's right that's right in it allows us a lot more flexibility in our in our designs
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:06,048	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We think a lot at DARPA about
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:08,096	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Not only developing and a blanket
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:11,936	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Abilities but thinking about the ultimate source of scalability and implementation of those
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:18,080	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	DSO really is looking at things that we might actually realize in 10 20 30 years
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,360	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But we always have that in mind
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Different science
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:21,920	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's right
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:28,064	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Let's just touch on two of your other programs just briefly
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:31,648	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	One of them ACDC that stands for agnostic
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,184	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Compact
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:34,464	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Demilitarization
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:38,304	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of chemical agents in that just sounds like a great idea
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Yeah it's it
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,352	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It's a wonderful and Nessa
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:40,864	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Necessary
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,400	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:47,776	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So is a CDC program is is designed to make
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,312	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Transportable
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:52,128	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Devices that can destroy chemical warfare
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:55,968	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So really we're headed with this is actually
EDL	00:25:55,968	00:25:57,504	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Building a device that is
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:03,648	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Almost a conventional diesel engines if you imagine a diesel engine and what we're going to be doing with this diesel engine is using
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:05,184	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The chemical warfare agents
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:05,952	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	As a fuel
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:08,256	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So just like his you would burn diesel fuel
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,024	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In an engine
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:11,072	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We're burning chemical warfare agent
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,864	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And destroying it in the process
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:16,448	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So we can produce energy from this engine
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:18,240	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But we are also then destroying chemical
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:21,824	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm an ultimately what we're building is
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The Prototype
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,616	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It's a pickup truck
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:27,200	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	With an engine in the front that in this pickup truck can drive to a site
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:28,992	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Run
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,808	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Off of the chemical warfare agent destroy chemical warfare agent
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,320	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And then we can drive
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:35,904	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Swords to plowshares
EDL	00:26:36,416	00:26:36,928	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Thanks
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:44,352	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Okay may you actually succeed in a nephew you've tested this a few times right now
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:46,656	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Developing rebuilding the full system develop
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:53,568	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Okay the last of your many programs that we will talk about right now is
EDL	00:26:53,568	00:26:56,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Scout just because I mentioned it earlier in the intro that stands for
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:58,176	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Spectral Combs
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,456	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Ultraviolet
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:00,736	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	2 terahertz
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:05,856	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And we're not talking about here. Comes that we use to make our hair look nice right this is something else
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:06,624	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's right
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:09,952	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Scout is is focused on
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:12,512	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Developing compact sources for spectroscopy
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,560	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Spectroscopy is essentially a chemical measured
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,352	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of of
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,120	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Varispeed
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:18,656	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	She's so if we want to know
EDL	00:27:19,168	00:27:22,752	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What species are present in the air that were breathing we might use spectroscopy to five
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,544	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:26,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Tell was really designed to take
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,640	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A capability that have been developed that
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:30,176	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Single wavelength
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:34,272	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And expanded all the way from ultraviolet to Terre Haute
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:37,088	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Hertz as you mentioned in the reason that you want to do that is because
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:38,624	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Molecules behave differently
EDL	00:27:38,624	00:27:39,648	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	When they're
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:41,440	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Energize if you will with light
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:43,488	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In the UV regime than they do in the terror
EDL	00:27:44,512	00:27:46,304	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm in different systems respond to phone
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:50,144	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Aliso movies is very good for interrogating biological
EDL	00:27:50,912	00:27:55,264	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Where is terahertz might be really good for really complex mixtures like breath an hour
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,336	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So people are very interested in using terahertz
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:00,384	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Before for those compass
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:02,944	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Interstellar
EDL	00:28:02,944	00:28:07,296	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Had to have two threads one is to develop the materials to miniaturize
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:11,136	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Very sort of high-fidelity sources
EDL	00:28:11,136	00:28:12,672	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	For spectroscopy
EDL	00:28:12,672	00:28:15,744	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Across the UV de Terror
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's right
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,560	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To use for the sort of spectroscopic apus
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:19,328	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Application
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:24,704	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And the other was to actually demonstrate let's say that we can build these things in the laboratory
EDL	00:28:25,216	00:28:27,008	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What can we actually do with them then in the field
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:28,544	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What we've shown is that
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That Scout offers the ability to do
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:34,432	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Things much much
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:35,712	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Faster than conventional
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,224	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Systems
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,552	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So I can take a spectrum
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:43,392	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In a matter of milliseconds where it might have taken me minutes
EDL	00:28:43,392	00:28:44,160	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To do before
EDL	00:28:44,672	00:28:49,792	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that's very important when you when you have something that that is a matter of whether or not you want to know that there's been
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:52,352	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Chemical attack for example you want to know as fast
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:54,912	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Possible and you want to know exactly what that
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:55,680	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Agent was
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:56,960	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm just kind of
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:58,240	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Tool can tell you
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And also we've been able to show that we can do
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,408	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The spectroscopy over a large distance
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:08,224	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So, am I
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,504	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Link the distance
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:12,576	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Which is really important to monitor larger areas
EDL	00:29:13,344	00:29:16,672	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And this might have implications in the oil and gas industry for gas leak
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:17,440	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Example
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,792	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Also for air quality monitoring across the city there are a number of different Factor
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:22,816	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You could think about
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,864	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm in these are all I safe
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:27,680	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So so we don't have to worry about safety challenges
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:31,520	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And we're really looking to find out how we might apply
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:32,800	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	This
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,336	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Spectroscopic method
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:37,152	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In a in a DVD and then outside DVD
EDL	00:29:37,664	00:29:39,712	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Why didn't you just mention along the way
EDL	00:29:39,712	00:29:44,576	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Even breath analysis that that begins to sound like a biomedical application cuz I know there has been research
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:46,112	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Indicating that
EDL	00:29:46,112	00:29:50,208	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	There can be in a really subtle signs in the in the sort of the chemistry of Ativan
EDL	00:29:50,208	00:29:52,768	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Exhalation right back in the be indicative of
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:30:00,192	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Play some kind of disease and really what you're getting in something like breath analysis or any other biological or complex
EDL	00:30:00,192	00:30:03,776	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	System generally as you getting a lot of chemical a lot of signals
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,824	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That might change
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:09,408	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Frequently or overtime in the concentrations might be very very low
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:12,224	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To developing a technique that can can do both
EDL	00:30:12,736	00:30:16,064	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm deal with that the complexity of of the number of different
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:21,440	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Analytes if you have the number different things in that sample and also do it very quickly and distinguish them from each other is really
EDL	00:30:22,208	00:30:24,000	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Okay then just finally on that for that word
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:25,280	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Home
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:30,912	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I take it it's because if you were to look at the distribution of wavelengths
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,984	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Insertive represent each one of those is a line
EDL	00:30:34,496	00:30:35,776	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Then
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:38,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	There's many lines in a way look like the tines of a comb
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:43,200	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's right that's exactly right suit so you get a light source that provides
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:44,224	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Many wavelengths
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:44,992	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	All at once
EDL	00:30:45,504	00:30:46,528	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But they have a very
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:48,576	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Find spectral resolution
EDL	00:30:48,576	00:30:49,856	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Which is really important
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:50,880	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Again for the surf
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:51,648	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Complex apart
EDL	00:30:51,648	00:30:52,160	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Dealing with
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:59,328	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Okay so we we've kind of touched on four of your programs and I but we will will have to leave the other one
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:00,096	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	4
EDL	00:31:00,096	00:31:01,632	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Another time Although our
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,216	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Westerners can always go to the DARPA website and find out more about those
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:08,032	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So you been a program manager for about a year-and-a-half
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:10,592	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that that means that you
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:11,616	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You're probably only have
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:13,152	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Have a couple more years to go that's typical
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:16,992	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm just wondering if you imagine
EDL	00:31:16,992	00:31:17,760	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Back
EDL	00:31:17,760	00:31:20,064	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	2 your time here at DARPA but from a vantage
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:22,112	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of 10 years from now
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:24,160	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And you've examined what has
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:25,440	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Come of your work
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,208	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Computer program
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:26,720	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Save
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:28,000	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Scouter make
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:31,328	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What do you hope you will be able to say at that time
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:33,120	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Well
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,936	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I really you no looking back
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:40,032	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We spend a lot of time here and I'm spending a lot of time thinking about
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:46,176	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Where might these things go and that's a lot of what what DARPA does is build relationships with other organizations
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:48,992	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Transition the technologies that would that we develop and so
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:53,344	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I already see seeds toot-toot to what that answer might be
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:57,184	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	There's some projects I have where it's going to be continued scientific Kentucky
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,976	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Call development a lot of knowledge generated
EDL	00:31:59,488	00:32:00,768	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And it might be
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:05,120	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You're 20 to 30 years before anybody sees anything and it might not look anything like it does
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:07,424	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Today I think for four program like
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:09,984	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Like make it we might actually see these two
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,032	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Systems and we might actually see some
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:15,104	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Some generation of the systems that we're building now
EDL	00:32:15,104	00:32:15,872	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	As a first generation
EDL	00:32:16,640	00:32:17,408	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	As commercial device
EDL	00:32:18,176	00:32:19,456	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We might see some seeds
EDL	00:32:20,480	00:32:21,504	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Industry
EDL	00:32:21,504	00:32:24,064	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Enter the chemical production industry
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:25,600	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Using some of the
EDL	00:32:25,600	00:32:26,112	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The computational
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:27,136	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That we're developing
EDL	00:32:27,904	00:32:28,672	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I think
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:30,976	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Programs like make it in ACDC
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,536	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I can see a very practical through field adapt
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,048	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Application
EDL	00:32:34,560	00:32:37,120	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And more Partners like molecular informatics I think it's
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:37,888	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We're just
EDL	00:32:37,888	00:32:39,168	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	At the Forefront of the
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:39,936	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Fining
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,472	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	What are the questions we should be asking
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:45,568	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To really begin to understand the opportunity for molecules
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:46,336	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In
EDL	00:32:46,336	00:32:46,848	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And something like
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:50,944	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Write an as I game this at myself if I try to be you for a minute
EDL	00:32:52,224	00:32:54,784	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	If I knew say 10 years from now.
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:57,088	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	AC DC technology that I work
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:01,184	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Help to decontaminate tons and tons and tons
EDL	00:33:01,952	00:33:03,488	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Very dangerous
EDL	00:33:03,488	00:33:05,024	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Chemical warfare agents
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:11,424	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Well I mean I would feel like I have something in my life I have to say even even even being it.
EDL	00:33:11,424	00:33:15,008	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	On a daily basis is humbling experience but then
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:16,544	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You know seeing something
EDL	00:33:17,056	00:33:20,384	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That that you're working on and they are performers are working really hard to
EDL	00:33:20,384	00:33:20,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To develop
EDL	00:33:21,920	00:33:23,200	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Become
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:24,480	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Used
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:26,016	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In either the deity or a broader
EDL	00:33:26,528	00:33:27,296	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Contacts
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:28,064	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Will be incredible
EDL	00:33:28,832	00:33:32,672	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	All right and then that's what we're getting toward the end here but I did just want to touch back on
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:36,512	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	An interest of yours that you express way back when you were
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:37,536	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Graduate student
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:38,816	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	When you were
EDL	00:33:39,328	00:33:43,168	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You're a woman entering the world of science and and
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:44,448	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You know in what
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:46,240	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Tradition has been in a male-dominated
EDL	00:33:46,240	00:33:47,008	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Kind of world
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:50,336	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But going further not just getting through that yourself but also
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:54,688	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So trying to inspire young women and girls to do the same so the Girl Scout
EDL	00:33:54,688	00:34:00,832	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Interest patch in chemistry a little bit about that particular experience and then if you've actually continued
EDL	00:34:01,344	00:34:02,368	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That kind of Interest
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:07,488	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Even in your late on your career really started
EDL	00:34:07,488	00:34:09,024	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	In in college
EDL	00:34:09,024	00:34:11,584	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	College and graduate so I was actually part
EDL	00:34:11,584	00:34:13,888	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And held leadership roles in an organization
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,424	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	My undergraduate and graduate
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,448	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Tutions
EDL	00:34:16,960	00:34:18,752	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That we're really geared towards
EDL	00:34:20,544	00:34:21,312	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Assertive women science
EDL	00:34:22,080	00:34:22,848	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:24,640	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We did Outreach
EDL	00:34:24,640	00:34:31,040	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Sit tight tight two young girls and and worked at science fairs and things like that but we also then work Community for each other
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:32,576	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Weather and the faculty at RNC
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:34,624	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It's not it wasn't something Limited
EDL	00:34:34,624	00:34:35,136	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	2 to a student
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:37,696	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I might sort of crosses
EDL	00:34:37,696	00:34:38,976	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Alter professional level
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:40,768	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,792	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I learned a lot
EDL	00:34:41,792	00:34:45,120	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Through a lot of those conversations about explicit bias
EDL	00:34:45,120	00:34:47,424	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Implicit bias and all sorts of
EDL	00:34:47,424	00:34:49,216	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of quitting reasons
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:49,984	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	You know
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,008	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That
EDL	00:34:51,008	00:34:53,568	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That there is an underrepresentation of
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:55,616	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Of both women and other
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:56,128	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Under represent
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:35:02,016	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But for me it was about finding the answer for the reason it was about empowering
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:02,528	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Those around me
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:05,856	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And and that happened it at that level at
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:09,440	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	It still happens today but I think I do it a little bit more
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:14,048	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Organically now as opposed to being involved in an organization's it's much more about mentoring
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:18,400	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And trying to fill a hole of that other women might have in terms of
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,216	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Having a circle of
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:24,288	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The people around them men and women to help Mentor them
EDL	00:35:24,288	00:35:25,312	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And grow their careers
EDL	00:35:25,824	00:35:29,408	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And that's one thing that that I do try to focus on
EDL	00:35:29,408	00:35:32,224	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And also then again make sure that I have that in my
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:34,272	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Life is wild because it's important for everyone
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:36,320	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Play to make sure that they build this relation
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,600	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	For folks
EDL	00:35:37,600	00:35:38,112	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Books to help
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,392	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And learning
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,696	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Okay so what
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:43,488	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	We were actually at a time
EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:47,072	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	But I just wanted to ask you if there's anything about science
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:49,376	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	DARPA your career as a chemist
EDL	00:35:49,888	00:35:51,936	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	So it was anything else you just didn't come up that would be adventurous
EDL	00:35:53,216	00:35:55,264	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Well you didn't ask me it how fun this way
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:36:02,688	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Well tell me how fun is it this this being being the podcast but also
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:04,224	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Life in general it at DARPA
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:06,528	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And I say that because
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,832	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Get to interact with
EDL	00:36:09,856	00:36:11,904	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Amazing top-notch scientist
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:12,672	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Json
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,184	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	A daily base
EDL	00:36:13,696	00:36:15,232	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Multiple times a day
EDL	00:36:15,744	00:36:19,584	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	That's a really exciting and it's a really fun it's amazing opportunity
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:22,656	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And those are the folks that are doing that the
EDL	00:36:22,656	00:36:23,936	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	The hard work to implement
EDL	00:36:23,936	00:36:25,472	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	All of the ideas that we might
EDL	00:36:25,472	00:36:25,984	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Generate
EDL	00:36:26,752	00:36:28,288	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	I'm really put them to practice
EDL	00:36:28,288	00:36:32,896	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	Snn again from another perspective of coming to work every day and being humbled by that
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:36,736	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	And being so excited and energized by what they have
EDL	00:36:36,736	00:36:38,528	| Episode 22 The Chemquistador |	To bring in terms of their ideas and
