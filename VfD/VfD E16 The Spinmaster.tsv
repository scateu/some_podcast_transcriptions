EDL	00:00:11,800	00:00:17,760	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Step of technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand , are totally missed. 
EDL	00:00:19,980	00:00:31,860	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defense advanced research projects has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:32,510	00:00:40,750	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:41,310	00:00:42,710	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	My name is ivan a motto . 
EDL	00:00:42,710	00:00:44,740	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And I am you double host today . 
EDL	00:00:44,740	00:00:51,830	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I am pleased with me in the studio , rosa , a hundred workers known as alive by her friends and colleagues . 
EDL	00:00:51,830	00:01:14,269	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Alan has been a program manager since early twenty seventeen in darkness , defense science office , where program managers take some of the deepest types in the fundamental in search of new foundations for novel technologies , relevant to national security allies , deep dive into fundamental science goes all of the way to electrons in some of the more unusual they can organize and behaviour and certain materials . 
EDL	00:01:14,269	00:01:29,347	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And how might be useful to engineer those electronic organizations into new microelectrodes and micromagnetic devices for applications in memory , logic , energy conversion and sensors prior to arriving a dark early was a professor of physics at the college . 
EDL	00:01:29,347	00:01:37,030	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	William and marine williams burger in before that , she was a member of the physics faculty at the university of the little in ohio . 
EDL	00:01:37,030	00:01:57,880	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And yet earlier in her career , she was a research scientist at the argentine national atomic CNEAin venezuela's argentina after finishing her early college training at the university , witnesses ali earned her doctorate in physics from wayne state university and retried michigan , and she completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the university of michigan and albert , I like . 
EDL	00:01:57,880	00:01:59,720	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Thanks for joining me in the today. 
EDL	00:02:00,470	00:02:01,640	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I'm happy to be here . 
EDL	00:02:01,640	00:02:02,440	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Thank you. 
EDL	00:02:02,440	00:02:07,480	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So let's start out by talking about how you became interested in science and general . 
EDL	00:02:07,480	00:02:11,540	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And then in particularly in physics , and the empty of electrons. 
EDL	00:02:12,030	00:02:28,300	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	When I guess that , you know me , I started being interested because my father would read to me articles that he was interested in in a magazine that he was getting delivered at home at the time in one of the sidelines , he was getting , some of which was a french man getting involved later . 
EDL	00:02:28,300	00:02:30,290	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Discoveries and developments . 
EDL	00:02:30,290	00:02:35,460	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And he was reading this to me when I was like seven or eight years old , so I mean , it was a very early start . 
EDL	00:02:35,460	00:02:37,390	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So that was the beginning . 
EDL	00:02:37,390	00:02:45,560	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And then , well , clearly , a minimum science has always been a billion to me , and we were getting additional languages inside home . 
EDL	00:02:45,560	00:02:48,170	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You know , that I was very obviously . 
EDL	00:02:48,170	00:02:56,070	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I remember reading once about shredding globalization , and even though I was like they really live in the top , and I didn't know what you mean . 
EDL	00:02:56,070	00:02:56,410	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I knew how. 
EDL	00:02:56,410	00:03:05,655	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	The shrinks , the question you were , you were reading all about the deeper , because parts of economic economics of uncertainty makes me think that your parents were signed , strange and so. 
EDL	00:03:05,655	00:03:12,105	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Father was a doctor in engineering , so but yeah , clearly , I mean , I was reading in this magazine . 
EDL	00:03:12,105	00:03:23,700	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I said in a minute , didn't understand what it question men I was staying , but I still was able to write it , you know , to draw it if you wish , I was able to draw a disagree with a paper . 
EDL	00:03:24,060	00:03:30,620	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And to this day , I remembered it from that day , I was very fascinated by decent , clearly , well , given us a stand went by . 
EDL	00:03:30,950	00:03:35,160	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I was greeted my head that I was going to go for a career in science . 
EDL	00:03:35,160	00:03:38,550	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I didn't know exactly what I speak to science shortly . 
EDL	00:03:38,550	00:03:48,980	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But surely , you know , myanmar began very , very interested in the electronic properties of materials and trust went from their own words right now. 
EDL	00:03:48,980	00:03:49,350	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	right ? 
EDL	00:03:49,350	00:03:53,200	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So the first part of your career you ended up going in an academic direction . 
EDL	00:03:53,200	00:03:56,510	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You became a professor at william and mary . 
EDL	00:03:56,510	00:03:59,410	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So talk me a little bit about the experience as a professor . 
EDL	00:03:59,410	00:04:02,890	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And I wanna hear you are , how did you get to dark story ? 
EDL	00:04:02,890	00:04:04,190	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So start with the university. 
EDL	00:04:04,190	00:04:18,037	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Okay , so I mean , I have been fascinated by the fact that , you know , me is not about what we are doing is like , you know , where's the spaces , we have to realize that our part resides on the fact that we transfer our knowledge is not . 
EDL	00:04:18,037	00:04:22,782	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Our individual knowledge is in knowledge from every generation before us . 
EDL	00:04:22,782	00:04:28,452	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Any disabled duty in my mind to buy this along to the next generation , where part of right ? 
EDL	00:04:28,452	00:04:51,217	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct , correct , so i've been always interested in in being a professional for that same reason , because I wanted to to be able to identify and students that internet , that capacity they've tried to go for scientific research and to try to amend them and help them be the best they could be so that they can , you know , that is no lesson that particular area ever more . 
EDL	00:04:51,217	00:05:04,063	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So that's why I went for the candy , of course , you know , when you're going to get the email , one of the things that you need to do in order to be able to to carry out this mother left trying to train grade students , you have to get funding . 
EDL	00:05:04,063	00:05:08,769	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so clearly , I mean , I had to explore all the fountain agencies among them . 
EDL	00:05:08,769	00:05:11,730	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I export our bye and gotten funding from the orbit . 
EDL	00:05:11,730	00:05:14,210	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And eventually you want to cannot learn . 
EDL	00:05:14,210	00:05:18,610	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Okay , what does it take the other side right to understand ? 
EDL	00:05:18,610	00:05:23,020	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	How do you know , select the best people to do best ? 
EDL	00:05:23,020	00:05:28,228	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	How is this process being proceeds from the viewpoint of the funding agency ? 
EDL	00:05:28,228	00:05:36,660	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So it was particularly intrigued by dark , but because I say , said it was happening by funded by the park in the beginning . 
EDL	00:05:37,420	00:05:44,140	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	This model of trying to find basic science that has a goal and ultimate goal was really very appealing to me. 
EDL	00:05:44,140	00:05:53,522	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Can I just ask your question of that dark in particular , because of as someone in academia , you might have gone to nationalistic to support , you might have gone to national science foundation . 
EDL	00:05:53,522	00:05:54,460	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What about that world? 
EDL	00:05:54,460	00:05:55,602	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	They're doing there . 
EDL	00:05:55,602	00:05:58,837	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	There are several parts to this particular question of me . 
EDL	00:05:58,837	00:06:14,501	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	On the one hand , you know , as a senior american , not by birth , but by choice , you know , I have a deep love for this country , the evaluation for this country , in , and a sense of duty regarding , you know , trying to help this country to continue be what it is right now . 
EDL	00:06:14,501	00:06:24,680	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And the best way my opinion is to try to see , okay , what are the needs of the people that are they far from difficult from difficulties that will be defended , the armed forces in general , right ? 
EDL	00:06:24,680	00:06:37,932	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Is it what is that is going to make that difference in terms of university and technology of analysis and research that can help this dismission , and clearly the advice at the first front of all of these funding agencies and that particular direction . 
EDL	00:06:37,932	00:06:45,750	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So I was very , very intrigued and cute years and interested in the impact of this particular organization for that reason. 
EDL	00:06:45,750	00:06:48,190	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So did you reach out only two ? 
EDL	00:06:48,190	00:06:51,690	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Darpa , was there somebody here that knew about you ? 
EDL	00:06:51,690	00:06:52,600	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What was the ? 
EDL	00:06:52,600	00:06:58,180	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Those were the final steps that got you onto the ruster programme managers? 
EDL	00:06:58,180	00:07:02,839	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I had the collaboration with store wolf , who was at a time when I was a william and murray . 
EDL	00:07:02,839	00:07:07,572	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	He was at the university of a junior , and he was leading the newspaper in the newspaper . 
EDL	00:07:07,572	00:07:14,040	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And and and I took it up on myself to actually introduce my research to him to try to study collaborative effort . 
EDL	00:07:14,040	00:07:18,930	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And index did happen , and we actually got a couple of british is going . 
EDL	00:07:18,930	00:07:23,100	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so eventually , what , of course , I knew that he had been a doubtful manager in the past . 
EDL	00:07:23,430	00:07:34,780	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So I mentioned him that that I was interested in , like , you know , seeing the others side of the fourth is so he actually told me what we don't give me your CV, and I will buy it alone . 
EDL	00:07:34,780	00:07:41,180	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And particularly he told me that he was going to show it the symphony dominance , which was set up down the director of the. 
EDL	00:07:41,180	00:07:44,424	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And there are some meaning defense , like software . 
EDL	00:07:44,424	00:07:46,670	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Six , a technical officers are. 
EDL	00:07:46,670	00:07:48,448	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct and the russian history of english . 
EDL	00:07:48,448	00:07:53,300	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I guess that she got my CV, and she contacted me to see if I was interested in pursuing a career. 
EDL	00:07:53,630	00:08:02,091	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So you mentioned to wolf , and that gives me a little bit of an excuse to maybe dive into your entry press , because it has still worked . 
EDL	00:08:02,091	00:08:07,527	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	He's a big name in the area of spain , chronics and miss gifts to electronics and materials . 
EDL	00:08:07,527	00:08:14,010	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Okay , talk to me just even a little more generally , emotions as the physicists that you are about this arena of that. 
EDL	00:08:14,010	00:08:15,189	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So so grab you . 
EDL	00:08:15,189	00:08:18,020	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So basically , my , my career in physics here . 
EDL	00:08:18,020	00:08:26,780	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And this country has been focused in particularly on spin dependent phenomenon , particular magnetic materials and magnetic phenomena. 
EDL	00:08:26,780	00:08:31,220	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And by spin dependent , you mean , depended on the spans of political lecturers , right? 
EDL	00:08:31,220	00:08:33,421	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Pretty particularly electrons . 
EDL	00:08:33,421	00:08:34,644	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Yes , that is correct . 
EDL	00:08:34,644	00:08:54,770	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	The electronics being so turns out that would you read the proper manager here , though , super stewart actually was the father of spain journey in the scene that he realized that there were some discoveries that were happening at a time when we were talking like late nine days are , in particular , the giant metal assistance effect , which was particularly driving . 
EDL	00:08:54,770	00:09:02,655	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	He falls for the explosion in a hard driving city and stories in japan that we have experienced the last twenty years. 
EDL	00:09:02,655	00:09:03,515	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Just wanted to accept you . 
EDL	00:09:03,515	00:09:09,605	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	For many , I realized we kind of just passed by this idea of spin , dependently spin of electrons . 
EDL	00:09:09,605	00:09:17,130	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But there's a difference spin of electron , which is little less familiar , as opposed to the charge of electric and the negative charge , which could most people do know about . 
EDL	00:09:17,130	00:09:24,660	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So , talking about those different aspects of the electronic and where spin dependence is in the coming into the group. 
EDL	00:09:24,660	00:09:34,515	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Great , so the electronics beneath the very difficult quantity to define legal citizens that quantify the electronic world of mechanical effects . 
EDL	00:09:34,515	00:09:44,400	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So instead of trying to define what spin is , one is whether or settled by defining what is that being does in general , what you find the election . 
EDL	00:09:44,750	00:09:57,078	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Yeah , if you , if you think of it as like a little error pointing in any given direction , what happens is that the accurate spins like to eat a barrel to each other and a bullet to each other , and indicates a magnetic materials . 
EDL	00:09:57,078	00:10:07,005	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What happens is that the electrons items in particular areas of the different attempts , they all like each other that , you know , very much attractive to one another , pointing in the same direction . 
EDL	00:10:07,005	00:10:10,602	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And and with that gives you some opportunity to give the meaning to this . 
EDL	00:10:10,602	00:10:24,100	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so , for example , you can say , okay , if I have a group of things spins that they are all aligned and given direction , I can associate , that would say , number one , and if they are pointed in the opposite direction , then I can associate this with the numbers . 
EDL	00:10:24,100	00:10:36,272	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And then you have the banner language , and you can combine the vitalities language and more complex languages that lead to what we using confutations these days , similar ones in zero of our digital age . 
EDL	00:10:36,272	00:10:54,350	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct , correct , so spin allows to do this in the advantages of spin in in , are , are that , well , you can actually have these composition of spins to be made really small , which means that you can actually back a lot of these beats of once in zero in space . 
EDL	00:10:54,350	00:11:05,790	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Ukraine hands the area , then CDthat you can store the ones and zero they happen to be done by the nature of the materials are protected against radiation , damaging . 
EDL	00:11:05,790	00:11:20,160	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And in one of the holy grades , as I was being to try to find out what is that limit , how small can you make the leader amount of spins to store a once in series in a stable manner , so? 
EDL	00:11:20,160	00:11:37,010	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And they were sentenced by focusing on spin of the electoral , rather than charge of the electron that you can actually have a smaller area of a piece of semiconductor with all these electrons are , are living that the smaller piece of that that some economics will host a one of our zero is. 
EDL	00:11:37,010	00:11:51,020	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	It's not just a question of the size , but it is also of the energetic , I mean , you know me , one of the things that matters to use do not to see how , how much power you've gonna be needed in order to have these , these consideration of this and one . 
EDL	00:11:51,020	00:11:53,667	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So in general , you know , this is what what we found . 
EDL	00:11:53,667	00:12:19,680	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	There were several effects associated with these activity of the elections of the involved and dialogue , that code technologies that will enhance the incident without increasing the demands of powerful and making this very stable ceremony , and also on the location , so that makes the entire in a collection of a property that are very , very attractive , not just for storage density . 
EDL	00:12:19,680	00:12:28,520	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So car drives , but also for memory , but , and that's basically one of the goods that this benjamin program had the program that stored actually started to be. 
EDL	00:12:28,520	00:12:30,500	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Right , let me bring you back now too . 
EDL	00:12:30,500	00:12:35,640	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Another big , multi celebrate crazy that you use earlier , which was giant magnetic resistance . 
EDL	00:12:35,640	00:12:48,320	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	We simply bring that up is because that phenomenon and the technology that it LED to became part of our everyday lives in our hard drive , right in the red heads of the hard drive . 
EDL	00:12:48,320	00:12:50,670	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	It tells a little bit about that technology , evolution . 
EDL	00:12:50,670	00:12:51,310	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And where does it? 
EDL	00:12:51,610	00:13:03,943	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So what happened was that what it was found , and this was what letter , the novel of brights in nineteen ninety eight was that when you have layer systems in which you two magnetic layers separated by one layer , that is not magnetic . 
EDL	00:13:03,943	00:13:13,960	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And if your best current through this particular contraction , the resistance of this contraction will be different when the spines of parallel with respect when they are under violent . 
EDL	00:13:13,960	00:13:25,158	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So that gives you a mechanism to read what is going on in terms of the biggest parallel , and they're valid , because you have now resistance to enable that , that the domination , and that's how you sense . 
EDL	00:13:25,158	00:13:26,670	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What is in the hardware. 
EDL	00:13:26,670	00:13:29,810	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So you are reading the spends , what are your parallel ? 
EDL	00:13:29,810	00:13:33,090	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And I do paralyse , but you are. 
EDL	00:13:33,090	00:13:35,175	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct , so that is a big power of this . 
EDL	00:13:35,175	00:13:37,450	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So that was discovered nineteen ninety eight . 
EDL	00:13:37,450	00:13:52,196	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And then later it was discovered , was that if you replaced the intermediate layer , the magnetic layer that goes metallic was done by an insulator layer and insulate , then you have an effective civilization , which means that you have an amazon sensitivity . 
EDL	00:13:52,196	00:13:53,145	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What you're doing . 
EDL	00:13:53,145	00:14:05,650	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	That was this being dependent on the natural systems being done , a independent natural assistance , and that LED to the explosion in , usually in england , that we have a magnetic , random access memory is great . 
EDL	00:14:05,650	00:14:10,760	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Yes , I always forget that in a photos of hazardous and the field , this is like everyday language , right? 
EDL	00:14:10,760	00:14:16,960	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I have been in some ways and understanding science , and emma is understanding acronyms that some of the battle. 
EDL	00:14:16,960	00:14:21,800	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	He beginning , the government has been in the end of the country is very single day. 
EDL	00:14:21,800	00:14:29,062	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So let's then segregate into your wife's appropriate material and exactly doing this for less than a year . 
EDL	00:14:29,062	00:14:35,963	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So you have a kind of perspective of an early program manager , which I think it would be quite interesting . 
EDL	00:14:35,963	00:14:38,472	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You already have two programs under your wing . 
EDL	00:14:38,472	00:14:46,220	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	One of them pause , which stands for a program in ultra fast laser science and engineering , is a program that you inherited . 
EDL	00:14:46,220	00:14:58,123	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And the other one , the top logical executions in electronics , or t that's a program that you pitched to the agency leadership and got the green lights of congratulation on that . 
EDL	00:14:58,123	00:14:58,742	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Thank you . 
EDL	00:14:58,742	00:15:10,440	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Let's start talking post , which seems to be about a new sort of taking our ability to generate and manipulate electoral magnetic graduation in ways that have been . 
EDL	00:15:10,440	00:15:10,930	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	so . 
EDL	00:15:10,930	00:15:14,010	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Tell me what your tickets are important , but you hope to achieve. 
EDL	00:15:14,010	00:15:17,329	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Both adjusted , it is a program that I inherited it . 
EDL	00:15:17,329	00:15:27,878	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	The BCtenant of the program is that it was to use again , some discoveries that have been increased outside by the the community , which is related to the frequency gone . 
EDL	00:15:27,878	00:15:31,114	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	The frequency gone is something that takes up in . 
EDL	00:15:31,114	00:15:39,050	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	It can like a separate , specific frequencies and brother ration frequent and use that for a variety of application. 
EDL	00:15:39,050	00:15:46,489	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	COM comes from right , because if you think of each frequency as a tie of account and rely on them all up , you get something that somebody looks like to come . 
EDL	00:15:46,489	00:15:47,740	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You usually brush your hair. 
EDL	00:15:47,740	00:15:52,480	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct , and so you can select secretary at the end of this reconsidering men . 
EDL	00:15:52,480	00:16:15,420	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so there have been worked that I was particularly interested in because it dies in with the programs that I am going , that I developed , people have been able to user technology , for example , to get a kind of extra behavior that the kind of behavior that you get with a single drum facility , which is a big , large facility and a table dropped type of configuration . 
EDL	00:16:15,420	00:16:31,740	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So there has been fascinating to me , people have been able to to achieve these by using frequency comes in the other extreme of it was also that people have been able to probe things in the time domain , and we'd add a second position that is. 
EDL	00:16:31,740	00:16:33,890	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Really short duration , right , right ? 
EDL	00:16:33,890	00:16:36,700	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , adult second is turned to the minus eighteen seconds . 
EDL	00:16:37,040	00:16:47,470	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So if you think of another second , which is tends to the nine seconds , which is one billions of a second , then an adult second is one billion of one billion. 
EDL	00:16:47,470	00:17:08,366	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	A one second is really , really fast , so that they think about this is that it is going to enable us to actually look at the dynamic dynamics of electrons , because those are the only entities that are going , but not the only , but at the mainland , it is that are going to be moving in that regime . 
EDL	00:17:08,366	00:17:10,970	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So that is what you are going to be using this kind. 
EDL	00:17:11,390	00:17:24,590	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So in some ways , it is almost like you are trying to create a movie camera that is mapped onto the way electrons live in the speed they live at , which is so much faster , and a minor human. 
EDL	00:17:24,590	00:17:28,710	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And not only the human , but are even the things that we have been doing doing so far . 
EDL	00:17:28,710	00:17:38,460	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Because I mean , you look at the various ranges in which we got to have been looking at things , yes , we move at some speed , you know , as humans , but then it is , molecules also have a weird moving day . 
EDL	00:17:38,460	00:17:39,310	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	They translate . 
EDL	00:17:39,310	00:17:46,700	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	They rotate their vibrate and then seeing those , because those movements are not at the , at the second , they are much slower than that . 
EDL	00:17:46,700	00:17:52,447	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So we have been able to see some of those things already , some in your getting the capabilities that we enable us to see . 
EDL	00:17:52,447	00:17:57,222	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	As I said , in the realm of electrons , which are so much more than the same and move so much faster . 
EDL	00:17:57,222	00:18:02,710	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So this is a new capability that would be a good achieved by this programming is due to the album . 
EDL	00:18:02,710	00:18:04,830	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	This does not exist today. 
EDL	00:18:04,830	00:18:08,680	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So let's stand this one for a second before you move over to your tea program . 
EDL	00:18:09,020	00:18:11,310	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So this , this sounds like very fundamental science . 
EDL	00:18:11,310	00:18:14,040	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And of course , that's why it was in DSof defence science . 
EDL	00:18:14,040	00:18:18,550	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	His office among the six second glove this year , but on the other hand , we are also in dark up . 
EDL	00:18:18,550	00:18:28,020	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so tell me a little bit about not only sort of where this might push the undeveloped in fundamental science , but how that might actually be of relevance to national security. 
EDL	00:18:28,020	00:18:50,990	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But some of the things that , for example , these technologies were enabled and happening , talking to the performance system , for example , provide methodology , for example , for the masks in the battling that have been done a dynamic level for microscopes that are used in the middle makeup of a number of driving systems from each other . 
EDL	00:18:50,990	00:19:00,000	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You need microprocessors and micro electronics in a number of of instruments and things that are used by the armed forces that are used by . 
EDL	00:19:00,000	00:19:22,697	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So when you reduce the footprint , there are a number of things that can , without the minimum addition to lower weight , obviously reduced the smaller you make a tables so fast , faster , which also enables , you know , faster , read information , but you also may enable lower power consumption , which also enables the acceptability of having this institute . 
EDL	00:19:22,697	00:19:32,230	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	This is given this cheap to work with less badly , needs so badly also have their own weight and footprint on the soldier's backs . 
EDL	00:19:32,230	00:19:47,090	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And in all of this is going into the same direction to try to the possibilities for safe for the soldiers to be more efficient when you have right now , but less bulky and less power hungry . 
EDL	00:19:47,090	00:19:53,485	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So the methodology that disconnect will enable gosh in an indirect question , but it goes into that particular. 
EDL	00:19:53,485	00:19:59,795	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And by micro logic , we mean some of new ways of measuring films as click case , very , very small claims . 
EDL	00:20:00,110	00:20:08,920	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And as you are speaking , it also makes me think that this does perhaps play into the future of progress and micro electronics . 
EDL	00:20:08,920	00:20:19,980	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And that is always this , this business concern for many minutes at at some point , we're not gonna , be able to use the techniques we use now to make the next smallest transistor we can actually need very new ideas . 
EDL	00:20:19,980	00:20:30,310	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Perhaps here that coming out of posts that will open doors for yet another era of of ministration or not , many transition , increasing capability and. 
EDL	00:20:30,310	00:20:38,040	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Of the trip , but at least , you know , more with the same , right , more sensitivity for less powerful beneficiaries are the same size . 
EDL	00:20:38,040	00:20:44,040	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So isn't that the addition in each way that you are there , there is a very broad , but I made our space that you have to consider when looking at. 
EDL	00:20:44,430	00:20:46,668	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	All right , so a lot of opportunity . 
EDL	00:20:46,668	00:20:53,181	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	There are members , fundamental science and potentially applying an interview to the highest of technologies . 
EDL	00:20:53,181	00:21:00,423	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So let them move over to your baby that we can call that your top logical executives in electronics program . 
EDL	00:21:00,423	00:21:09,314	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And I know this gets a little bit hurry , because we're using words like top logical , or where you can take our imaginations down to the electronic level . 
EDL	00:21:09,314	00:21:14,680	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Talk to me as obama in undergraduate physics , and your introducing some of these ideas for first time. 
EDL	00:21:14,990	00:21:16,050	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I tried in the meaning . 
EDL	00:21:16,050	00:21:48,334	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	One of the things that I mentioned earlier was that one of the holidays that we have had for the obligation of in , say , a storage renewable is , how small can you make this collection of space so that they can keep the information as all aligned meaning and one or all align meaning we've been disturbed by preparations , because in the end of southwestern energetic consideration , if your temperature fluctuations are more than energy than the energy that is contained in this group of a of electrons , then they're not gonna win , and then you lose . 
EDL	00:21:48,334	00:21:56,292	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Information is like , I like the day my students , you take your left up to my yummy , and that goes all the information that you started , that would be fun . 
EDL	00:21:56,292	00:21:58,233	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So you need something better than that . 
EDL	00:21:58,233	00:22:16,025	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so I have been following the jenny turns out , you know , that we have a new door , our , our disposal for , for blogging , new partnerships , and is what the college brings , which is again , something that has to do with the , they are all the intentional configuration of things. 
EDL	00:22:16,025	00:22:20,520	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But not just as a technology comes out of really the deal wrong. 
EDL	00:22:20,520	00:22:23,442	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Of geometry , right in a way , yes , like in , in a way . 
EDL	00:22:23,442	00:22:27,370	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Yes , it has to do with something that has to do with a special configure . 
EDL	00:22:27,370	00:22:40,850	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So in this particular case , that we go to the heart of the method , I mean , I told you that spins like to be barrel and dialogue , but he doesn't say that this is an attempt of the possibility that scientists have discovered . 
EDL	00:22:40,850	00:22:45,532	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And he said , they are engineer for them to be candidates that is making some angle between them . 
EDL	00:22:45,532	00:22:55,360	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Now , you lock them into discounting , and you try to put them on a surface , you realize , and now they had to arrange themselves in such a fashion that they can accommodate the academic . 
EDL	00:22:55,790	00:23:00,030	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And when you try to do this exercises , if you take like , do little , be , do little doing . 
EDL	00:23:00,030	00:23:10,300	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And then you went about several of them on a surface , you see that they had to be arranging kind of award exercise , kind of little things to the political experience of regulators are right . 
EDL	00:23:10,300	00:23:12,060	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Okay , something like that . 
EDL	00:23:12,060	00:23:14,010	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You can put them there right on the surface . 
EDL	00:23:14,010	00:23:15,974	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And that is what we got screamings , right . 
EDL	00:23:15,974	00:23:17,581	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And why are these interesting ? 
EDL	00:23:17,581	00:23:26,690	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Well , because now , because they are counted , if you want to switch them off , pointing in one direction to pointing the opposite direction , now you have to do this with the entire , the entire lot. 
EDL	00:23:26,690	00:23:37,620	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And just just for clarity , when you say the word canteen with you , likely these spines are candid , means that they're not parallel or anti parallel , but are actually a certain kind of angle , almost like. 
EDL	00:23:37,620	00:23:38,420	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct , correct . 
EDL	00:23:38,420	00:23:57,310	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so now , because they are locked into this by some mechanism , right , you just cannot switch one without switching the other , so you have to switch the entire thing because you have to switch the entire that caused you more energy than it will be doing just the individual players , right , so that makes an introduction more. 
EDL	00:23:57,310	00:24:04,070	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	A little doubt of thermal energy , he is not , is not enough to football correct , so they become stable , correct. 
EDL	00:24:04,070	00:24:19,710	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	That is what the topology offers you a production , so that if you can like , engineer this in a suitable way , such that we can create a region of spins in this configure multiplication smaller than what we have right now for collecting the ones and diseases . 
EDL	00:24:19,710	00:24:26,750	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Then you are in the next generation of media that would be based upon this type of material , and that would push it . 
EDL	00:24:26,750	00:24:31,540	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , and there are some metrics that tell us , where can we go ? 
EDL	00:24:31,540	00:24:33,510	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What would we achieve me doing that ? 
EDL	00:24:33,510	00:24:39,990	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And it is not just size , as I said , that really so , so question about energetics , how much energy you really need to do do this ? 
EDL	00:24:40,340	00:24:52,420	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Can you move them around , and you actually do things with them so you can open up several paradigms to use these entities for memory , logic or sensitive applications beyond what we can do with materials , right? 
EDL	00:24:52,420	00:24:59,300	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Okay , and this still fall within the tradition of spain , china , accidents and still worth , or is this beyond , is this in some other? 
EDL	00:25:00,030	00:25:04,070	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Related , so it will be spiritual in in spirit , right ? 
EDL	00:25:04,070	00:25:04,560	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But it is . 
EDL	00:25:04,560	00:25:07,890	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	It has this added thing , which is the topological protection . 
EDL	00:25:07,890	00:25:11,540	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	This is top box in double logical spintronics , right , right ? 
EDL	00:25:11,540	00:25:13,170	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So that is a new thing . 
EDL	00:25:13,170	00:25:14,040	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And that is. 
EDL	00:25:14,040	00:25:14,560	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What is gonna ? 
EDL	00:25:14,560	00:25:15,460	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Take us ? 
EDL	00:25:15,460	00:25:20,120	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Let's talk about where your program is in sort of the general lifecycle of a program . 
EDL	00:25:20,120	00:25:20,670	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Here is dark . 
EDL	00:25:20,670	00:25:24,090	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So you came , and here you came up with this wonderful idea . 
EDL	00:25:24,580	00:25:31,270	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You went through the hiring experience of bringing it to its called tech council , where leadership in your coal program management . 
EDL	00:25:31,270	00:25:33,160	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Others are there vetting it ? 
EDL	00:25:33,160	00:25:35,830	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So you made it passed all of those obstacles. 
EDL	00:25:35,830	00:25:35,960	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	我。
EDL	00:25:35,960	00:25:37,500	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Now , what's the status of the purpose ? 
EDL	00:25:37,500	00:25:39,370	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So right now , we have passed . 
EDL	00:25:39,370	00:25:48,700	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Source selections show a broader announcement was placed for the people and university proposals . 
EDL	00:25:48,700	00:25:57,310	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	The proposals were evaluated by teams of experts , and then decisions were made in terms of what the most. 
EDL	00:25:57,310	00:26:05,725	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Qualified and teach me that by source , select action is that those who can make a past , these obstacles become a source as a where we tell them for. 
EDL	00:26:05,725	00:26:08,802	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct correct , so right now , that is the states . 
EDL	00:26:08,802	00:26:26,598	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And so what we are going on right now will be , you know , the contracting part of , so is that when the money is actually being delivered to the performance , and so we think that we would have the kick of meeting sometime early during the eighteen , and shortly after we'll be reviewed time , right ? 
EDL	00:26:26,598	00:26:30,140	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , they have to perform between the art by another agency as well . 
EDL	00:26:30,140	00:26:34,960	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Is that there are very strong metrics that have to be satisfied in order to continue with. 
EDL	00:26:34,960	00:26:41,220	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Progress , although I certainly miss you , this , you know , this reminds me a little bit of some of the early days here . 
EDL	00:26:41,220	00:26:52,210	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I doubt about where , for example , there was a funding of something called the inter disciplinary laboratories , and at least became kind of the , the seeds , but later became known as material science and engineering . 
EDL	00:26:52,210	00:26:54,000	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So starbucks had a role . 
EDL	00:26:54,000	00:26:55,610	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	They are next to the united . 
EDL	00:26:55,610	00:26:57,220	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Kind of it is nurturing . 
EDL	00:26:57,220	00:27:13,410	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	What had was honest way to becoming a new material science is this is this kind of a sense of that kind of possibility where , because you have an idea that organizing groups , these potential performers , do you think this is going to be important for starting a new field? 
EDL	00:27:13,410	00:27:23,587	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	In fact , it is particularly important to concentrate the efforts of experts that are maybe working on various other areas that may not be related to one another . 
EDL	00:27:23,587	00:27:34,980	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But to then focus them under a specific problem with the specific metrics , and that may lead to advances in this particular territory in which we are not even brief , because we don't know what they are going to discover . 
EDL	00:27:34,980	00:27:37,580	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , we are thinking that one application would be . 
EDL	00:27:37,950	00:27:58,042	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	This new generation may modify that we all are needing and wanted to happen , but it so happens in the suspect experience that , you know , prior people in , including school , has mentioned this to me that often thinks what happens is that the performance discovers things that you need and anticipate , and the program can go in a different direction rate and start the new program . 
EDL	00:27:58,042	00:28:00,000	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You just don't know what they can take you . 
EDL	00:28:00,000	00:28:13,150	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So that's basically what my hope is that because this is basic science , that is all of the best ability of the groups , groups of people to discover something completely non undissipated that would blow our minds away . 
EDL	00:28:13,150	00:28:14,660	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	We would like , well. 
EDL	00:28:14,660	00:28:19,013	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	We'll make that happen , as that sounds really like an exciting possibility . 
EDL	00:28:19,013	00:28:39,280	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And in some ways , I wonder if I wondered if at a place like dark , or whether such a diversity of skill set , whether there is even more of an opportunity to recognize when really surprising things happens like a sleep , maybe if everything promises , no question , here is another to hear you kind of air dropped in from academy . 
EDL	00:28:39,280	00:28:41,300	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	You're in the defence science office . 
EDL	00:28:41,620	00:28:53,180	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Have you met other program managers or wanted other programs that that , in a sense of blow your mind , and that are , you are now beginning to think of how they relate to your own. 
EDL	00:28:53,180	00:28:53,780	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	interests . 
EDL	00:28:53,780	00:29:15,520	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I'm definitely looking into this , particularly for the m do the manufacturing technological life is the microscope that is correct , because these are the guys that would be perhaps the ones that may take on whatever developments come from the issue , because they are the ones that are going to try to make actual devices out of this if they turn out to be , do living up to the promise that we are hoping . 
EDL	00:29:15,520	00:29:16,225	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So yes. 
EDL	00:29:16,225	00:29:22,889	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So it looks like an interesting synergy there where you might be on the really fundamental side of things . 
EDL	00:29:22,889	00:29:23,513	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And telled . 
EDL	00:29:23,513	00:29:37,460	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	My system technology officer , even though still fundamentally in engineering site , could take it further the next step toward what ultimately would be the finish line , and , of course , of the way dark it works that would probably be out in industry or some a part of some other lab . 
EDL	00:29:37,460	00:29:39,220	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And in the military services. 
EDL	00:29:39,220	00:29:47,750	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But there is so easy and expected , because in the sensor technology , you don't know , this may take you to some biology related sensors that we are not even thinking on right now . 
EDL	00:29:47,750	00:30:02,920	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And it has happened a lot of in , in particularly in recent times , that a lot of the discoveries have been done , like , for example , taking the indeed of nanotechnology , and in people who are working with analytics for a number of physical application and then and then the biology started thinking . 
EDL	00:30:02,920	00:30:06,405	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	How about using them as markers for biological , you know. 
EDL	00:30:06,405	00:30:14,757	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Rights and by and by nanoparticles were kind of talking about things , viruses , so things that much smaller than sales , more , even smaller than some organisms . 
EDL	00:30:14,757	00:30:16,570	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But the suitable one that virus. 
EDL	00:30:16,570	00:30:23,149	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct , so there are , there are opportunities so that that we just don't know , and we will have the , you know , we will see the performance . 
EDL	00:30:23,149	00:30:23,990	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Get there there . 
EDL	00:30:23,990	00:30:30,820	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And then , you know , if there is certainly an opportunity , we will really , really explore it in and make the people from between. 
EDL	00:30:30,820	00:30:39,400	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Aware of this , so , and BTor game was an excuse to mention that another one of the officers said that the biological technology is correct. 
EDL	00:30:39,400	00:30:42,942	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Correct , correct , and so that's that's from the indian , who knows ? 
EDL	00:30:42,942	00:30:47,111	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , there might be other things that may be important for doctors . 
EDL	00:30:47,111	00:30:48,800	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , we just don't know . 
EDL	00:30:48,800	00:31:03,160	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , I know that deeply at the , in STO, you know , maybe interested in , you know , different ways of of of that can come from these programs that to be applicable to specific problems that they're working on. 
EDL	00:31:03,160	00:31:13,590	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Right , and again , as tears are going through the entire reporter here , the entire set of others , that strategic technologies of us that could be only when we did mention so far as the technical technologies are not just . 
EDL	00:31:13,590	00:31:14,255	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Oh , and I too . 
EDL	00:31:14,255	00:31:16,915	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Oh , exactly what is this information innovation occasion ? 
EDL	00:31:16,915	00:31:18,110	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	There is the entire six. 
EDL	00:31:18,110	00:31:22,380	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	But again , we don't know where is this political program is gonna . 
EDL	00:31:22,380	00:31:22,830	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Take that . 
EDL	00:31:22,830	00:31:26,780	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I mean , that is the beauty of working for the issue that you are there for front of science . 
EDL	00:31:26,780	00:31:27,630	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	We are there by science . 
EDL	00:31:27,630	00:31:33,440	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Starbucks , in that regard , you know , that we are working with things that we don't know where they are going to take us . 
EDL	00:31:33,440	00:31:35,330	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	That is not a specific goal . 
EDL	00:31:35,330	00:31:41,560	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	We have some idea where we want to go , but we don't know if there are going to be new opportunities arising from them. 
EDL	00:31:42,030	00:31:48,600	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	From discovery , so are there , are there any questions that you wish I had asked you in the discussion that I. 
EDL	00:31:48,910	00:31:49,780	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Didn't get you . 
EDL	00:31:49,780	00:32:04,197	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Yes , like where , whether by in the american dessert , I mean , I mentioned this in best , a lot of people like when I was like at an obligation a few years ago , was reading a club gotta novel , and he mentioned at some point , darbar . 
EDL	00:32:04,197	00:32:08,705	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And i've got to the science novel , kind of universal digital. 
EDL	00:32:08,705	00:32:11,265	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	This has to be a hot age to climb custody , the author . 
EDL	00:32:11,265	00:32:20,014	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And yes , the dark , we do know a certain kind of mistake , and it is out there in the cultural world , in various ways that is absolutely true . 
EDL	00:32:20,014	00:32:30,050	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Yeah , I just want to thank you alive for spending this time with us and letting us know little bit about how you are taking this role as a programmer energy to the future of technology. 
EDL	00:32:30,050	00:32:31,710	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	Thank you so very much for being here . 
EDL	00:32:31,710	00:32:33,640	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	I am proud of being adopted member here . 
EDL	00:32:33,640	00:32:34,640	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	So thank you. 
EDL	00:32:34,640	00:32:41,260	| VfD E16 The Spinmaster |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from darker .
