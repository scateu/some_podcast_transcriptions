EDL	00:00:11,820	00:00:22,154	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Stop technology , the internet GPS in the column of your hand on the most operation , and technology is a driver of our times . 
EDL	00:00:22,154	00:00:30,990	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war in DARPA , the defensive ADS research projects has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:31,550	00:00:39,590	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window on the darkness , core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:39,590	00:00:42,429	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	My name is iphone amount on your dark a host today . 
EDL	00:00:42,429	00:00:59,779	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I am pleased to be talking without your john book , a program manager since twenty seventeen in agencies microsystems technology , we are recording our conversations from our respective homes as we do our parts to slow the spread of covered nineteenth , the pandemic disease caused by the crowd of our source . 
EDL	00:00:59,779	00:01:04,060	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Two , this is also why you might hear ambient sounds like trucks and sirens and birds . 
EDL	00:01:04,660	00:01:14,750	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	John brings his technology visions to dark up on detail from the air force research laboratory , space vehicles directorate , acquirement air force base in new mexico . 
EDL	00:01:14,750	00:01:27,160	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	There , he had a research team developing a tonight clocks , a ton of time transfer for secretion applications and ultra precision measurement techniques for use in the global positioning system , other space . 
EDL	00:01:27,160	00:01:43,560	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	His research interests include the development of next generation sensors for pushing the state of the identity , for example , remote detection and frequency synthesis methods to enable PN, PNTis *** , speak for positioning , navigation and timing . 
EDL	00:01:44,030	00:01:46,950	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	John earned this pitch in physics in the university , virtually. 
EDL	00:01:47,270	00:01:48,240	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	John , thanks for joining me . 
EDL	00:01:48,640	00:01:51,540	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What are the bigger thanks for inviting me to do this? 
EDL	00:01:51,540	00:02:04,246	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Also , I know that one of your interest adopted is to reduce the complexity , costs and size of PNTand other techniques , and to make these usable outside of labour , tories settings , and we'll get to those when we speak about your programs . 
EDL	00:02:04,246	00:02:09,071	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But first , I like to hear a little bit about where your interest in science comes from . 
EDL	00:02:09,071	00:02:13,670	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	If your parents were scientists , repair the amazing teacher , just what is about twenty two? 
EDL	00:02:13,670	00:02:21,843	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I think it really started in the youth that , as I suppose it does for many people to sort of a natural curiosity in the world . 
EDL	00:02:21,843	00:02:25,930	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And as I grew up and kind of discovered , I was pretty good at math . 
EDL	00:02:25,930	00:02:29,816	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I think every person has a good or bad experience with this . 
EDL	00:02:29,816	00:02:30,965	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Mine was positive . 
EDL	00:02:30,965	00:02:39,922	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And one thing LED to another , and I went to college and a professor talking to taking physics one or one for a general education agreement . 
EDL	00:02:39,922	00:02:45,901	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And I did really , really one thing like another in here I am , I can sort of call that that went . 
EDL	00:02:45,901	00:02:48,815	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I will say one little thing along the way . 
EDL	00:02:48,815	00:02:55,310	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It turned out that my , a great grandfather actually was a physics professor at the college that I went to know . 
EDL	00:02:55,310	00:02:59,690	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I knew this a little bit going there , but I didn't really discover this until I was . 
EDL	00:03:00,030	00:03:06,170	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So it turns out that of my great grandfather with a physicist name johnny . 
EDL	00:03:06,470	00:03:09,090	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Here I am , this is his name and doing the same thing , which I was amazing circle there. 
EDL	00:03:09,500	00:03:16,085	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's the bird dynasty and physics , so that that's really a copy of history next to the school you went to . 
EDL	00:03:16,085	00:03:20,496	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So you work at the air force research laboratory in current . 
EDL	00:03:20,496	00:03:25,425	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so my guess is that you knew about DARPA quite well even there . 
EDL	00:03:25,425	00:03:28,050	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But how is it that you've got to die ? 
EDL	00:03:28,050	00:03:30,520	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Booking manager has a how I got the dark story . 
EDL	00:03:30,520	00:03:31,310	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So what's? 
EDL	00:03:31,310	00:03:34,290	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	When I was in graduate school , we were funded . 
EDL	00:03:34,290	00:03:38,370	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I was found as a graduate student by daughter and said , that was my first exposure to it . 
EDL	00:03:38,370	00:03:48,714	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The pressure was overwhelming to perform , but it was really rewarding to have some direction to go on and not to sort of float in the english world of questions you might ask . 
EDL	00:03:48,714	00:03:50,163	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And physics are in science . 
EDL	00:03:50,163	00:03:55,920	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And I saw that kind of when I get interested in being participant and sort of the dark of mission , get all that . 
EDL	00:03:55,920	00:03:56,870	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I think that stake with me . 
EDL	00:03:56,870	00:04:04,313	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now I want to air force , as you said , and it doubt there are many folks government that helped double with more context for the problems that there have been . 
EDL	00:04:04,313	00:04:08,823	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So then I helped not rule for quite a while before being asked , join the ranks . 
EDL	00:04:08,823	00:04:10,000	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And I was very excited. 
EDL	00:04:10,000	00:04:15,382	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Okay , and just wanna backtrack a little bit too , that earlier , I think you said the involvement is a graduate student . 
EDL	00:04:15,382	00:04:16,524	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And we said , that's right . 
EDL	00:04:16,524	00:04:17,510	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What was the program? 
EDL	00:04:17,510	00:04:21,350	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It was called the guided , both einstein . 
EDL	00:04:21,350	00:04:25,310	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Khan said in a foreign program , which is a mouthful , to be sure. 
EDL	00:04:25,310	00:04:38,990	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And what really what we're talking about are tiny in a sort of fundamental particles like atoms that are put into a certain conditions so that they all are sort of like one micros topic want an object that you can manipulate this , that I get that kind of. 
EDL	00:04:38,990	00:04:41,012	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's pretty close to rate . 
EDL	00:04:41,012	00:04:50,920	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It is a strange thing that it turns out that the eyes , diana and the physician both figured out that you , you could under certain conditions , would make this way . 
EDL	00:04:50,920	00:05:03,110	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They need to be very cold if you can cool particles down to a certain temperature in parliament of box , they would insert a behaving like individual particles being into each , yeah , that they would add more like a super particular . 
EDL	00:05:03,110	00:05:11,220	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	We all can adapt together and call her fashion the most normal way of talking about this is , I was coming out to say , we are talking about . 
EDL	00:05:11,220	00:05:13,300	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	This is a comparison to the laser . 
EDL	00:05:13,300	00:05:14,350	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You have a light bulb . 
EDL	00:05:14,350	00:05:20,830	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You know how that works , and you have a laser pointer , and you , people have experience with those who implemented the capital or whatever . 
EDL	00:05:20,830	00:05:26,784	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So that sort of the difference we're talking about yourself , normal particles , and I guess they've been in two children . 
EDL	00:05:26,784	00:05:28,470	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I believe one kind of physics . 
EDL	00:05:28,470	00:05:33,180	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And then if we do this BCconversation , they act more like a laser . 
EDL	00:05:33,180	00:05:36,830	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So it's a whole different set of rules applies that level . 
EDL	00:05:36,830	00:05:38,360	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	We will reach glory at a time. 
EDL	00:05:38,360	00:05:47,630	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The journal , we want to secure it in two , talking about your programs , two of which you inherited and two of which you are going to be rolling out . 
EDL	00:05:47,630	00:05:50,910	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Or are , let's go to the inherited programs . 
EDL	00:05:50,910	00:06:06,716	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	First one is called the atomic clocks with enhanced stability program or aces , and one is actually much more multi celebrate program known short as ambient , but a long form as atomic mechanism of her for biological imaging in earth's native to win . 
EDL	00:06:06,716	00:06:12,927	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So let's talk about both programs , starting with asians and and so what's the technology goal basis ? 
EDL	00:06:12,927	00:06:16,330	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And how would you describe the status of the program? 
EDL	00:06:16,330	00:06:25,462	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So it is , is , is trying to make some of the world's best time clocks and to a package that is actually useful . 
EDL	00:06:25,462	00:06:36,517	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And you know , this is a long history , actually darker , trying to do this as a program called suicide crystal , maybe fifteen years ago , trying to do the next four hours earlier . 
EDL	00:06:36,517	00:06:43,741	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Thus , the chip scale tonight clock , so to a little more self event , it was trying to do that was really successful program . 
EDL	00:06:43,741	00:06:45,274	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And I , you can buy sea sex . 
EDL	00:06:45,274	00:06:48,684	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	This typical time of collapse in a variety of thanks . 
EDL	00:06:48,684	00:06:58,285	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Just mentioned a few of the users share , so automatically general , the main user of them is , is what synchronization visible . 
EDL	00:06:58,285	00:07:02,067	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What is the synchronism things like GPS, GPS. 
EDL	00:07:02,067	00:07:07,119	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The global positioning system is entirely funded on these atomic clocks . 
EDL	00:07:07,119	00:07:08,038	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It went for them . 
EDL	00:07:08,038	00:07:09,646	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They wouldn't work at all . 
EDL	00:07:09,646	00:07:26,450	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	There are also backup for a lot of information technology systems , things like financial markets , data , data centers are all these things when a lot of data is moving around requests in conversation , you find a tomato collapse in all those cancer. 
EDL	00:07:26,450	00:07:35,697	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Right , okay and unseen to most of us is just just the role that autonomic clocks play as you change everything from GPS all the way to to the financial transactions . 
EDL	00:07:35,697	00:07:38,550	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But so getting back to assist the asset program . 
EDL	00:07:38,550	00:07:41,580	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Yeah , again , what's the technology goal ? 
EDL	00:07:41,580	00:07:44,450	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And how do you describe the status of the. 
EDL	00:07:44,830	00:07:48,360	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But so there's a whole solution of atomic clocks that are out there . 
EDL	00:07:48,360	00:07:56,875	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Some are pretty expensive , and you will not see those except specialized circumstances , and some are very inexpensive , like the justice . 
EDL	00:07:56,875	00:07:59,536	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Galaxy collectors is rotary and expensive . 
EDL	00:07:59,536	00:08:04,076	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But the think you find it like finance networks and GPS systems . 
EDL	00:08:04,076	00:08:15,712	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The question was , could we make something as good as that , but at a sizing costume and power low enough that you could actually start thinking about putting them more places . 
EDL	00:08:15,712	00:08:32,970	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so let's deal with the program to try to make an anthony collector you could still buy , but it will cost you seven thousand and fill up a good chunk of of your real statement and save up and develop a talk communications cannon and replaced . 
EDL	00:08:32,970	00:08:41,920	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It was something that was more like the size of your fist or millions , and then you guys are putting them in radios , putting them in their planes , putting on a matter of places . 
EDL	00:08:41,920	00:08:44,897	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So that's a gold program to to do that . 
EDL	00:08:44,897	00:09:04,583	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Is , it turns out every part of these best atom o'clocks that you could buy has to be managed to rise precise dramatically , and that will be enough , and we need to go to the laboratories , whereas some of the best atomic clocks are made and learned some new techniques . 
EDL	00:09:04,583	00:09:07,333	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Leaders are calling being one of the english . 
EDL	00:09:07,333	00:09:13,490	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Just participants are talking about cold , cold particles and and try to implement those . 
EDL	00:09:13,490	00:09:25,110	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It also , it makes us small , so it's a pretty big system challenge of lots of pieces being made small where we are in the program , where we are actually towards into the problem . 
EDL	00:09:25,110	00:09:32,140	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And I would like to tell you when I took the program over , it seemed like a very , very difficult challenge was had at the beyond us . 
EDL	00:09:32,140	00:09:46,442	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I think it would be unlikely that we would have that for your programmer , so we would succeed at the level we have , but longer holds were about six months out to dinner the program , and we have program types , and they work . 
EDL	00:09:46,442	00:09:47,429	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And it's amazing . 
EDL	00:09:47,429	00:10:05,860	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It is each little compounded , and there is a little bit of a of a dry story , but there are all kind of amazing when you think about them , vacuum pumps and special lasers , and just just all kinds of little pieces , this has been made to fit in there , but they work , and I think , pretty soon will have asian clocks that. 
EDL	00:10:06,200	00:10:07,610	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It is , some people will be able to buy . 
EDL	00:10:08,060	00:10:18,322	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Maybe you can just say a little bit about what this does mean when you can mean your choice and make more , more affordable technologies that have been too big or too expensive to use . 
EDL	00:10:18,322	00:10:26,370	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And I am thinking of just even the way GPS became a military rise , and and is now in all of our fans , something the job also had a role . 
EDL	00:10:26,370	00:10:33,030	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So what happens when we can take , you know , the time of clubs and put them into gadgets they. 
EDL	00:10:33,030	00:10:34,846	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So I have not been able to go before . 
EDL	00:10:34,846	00:10:44,495	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Well , let's start at the GPS system because that next part of the most important place to start the , you know , a lot of people maybe not realize how important GPS actually is . 
EDL	00:10:44,495	00:10:50,596	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's in practical , everything writers that would make your mobile phones really work as well as they do . 
EDL	00:10:50,596	00:10:53,760	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It makes our electrical system work as as reliably . 
EDL	00:10:54,600	00:10:57,660	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's , you know , even to the point of right now . 
EDL	00:10:57,660	00:11:04,414	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I don't have to realize this , but the best farming equipment , and actually most of our crops now are dependent on GPS . 
EDL	00:11:04,414	00:11:09,250	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They actually recalled each one of the seats were exactly reduced to make a cinema. 
EDL	00:11:09,250	00:11:14,660	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so they can go back to that sea , gratefully into precision farming , precision fertilizer in position . 
EDL	00:11:14,660	00:11:16,720	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Application of water were needed to be amazing. 
EDL	00:11:16,720	00:11:25,629	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's amazing , and so GPS is everywhere , but what you might not realize is that if something would happen to GPS , you know , it could be a mammy problem . 
EDL	00:11:25,629	00:11:40,670	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	There have been several instance of that new york books , basically in the system have been discovered to a natural system problem , some , some way of solar flares have been famously started about it . 
EDL	00:11:40,670	00:11:54,433	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Spain very disrupted , and so what I have , and if we didn't have GPS was all those things that depend on , it will always certainly be flowing and not have that time or the location information , and it would be very bad , I think . 
EDL	00:11:54,433	00:12:01,313	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So over , for example , how would overwork , or you're right during work if there was no GPS for a day , wouldn't work at all . 
EDL	00:12:01,313	00:12:02,846	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's an important problem . 
EDL	00:12:02,846	00:12:21,218	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So the main thing that absolutely the main thing that is that my affordably making a clock at this quality , those kinds of systems that leads those are truth , can put these o'clocks backup in there , and there are systems we know we're planning for on the bad days on day , but that they would be a little less bad . 
EDL	00:12:21,218	00:12:24,540	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now we could have some reasonably priced collapsed in. 
EDL	00:12:24,540	00:12:24,853	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	right ? 
EDL	00:12:24,853	00:12:28,771	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And just because we are talking about dark here , which is part of the department of the fencing . 
EDL	00:12:28,771	00:12:38,912	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And we should point out that , of course , one of the concerns and a driving concerns , and we leave GPS becomes available to the military services in the assets that we have to depend on them , right ? 
EDL	00:12:38,912	00:12:49,550	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So this is one of the drivers were trying to come up with alternatives to GPS that can kick in their european factor in absolutely some of the recent GPS system becomes unavailable. 
EDL	00:12:49,550	00:12:51,430	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's right , organized asia's clocks . 
EDL	00:12:51,430	00:12:57,244	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They are , first , of course , but if we can manage , that , does not think you are seeing in in commercial use all over the place too . 
EDL	00:12:57,244	00:13:00,000	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I say one of the most important places you might see this . 
EDL	00:13:00,000	00:13:02,060	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It is in our soil and infrastructure . 
EDL	00:13:02,060	00:13:10,490	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So it is a reason all of our phones , if you actually prepare phone is about the opportunity , and it's all typed back to GPS through your cell phone to our own . 
EDL	00:13:10,880	00:13:20,960	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So at the same thing , if we can make achieve enough that telecom companies wants me a bucket , putting AAreally nice time keeping unit in their base stations in the towers and so on . 
EDL	00:13:21,470	00:13:31,310	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now , awesome , you have a much moral based technology communication system in case of something happens , but also they can make the systems even better . 
EDL	00:13:31,310	00:13:41,260	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Right , there's a problem , you know , past five g sixty , whatever is out past that might utilize the timing that these clocks gave the systems more . 
EDL	00:13:41,260	00:13:48,517	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So , so , you know , really have a talk communications companies sort of argue outside , like leaning into the timing precision . 
EDL	00:13:48,517	00:13:50,588	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They could buy a reasonable price . 
EDL	00:13:50,588	00:13:52,660	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They could be really begin changing. 
EDL	00:13:52,660	00:14:00,000	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's because it would help them piece together many more packets of information coming in all different times , because I can time snap those so accurately. 
EDL	00:14:00,000	00:14:07,176	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's right , you're trying to spend very accurately , and it's really important for things like data hand off the festival , driving around . 
EDL	00:14:07,176	00:14:11,444	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's actually had amazing when you think about it , you can drive in your car now . 
EDL	00:14:11,444	00:14:13,190	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And the most part , your call doesn't drop . 
EDL	00:14:13,190	00:14:16,477	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Where are you going to eternally go into a bridge ? 
EDL	00:14:16,477	00:14:17,134	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	No problem . 
EDL	00:14:17,134	00:14:24,585	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And yet that's why is that it was because of those data packs of things rounded between between different towers all the time . 
EDL	00:14:24,585	00:14:30,440	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And it works similar into powerful techniques , synchronized and and just different , different. 
EDL	00:14:30,440	00:14:31,570	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Detail activities . 
EDL	00:14:32,080	00:14:38,180	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now let's move to the second program that you inherited in this was from a former program manager , robert , like work . 
EDL	00:14:38,180	00:14:45,799	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	This one is called atomic magnetos matter for biological imaging in earth's native train or ambient for short . 
EDL	00:14:45,799	00:14:47,520	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's two eyes in there . 
EDL	00:14:47,520	00:14:49,240	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What's that program about ? 
EDL	00:14:49,240	00:14:50,961	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And where is it it in ? 
EDL	00:14:50,961	00:14:52,260	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So in the end of. 
EDL	00:14:52,260	00:14:55,010	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	As a magazine , it's a management program . 
EDL	00:14:55,620	00:15:04,540	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so first question is asking for what is the magnitude , and it's simply a device that measures magnetic fields . 
EDL	00:15:04,540	00:15:16,300	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And you might ask , why would we want to ever handle such a device , but it turns out that lots of things had a magnetic moment through them are like a permitted language . 
EDL	00:15:16,830	00:15:21,160	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Does university of a strong one that can be used to find them . 
EDL	00:15:21,160	00:15:22,440	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So you see this all the time . 
EDL	00:15:22,440	00:15:39,010	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So , for example , you see people using a metal attackers to find , like jury on a beach as a classic example of someone using some of the negative properties of a device of the story of the object trying to find to find it , even though it would be difficult to. 
EDL	00:15:39,010	00:15:41,250	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Otherwise , although usually the finding. 
EDL	00:15:41,250	00:15:46,690	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Bottle cap misery is , so you have it an important problem , and manufacturers just already . 
EDL	00:15:47,050	00:15:51,670	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So the magnetic field made by the object can be actually large enough to find . 
EDL	00:15:52,390	00:16:13,010	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The promise is so many things that have a magnetic associated imaginative field that they cannot collaborate each other up so it can be very easy to get lost in all the noise made biological objects that mention the earth has all magnetic field that is actually quite large and scale of any of these things were talking about yet to attract that off . 
EDL	00:16:13,010	00:16:15,660	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so let's hear that the program and earth need to rain . 
EDL	00:16:16,300	00:16:36,730	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So the problem we're trying to solve here is , how can make a manufacturer that sort of automatically , you're intrinsically removes that background field and can separate out all the that you from different objects , so you can really hold in on one thing that you care about. 
EDL	00:16:36,730	00:16:54,027	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	One of the potential applications that has caught my attention is in using these new kinds of magnetic tools as measurement instruments for the brain took to sort of look at the magnetic fields that are associated with all of the kind of movement of electrical charges in the brain . 
EDL	00:16:54,027	00:16:55,470	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What we can say about that. 
EDL	00:16:55,470	00:16:56,390	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So that's right . 
EDL	00:16:56,390	00:17:09,600	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The , it's not just permanent objects that he says anything that makes a current so that your brain does that you have nervous circuits in your brain that are constantly firing , trying to sort out the law around you . 
EDL	00:17:10,000	00:17:14,255	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And those currents make many fields , and the many fields can be detected . 
EDL	00:17:14,255	00:17:17,872	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They passed right through the score and to the outside world . 
EDL	00:17:17,872	00:17:33,630	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now you , you might imagine that you might , those currents are really , really small , so actually detecting the middle field associated with them is pretty challenging , especially if you get this big earth field trying to wash all of that out the indian program as well . 
EDL	00:17:33,630	00:17:35,080	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The first things were trying to do this . 
EDL	00:17:35,080	00:17:36,090	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's just a really hard . 
EDL	00:17:36,090	00:17:38,960	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Problem is a very small metic field argument in a number . 
EDL	00:17:38,960	00:17:42,150	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's a honest scale of about ten film to test. 
EDL	00:17:42,570	00:17:46,190	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Samples that small , let's stand to remind the fifteen of something. 
EDL	00:17:46,190	00:17:48,665	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Turn the minus fifteen of something . 
EDL	00:17:48,665	00:17:55,470	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And to put that perspective , that is about so earth's magic feels about a hundred micro tesla . 
EDL	00:17:55,470	00:17:57,857	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So we've got about the lesson . 
EDL	00:17:57,857	00:17:59,184	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What is the matter ? 
EDL	00:17:59,184	00:18:03,860	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But twelve , because the manager , too , would get to keep the cultural in order to see this . 
EDL	00:18:04,170	00:18:06,510	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That is a really , really hard problem . 
EDL	00:18:06,510	00:18:10,000	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	How do you measure something small on the face of something large ? 
EDL	00:18:10,000	00:18:23,279	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So we were trying to legislate , measure these tiny manufacturers and the way we want to do that is , instead of measuring a many field itself , we will try to measure the gradient , automatic field . 
EDL	00:18:23,279	00:18:29,837	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So instead of measuring the raphia direction , measuring the difference between two manufacturers to reckon . 
EDL	00:18:29,837	00:18:40,980	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So the idea you put one manufacturer may be next , you're brain , but it has at your , your skill and the element , tomorrow's a lot of fuel inches away from that , which doesn't sound like a lot . 
EDL	00:18:40,980	00:18:51,880	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But I insist in space enough to a sort of measure the separation between what your brains doing and what the earth is doing , and subtract us to and give you back a signal list , hopefully. 
EDL	00:18:51,880	00:18:53,086	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What your brain is doing . 
EDL	00:18:53,086	00:18:54,637	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I remember talking to rubber . 
EDL	00:18:54,637	00:19:08,810	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Let's work about some of the potential biomedical applications you are like , potentially helping to monitor what happening in the nervous system during medical procedures in the weather that some kind of neurosurgery , or , I think , really discussion you mention. 
EDL	00:19:08,810	00:19:10,810	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Concussion monitoring , that's right . 
EDL	00:19:10,810	00:19:18,251	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The brain is sort of famously difficult to understand and end make any kind of reasonable measurements of , especially in real time . 
EDL	00:19:18,251	00:19:20,844	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And we have cats , gangs and things like this . 
EDL	00:19:20,844	00:19:26,500	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But do you want to know something about an injury happening to the brain of real time ? 
EDL	00:19:26,920	00:19:28,620	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's very difficult to find . 
EDL	00:19:28,620	00:19:34,230	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So let's the kind of thing we might try to go use this for is real time concussion monitoring . 
EDL	00:19:34,230	00:19:43,550	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You actually , maybe we all see if the narrow activity your brain is changed from what it was the day before . 
EDL	00:19:43,890	00:19:50,007	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So a football player might have a very fast ability to see if they've been concussed . 
EDL	00:19:50,007	00:20:01,664	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And if we make it more important than they could do it out in around the side of the field with the earth's field , constantly trying to wash out that there will be one of the we want to do is in the military . 
EDL	00:20:01,664	00:20:03,662	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	We want to do this too far for , say , soldiers . 
EDL	00:20:03,662	00:20:05,827	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They were exposed to an explosion of some kinds . 
EDL	00:20:05,827	00:20:06,992	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's sent to the same problem . 
EDL	00:20:06,992	00:20:09,640	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	How do you know if that soldiers okay , that could continue? 
EDL	00:20:09,640	00:20:28,693	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Just in a more general sense , and just bring me briefly on the assembly , it pushes science whenever you can develop a sensor that just is more capabilities , more sensitive words , more accurate words , tapping into a signal out there on the world that other centuries have not been able to do you open up opportunities for more discovery , right ? 
EDL	00:20:28,693	00:20:35,480	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so I would think these kinds of mcdonald's coming out of ambient might also survivor us. 
EDL	00:20:35,480	00:20:48,990	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's right , it means it's a tool not just to explore magnetic fields or some particular problem , like concussions , but it's a means to see our world with a different sort of abilities . 
EDL	00:20:48,990	00:20:50,030	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And we had before . 
EDL	00:20:50,450	00:20:52,510	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And this is really fascinating thing . 
EDL	00:20:52,510	00:21:02,028	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So we , we are particular problem , and we were looking at , but the larger picture of of , how can you understand in the world around us ? 
EDL	00:21:02,028	00:21:18,177	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And anytime we can expand our capability to do that , scientists everywhere and all kinds of applications , engineers , and so we'll find a way to make the best of that and discover new things that make new types of applications capabilities . 
EDL	00:21:18,177	00:21:28,780	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So that's really , really exciting parties , figuring out how it happened to that page , then hearing accuracy and and sensitivity these , these kind of sensors can not. 
EDL	00:21:28,780	00:21:29,420	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Can give us . 
EDL	00:21:29,420	00:21:37,580	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So we've spoken about the two programs that you inherited assets and ambient , but you are in the process of rolling out to other. 
EDL	00:21:37,580	00:21:44,478	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Programs sure , so the , the first program of it was briefly mentioned as the atomic photonic integration program . 
EDL	00:21:44,478	00:21:51,250	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	He added , basically , the problem is for these really high and column sensors . 
EDL	00:21:52,310	00:22:05,410	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	The existing labor tories , did you look at these things in someone's laboratory at university say you'll instant see this large force of optics and mirrors and lasers , and just all kinds of stuff . 
EDL	00:22:05,410	00:22:15,940	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And it's amazing , scientists can do it for all that , but it takes a small army of graduate students to run all that in the symbolic and lot of money , money from taxpayers , mostly too to build . 
EDL	00:22:16,360	00:22:26,527	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So the question I had was , could we figure out a way to fabricate the equivalent sort of device that does all that stuff ? 
EDL	00:22:26,527	00:22:40,717	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And then we have a means to more quickly iterate on different design concepts to expand the state of the art and also a faster offering offered from a laboratory to a natural , practical advice . 
EDL	00:22:40,717	00:22:45,317	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So , for example , asean ambient would be examples of the kind of problem action . 
EDL	00:22:45,317	00:22:51,590	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So could you just want to fabricated the standards you just making a more copies of it more quickly released ? 
EDL	00:22:51,590	00:22:53,039	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	No , so much such a word . 
EDL	00:22:53,039	00:23:01,250	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So you're combining fatalities and electronic and circuits , another kinds of devices into a quantum , trying to make it all at once . 
EDL	00:23:01,250	00:23:06,590	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so if we could do that , I will just imagine how much faster we could go if we could do that instead . 
EDL	00:23:06,900	00:23:17,424	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So that's an automation , you know , for us in a deal deal , if we saw something that was really going to make a big impact to our national security , we can actually do something about that relatively quickly . 
EDL	00:23:17,424	00:23:19,070	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So let's let's go to. 
EDL	00:23:19,070	00:23:20,780	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Right , okay , thanks for showing that . 
EDL	00:23:20,780	00:23:24,150	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And then there is the second program we rolling out to tell me little about. 
EDL	00:23:24,150	00:23:27,098	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So quebec is another manufacturer program . 
EDL	00:23:27,098	00:23:29,555	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It saw this , this , we were talking about . 
EDL	00:23:29,555	00:23:32,504	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Environment is in the idea of tournament . 
EDL	00:23:32,504	00:23:32,750	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	and. 
EDL	00:23:33,400	00:23:36,980	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so I get them just before you go to the description for something like this. 
EDL	00:23:36,980	00:23:43,850	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Quebec stands for the column imaging of vector electronic creation and emphasize victor , because that's what the key question is . 
EDL	00:23:44,440	00:24:00,000	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So these manufacturers that we made in ambient , they are skilled amanda towners , so for for them , initiated with that means that the magnetic field , the authors of actor , you can see this field , but he looked at iron filings around , like a , like , a permanent mag . 
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:01,886	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Maybe some pictures like that . 
EDL	00:24:01,886	00:24:12,260	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Those are showing you the field lines that can occur around themselves since a little bit of a field , and imagine it is a little of an invisible field . 
EDL	00:24:12,720	00:24:17,720	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And if you try to measure that the magnitude of that , any point you really get in part of the information . 
EDL	00:24:18,350	00:24:27,801	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So instead , the question is , let's make a victor management , they can measure the three different or flag or components that magnetic field . 
EDL	00:24:27,801	00:24:32,125	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Victor explains , they say , and they will make those into a smaller way . 
EDL	00:24:32,125	00:24:39,700	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Imagine that religious , and then you can measure something called that you copy , and a magnetic field of actual beneficial . 
EDL	00:24:39,700	00:24:44,340	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Did you copy in cancer , but to copy an answer , sir , is the mathematical or speaker . 
EDL	00:24:44,340	00:24:51,460	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But it's a majority of three by three majors , or each component of the is a derivative of electrical component . 
EDL	00:24:51,460	00:24:55,047	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Would respect to a different direction of component . 
EDL	00:24:55,047	00:25:05,370	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So , for example , the delivery of domestic field in the extraction was respect a translation in the white direction would be the middle component , say that magic. 
EDL	00:25:05,370	00:25:10,170	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Okay , and so what i'm gonna actually have to ask you to do that is maybe translate that. 
EDL	00:25:10,730	00:25:14,460	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	If you succeed , what's the capability to do , so , what are we talking about this right ? 
EDL	00:25:14,460	00:25:44,061	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So there is a magic , right once you have that tensor , you now have all of the relevant information about the magnetic , you'll do to say a premier nan , and with all the information now , this quarter and background field problem is no longer a physics lesson , any more to mathematical lesson is in question , what algorithm can I use on that methodological object to deduce information about the architect looking for ? 
EDL	00:25:44,061	00:25:53,920	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And that's very , very powerful , because now you reduce the sensing problem into a computation problem , very easy computation promises to relate at three major magic is not very complicated . 
EDL	00:25:54,580	00:26:03,510	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So with that , we hope we can make a very general manager that can see almost anything we have to really make a big impact on the ability of neglect . 
EDL	00:26:03,970	00:26:09,730	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Tomatoes to build a final minute field with objects looking for , as I hope it is to the general plan for every name of tomorrow. 
EDL	00:26:09,730	00:26:18,601	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Can you concrete is that either an innocent military technology , technology , space for civilian technology , space where that can make a difference ? 
EDL	00:26:18,601	00:26:19,230	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Let's say. 
EDL	00:26:19,230	00:26:21,300	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You are a civilian . 
EDL	00:26:21,300	00:26:36,304	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	What is decreased for the moment , and you , you , you have a well ahead that maybe you , your company built has been in the ground in half fifty years old , and you don't aware of this , you know , then a field , maybe , you know , if you've got that far , you get a map somewhere . 
EDL	00:26:36,304	00:26:41,432	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You say , okay , that the well had I needed to attach to you to do something is somewhere in this . 
EDL	00:26:41,432	00:26:47,828	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	This , this handwritten field , as a very common scenario , I am a pipeline could be pipeline , something like this . 
EDL	00:26:47,828	00:26:50,930	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Yeah , okay , I want to go find and have been covered with a long ago . 
EDL	00:26:51,330	00:27:02,270	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now you have this unfortunate prompt , just like the person trying to find the hearing on the , on the beach , you have to get take a mangoes on the do you can try to find the involved . 
EDL	00:27:02,270	00:27:02,681	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	ironic . 
EDL	00:27:02,681	00:27:04,731	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Pipe says , as a nice management field . 
EDL	00:27:04,731	00:27:13,234	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But if the systematically , you know , a few inches over the ground may be surveyed the entire field , trying to find that welfare , but we've quarrel . 
EDL	00:27:13,234	00:27:16,261	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Imagine how to do that if you are just in range . 
EDL	00:27:16,261	00:27:26,350	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so instead of pandas surveyed the whole field systematically and do a big analysis on the whole , management should take days , if not longer to find . 
EDL	00:27:26,750	00:27:35,340	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now you go out to the field of your kind of clothes if you measure your imaginative field , and it tells you there it is , and you go there find it . 
EDL	00:27:35,340	00:27:36,200	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Now you're done . 
EDL	00:27:36,200	00:27:39,100	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Could you actually put them on a drawing that actually is a good question ? 
EDL	00:27:39,100	00:27:40,700	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's exactly how they actually do it . 
EDL	00:27:40,700	00:27:44,520	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	They had dropped megacities from drones and do the surveying that way . 
EDL	00:27:44,520	00:27:45,990	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But it does very long time . 
EDL	00:27:45,990	00:27:47,120	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Nor did you do that. 
EDL	00:27:47,120	00:27:53,106	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	John , in an email exchange , you wrote something that really intrigued me , here's what you wrote . 
EDL	00:27:53,106	00:28:04,789	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I like to make the point that quantum sensors can observe electric , magnetic and inertial forces , or gravitation more accurately than anything else , at least in in laboratory laboratory skills . 
EDL	00:28:04,789	00:28:13,867	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And then you said , when you really think about this in compasses , every part of our world , because all about human experience is governed by these forces . 
EDL	00:28:13,867	00:28:15,140	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's amazing to me . 
EDL	00:28:15,140	00:28:17,688	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I love thinking about new circumstances . 
EDL	00:28:17,688	00:28:27,037	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	This way gives me some sense of why we go about it , but we've also been measuring electrical , magnetic inertial forces without some of the sensors you have in mind . 
EDL	00:28:27,037	00:28:31,210	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So what are we gained by building one term sensor is like the ones who are pursuing. 
EDL	00:28:31,210	00:28:32,688	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's all about noising . 
EDL	00:28:32,688	00:28:35,151	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Sensitivity may be an accuracy . 
EDL	00:28:35,151	00:28:44,644	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You know , the original sort of sensors or devices or mechanical clocks , are just sort of a special cases where it is sort of the oldest right at pendulum clock . 
EDL	00:28:44,644	00:28:49,610	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You see that on the wall , and you know , kind of that number of accuracy is more of a display piece . 
EDL	00:28:49,610	00:28:57,040	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Why is that all we replaced that mechanical device with an electrical one and logical component ? 
EDL	00:28:57,040	00:28:58,320	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Where is that ? 
EDL	00:28:58,320	00:29:03,100	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	All , of course , will be a hospital in your rest watching , that's , let's wait better from an across point of view . 
EDL	00:29:04,030	00:29:20,060	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And this is influenced true for , for , like , save a manufacturer , you can make a management with a permanent management on , like some kind attention , right and make an mechanical sort of negative , like a campus actual issue that says the first accomplishes the manufacturers of mechanical one . 
EDL	00:29:20,690	00:29:21,860	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So that's all . 
EDL	00:29:21,860	00:29:24,140	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's great , but going to our logical systems . 
EDL	00:29:24,140	00:29:45,621	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And finally , now to a quantum systems is really just about improving the accuracy and sensitivity of these kinds of so the wise , that , well as it's simply because that in the quantum world noise and it sort of errors are just the physical properties are driving . 
EDL	00:29:45,621	00:29:49,820	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Those sorts of mechanisms are just a lot . 
EDL	00:29:49,820	00:29:56,240	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So the and their noise properties are unable to to making the best advice , as we know how to make . 
EDL	00:29:56,240	00:29:57,610	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So it in every field . 
EDL	00:29:57,610	00:30:00,050	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Luca said , a luxury gravity of magnetic . 
EDL	00:30:00,050	00:30:07,226	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	We don't get a quantum of nuclear force measurement system yet , but I imagine what could make one in the future . 
EDL	00:30:07,226	00:30:17,955	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But the royal economic analysis , because of this inherent accuracy that based on this industrial alone so long , maybe a story that trying to figure out why exactly that is . 
EDL	00:30:17,955	00:30:23,280	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But that's the fundamental reason is that the quantum devices , the noise properties that. 
EDL	00:30:23,280	00:30:24,251	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Logical organic ones . 
EDL	00:30:24,251	00:30:28,350	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So you can reiterating something , but feel free to elaborate us , free flame . 
EDL	00:30:28,350	00:30:48,100	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And again , what's so exciting to me about , that is one of the , the new technological opportunities that these kinds of sensing devices would allow , but it also the takes away our otherwise might be a blindness to certain kinds of phenomenon that are out there , but we don't see them because we don't have the essentials that are good enough to detect. 
EDL	00:30:48,600	00:30:49,050	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That's right . 
EDL	00:30:49,050	00:31:01,085	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I mean , if you , you know , take a little volume in space in your house , or you know , some world , anywhere else in the universe , the fundamental forces are playing a little violent . 
EDL	00:31:01,085	00:31:06,512	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Meanwhile , there are what it feels there , the magnetic fields there , there is gravity . 
EDL	00:31:06,512	00:31:11,550	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	There are four times moving through that space that in a result or radio waves . 
EDL	00:31:11,550	00:31:24,081	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It's all there , and our eyes are just special versions that are eyeballs of biological sensor measuring article fields to watch the special case and watching the field in a animals have named towners . 
EDL	00:31:24,081	00:31:31,767	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Don't introduce them to take a navigate around the world that takes one time to figure out that even as possible . 
EDL	00:31:31,767	00:31:46,180	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	But this fundamental forces govern everything so for us to build a peer behind the current and satisfactory to see more and more of what's everywhere around us and understand that bill reproduce that we can all agree or were saying . 
EDL	00:31:46,920	00:31:51,490	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	That is , I think the ultimate sort of ability to see the. 
EDL	00:31:52,430	00:31:56,330	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Well , that was great , fascinating way to think about you to move in the state of the art of sensor . 
EDL	00:31:56,330	00:32:00,030	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So thanks for sharing out that now we are running at times . 
EDL	00:32:00,030	00:32:04,520	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I wanna ask you one of the question , which is , what question do you wish ? 
EDL	00:32:04,520	00:32:08,490	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I had asked that I did not ask in a very such a question . 
EDL	00:32:08,490	00:32:09,750	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You should ask it. 
EDL	00:32:10,240	00:32:29,570	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I have a question horizon , you know , the question is , why would climb devices be more accurate , and I say , accurate , because sensitivity in being out of the world that really a different question from knowing what you're seeing is truly what the world is gift showing you like that . 
EDL	00:32:29,570	00:32:30,960	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	We can agree on the same thing . 
EDL	00:32:31,880	00:32:42,370	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And that to me , as I should even more powerful still , it's easy to maybe imagine making more sense of devices like you see more signal . 
EDL	00:32:42,370	00:32:44,440	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I'll have less noise , but for you . 
EDL	00:32:44,440	00:32:46,200	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And I did not agree with that . 
EDL	00:32:46,200	00:32:57,180	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I have to do anything in advance that our devices see the same thing means that we can also build upon our mutual measurements and collaborate more easily . 
EDL	00:32:57,180	00:33:04,220	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And that's really powerful to have , you know , accurate measurements of the world around us that we can all agree on . 
EDL	00:33:04,220	00:33:18,797	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so quantum devices are especially good if that there are more sensitive tools and that's useful , and whether also more accurate in the reason is because most of these things are based on adults , not all but those in every adam , exactly exactly the same . 
EDL	00:33:18,797	00:33:18,992	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	try . 
EDL	00:33:18,992	00:33:25,838	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	You can't manufacturer something to be exactly the same about how hard you drive is always manufacturing train challenges . 
EDL	00:33:25,838	00:33:34,513	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	These lines were using items , every single items , exactly the same issues has some hydrogen , and attack is the exact same hydrogen that I had in my tech . 
EDL	00:33:34,513	00:33:38,510	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	And so we can , it means for growing upon our measurements. 
EDL	00:33:38,510	00:33:46,830	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	It sort of like the ultimate reference by which we can all agree on what we're seeing , and what maybe the numbers from our instruments are telling us . 
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:48,820	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	May you succeed it . 
EDL	00:33:48,820	00:33:53,550	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	All of these , these efforts adopt , and then beyond that . 
EDL	00:33:53,550	00:33:56,640	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	So I just want to thank you john , this time with me. 
EDL	00:33:57,060	00:33:58,170	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Well , there was a lot of fun . 
EDL	00:33:58,170	00:34:03,840	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	I hope it turns into something that people really can be kind of learn from it and see a little bit more about doing. 
EDL	00:34:04,330	00:34:18,050	| VfD E30 The Sensor Sorcerer |	Thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from darker thanks also to bend , celebrate in town shortage for their partnership in producing this program .
