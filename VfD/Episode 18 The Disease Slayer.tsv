EDL	00:02:23,616	00:02:25,152	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What are the origins of those in
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:27,456	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It started pretty young
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:31,552	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I have this childhood memory of being ass at my school
EDL	00:02:32,064	00:02:35,648	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The Catholic school and I was meeting with one of the priests and they simple what do you really want to do
EDL	00:02:36,160	00:02:37,696	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And I said I wanted to be a pediatrician
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And they said
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:42,560	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Why an end and I said well
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,328	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Cuz
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:44,352	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Just want to take care of people
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I want to take care of children
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:52,288	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And I do think it stems from my mom was a nurse and so I think less so from the info
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Florence Ave
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:58,176	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Being around someone in the medical profession but more so just being around somebody that cares very deeply about other
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:03:04,832	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Again very early on and it's a but it's been it's been sort of a consistent part of my life that is really
EDL	00:03:04,832	00:03:11,232	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Yeah this was in fourth grade this whole like you know I wanted to be a pediatrician the toys I was on this trajectory and I didn't know
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:15,584	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Of course what I was talking about you make these decisions early in your life
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:20,448	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But my parents and my family always had this incredibly strong ethic of service
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,032	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And very deeply and fundamentally cuz I reflect on the soffit
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:25,056	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Actually it's like
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:28,640	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Who am I in and what am I supposed to be and I think
EDL	00:03:29,152	00:03:30,688	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What I do is I survived
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:31,968	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That's that's how I defined my
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,040	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Maybe one of the greatest gifts from my parents was
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:41,952	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	My dad was active duty Navy officer did RTC and served as a nuclear engineer
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,232	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	On a Surface Warfare ship
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:46,560	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It was actually for five or six years stayed in the Navy for another 20 plus
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Retired as a Navy captain in the reserves
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:53,728	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You couple my mom's passion for helping other people in the medical
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:57,312	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Field with my dad's passion of serving our country
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:01,408	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	This is almost like all I knew until that trajectory his would have guided me through all of my
EDL	00:04:02,432	00:04:08,320	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Okay well if that's actually talk a little bit about that in before you came to drop you spent almost 15 years in a variety of

EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,679	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Erectile and other places I'm sure what did you learn from
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,215	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	All of that Global Experience
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,007	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I would start by saying what a privilege
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,799	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What a privilege
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:31,871	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To have those types of life experience
EDL	00:04:32,383	00:04:33,919	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	All in the context of
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:36,479	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Again feelings that I'm serving my country and make
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:43,391	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Some of the work that I'm most proud of frankly is work I did in the caucuses with Georgia and Azerbaijan and
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:45,439	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The program
EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:48,255	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What was under the auspices was called The Cooperative threat reduction
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,327	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But really my rule there was
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:55,167	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To engage their Public Health Community
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:56,703	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And their medical research community
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:03,359	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To establish that capability of finding infectious diseases diagnosing them in Ultimate
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:03,871	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Treating them
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,431	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And it was a capability that was
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:11,295	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Those public health systems were all part of the Soviet Union but when the Soviet Union fell
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,111	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	These countries were kind of left to their own to
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,647	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Recreate a public health in.
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:17,695	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so the privileged
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:23,071	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Was to work with those experts in the host country to say how do we build that back up a
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:27,935	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So that you can tell us that there's an outbreak going on and then we can
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,239	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Collectively work together to respond to that
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:32,031	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So did you bring in models like
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,823	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The centers of Disease Control
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:40,223	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Did we did we work closely with the Embassy Suite work closely with the state department we work closely with the CD
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,015	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	DC at the end of the day
EDL	00:05:42,015	00:05:46,111	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It was myself and some of my DOD colleagues on the ground
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,903	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Near rolling our sleeves up
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:50,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Helping these countries develop the system
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,511	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Developing laboratory capabilities
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:55,583	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Developing the ability to do clinical research
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:59,423	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	2 ethical standards that would be accepted all over the world and to
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,983	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Figure out how to do this you know again I look fat
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,287	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What a privilege to be on the ground
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:09,151	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm at and at this point fairly Junior in my career and to help by the entire nation
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,919	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Improve the public health
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Another cat sound like
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,223	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The great privilege
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:14,527	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What is the sequence of events matthat
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:15,807	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Resulted in your
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:16,831	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Current position here
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,343	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	DART bus app
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,695	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Drop my medical career I had heard about.
EDL	00:06:21,695	00:06:23,231	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And I had seen
EDL	00:06:23,231	00:06:25,791	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Amazing technology that is
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:28,607	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Come from DARPA that were aimed at addressing infection
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,119	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Kisses
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,423	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So I always admired from afar
EDL	00:06:31,423	00:06:34,495	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Before I joined our pie was over at the White House National
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:35,007	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Security Council
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And in that role my job was to
EDL	00:06:39,103	00:06:43,455	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Identify what capabilities we do not have to respond to pandemics
EDL	00:06:43,455	00:06:48,575	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And then how we can organize ourselves as a government not just DOD but as an entire government
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,647	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Towards addressing this Gap so we're ready for the next
EDL	00:06:52,415	00:06:54,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And while I was there I got tapped on the shoulder
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:56,255	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And the
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,815	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Concise phrase was
EDL	00:06:58,815	00:07:02,911	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You're doing all of this policy what we should do as a government
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,703	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	How would you then
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:06,239	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Like to implement
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:08,287	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And actually
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,079	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Make investments
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:11,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	They're going to address us
EDL	00:07:11,615	00:07:14,175	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So that's where you literally tapped on the shoulder
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:20,575	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Was supposed to say It was Doctor Jeff Ling was the death
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:21,855	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	AP director of DSO at
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:22,623	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The time
EDL	00:07:22,623	00:07:23,391	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:25,951	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	He at least I met him for coffee one morning
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,975	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And he
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:30,815	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Didn't literally actually put his hand on my shoulder but
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:34,143	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Figuratively imagine a hand on my shoulder
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:34,911	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Saying
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:40,543	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	How would you like to try a DARPA to actually invest make a difference
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:44,127	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	For all those things that you've been talking about in her the big policy word
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:51,807	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Well and of course he provided a model of audacity because he really took on Trump
EDL	00:07:51,807	00:07:57,183	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Prosthetics and other programs to really help by the Warfighter why don't we Segway than into
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:00,767	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Your life is a program manager here in this tremendous portfolio
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:06,143	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That you've developed which is I think a portfolio that also reflects some kind of audacious
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:06,911	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Point of view
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:08,191	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	As of course
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,983	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	A reflected by that statement earlier
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:16,895	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You want to take the lethal power out of infectious disease so the names are fantastic some of them like
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:20,991	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Prometheus and Thor dialysis like Therapeutics in vivonet
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,551	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	A Platforms in will probably talk more about one of them and
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,319	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Particular
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:25,855	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The pandemic prevention plan
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,439	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What I'm hoping to do now is if you could briefly take us
EDL	00:08:29,951	00:08:31,487	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	For a tour of your program
EDL	00:08:31,487	00:08:33,023	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Cuz we can't go in depth about any of them
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:34,559	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	At this point
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:37,119	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Take me to a little bit of a torrent
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,167	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What you're hoping to achieve with some of these programs
EDL	00:08:39,167	00:08:40,703	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And then we'll focus in a little bit more
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,727	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pandemic
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:45,055	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Yeah so that tour starts by saying
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:46,847	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What what problems are we trying to solve
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And again
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,663	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	At the White House Nashville
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,223	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Security Council staff I got a chance to say
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:53,503	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Look for these
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Major outbreak
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,343	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pandemics are near pandemic
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,391	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	How have we done as a government
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:02,207	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Think about the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:03,999	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I think about the West Africa
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:08,095	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Ebola crisis H1N1 influenza
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:13,727	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Influenza think about the West Africa ebola crisis think about how we've recently responded to zika
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:18,591	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	They're coming themes throughout and some of those common themes are we need to be much better
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,639	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	At diagnosing if someone has
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:24,735	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we need to go A Step Beyond that and imagine a world
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,271	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That if we could
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Figure out if someone
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:29,087	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is going to be sick
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,879	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Or is going to be contagious
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:34,207	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We can intervene and stop the outbreak writing
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,231	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that's for me
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:36,255	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that's the Prometheus
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:40,351	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But we also need to make vaccines and treatments much fast
EDL	00:09:40,351	00:09:41,375	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Then we currently
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:44,959	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that's one of the examples is the pandemic prevention plan
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:48,031	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We need alternate ways of how we treat infection
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,591	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And using portable dialysis
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:52,895	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To filter the blood and remove any type of path
EDL	00:09:53,407	00:09:54,431	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is a good example
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:10:00,319	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But the purchase in that case is that mean I might by might have been exposed to some kind of pathogenic agents
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,855	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In my blood certain
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:04,159	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Level so it would this kind of Technology
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:07,487	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Remove that before could take hold and actually get me sick
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:09,279	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Was that the idea of that yes
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,327	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And it the idea would be
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Again
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:15,423	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Especially for pathogens where we don't have a vaccine
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:16,959	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Where we don't have it
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:22,591	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Especially think about now with what we're seeing so much of antimicrobial resistance
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:23,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Bacteria
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,639	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Imagine if
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,175	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Where we can't use antibiotics
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:29,503	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So if we can filter your blood and remove that Passage
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,623	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What has ultimately gives a leg-up for your own immune response to ultimately
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,647	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Make you well again
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,951	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We like that technology especially
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:42,815	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In those first days when we need to buy some time to develop a vaccine and when
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:47,679	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so my point across the portfolio is that
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,775	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We have lots of investments in medical diagnostic
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:58,175	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Text we're investing in modeling to forecast where infectious diseases are going to go we have Investments and accelerate
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,943	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Braiding new treatment
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,479	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But they're all connected together
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:01,759	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	They are all linked
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,783	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And let me give you an example
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:05,087	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	With our Prometheus program
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:07,903	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Predicting if someone is going to become contagious
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:09,695	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Awesome right
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:10,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We can do that
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:14,303	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But once we predict and identify that person
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:15,071	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We still have to
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:15,583	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To treat them
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:17,119	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,887	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We're going to need
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,399	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Treatment
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:19,935	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Fast as possible
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:21,727	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	With our pandemic River
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,239	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pension platform
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:27,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And the beauty is that those treatments are probably going to be most of
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,151	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Active when they're given as early as possible
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:29,919	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:33,503	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I think of our whole portfolio as interconnected
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:37,599	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That we develop a lot of different specific projects to hit capabilities
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:40,671	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But that their ultimate league going to intertwine
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So that we stop the outbreak in it
EDL	00:11:42,719	00:11:46,303	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Tracks well when I think of programs or darbydale have a kind of
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:48,607	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Lifecycle to them right I mean lately certain started
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:52,959	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Glimmer in the eye of Someone Like You matter program manager
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:56,031	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	There's a. Wedding and working with others here to really
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,055	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Articulate
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And formulate the program is
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,615	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Best of candy soda
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:06,015	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It's can be most effective and then kind of smoke signals go out to the world and seeking people who maybe think that they can pull offs
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:10,111	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Some of these audacious tasks that we'd be without course then the research is done and hopefully
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,879	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In the end
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:12,415	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You succeed or if not
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:13,951	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Fully succeed you learn from
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	All the research
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:16,255	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What's going on
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,559	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What is the status of that life cycle
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:20,095	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Of the pandemic
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,375	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Prevention platform
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,679	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The democratization platform
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,191	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Just launched
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:28,543	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so and by lunchtime those who might not know what that means in the DARPA context
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:32,639	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Said that that means that completing the Contracting process
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:33,919	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So that are performers
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,735	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That were selected in a very rigorous process
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,783	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Can now accomplish the goals of
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:39,295	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The program
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,111	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So they're just starting in there for 6
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	As part of the life cycle
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,439	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	These are early days
EDL	00:12:45,951	00:12:49,535	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Early days because the ultimate goal of that program is so
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,047	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Difficult
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:53,375	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm we have a lot to eat on some ways I feel like what we have
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,399	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We have a long way to go
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:57,471	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	One of the key points though of the pandemic prevention Platte
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:59,007	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is that
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,543	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The goal is
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,311	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Incredibly ambitious
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:04,639	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But there is foundational scientific evidence
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:06,175	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That this can be done
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:09,759	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that foundational scientific evidence is derived
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,807	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	From a previous DARPA program
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:15,903	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that previous Circle parade other approved the concept of depth
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,183	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That's the Adept program
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:21,535	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Because when I looked over the program it's fascinating to me cuz it looks like
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,583	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We're trying to rev up the whole
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:26,911	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Brilliance molecular world of anybody
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:32,799	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so I want you to go through this the sequence events beginning with this earlier program at depth
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:39,199	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Yeah but walk us through some of the steps because when I look at anybody's to Armand my favorite proteins when I look at them
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:40,223	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	William things like
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:42,015	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So selective
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:47,135	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Find the thing that we don't want our bodies like gloves anyway you tell us the pieces of the program
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:49,695	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And you know I haven't I couldn't agree more
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:56,607	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I think all of us that are fascinated by DARPA right this very uncommon thing is we are just a man
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,375	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Amazed
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:00,447	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	By the natural world and what the natural world has developed
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,239	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Antibodies are grade exam
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:05,055	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I mean there are millions and millions
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,407	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Of these different versions of antibody circulating through your body at all times
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,687	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:13,247	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The mechanisms are so refined and intricate
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,783	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To select
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,551	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Okay
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:18,111	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Which are the antibodies that are most protective
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,647	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	When you're exposed to an infection
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:23,743	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And your body goes through the process of them making a lot of those in a short. Of time
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:27,839	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I think it's mind-boggling how advanced that system is
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:31,679	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We've learned so much about antibodies in the last 50 years
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,751	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You're absolutely right we want to Leverage
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:39,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	All of that information that we know how they work now and we know all that we know about their structure
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:42,431	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We know how to make them in big vast and why can't we use that
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,991	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And you're seeing incredible progress in medicine
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:46,271	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Where we are using the
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:49,343	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Where you're seeing antibodies approved as products now
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:50,879	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	For cancer tree
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:58,047	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	For treating autoimmune disease or the category of biological index in the category of biological tomasovic
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:14:59,327	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Explosion in that space
EDL	00:14:59,327	00:15:03,167	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we want to use all of that knowledge in that technology
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,447	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To solve infectious diseases
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:09,311	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What we do at DARPA though is the fun part is we couple different fields together
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,335	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:15,199	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	As you correctly pointed out this extraordinary powerful tool of antibody in
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:17,247	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Engineering but can we couple that
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:20,063	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	With the the revolution that we seen in in genetic
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,855	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that's
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,671	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That's DARPA right it's taking two different areas
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Seeing if we can mix them together
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:32,351	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Again an antibody specialist might not think about the opportunities with genetics
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,679	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The genetic specialist might not think we'll wonder if I could
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:38,495	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Use my use genetic engineering to make an antibody
EDL	00:15:39,007	00:15:43,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You bring the two Fields together in the more you know by RR Magic
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:46,175	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Bringing them the disciplines together we achieve that effect
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,455	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:48,991	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The proof-of-concept
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:51,039	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Which I find exhilarating
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:52,831	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Chills up and down my spine
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:54,879	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is that
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:56,671	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We can give you a
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,463	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Piece of DNA
EDL	00:15:58,463	00:15:59,743	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Or piece of RNA
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,279	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:02,047	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We can
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,327	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Put that into your muscle cells
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,631	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that your muscle cells
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,167	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Say okay got it
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:10,751	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I am going to make this antibody that is so protective
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,287	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That someone's knocking
EDL	00:16:12,287	00:16:14,335	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that's encoded by these nucleic acid
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:18,943	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The RNA and TRNA tells that muscle cell to the muscle cells doing what a muscle cell does
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,015	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But once that RNA gets inside that muscle cell
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:23,039	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The muscle cell size
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Right
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:27,135	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm going to make a protective antibody is going to protect you from evil
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,927	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And to do that in a
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,207	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Fairly short period of time
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:34,047	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And that idea would sound crazy 10 years ago
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,839	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Too many obstacles can't be done
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,375	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The foundational investment
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,167	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm from DARPA
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:40,959	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Prove that console
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:43,263	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In many different animal models for many different
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:47,359	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Fight because we're DARPA we said we're great we proved the concept
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,383	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That wasn't good enough
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:51,455	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It wasn't good enough for me it wasn't good enough for the DARPA leadership
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,503	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	DARPA leadership said
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,551	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Okay that's great but we need to burp the baby
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,855	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	If we're going to take
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,903	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pandemics off the table
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:01,183	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Nets
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Why I'm here
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,487	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We need to be able to
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,023	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Put this together
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,303	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	As a platform
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,863	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That can go start
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:09,375	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To finish
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:13,983	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	From Once Upon A pigeon is identified to making thousands of doses
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,519	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Of this
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:16,799	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Miraculous
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:20,639	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Antibody-based antibody-based treatment
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:22,175	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Incredibly short
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:22,687	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Period of time
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:26,015	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Right and let's let's talk about the time scale for a minute cuz that's part of the
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:27,295	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Did the big deal here right
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,319	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What I've seen is
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:34,463	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Within 60 days of identifying the the pathogenic agent actually have these doses right in hand
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,255	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm in a distributable for MS
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:37,535	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That's correct
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:39,327	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Rain-X wipers to what
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,095	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is it to what's the state of
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:43,167	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The state-of-the-art today depends on infect
EDL	00:17:43,935	00:17:45,983	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But let's use some some reason example
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:50,079	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We currently have some zika vaccines in clinical trials but
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:52,383	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We've been working now for a few years
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:54,687	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we don't have a license
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,199	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Steak and Shake
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:18:00,575	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You think about our Reese when we talked about gaps you think about all of these recent out
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:06,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And one of the fundamental Essence is that we haven't had vaccines and treatments that are ready in time
EDL	00:18:07,743	00:18:08,767	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:09,791	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We came up
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:11,583	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That the 60-day
EDL	00:18:11,583	00:18:12,095	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Golf
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,143	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Has been controversial
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,215	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	When we talk about audacity
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:20,031	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You know I have
EDL	00:18:20,031	00:18:24,127	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Professional colleagues laugh at me I've been on panels
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,967	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We're right here discuss the program
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:30,783	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And the other panelists joined with the audience at laughing at me
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,087	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So I knew we were in the right space
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:37,183	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The counter-argument that I continually make to the critics is
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:40,511	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	60 days is dictated by what we need
EDL	00:18:41,023	00:18:42,303	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To respond to pandemic
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:46,143	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So if you don't agree that our approach has the right way
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,935	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Then come up with an alternative
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:52,799	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Because we can't negotiate with Mother Nature and say what would like another 6 months if
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:53,311	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	If you don't mind
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:57,919	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Especially when you think about the catastrophic consequences
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:58,431	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Accordingly
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,711	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,991	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We have to be
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:01,759	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We have to do this with
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,575	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And I think again
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:06,623	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Profoundly excited cuz I think we found a way to do it
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:09,951	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I want to try to make this concrete for a listeners
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:13,279	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What you've actually done fairly well just now what I thought of another way we met
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:13,791	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I do this
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,351	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	By combining
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:18,143	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You know kind of almost at the the
EDL	00:19:18,655	00:19:20,959	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Gaming out to the Future where let's say you are success
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:24,543	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And may you be successful with this P3 program
EDL	00:19:25,823	00:19:26,591	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pandemic
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Prevention plan
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,383	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Program
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,735	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Let's say that you had that P3
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:33,503	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Ability
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,295	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Back in the 1918 Spanish
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,599	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I've seen different numbers of
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:38,879	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	50 million
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,463	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pandemic
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,767	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	If this technology existed back
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:46,303	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In the early part of the
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,327	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Last century
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,863	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	How would that unhappy
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:49,375	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Have unfolded
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:51,679	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Well my hope
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:52,959	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is that
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:54,751	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	50 million people down.
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,287	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:58,335	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Leanne Again part of this is
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,871	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Can you detect that we have a new virus
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:01,663	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	RI new version
EDL	00:20:02,431	00:20:03,199	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Of influenza
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:07,807	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we detect very early on in the process when it's first starting out in a given country
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,367	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm satisfied that it's happening
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,903	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We flipped the switch
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,439	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we say
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,719	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	For that new virus
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,791	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We need 20000 doses
EDL	00:20:17,791	00:20:19,071	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That have to be ready within six
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:22,143	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And then we go to win that outbreak
EDL	00:20:22,143	00:20:22,655	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	His first start
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,703	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Wade NFI who's sick
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,263	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We treat those people
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,311	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm that are most likely to be contagious
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:31,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we stop the outbreak
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:31,871	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Strack's
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,175	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	If we added we could have stopped the Spanish Flu
EDL	00:20:34,175	00:20:35,967	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I think even more important
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:39,295	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Right now today you and I both know
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:43,391	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	People who are getting very sick with influenza we're seeing a severe season
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:47,231	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we're seeing unfortunately children.
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:50,047	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We're seeing unfortunately
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:53,887	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Otherwise completely healthy people having dianping Hospital
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,471	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Influenza does that to us every year
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:21:00,031	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We imagine a world where this platform
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,311	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Could be used
EDL	00:21:01,311	00:21:03,103	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To take seasonal influenza
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,431	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Write an amazing thought because
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:07,711	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I mean this gets back to
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:09,759	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Several times
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,783	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You said what a privilege
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:11,551	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It is
EDL	00:21:11,551	00:21:13,087	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To do what you're doing because
EDL	00:21:13,087	00:21:13,855	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Succeed
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,647	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You will know and I know you won't take this
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:17,696	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pumping you up personally
EDL	00:21:18,208	00:21:18,720	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It's more for what it do
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,512	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You know
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:21,280	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Kind of humanity
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:23,328	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But you will know you've had a pardon
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:24,096	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Potentially saving
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:25,376	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	People's lives
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:25,888	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	By cutting leaves
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:27,424	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	A pandemic
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:28,448	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Experiences
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,216	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Does off
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:31,776	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I'll before they really get going and spread so
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:37,664	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Really quite an amazing event and I would make two points the first is that
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,944	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	DARPA
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:42,016	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	My my put my team does not do this alone
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,552	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	DARPA does not do this
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:47,392	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We work incredibly closely
EDL	00:21:47,904	00:21:52,512	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	With our colleagues in Health and Human Services with other experts in the department of
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:54,048	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Defense in the US government
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:57,120	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	As well as philanthropy as well as
EDL	00:21:57,120	00:21:58,144	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The private sector
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:21:59,680	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And as well as the global community
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:02,496	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is It ultimately a global teamwork
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,568	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That's going to take these infectious disease
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:08,896	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Off the table but make no mistake we can say
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,944	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It sounds hard and it's ambitious and it's crazy
EDL	00:22:11,456	00:22:13,504	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But I challenge you to say why not
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:17,856	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Need a white why aren't we as a society putting incredible
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:18,880	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Even more effort
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,672	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Into taking these infection
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:23,488	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Tri-Cities is off the table if we have the if we have the scientific know how to
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:26,048	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	This is what I think we should be
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:27,584	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It's a moonshot
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:28,864	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But why not go friendly
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:31,936	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And why not go for a moon shot for
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,984	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Again something that could
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,520	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Kill another 50 million
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,592	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Why not take a moon shot against
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:43,200	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis I mean we've seen
EDL	00:22:43,200	00:22:47,552	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You know there's there's effort in there there's Global effort that's absolutely tremendous
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:48,576	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Why not more
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:53,440	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Samantha just a little while ago you and I were kind of gushing about the molecular
EDL	00:22:53,440	00:22:54,720	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Beauty in the biology
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:56,000	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	SHOW beauty of antibody
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:57,024	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Specificities
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,072	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To go out in
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:22:59,840	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Find whatever
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:02,656	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The hell threatening agent might be in
EDL	00:23:02,656	00:23:03,680	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Kind of man
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,984	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The role that plays in our own bodies
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:07,264	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Fight against
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:08,800	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Health compromise
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:10,592	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Exposures
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:16,224	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I guess I kind of want to ask you to do you have a favorite
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:19,040	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Infectious disease in the sense that you admire
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:20,576	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What the bacteria
EDL	00:23:21,088	00:23:21,856	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Virus
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:24,672	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Does is learn how to do over
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:25,440	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The course of evolution
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:28,000	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,792	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Lights are in a slightly different way
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:31,328	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I think it's a
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:35,936	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	When we say we want to take infection
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,960	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Diseases off the table
EDL	00:23:37,984	00:23:40,288	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In some ways its it's ridiculous because
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,824	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We're always going to have
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,872	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We're always going to have
EDL	00:23:43,872	00:23:47,200	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Viruses and bacteria that are part of the natural world
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:48,224	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And
EDL	00:23:49,504	00:23:50,272	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:53,088	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And we've always seen them as the enemy or
EDL	00:23:53,088	00:23:54,880	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Pathogens is the word that we use
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:59,488	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	One of the interesting ways to think about the problem though is that
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:05,120	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Part of it is that they are a pathogen but part of it is how we respond
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:06,912	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,704	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Modulating
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:11,264	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	How our own body response to pathogens
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:13,568	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is a major theme of what we're trying to do
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:15,616	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	With antibodies being one of many example
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:17,152	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,968	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You're one of the traditional attitudes of antibiotics has
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:24,064	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Antibiotics that have been wonderful and certainly profoundly impactful
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,344	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In terms of our society
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:27,136	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	As we were as we come along
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:31,488	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But we've also discovered the unintended consequences of giving a broad-spectrum antibiotic
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Concurring my
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,048	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Antimicrobial resistance and
EDL	00:24:34,048	00:24:35,072	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Things like that as well
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:36,352	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:38,656	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The world that I imagine
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,424	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is that
EDL	00:24:39,936	00:24:41,472	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	There is I guess
EDL	00:24:41,472	00:24:44,032	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Like you said before it appreciation of Passage
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:46,336	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Depreciation of viruses and bacteria
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:47,616	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Understanding
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,896	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What they do and what they don't do
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:56,320	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It's not always wiping them out but more about rendering them harmless or figuring out ways to cut it
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:56,832	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Coexist
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,392	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is where I would like are thinking to go on the toy
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,952	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:07,584	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Statistics about the number of mammalian cells in me and you and the number of bacterial cells
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:13,984	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And there's for the world's most from just the numbers perspective way more bacteria than we are we are
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,032	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But there most of the time this is
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	This is a symbiosis
EDL	00:25:17,312	00:25:19,104	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	This is a mutually beneficial relationship
EDL	00:25:19,872	00:25:21,152	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:22,432	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I did really we shouldn't always
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,456	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I think about these
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:24,480	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	These microbes
EDL	00:25:24,992	00:25:26,016	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Things to eat to
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,784	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	2
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:28,320	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Consider the minute we shouldn't consider
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:32,160	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That's right that's right and the other part is that we learn from them
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:34,208	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It's its their evolution
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,280	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That also kind of inspires us and so
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:38,048	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It's a
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:41,632	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That in some ways there are adversary but in some ways they're sort of that
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:49,056	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	But you know when the superhero novels and things like that this idea of the the the balance between the hero and
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,336	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The villain in sort of that
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:55,712	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Estranged relationship that often develops between the two end if you will meet mutual appreciation
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,248	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is that I think that's awesome pathogen
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:00,064	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Tonight we're coming toward the end
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,088	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Part-time hero
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:03,136	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Just wondering if
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,208	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Something that didn't come up
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:08,768	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	During our discussion that you think would be oven
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:10,304	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To our listeners
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,096	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You know your
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:12,608	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Go hero
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:13,888	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Scrubzah
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:15,680	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Ridding us of
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Some of some of the
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:17,472	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The concerns we have
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:19,776	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The pathogens
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:23,872	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Yeah what are munchers at DARPA is this idea of
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:27,712	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Inspiring inspiring creativity and new solutions to
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:29,760	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And often times
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,552	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	We say by sort of
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:34,624	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Recruiting in people who have not traditionally thought about our problems
EDL	00:26:35,904	00:26:37,952	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To help us with the solution
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:43,328	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so you know I would love for the listeners of this podcast
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:45,376	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To be more inspired
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:47,168	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To address
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,448	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Other problems in infectious
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:48,960	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Diseases
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:50,752	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What I mean by that is
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:55,616	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I always say people like me have to leave investor in tires
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:58,944	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Careers in our life work into this and we have deep knowledge
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,248	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The subject
EDL	00:27:01,248	00:27:02,784	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	I love the thought of
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:04,832	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	People that have expertise in
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:05,344	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Computer science
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,136	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,672	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	In
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:12,256	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	What we would say well maybe those fields aren't necessarily obviously related
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,792	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	How to
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,072	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That's how we're going to solve

EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:20,704	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	And so when I speak on this it's almost part
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:21,984	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	One part recruiting
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:26,080	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	It's especially recruiting those that may not have all of the biases
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:28,640	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Of the traditional experts in infectious
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:31,456	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	To come up with a creative solution
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:31,968	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	The solve it
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	So
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:35,552	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That makes me think of a term that

EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,160	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,696	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Cuz you just mentioned
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,976	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Whole bunch of discipline
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:43,488	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Put in a maybe
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:47,328	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	When you first think about infections that you might not think some of the
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,888	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Come together so it is there something about
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:52,704	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	You and being here at DARPA
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:53,472	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	That
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:57,568	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Is conducive to show the shaking up that Innovation ecosystem in ways that
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,616	| Episode 18 The Disease Slayer |	Maybe move for the goals that you have
