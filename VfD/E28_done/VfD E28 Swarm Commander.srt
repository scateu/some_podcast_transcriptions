2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:19,976
Stealth Technology, the Internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation

3
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:31,700
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958, in the midst of the cold war, DARPA the defence advanced research project agency has been a driver of technology.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:39,420
Welcome to Voices from DARPA, a window onto the DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine was possible

5
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,780
My name is Ivan Amato. I'm  your DARPA host

6
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:55,220
On this occasion, I've invited my colleague in DARPA's public affairs group Tabatha Thompson to join me as a co-host as we speak to doctor Timothy Chung, who joined the DARPA as a program manager in 2016.

7
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,770
You might hear some ambient sounds like birds or sirens

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:10,220
That's because recording our conversation from our respective homes, as we do our part to slow the spread of Covid19, as the pandemic has abandoned our daily routines

9
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,650
Work continues on more than 250 programs

10
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,704
Each was a vision of useful technology that's out of reach at the moment, but could become within reach in the future.

11
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:25,445
Tabatha, you've been working closely with Dr. Tim Chung to help get word out about his program

12
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:26,630
So why don't you take it from here?

13
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,480
Thank you, Ivan.

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:40,298
I have been lucky to have a front row seat to the progress on two of those programs, OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics, OFFSET for short and the DARPA of Subterranean challenges or SubT challenge for short.

15
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:48,670
For the OFFSET program, two teams have developed two different swarm systems, open architectures in physical testbeds.

16
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:59,342
The program also has what I called swarms sprinters, organizations competitively selected through contract opportunities to focus on a particular technology through sierra

17
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,045
About every six months,

18
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:07,109
The program hosts a field tests for the sprinters to demonstrate and further develop their solutions

19
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:15,805
The SubT challenge is a price base challenge, with teams from all over the world competing, in the systems competition with physical platforms,

20
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,202
the virtual competition, or in both.

21
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:30,300
Team score when the robots accurately identified artifacts, a first responder or a war fighter might encounter underground like a backpack, drill or a thermal manikins(人体模型)

22
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,000
representing a survivor.

23
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,080
Tim, thank you for joining us to talk about your work.

24
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,940
Yeah, it's a pleasure to be here.

25
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,770
Thank you so much

26
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,340
I'd like to hear more about your programs and technologies you're working toward

27
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,200
But I'd like to start with your research trajectory and how you came to DARPA

28
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,830
You have degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineering

29
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,160
But where did your interest start?

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,060
And are there any significant influences that could be people or events that stand out for you?

31
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,190
Yeah, well, I mean, I think I always

32
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,036
really appreciated and was curious about how the world works.

33
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:14,790
And from that perspective, being an engineer means that we not only need to understand how things worked, but also also wants to try to fix them

34
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,410
if we can, of course, and come up with new ideas.

35
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:32,930
And so I think a lot of the excitement that goes on around robotics also touched me, especially as a undergrad where I had a chance to work on the Cornell University Robotic soccer team.

36
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,720
And that led to whole new experiences and really understanding what it means

37
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,220
to make the technology real

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:51,476
This is granted about playing robots soccer, but it meant that people had to come together, share ideas, worked together and then create the sets of robots that were doing,

39
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:54,872
or be something really fun with a soccer, but doing a purpose

40
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:58,340
and that really inspired me to continue that line of research.

41
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,750
Could you go from that experience with robot soccer to coming to DARPA as a program manager?

42
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:14,900
The inspiration perhaps comes all the way back when my sister was a sophmore at west points, and I just started my first year in grad school

43
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,690
And that's when I am eleven hit

44
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:25,821
And I knew at that point, my sister being part of that, army would soon to be called upon to action,

45
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:36,549
and it was really hard for me to sit in this supposed Ivory tower of academia, and think that my kid sister would be fighting, you know, this war

46
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:44,110
and ponder(仔细琢磨) a lot about whether or not to, unless myself, pondered what I could do to serve my country in that sense

47
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:53,540
And I remember my mentor at the time said, I totally understand if you want to, or need to enlist(参军), you know, go, go, do that

48
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:04,831
but remember that there is this opportunity that the work that you do here, in pursuit of your advanced degrees, can ultimately, potentially do more and serve more and have deeper impact

49
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:13,402
And I think, from that point toward, I saw that my sister went into hammers' way, but I remain in grad school, finish my degree

50
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:19,921
continue to always have in the back of my mind that I wanted to make the world a slightly safer, better place

51
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:25,549
And I think that let me to pursue in my position, my faculty position at the Naval post-graduate school,

52
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:35,288
which allowed me to explore mission relevance, research problems while also engaging with junior officer core, which is incredibly rewarding,

53
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:41,872
and then also ultimately led to a research portfolio there that brought exposure to

54
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:51,750
the institution of DARPA and from that interaction, was able to find my way ultimately to DARPA to hopefully realize some of that quest that was inspired many many years ago.

55
00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:02,927
You've given a couple of examples of how your career interacted with DARPA before you actually join the agency as a principal investigator, and also not honesty

56
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:08,493
But knowing the team that was participating in a DARPA challenge, when you are at CalTech.

57
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:21,062
Could you talk a little bit about how those experiences, in addition to those life experience, but I think were so important to informing your work, how they influence the way you shape the programs that you run for the agency.

58
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:24,740
It takes me back to think about the DARPA grand challenge

59
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,637
while I was a grad student

60
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:35,690
I saw, this announcement about this audacious(大胆的) effort to take robots and driving across the desert in autonomous fashion

61
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:42,090
And I remember thinking, and I was just a junior grad student, but leaning over to my fellow student Pierre saying

62
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:50,309
wow, this is really cool, and then discovered that the CalTech would be fielding(选派..上场) a team largely comprising undergraduates

63
00:06:50,309 --> 00:07:04,630
But I still remember the inspiration of that challenge offered to me and my fellow graduate students and undergraduate student, and I think that kind of nugget of inspiration was something that continued burning

64
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,855
I think, it continues to be there and drives us to go and do

65
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:13,706
sometimes really audacious things, and given this opportunity to come to DAPRA

66
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:21,160
and have the opportunity to go off and do those types of audacious things that really inspired the nature of both of my programs

67
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,870
I think was able to work at the Naval post-graduate school, which I would really like to be an incubator

68
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,190
really great ideas

69
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,230
We have junior officers who have a lot of fleet experience

70
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,169
They come to getting their gradual level education.

71
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,160
They bring with them a lot of experiences that meet academic research,

72
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,920
And boom, you have a really great fusion of need, and state-of-the-art

73
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,150
And from my perspective seeing, NPS as an incubator

74
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:57,390
I view DARPA as an accelerator of those ideas, really take those ideas and run with them a bigger, bolder, faster.

75
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:05,285
This is a good point for us to talk a little bit more about the programs in your portfolio SubT challenge and OFFSET offensive swarm enabled tactics,

76
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:10,730
the obvious tie between the two is this focus on the autonomy and robotics

77
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,178
But there are some significant differences in the outcome goes too,

78
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:17,053
for instance, the focus on human swarm teaming in OFFSET

79
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:23,920
Could you talk through some of these common teams, and then also some of the key differentiators for these two programs?

80
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:31,652
Sure. OFFSET is a program where we seek to discover the swarm system technologies

81
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:42,730
that will allow operates of hundreds of 250 air and ground robots operating in complex urban environments in support of small unit operations

82
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:52,610
The Subterranean challenge is all about discovering innovative approaches to map, navigate and search in complex underground environments.

83
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:02,170
I think the unifying theme and what drives me is to see robots in the real world, operating in complex environments.

84
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:13,390
I think robotics is one of those fields where you can't just only work in theory, or you can't only work in kind of Trial and error.

85
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,860
You kind of need to bring both of them together and see robot working in the wild.

86
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:27,763
And so I think that's something that really inspires me is obtaining that strict, not something that we, roboticst, really embrace is seeing robots work.

87
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:32,017
Until the key emphasis for both OFFSET and SubT challenge

88
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:44,357
is putting robots in really challenging environments in a field, robotic sense and seeing what they have to do, where the gaps might still be for what they're not yet able to do.

89
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:49,017
So for OFFSET we're interested in those really complex urban environment,

90
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:55,030
specifically those aspects of the urban mess that stress autonomy today.

91
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,349
And that includes everything from the fact that you might not have a line of sites,

92
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:07,259
because the building in the way you can't move as freely, because there is a lot of obstacles or things, blocking in your lanes,

93
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:14,048
and the fact that you have to look up and around, because you have the superstructures(上部结构) all around this, well

94
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:18,190
And so, how do you get air and ground robots working in that kind of environment?

95
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,842
And then on top of that, and because this is DARPA, we'd like to push the envelope.

96
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:28,000
how do we get hundreds of robots to be able to go off and do those kind of things in a complex environment?

97
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,116
I think the similarity with the Subterranean challenge is the [inaudible] these underground environments are equally complex

98
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:43,488
And not only are they complex, in the sense of, hey, we don't typically spend a lot of time in underground environments

99
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:50,530
one might argue, but also the fact that the unknown underground, it makes it even dangerous for people to go in

100
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,680
And so this is an opportunity for again, robots, to, to shine

101
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:04,358
And so whether those are in human-made tunnel-like environment, such as mines, to urban underground to naturally occurring cave environments.

102
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:12,446
This is an opportunity for, again, robots to understand what the current limitations of autonomy and robotics are today,

103
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:19,762
and really inspired the type of researchers as necessary to conquer those environments in the future

104
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:30,842
I think both of the programs offered the opportunities for roboticst, but also just brought the researchers, geologists, city planners, even kind of micro climate researchers,

105
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:36,420
to speak to what impact a holistic(整体的) systems design

106
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,440
And when I say systems, I'm not talking just about one robot

107
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm talking about all the robots working together

108
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,667
The team, the humans supervisor

109
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:54,650
or the human-swarm team member, understanding how that holistically comes together to deliver the capabilities that will help save lives in the end.

110
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,030
Could I get you to talk a little bit more about human-swarm teaming, and just describe what's that looks like

111
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,884
Yeah, I'm an autonomy researcher is, is, however, described myself.

112
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:17,350
But in thinking about autonomy and swarm autonomy, in the sense of having large scale teams of robots makes air and ground working together

113
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:28,100
We can't leave the human out of it because how we design that autonomy is impacted by how we envison the human swarm commander, working with a technology

114
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:35,260
And so the OFFSET program intentionally focuses on those two pillars of swarm autonomy and human teaming

115
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:44,925
And in that sense, the OFFSET programs about discovering what it means when you have hundreds of robots operating in a complex environment

116
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:50,430
and the intense of the program is to kind of understand, you know what works and what doens't work

117
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,800
We certainly cannot have 100 or 200 marines runing around with joysticks in conducting and urban operation

118
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:05,172
So what does it mean when we try to consolidate(巩固) a lot of that team member commander role for large-scale teams of robot,

119
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:06,400
what, what does it mean?

120
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,950
Does it mean..

121
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,040
We present information in a different way?

122
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,467
Does it mean that they have to interact with the robots at a much higher level,

123
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:24,747
and so the way we think about it in the OFFSET program is in the context of translating commanders intents into these machine-understandable swarm tactics

124
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:30,161
These swarm tactics give us a glimpse as to how we can potentially interact

125
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:38,796
with these large scale teams, and ultimately boils down to understanding what the language we called the swarm interaction grammar

126
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:42,543
What is the language by which the swarm can understand

127
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,669
the commander is trying to get done, commander's intent,

128
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:50,348
and conversely(相反地), the commander understanding what the swarm's actually doing.

129
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:59,070
is it doing what I ask it to on things of a nature, so the two ways tree, and that's why we call it the human swarm teaming, it is not a human swarm control

130
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,054
It's really about interaction between the human and the swarm

131
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:07,636
And so we imagine also that it's not just going to be a screen with a mouse

132
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:12,170
that's gonna solve this problem of interacting with these large scale teams

133
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,370
You know, gesture or voice or augmented and virtual reality

134
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:23,210
Maybe these are other tools that we can now take advantage of to help inform how we interact with these large-scale teams

135
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,250
For the SubT challenge, it's an extended event, so it's over a couple of years

136
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,740
that you are working with these teams.

137
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,850
And you divided it up into circuits.

138
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:37,476
Could you talk a little bit about your goal for each of the circuits and how you divided the challenge?

139
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:47,740
Well as I mention we're really interested across my DARPA program portfolio of putting robots in the real world and having them operate in complex environments.

140
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,250
And when we take another look at underground environments,

141
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,672
There are so many different types of underground environments that just to solve the problem in one of the domain wouldn't be enough.

142
00:14:57,672 --> 00:15:05,794
I really ought to understand and identify what works and what doesn't work in underground environments.

143
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:14,088
And so what we've done is for the SubT challenge we highlighted that there're underground environment like tunnels and mines

144
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:18,316
We've articulated(清楚表达) there're urban underground environments

145
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:30,900
They are natural occuring cave systems and trying to figure out what kind of robotic technologies will allow us to operate relatively adaptively across all three of those types of underground environments

146
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,950
So what that boils down to is, how do we capture all of that

147
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,624
And so one way to do that is to focus on each individuals of domain

148
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:53,230
and we're doing that in the context of three circle domains, namely the tunnel circuit, urban circuit and upcoming, we have a cave circuit. But, as I highlighted, it's not about being the best swimmer were the best runner

149
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,280
It's really about being the best Triathlete(铁人三项运动员) here

150
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:05,890
And so we want to see how these individual events in form the designs, and even the concept of operations for those technologies

151
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:15,355
But it's at final event where we will be able to merge elements of all three of those sub domains into the grand finale, epic final course,

152
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:24,050
and understand what it means to have truly adaptive technology, robotic systems that can upgrade across those sub domains.

153
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:36,630
Tim, both of your programs really inspired the imagination to think of all of this kind of interaction with with you are human beings and with machines all trying to work together to, you know, in new ways

154
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:46,210
The SubT, though, also comes to my mind as a kind of fascinating and endeavour(努力) that it forces you to think about being underground, right in most of the time

155
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,620
We think about being on the surface [..] or an plains all the time

156
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,610
But it's rare unless you're a spelunker, caver

157
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:59,440
to really think much about being underground, or if you're, you know, a metro worker, and you are in tunnels under the city

158
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
where trains go

159
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:10,800
But I'm just wondering if your experience with SubT has changed the way you think about in some ways, being in the world because your mind is so much underground.

160
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:20,454
Hey, yeah, well. I'll say everything takes a different lens when you put in the context of each of these tester programs and SubT is no different

161
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:24,450
I think everything from when I am, you know, I don't know about if

162
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,484
you know, once upon a time, many ways, you know, taking a look every time I go.

163
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:37,350
Or I go into a tunnel while I'm driving, or anything along those lines now, kind of inspires a little bit of SubT

164
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,048
And I say, for anyone who watches movies quite a lot,

165
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:46,603
there are many occasions where there're folks in underground tunnels

166
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:50,864
or there're basements, there're empty malls in sublevels or whatever.

167
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:55,782
so now that I watch those movies with the SubT challenge lens.

168
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:59,092
I'm often shouting out oh that's a great idea for the SubT challenge,

169
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:10,006
but I maybe the other more technical, serious answer here is, I think, thinking about the underground has led me to understand that the challenges are quite severe --

170
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:16,210
You don't have GPS, and often times something we lean on to get the job done for for a robot

171
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,710
Communication is horrible down there

172
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:26,240
And so it makes us think a little bit differently about what it means to want to communicate what information do I want to share

173
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,849
And this isn't just for robots, it turned out that this is applicable to human teams that go down there as well

174
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:40,640
so that given both a stronger, inspirational motivation to push the boundaries of those technologies,

175
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:50,280
but it's also really driven the appreciation, not just by me but also of all the participants of the challenges that resided underground.

176
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,820
Well, thanks Tim, for sharing some of your personal notes from the underground and the challenges of working in Subterranean settings

177
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,290
And now let me pass the baton(指挥棒) back to Tabatha.

178
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,164
Thank you, Ivan.

179
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:06,792
Tim, you talked about your experience, working with graduate students from the SubT challenge perspective

180
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:15,000
But you worked with students in an earlier challenge when you first came to DARPA for the swarm challeng, could you describe that program and what you learn from it?

181
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,340
I know we talk about how I found my way to DARPA earlier, but in fact, I think it was

182
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,800
The swarm challenge concept that really seal the deal for bringing me to DARPA

183
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,840
And this idea was building on the research I done previously of getting large teams of air vehicles

184
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:41,270
In this case, my prior research was on getting 50 fixed-wing aircraft, the fixed-wing airplane-like drones aloft(在空中) and doing interesting things in the sky

185
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,938
And we were able to leverage that body of work

186
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:52,087
and the idea that came from it, and what we built out here at DARPA

187
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:57,264
upon my arrival was the service academies, swarm challenge that you referenced,

188
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:07,145
this was really fun because we wanted to capitalize on this momentum of technology development of getting large numbers of aircraft aloft

189
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:16,250
and also create an opportunity to help frame the next generation of military officer by working with the military services academies

190
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,388
Namely the naval academy, air force academy and the military academy at west point

191
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:30,394
and bring those cadets and midshipmen and work with them to understand what it means to work with these types of swarm technologies

192
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:35,907
And the phrase we like to use was, how do you go from zero to swarm in 8 months

193
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:43,990
because that was the time, these cadets and midshipmen had in their capstone design projects in their senior year to complete this, this project

194
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,733
And so that was basically getting a fixed wing and quadrotor drones

195
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:55,213
I gave each team, and they get to pick their own lineup of 25 drones on the side

196
00:20:55,213 --> 00:21:08,447
We set up bounty castles on the opposing sides of the field, and this is in lifelike experimentation, and so we have bounty castles and you'll score points by landing your drones in the opposing teams'

197
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:15,480
bounty castle, but you want to defend your own home, bounty castle, of course, basically a simulated laser tag in the sky

198
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,981
And so it was this really great understanding how do you play strong offensive, how do you play strong defense

199
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:34,720
and have a gears turned for these cadets, who had never worked with the this type of technology before and partnering them with research engineers and lives and others to make this all happen

200
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:46,364
It was incredibly rewarding to see cardets and midshipmen who never thought that they would be part of something that bold, that forward leaning in their time at the academies, I think,

201
00:21:46,364 --> 00:22:03,760
and they walked away, recognizing that there does exists an organization within the DoD that is thinking so far in advance that they have the region to, 20, 21 year old to the start the process of tech revolution, right?

202
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,940
So I think that again, inspired me

203
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:16,924
I think that that experience bolden and enforged(强化) my core team of challenge believers as a model for driving tech innovation,

204
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:28,310
and that allowed us to go forward with kind of pitching the Subterranean challenge as the next bold step in driving autonomy and robotics technologies

205
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,211
And so let me just follow that with an institutional question,

206
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:35,539
I mean, DARPA is a place where engineers like you

207
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:37,575
Tim can develop a technology vision

208
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:41,340
And as I see in the opening of this podcast -- redefine what is possible

209
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,990
But what is it about DARPA institutionally, do you think, that creates these opportunities?

210
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:58,470
I definitely believe DARPA has a secret sauce that it has continued to, been able to generate those ideas, but also create and execute and realize those ideas

211
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,897
I think, on the one hand, certainly from the technical technology office, from which I hear,

212
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:14,361
we really love seeing technologies demonstrated so systems being brought together and realized in some sort of field test demonstration, and I think that's one end.

213
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,440
on the other hand

214
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,530
We're interested in creating whole new, foundation whole new

215
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,540
areas of research that hadn't really been thought about.

216
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:34,390
And I think that being able of expand that spectrum and do it in the context of, you know, one hundred or so of programming and across 300 programs is a pretty phenomenal(不寻常)

217
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:42,323
I'd say, one another way that I describe DARPA, this was, uh, one of my colleagues had previously described research this way

218
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:47,210
Is there're a lot of folks out there that might say some research is impossible

219
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,072
or some vision is impossible

220
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:53,595
And my colleague at the time said, actually no, it's not impossible

221
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:55,457
It's rather, it's unpossible

222
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:57,851
It's just that it hasn't been done yet

223
00:23:57,851 --> 00:24:01,000
It is not that it can't been done yet

224
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,719
and I like to embrace that philosophy and everything that I try to touch in the sense, just because I hadn't been done before

225
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:11,243
is not proof that it can't be done.

226
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:15,814
In fact, its challenge, say, that maybe I am the one who can do it,

227
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:19,731
and DARPA really gives us both the tools and inspiration,

228
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:30,740
and the kind of community, as to say, that both the support, but also my, you know, program manager colleagues, when I see all the amazing things they are making possible

229
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,450
it makes me think that the things might have been considered impossible, or simply just opportunities.

230
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,740
We're getting towards the end here, but I want to get into a couple of questions that are more about technology in general

231
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,960
First, I want to ask you about the kinds of technology is developing

232
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,372
We're talking now here, about humans and machines working together

233
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:58,778
DARPA has a long long history going back even to 1960s, thinking about that particular kind of powerful dynamic.

234
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:02,910
So I'm just wondering what excites you most about these technologies?

235
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:12,663
As you said it is the intersection of the human, machines synbiosis(协同生物) that is in a lot of DARPA's genetic code already

236
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:17,546
So I am leveraging understanding on their shoulders for sure

237
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:22,430
I think the thing that perhaps excites me a lot about these technologies

238
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:29,050
is the idea that we'll have to look at our robotic teams in [fuck] different ways

239
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,468
What I mean by that is a lot of maybe a research has been done on what it means to

240
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:43,750
work with a single robot, or maybe a few robots, but we're narrowly pushing what it means to work with multiple, many robots

241
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:56,627
And I think this is a really rich area of new research to be had in the sense that the way I would interact with my small team of researchers, or at a startup company,

242
00:25:56,627 --> 00:26:06,590
or something like that is very different men, how I would want to interact a larger company or a larger project team, and that goes analogously(类似的) with team of robots

243
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:19,632
And so I think how we work with mixed, but physically mixed in terms of your air and ground, but uh mixed as in the functions that these robots will play in a composition of a team

244
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:30,098
I think the type of [...] is really gonna open up not only new capabilities, but also plane proceeds for new foundation of research to be done as well

245
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:43,032
So that's gonna be one of the, interestingly, behind, if I can say that, both of these problems, is understanding what it means to work when you have high complexity in a robot team itself,

246
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:54,555
and that warrants high complexity, warrants new math, new communication networks, new compute methodologies, new sensing approaches or new algorithms

247
00:26:54,555 --> 00:27:01,568
And I think both of these programs have started to, bear some of the fruit out and lay some of the foundations

248
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:03,970
So that's been really, really exciting.

249
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,050
And that's a lot of foundation to lay down

250
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,130
We all know how much it takes for people to work well together

251
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:20,640
So I'm not surprised to hear about the enormity(棘手) and complexity of the task to realize the mission in which humans and machines work together almost as if they were one hybrid organism, very cool stuff.

252
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:27,140
It is, and I think it's important to know how that work is continuing

253
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,240
I've been reference

254
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:35,675
at the beginning of the episode, but there is no doubt Covid19 will be an historic marker for all of our lives.

255
00:27:35,675 --> 00:27:44,490
It would be interesting to know, Tim, how it is affected your work, and perhaps the near term goals in deliverables for some of these programs you're working on.

256
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:55,734
Yeah, no doubt Covid19 has had its impact, one of the things about DARPA is that it's all about being able to be nimble(灵活) and adaptive,

257
00:27:55,734 --> 00:28:05,970
and so I think, even in the context of OFFSET and SubT challenge, the impact really is felt in the context of, as I mentioned earlier, is about trying to get robots in the real world

258
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:22,660
And when it's difficult to go to the real world to get those lessons learned and put a robot in those context, which, which Covid19 is really limited our ability to do that, it definitely does impact the type of progres and lessons learned we can achieve

259
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:36,650
But in that same vein, both of these problems have a theme of leveraging the virtual environment to, kind of, balance in couple and accelerate the lessons that we learn in the real world

260
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:46,710
And so, in OFFSET we have two virtual environments that allow us to explore, test, simulate swarm tactics and execution

261
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:58,391
And we do that with realistic environment. In test site we will have a 3D model of a test site, and we'll replicate what it is that we're testing in a synthetic environment

262
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:07,299
And the OFFSET program was structured from getgo whether there're robot, whether they're simulated real, don't know that they're plugged in to the simulated world.

263
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:20,730
So we really leaned to that aspect, the OFFSET programs so that we can still continue to discover new ideas and strengthen the insights that we hope or translate to

264
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:35,177
the fourth dominic field test of OFFSET program for the SubT challenge again, that virtual environment plays a huge role for SubT and since that we have the virtual competition alongside the system's competition

265
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:41,810
So whereas(然而) we might be physically putting robots in underground environments, for the system's competition

266
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:52,177
we've created that SubT simulator that allows for teams to not only practice and test, but also compete in virtual environment

267
00:29:52,177 --> 00:29:56,673
And so that virtual environment has given us another opportunity,

268
00:29:56,673 --> 00:30:10,032
and in some ways of relief alf for teams, who are constrained and being able to go to the site, to go on the test, I can still do some of that development in the simulated contexts to go

269
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:20,000
and and you know keeping the ball rolling forward, 'cause OFFSET and SubT both about keeping up the momentum of a research, just like the rest of DARPA. I'd one of the other

270
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:30,301
impacts, of course, is that community I described earlier about getting people together and facilitating the exchange of information or bouncing ideas or seeing what works

271
00:30:32,934 --> 00:30:35,675
imitating it in my own research, or whatever I mean,

272
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:54,435
each of these teams benefits from the interaction in very different, but also in profound ways fastering the sense of community, through online community forum, or being able to open up a collaborative web space for teams to share their software

273
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:58,770
deliverables are ways that were trying to live in this normal.

274
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,200
Tim, thank you for your time, for your insights into your work with DARPA.

275
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,120
It's been a pleasure

276
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,200
Thank you so much.

277
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:15,410
I will encourage everyone to spend some time exploring the SubT challenge, play list on DARPA's youtube channel, to get an idea of how teams are tackling the underground

278
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,500
You can see a couple of recent OFFSET field experiments on the youtube channel as well

279
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,680
And Ivan, it's been great joing you as the co-hosts

280
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,340
I look forward to seeing you back in the studio.

281
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,710
Yes, and it was my pleasure too to share

282
