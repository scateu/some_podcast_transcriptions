EDL	00:00:11,980	00:00:19,976	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Stealth Technology, the Internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation 
EDL	00:00:19,976	00:00:31,700	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958, in the midst of the cold war, DARPA the defence advanced research project agency has been a driver of technology.
EDL	00:00:31,700	00:00:39,420	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA, a window onto the DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine was possible
EDL	00:00:39,970	00:00:42,780	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	My name is Ivan Amato. I'm  your DARPA host
EDL	00:00:42,780	00:00:55,220	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	On this occasion, I've invited my colleague in DARPA's public affairs group Tabatha Thompson to join me as a co-host as we speak to doctor Timothy Chung, who joined the DARPA as a program manager in 2016.
EDL	00:00:56,140	00:00:58,770	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	You might hear some ambient sounds like birds or sirens
EDL	00:00:59,120	00:01:10,220	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	That's because recording our conversation from our respective homes, as we do our part to slow the spread of Covid19, as the pandemic has abandoned our daily routines
EDL	00:01:10,220	00:01:13,650	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Work continues on more than 250 programs
EDL	00:01:13,650	00:01:20,704	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Each was a vision of useful technology that's out of reach at the moment, but could become within reach in the future. 
EDL	00:01:20,704	00:01:25,445	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Tabatha, you've been working closely with Dr. Tim Chung to help get word out about his program
EDL	00:01:25,445	00:01:26,630	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So why don't you take it from here?
EDL	00:01:27,070	00:01:27,480	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Thank you, Ivan.
EDL	00:01:27,480	00:01:40,298	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I have been lucky to have a front row seat to the progress on two of those programs, OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics, OFFSET for short and the DARPA of Subterranean challenges or SubT challenge for short. 
EDL	00:01:40,298	00:01:48,670	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	For the OFFSET program, two teams have developed two different swarm systems, open architectures in physical testbeds.
EDL	00:01:48,670	00:01:59,342	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The program also has what I called swarms sprinters, organizations competitively selected through contract opportunities to focus on a particular technology through sierra
EDL	00:01:59,342	00:02:01,045	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	About every six months,
EDL	00:02:01,045	00:02:07,109	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The program hosts a field tests for the sprinters to demonstrate and further develop their solutions
EDL	00:02:07,109	00:02:15,805	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The SubT challenge is a price base challenge, with teams from all over the world competing, in the systems competition with physical platforms, 
EDL	00:02:15,805	00:02:19,202	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	the virtual competition, or in both. 
EDL	00:02:19,202	00:02:30,300	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Team score when the robots accurately identified artifacts, a first responder or a war fighter might encounter underground like a backpack, drill or a thermal manikins(人体模型)
EDL	00:02:30,300	00:02:32,000	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	representing a survivor.
EDL	00:02:32,580	00:02:36,080	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Tim, thank you for joining us to talk about your work. 
EDL	00:02:36,760	00:02:37,940	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Yeah, it's a pleasure to be here.
EDL	00:02:37,940	00:02:38,770	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:02:39,300	00:02:43,340	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I'd like to hear more about your programs and technologies you're working toward
EDL	00:02:43,340	00:02:47,200	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But I'd like to start with your research trajectory and how you came to DARPA
EDL	00:02:47,710	00:02:50,830	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	You have degrees in mechanical and aerospace engineering
EDL	00:02:51,340	00:02:53,160	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But where did your interest start?
EDL	00:02:53,160	00:02:59,060	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And are there any significant influences that could be people or events that stand out for you? 
EDL	00:03:00,030	00:03:01,190	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Yeah, well, I mean, I think I always
EDL	00:03:01,810	00:03:06,036	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	really appreciated and was curious about how the world works.
EDL	00:03:06,036	00:03:14,790	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And from that perspective, being an engineer means that we not only need to understand how things worked, but also also wants to try to fix them
EDL	00:03:14,790	00:03:17,410	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	if we can, of course, and come up with new ideas.
EDL	00:03:17,980	00:03:32,930	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so I think a lot of the excitement that goes on around robotics also touched me, especially as a undergrad where I had a chance to work on the Cornell University Robotic soccer team.
EDL	00:03:32,930	00:03:38,720	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And that led to whole new experiences and really understanding what it means
EDL	00:03:38,720	00:03:40,220	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	to make the technology real
EDL	00:03:40,220	00:03:51,476	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	This is granted about playing robots soccer, but it meant that people had to come together, share ideas, worked together and then create the sets of robots that were doing, 
EDL	00:03:51,476	00:03:54,872	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	or be something really fun with a soccer, but doing a purpose
EDL	00:03:54,872	00:03:58,340	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and that really inspired me to continue that line of research. 
EDL	00:03:58,690	00:04:04,750	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Could you go from that experience with robot soccer to coming to DARPA as a program manager? 
EDL	00:04:05,300	00:04:14,900	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The inspiration perhaps comes all the way back when my sister was a sophmore at west points, and I just started my first year in grad school
EDL	00:04:15,360	00:04:16,690	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And that's when I am eleven hit
EDL	00:04:17,420	00:04:25,821	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I knew at that point, my sister being part of that, army would soon to be called upon to action, 
EDL	00:04:25,821	00:04:36,549	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and it was really hard for me to sit in this supposed Ivory tower of academia, and think that my kid sister would be fighting, you know, this war 
EDL	00:04:36,549	00:04:44,110	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and ponder(仔细琢磨) a lot about whether or not to, unless myself, pondered what I could do to serve my country in that sense
EDL	00:04:44,510	00:04:53,540	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I remember my mentor at the time said, I totally understand if you want to, or need to enlist(参军), you know, go, go, do that
EDL	00:04:53,540	00:05:04,831	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	but remember that there is this opportunity that the work that you do here, in pursuit of your advanced degrees, can ultimately, potentially do more and serve more and have deeper impact
EDL	00:05:04,831	00:05:13,402	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I think, from that point toward, I saw that my sister went into hammers' way, but I remain in grad school, finish my degree 
EDL	00:05:13,402	00:05:19,921	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	continue to always have in the back of my mind that I wanted to make the world a slightly safer, better place
EDL	00:05:19,921	00:05:25,549	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I think that let me to pursue in my position, my faculty position at the Naval post-graduate school, 
EDL	00:05:25,549	00:05:35,288	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	which allowed me to explore mission relevance, research problems while also engaging with junior officer core, which is incredibly rewarding, 
EDL	00:05:35,288	00:05:41,872	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and then also ultimately led to a research portfolio there that brought exposure to 
EDL	00:05:41,872	00:05:51,750	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	the institution of DARPA and from that interaction, was able to find my way ultimately to DARPA to hopefully realize some of that quest that was inspired many many years ago. 
EDL	00:05:53,210	00:06:02,927	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	You've given a couple of examples of how your career interacted with DARPA before you actually join the agency as a principal investigator, and also not honesty
EDL	00:06:02,927	00:06:08,493	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But knowing the team that was participating in a DARPA challenge, when you are at CalTech. 
EDL	00:06:08,493	00:06:21,062	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Could you talk a little bit about how those experiences, in addition to those life experience, but I think were so important to informing your work, how they influence the way you shape the programs that you run for the agency.
EDL	00:06:21,062	00:06:24,740	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It takes me back to think about the DARPA grand challenge
EDL	00:06:24,740	00:06:26,637	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	while I was a grad student
EDL	00:06:26,637	00:06:35,690	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I saw, this announcement about this audacious(大胆的) effort to take robots and driving across the desert in autonomous fashion
EDL	00:06:35,690	00:06:42,090	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I remember thinking, and I was just a junior grad student, but leaning over to my fellow student Pierre saying
EDL	00:06:42,090	00:06:50,309	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	wow, this is really cool, and then discovered that the CalTech would be fielding(选派..上场) a team largely comprising undergraduates
EDL	00:06:50,309	00:07:04,630	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But I still remember the inspiration of that challenge offered to me and my fellow graduate students and undergraduate student, and I think that kind of nugget of inspiration was something that continued burning
EDL	00:07:04,630	00:07:08,855	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think, it continues to be there and drives us to go and do 
EDL	00:07:08,855	00:07:13,706	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	sometimes really audacious things, and given this opportunity to come to DAPRA 
EDL	00:07:13,706	00:07:21,160	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and have the opportunity to go off and do those types of audacious things that really inspired the nature of both of my programs
EDL	00:07:21,480	00:07:28,870	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think was able to work at the Naval post-graduate school, which I would really like to be an incubator
EDL	00:07:28,870	00:07:30,190	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	really great ideas
EDL	00:07:30,190	00:07:33,230	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We have junior officers who have a lot of fleet experience
EDL	00:07:33,560	00:07:37,169	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	They come to getting their gradual level education. 
EDL	00:07:37,169	00:07:41,160	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	They bring with them a lot of experiences that meet academic research,
EDL	00:07:41,160	00:07:45,920	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And boom, you have a really great fusion of need, and state-of-the-art 
EDL	00:07:46,330	00:07:50,150	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And from my perspective seeing, NPS as an incubator
EDL	00:07:50,150	00:07:57,390	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I view DARPA as an accelerator of those ideas, really take those ideas and run with them a bigger, bolder, faster. 
EDL	00:07:57,950	00:08:05,285	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	This is a good point for us to talk a little bit more about the programs in your portfolio SubT challenge and OFFSET offensive swarm enabled tactics, 
EDL	00:08:05,285	00:08:10,730	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	the obvious tie between the two is this focus on the autonomy and robotics
EDL	00:08:10,730	00:08:14,178	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But there are some significant differences in the outcome goes too, 
EDL	00:08:14,178	00:08:17,053	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	for instance, the focus on human swarm teaming in OFFSET
EDL	00:08:17,053	00:08:23,920	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Could you talk through some of these common teams, and then also some of the key differentiators for these two programs?
EDL	00:08:25,110	00:08:31,652	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Sure. OFFSET is a program where we seek to discover the swarm system technologies 
EDL	00:08:31,652	00:08:42,730	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	that will allow operates of hundreds of 250 air and ground robots operating in complex urban environments in support of small unit operations
EDL	00:08:43,040	00:08:52,610	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The Subterranean challenge is all about discovering innovative approaches to map, navigate and search in complex underground environments.
EDL	00:08:53,330	00:09:02,170	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think the unifying theme and what drives me is to see robots in the real world, operating in complex environments.
EDL	00:09:02,170	00:09:13,390	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think robotics is one of those fields where you can't just only work in theory, or you can't only work in kind of Trial and error.
EDL	00:09:13,390	00:09:17,860	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	You kind of need to bring both of them together and see robot working in the wild.
EDL	00:09:17,860	00:09:27,763	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so I think that's something that really inspires me is obtaining that strict, not something that we, roboticst, really embrace is seeing robots work. 
EDL	00:09:27,763	00:09:32,017	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Until the key emphasis for both OFFSET and SubT challenge
EDL	00:09:32,017	00:09:44,357	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	is putting robots in really challenging environments in a field, robotic sense and seeing what they have to do, where the gaps might still be for what they're not yet able to do.
EDL	00:09:44,357	00:09:49,017	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So for OFFSET we're interested in those really complex urban environment, 
EDL	00:09:49,017	00:09:55,030	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	specifically those aspects of the urban mess that stress autonomy today.
EDL	00:09:55,030	00:09:59,349	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And that includes everything from the fact that you might not have a line of sites, 
EDL	00:09:59,349	00:10:07,259	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	because the building in the way you can't move as freely, because there is a lot of obstacles or things, blocking in your lanes, 
EDL	00:10:07,259	00:10:14,048	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and the fact that you have to look up and around, because you have the superstructures(上部结构) all around this, well
EDL	00:10:14,048	00:10:18,190	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so, how do you get air and ground robots working in that kind of environment?
EDL	00:10:18,190	00:10:21,842	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And then on top of that, and because this is DARPA, we'd like to push the envelope. 
EDL	00:10:21,842	00:10:28,000	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	how do we get hundreds of robots to be able to go off and do those kind of things in a complex environment?
EDL	00:10:28,000	00:10:36,116	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think the similarity with the Subterranean challenge is the [inaudible] these underground environments are equally complex
EDL	00:10:36,116	00:10:43,488	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And not only are they complex, in the sense of, hey, we don't typically spend a lot of time in underground environments
EDL	00:10:43,488	00:10:50,530	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	one might argue, but also the fact that the unknown underground, it makes it even dangerous for people to go in
EDL	00:10:50,530	00:10:54,680	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so this is an opportunity for again, robots, to, to shine
EDL	00:10:54,680	00:11:04,358	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so whether those are in human-made tunnel-like environment, such as mines, to urban underground to naturally occurring cave environments.
EDL	00:11:04,358	00:11:12,446	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	This is an opportunity for, again, robots to understand what the current limitations of autonomy and robotics are today, 
EDL	00:11:12,446	00:11:19,762	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and really inspired the type of researchers as necessary to conquer those environments in the future
EDL	00:11:19,762	00:11:30,842	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think both of the programs offered the opportunities for roboticst, but also just brought the researchers, geologists, city planners, even kind of micro climate researchers, 
EDL	00:11:30,842	00:11:36,420	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	to speak to what impact a holistic(整体的) systems design
EDL	00:11:36,420	00:11:40,440	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And when I say systems, I'm not talking just about one robot
EDL	00:11:40,440	00:11:43,240	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I'm talking about all the robots working together
EDL	00:11:43,590	00:11:45,667	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The team, the humans supervisor 
EDL	00:11:45,667	00:11:54,650	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	or the human-swarm team member, understanding how that holistically comes together to deliver the capabilities that will help save lives in the end. 
EDL	00:11:55,560	00:12:00,030	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Could I get you to talk a little bit more about human-swarm teaming, and just describe what's that looks like
EDL	00:12:02,060	00:12:07,884	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Yeah, I'm an autonomy researcher is, is, however, described myself. 
EDL	00:12:07,884	00:12:17,350	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But in thinking about autonomy and swarm autonomy, in the sense of having large scale teams of robots makes air and ground working together
EDL	00:12:17,700	00:12:28,100	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We can't leave the human out of it because how we design that autonomy is impacted by how we envison the human swarm commander, working with a technology
EDL	00:12:28,100	00:12:35,260	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so the OFFSET program intentionally focuses on those two pillars of swarm autonomy and human teaming
EDL	00:12:35,260	00:12:44,925	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And in that sense, the OFFSET programs about discovering what it means when you have hundreds of robots operating in a complex environment 
EDL	00:12:44,925	00:12:50,430	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and the intense of the program is to kind of understand, you know what works and what doens't work
EDL	00:12:50,430	00:12:56,800	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We certainly cannot have 100 or 200 marines runing around with joysticks in conducting and urban operation
EDL	00:12:57,130	00:13:05,172	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So what does it mean when we try to consolidate(巩固) a lot of that team member commander role for large-scale teams of robot, 
EDL	00:13:05,172	00:13:06,400	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	what, what does it mean?
EDL	00:13:06,400	00:13:06,950	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Does it mean.. 
EDL	00:13:06,950	00:13:09,040	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We present information in a different way?
EDL	00:13:09,360	00:13:14,467	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Does it mean that they have to interact with the robots at a much higher level, 
EDL	00:13:14,467	00:13:24,747	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and so the way we think about it in the OFFSET program is in the context of translating commanders intents into these machine-understandable swarm tactics
EDL	00:13:24,747	00:13:30,161	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	These swarm tactics give us a glimpse as to how we can potentially interact 
EDL	00:13:30,161	00:13:38,796	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	with these large scale teams, and ultimately boils down to understanding what the language we called the swarm interaction grammar
EDL	00:13:38,796	00:13:42,543	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	What is the language by which the swarm can understand
EDL	00:13:42,543	00:13:45,669	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	the commander is trying to get done, commander's intent, 
EDL	00:13:45,669	00:13:50,348	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and conversely(相反地), the commander understanding what the swarm's actually doing. 
EDL	00:13:50,348	00:13:59,070	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	is it doing what I ask it to on things of a nature, so the two ways tree, and that's why we call it the human swarm teaming, it is not a human swarm control
EDL	00:13:59,070	00:14:03,054	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It's really about interaction between the human and the swarm
EDL	00:14:03,054	00:14:07,636	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so we imagine also that it's not just going to be a screen with a mouse
EDL	00:14:07,636	00:14:12,170	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	that's gonna solve this problem of interacting with these large scale teams
EDL	00:14:12,170	00:14:16,370	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	You know, gesture or voice or augmented and virtual reality
EDL	00:14:16,370	00:14:23,210	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Maybe these are other tools that we can now take advantage of to help inform how we interact with these large-scale teams
EDL	00:14:24,030	00:14:28,250	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	For the SubT challenge, it's an extended event, so it's over a couple of years
EDL	00:14:28,250	00:14:29,740	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	that you are working with these teams.
EDL	00:14:29,740	00:14:31,850	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And you divided it up into circuits.
EDL	00:14:31,850	00:14:37,476	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Could you talk a little bit about your goal for each of the circuits and how you divided the challenge? 
EDL	00:14:37,476	00:14:47,740	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Well as I mention we're really interested across my DARPA program portfolio of putting robots in the real world and having them operate in complex environments.
EDL	00:14:48,090	00:14:51,250	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And when we take another look at underground environments,
EDL	00:14:51,250	00:14:57,672	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	There are so many different types of underground environments that just to solve the problem in one of the domain wouldn't be enough. 
EDL	00:14:57,672	00:15:05,794	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I really ought to understand and identify what works and what doesn't work in underground environments.
EDL	00:15:05,794	00:15:14,088	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so what we've done is for the SubT challenge we highlighted that there're underground environment like tunnels and mines
EDL	00:15:14,088	00:15:18,316	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We've articulated(清楚表达) there're urban underground environments
EDL	00:15:18,316	00:15:30,900	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	They are natural occuring cave systems and trying to figure out what kind of robotic technologies will allow us to operate relatively adaptively across all three of those types of underground environments
EDL	00:15:31,360	00:15:34,950	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So what that boils down to is, how do we capture all of that
EDL	00:15:34,950	00:15:39,624	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so one way to do that is to focus on each individuals of domain 
EDL	00:15:39,624	00:15:53,230	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and we're doing that in the context of three circle domains, namely the tunnel circuit, urban circuit and upcoming, we have a cave circuit. But, as I highlighted, it's not about being the best swimmer were the best runner
EDL	00:15:53,230	00:15:56,280	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It's really about being the best Triathlete(铁人三项运动员) here
EDL	00:15:56,280	00:16:05,890	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so we want to see how these individual events in form the designs, and even the concept of operations for those technologies
EDL	00:16:05,890	00:16:15,355	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But it's at final event where we will be able to merge elements of all three of those sub domains into the grand finale, epic final course, 
EDL	00:16:15,355	00:16:24,050	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and understand what it means to have truly adaptive technology, robotic systems that can upgrade across those sub domains. 
EDL	00:16:24,050	00:16:36,630	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Tim, both of your programs really inspired the imagination to think of all of this kind of interaction with with you are human beings and with machines all trying to work together to, you know, in new ways
EDL	00:16:36,630	00:16:46,210	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The SubT, though, also comes to my mind as a kind of fascinating and endeavour(努力) that it forces you to think about being underground, right in most of the time
EDL	00:16:46,210	00:16:49,620	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We think about being on the surface [..] or an plains all the time
EDL	00:16:49,620	00:16:52,610	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But it's rare unless you're a spelunker, caver
EDL	00:16:52,610	00:16:59,440	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	to really think much about being underground, or if you're, you know, a metro worker, and you are in tunnels under the city
EDL	00:16:59,440	00:17:00,800	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	where trains go
EDL	00:17:00,800	00:17:10,800	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But I'm just wondering if your experience with SubT has changed the way you think about in some ways, being in the world because your mind is so much underground. 
EDL	00:17:11,230	00:17:20,454	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Hey, yeah, well. I'll say everything takes a different lens when you put in the context of each of these tester programs and SubT is no different
EDL	00:17:20,454	00:17:24,450	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think everything from when I am, you know, I don't know about if
EDL	00:17:24,450	00:17:29,484	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	you know, once upon a time, many ways, you know, taking a look every time I go. 
EDL	00:17:29,484	00:17:37,350	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Or I go into a tunnel while I'm driving, or anything along those lines now, kind of inspires a little bit of SubT
EDL	00:17:37,350	00:17:41,048	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I say, for anyone who watches movies quite a lot, 
EDL	00:17:41,048	00:17:46,603	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	there are many occasions where there're folks in underground tunnels 
EDL	00:17:46,603	00:17:50,864	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	or there're basements, there're empty malls in sublevels or whatever. 
EDL	00:17:50,864	00:17:55,782	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	so now that I watch those movies with the SubT challenge lens. 
EDL	00:17:55,782	00:17:59,092	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I'm often shouting out oh that's a great idea for the SubT challenge, 
EDL	00:17:59,092	00:18:10,006	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	but I maybe the other more technical, serious answer here is, I think, thinking about the underground has led me to understand that the challenges are quite severe -- 
EDL	00:18:10,006	00:18:16,210	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	You don't have GPS, and often times something we lean on to get the job done for for a robot
EDL	00:18:16,210	00:18:18,710	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Communication is horrible down there
EDL	00:18:18,710	00:18:26,240	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so it makes us think a little bit differently about what it means to want to communicate what information do I want to share
EDL	00:18:26,240	00:18:33,849	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And this isn't just for robots, it turned out that this is applicable to human teams that go down there as well
EDL	00:18:33,849	00:18:40,640	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	so that given both a stronger, inspirational motivation to push the boundaries of those technologies, 
EDL	00:18:40,640	00:18:50,280	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	but it's also really driven the appreciation, not just by me but also of all the participants of the challenges that resided underground. 
EDL	00:18:50,900	00:18:56,820	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Well, thanks Tim, for sharing some of your personal notes from the underground and the challenges of working in Subterranean settings
EDL	00:18:57,340	00:18:59,290	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And now let me pass the baton(指挥棒) back to Tabatha. 
EDL	00:19:00,000	00:19:01,164	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Thank you, Ivan. 
EDL	00:19:01,164	00:19:06,792	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Tim, you talked about your experience, working with graduate students from the SubT challenge perspective
EDL	00:19:06,792	00:19:15,000	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But you worked with students in an earlier challenge when you first came to DARPA for the swarm challeng, could you describe that program and what you learn from it?
EDL	00:19:16,110	00:19:21,340	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I know we talk about how I found my way to DARPA earlier, but in fact, I think it was
EDL	00:19:21,340	00:19:25,800	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	The swarm challenge concept that really seal the deal for bringing me to DARPA
EDL	00:19:26,190	00:19:31,840	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And this idea was building on the research I done previously of getting large teams of air vehicles
EDL	00:19:31,840	00:19:41,270	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	In this case, my prior research was on getting 50 fixed-wing aircraft, the fixed-wing airplane-like drones aloft(在空中) and doing interesting things in the sky
EDL	00:19:41,650	00:19:45,938	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And we were able to leverage that body of work 
EDL	00:19:45,938	00:19:52,087	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and the idea that came from it, and what we built out here at DARPA 
EDL	00:19:52,087	00:19:57,264	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	upon my arrival was the service academies, swarm challenge that you referenced, 
EDL	00:19:57,264	00:20:07,145	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	this was really fun because we wanted to capitalize on this momentum of technology development of getting large numbers of aircraft aloft 
EDL	00:20:07,145	00:20:16,250	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and also create an opportunity to help frame the next generation of military officer by working with the military services academies
EDL	00:20:16,690	00:20:21,388	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Namely the naval academy, air force academy and the military academy at west point 
EDL	00:20:21,388	00:20:30,394	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and bring those cadets and midshipmen and work with them to understand what it means to work with these types of swarm technologies
EDL	00:20:30,394	00:20:35,907	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And the phrase we like to use was, how do you go from zero to swarm in 8 months 
EDL	00:20:35,907	00:20:43,990	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	because that was the time, these cadets and midshipmen had in their capstone design projects in their senior year to complete this, this project
EDL	00:20:44,400	00:20:49,733	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so that was basically getting a fixed wing and quadrotor drones
EDL	00:20:49,733	00:20:55,213	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I gave each team, and they get to pick their own lineup of 25 drones on the side
EDL	00:20:55,213	00:21:08,447	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We set up bounty castles on the opposing sides of the field, and this is in lifelike experimentation, and so we have bounty castles and you'll score points by landing your drones in the opposing teams'
EDL	00:21:08,447	00:21:15,480	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	bounty castle, but you want to defend your own home, bounty castle, of course, basically a simulated laser tag in the sky
EDL	00:21:15,480	00:21:21,981	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so it was this really great understanding how do you play strong offensive, how do you play strong defense 
EDL	00:21:21,981	00:21:34,720	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and have a gears turned for these cadets, who had never worked with the this type of technology before and partnering them with research engineers and lives and others to make this all happen
EDL	00:21:34,720	00:21:46,364	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It was incredibly rewarding to see cardets and midshipmen who never thought that they would be part of something that bold, that forward leaning in their time at the academies, I think, 
EDL	00:21:46,364	00:22:03,760	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and they walked away, recognizing that there does exists an organization within the DoD that is thinking so far in advance that they have the region to, 20, 21 year old to the start the process of tech revolution, right?
EDL	00:22:03,760	00:22:05,940	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So I think that again, inspired me
EDL	00:22:05,940	00:22:16,924	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think that that experience bolden and enforged(强化) my core team of challenge believers as a model for driving tech innovation,
EDL	00:22:16,924	00:22:28,310	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and that allowed us to go forward with kind of pitching the Subterranean challenge as the next bold step in driving autonomy and robotics technologies
EDL	00:22:28,820	00:22:32,211	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so let me just follow that with an institutional question, 
EDL	00:22:32,211	00:22:35,539	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I mean, DARPA is a place where engineers like you
EDL	00:22:35,539	00:22:37,575	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Tim can develop a technology vision
EDL	00:22:37,575	00:22:41,340	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And as I see in the opening of this podcast -- redefine what is possible
EDL	00:22:41,340	00:22:45,990	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But what is it about DARPA institutionally, do you think, that creates these opportunities? 
EDL	00:22:46,650	00:22:58,470	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I definitely believe DARPA has a secret sauce that it has continued to, been able to generate those ideas, but also create and execute and realize those ideas
EDL	00:22:58,470	00:23:03,897	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think, on the one hand, certainly from the technical technology office, from which I hear, 
EDL	00:23:03,897	00:23:14,361	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	we really love seeing technologies demonstrated so systems being brought together and realized in some sort of field test demonstration, and I think that's one end. 
EDL	00:23:14,361	00:23:15,440	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	on the other hand
EDL	00:23:15,440	00:23:20,530	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We're interested in creating whole new, foundation whole new
EDL	00:23:20,530	00:23:23,540	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	areas of research that hadn't really been thought about.
EDL	00:23:23,540	00:23:34,390	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I think that being able of expand that spectrum and do it in the context of, you know, one hundred or so of programming and across 300 programs is a pretty phenomenal(不寻常)
EDL	00:23:34,770	00:23:42,323	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I'd say, one another way that I describe DARPA, this was, uh, one of my colleagues had previously described research this way
EDL	00:23:42,323	00:23:47,210	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Is there're a lot of folks out there that might say some research is impossible
EDL	00:23:47,210	00:23:49,072	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	or some vision is impossible
EDL	00:23:49,072	00:23:53,595	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And my colleague at the time said, actually no, it's not impossible
EDL	00:23:53,595	00:23:55,457	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It's rather, it's unpossible
EDL	00:23:55,457	00:23:57,851	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It's just that it hasn't been done yet
EDL	00:23:57,851	00:24:01,000	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It is not that it can't been done yet
EDL	00:24:01,000	00:24:08,719	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and I like to embrace that philosophy and everything that I try to touch in the sense, just because I hadn't been done before
EDL	00:24:08,719	00:24:11,243	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	is not proof that it can't be done.
EDL	00:24:11,243	00:24:15,814	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	In fact, its challenge, say, that maybe I am the one who can do it, 
EDL	00:24:15,814	00:24:19,731	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and DARPA really gives us both the tools and inspiration, 
EDL	00:24:19,731	00:24:30,740	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and the kind of community, as to say, that both the support, but also my, you know, program manager colleagues, when I see all the amazing things they are making possible
EDL	00:24:31,880	00:24:37,450	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	it makes me think that the things might have been considered impossible, or simply just opportunities. 
EDL	00:24:38,020	00:24:43,740	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We're getting towards the end here, but I want to get into a couple of questions that are more about technology in general
EDL	00:24:44,060	00:24:47,960	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	First, I want to ask you about the kinds of technology is developing
EDL	00:24:47,960	00:24:51,372	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We're talking now here, about humans and machines working together
EDL	00:24:51,372	00:24:58,778	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	DARPA has a long long history going back even to 1960s, thinking about that particular kind of powerful dynamic.
EDL	00:24:58,778	00:25:02,910	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So I'm just wondering what excites you most about these technologies? 
EDL	00:25:03,270	00:25:12,663	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	As you said it is the intersection of the human, machines synbiosis(协同生物) that is in a lot of DARPA's genetic code already
EDL	00:25:12,663	00:25:17,546	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So I am leveraging understanding on their shoulders for sure
EDL	00:25:17,546	00:25:22,430	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think the thing that perhaps excites me a lot about these technologies
EDL	00:25:22,430	00:25:29,050	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	is the idea that we'll have to look at our robotic teams in [fuck] different ways
EDL	00:25:29,050	00:25:34,468	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	What I mean by that is a lot of maybe a research has been done on what it means to
EDL	00:25:34,468	00:25:43,750	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	work with a single robot, or maybe a few robots, but we're narrowly pushing what it means to work with multiple, many robots
EDL	00:25:43,750	00:25:56,627	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I think this is a really rich area of new research to be had in the sense that the way I would interact with my small team of researchers, or at a startup company, 
EDL	00:25:56,627	00:26:06,590	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	or something like that is very different men, how I would want to interact a larger company or a larger project team, and that goes analogously(类似的) with team of robots
EDL	00:26:06,590	00:26:19,632	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so I think how we work with mixed, but physically mixed in terms of your air and ground, but uh mixed as in the functions that these robots will play in a composition of a team
EDL	00:26:19,632	00:26:30,098	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I think the type of [...] is really gonna open up not only new capabilities, but also plane proceeds for new foundation of research to be done as well
EDL	00:26:30,098	00:26:43,032	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So that's gonna be one of the, interestingly, behind, if I can say that, both of these problems, is understanding what it means to work when you have high complexity in a robot team itself, 
EDL	00:26:43,032	00:26:54,555	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and that warrants high complexity, warrants new math, new communication networks, new compute methodologies, new sensing approaches or new algorithms
EDL	00:26:54,555	00:27:01,568	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And I think both of these programs have started to, bear some of the fruit out and lay some of the foundations
EDL	00:27:01,568	00:27:03,970	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So that's been really, really exciting. 
EDL	00:27:03,970	00:27:06,050	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And that's a lot of foundation to lay down
EDL	00:27:06,620	00:27:10,130	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	We all know how much it takes for people to work well together
EDL	00:27:10,130	00:27:20,640	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So I'm not surprised to hear about the enormity(棘手) and complexity of the task to realize the mission in which humans and machines work together almost as if they were one hybrid organism, very cool stuff. 
EDL	00:27:21,820	00:27:27,140	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It is, and I think it's important to know how that work is continuing
EDL	00:27:27,140	00:27:28,240	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I've been reference
EDL	00:27:28,240	00:27:35,675	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	at the beginning of the episode, but there is no doubt Covid19 will be an historic marker for all of our lives. 
EDL	00:27:35,675	00:27:44,490	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It would be interesting to know, Tim, how it is affected your work, and perhaps the near term goals in deliverables for some of these programs you're working on. 
EDL	00:27:45,370	00:27:55,734	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Yeah, no doubt Covid19 has had its impact, one of the things about DARPA is that it's all about being able to be nimble(灵活) and adaptive, 
EDL	00:27:55,734	00:28:05,970	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and so I think, even in the context of OFFSET and SubT challenge, the impact really is felt in the context of, as I mentioned earlier, is about trying to get robots in the real world
EDL	00:28:06,330	00:28:22,660	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And when it's difficult to go to the real world to get those lessons learned and put a robot in those context, which, which Covid19 is really limited our ability to do that, it definitely does impact the type of progres and lessons learned we can achieve
EDL	00:28:23,010	00:28:36,650	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	But in that same vein, both of these problems have a theme of leveraging the virtual environment to, kind of, balance in couple and accelerate the lessons that we learn in the real world
EDL	00:28:37,110	00:28:46,710	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so, in OFFSET we have two virtual environments that allow us to explore, test, simulate swarm tactics and execution
EDL	00:28:46,710	00:28:58,391	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And we do that with realistic environment. In test site we will have a 3D model of a test site, and we'll replicate what it is that we're testing in a synthetic environment
EDL	00:28:58,391	00:29:07,299	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And the OFFSET program was structured from getgo whether there're robot, whether they're simulated real, don't know that they're plugged in to the simulated world. 
EDL	00:29:07,299	00:29:20,730	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So we really leaned to that aspect, the OFFSET programs so that we can still continue to discover new ideas and strengthen the insights that we hope or translate to
EDL	00:29:20,730	00:29:35,177	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	the fourth dominic field test of OFFSET program for the SubT challenge again, that virtual environment plays a huge role for SubT and since that we have the virtual competition alongside the system's competition
EDL	00:29:35,177	00:29:41,810	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	So whereas(然而) we might be physically putting robots in underground environments, for the system's competition
EDL	00:29:41,810	00:29:52,177	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	we've created that SubT simulator that allows for teams to not only practice and test, but also compete in virtual environment
EDL	00:29:52,177	00:29:56,673	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And so that virtual environment has given us another opportunity, 
EDL	00:29:56,673	00:30:10,032	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and in some ways of relief alf for teams, who are constrained and being able to go to the site, to go on the test, I can still do some of that development in the simulated contexts to go 
EDL	00:30:10,032	00:30:20,000	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	and and you know keeping the ball rolling forward, 'cause OFFSET and SubT both about keeping up the momentum of a research, just like the rest of DARPA. I'd one of the other
EDL	00:30:20,430	00:30:30,301	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	impacts, of course, is that community I described earlier about getting people together and facilitating the exchange of information or bouncing ideas or seeing what works
EDL	00:30:32,934	00:30:35,675	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	imitating it in my own research, or whatever I mean, 
EDL	00:30:35,675	00:30:54,435	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	each of these teams benefits from the interaction in very different, but also in profound ways fastering the sense of community, through online community forum, or being able to open up a collaborative web space for teams to share their software
EDL	00:30:54,435	00:30:58,770	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	deliverables are ways that were trying to live in this normal. 
EDL	00:30:59,350	00:31:03,200	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Tim, thank you for your time, for your insights into your work with DARPA. 
EDL	00:31:04,000	00:31:05,120	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	It's been a pleasure
EDL	00:31:05,540	00:31:06,200	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Thank you so much.
EDL	00:31:06,900	00:31:15,410	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I will encourage everyone to spend some time exploring the SubT challenge, play list on DARPA's youtube channel, to get an idea of how teams are tackling the underground
EDL	00:31:15,820	00:31:20,500	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	You can see a couple of recent OFFSET field experiments on the youtube channel as well
EDL	00:31:21,140	00:31:24,680	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And Ivan, it's been great joing you as the co-hosts
EDL	00:31:24,680	00:31:27,340	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	I look forward to seeing you back in the studio. 
EDL	00:31:28,230	00:31:30,710	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Yes, and it was my pleasure too to share
EDL	00:31:30,710	00:31:36,570	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	this is a tag team podcast with you Tabatha, and also just to learn so much about what you're doing
EDL	00:31:36,910	00:31:39,260	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	Tim, It's been really, really fascinating
EDL	00:31:39,260	00:31:49,984	| VfD E28 Swarm Commander |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us, I hope you join us again for the next Voices from DARPA.
