00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,730
Step of technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand are tonight . 

2
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,000
Technology is a driver of our times . 

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:31,740
Since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research agency has been a driver of technology . 

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,260
Welcome to Voices from drug a window onto the top is cool of program managers , their job to redefine what possible . 

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,600
My name is ivan , a motel , and on your dark host today , I am pleased to be talking with us . 

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:01:04,680
Air force lottery cannon children , david lewis , a program manager in the agencies , defense sciences office , just not before we proceed , we are recording our conversations from our respective homes as we do our parts to slow the spread of coffee nineteenth , because we are not in a recording studio . 

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,148
You might hear ambient sounds like trucks , birds , and at this time of the summer . 

8
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,000
Even secretary . 

9
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:38,117
So let me say a few things about david before we talk about programs , and let's just say the david , as is more casual in home , has been immersed in the heart sciences for quite a while after collecting bachelor's degrees in both physics and chemistry here and the physics in twenty eleven from the air force institute of technology , which is located at the right pattern air force base near data , no higher at the institute . 

10
00:01:38,117 --> 00:02:10,610
David was an assistant professor of physics where he taught coal graduate , physical and helped usher and mentor more than sixty officers in civilians through graduation prior to coming to their , but they would also took on assignments with the joint special operations command , the defense threat dictionary agency in the air force research laboratories , sensors directorate , instead of a fascination in applying quantum mechanics , the physics of the space environment , plasmas and gravitational physics in unique ways to take on duty changes . 

11
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,352
Lu tennis kernel , lewis , david , thanks for joining me in this conversation . 

12
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,627
Glad to be here again . 

13
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:17,902
Thanks for having me . 

14
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:37,402
You have a portfolio , five programs to meet astonishing all of the way from the deep math underlying optimization challenges , such as road planning and allocation of resources to finding ways of using untapped signals in the atmosphere as indicators of natural and human activities on the planets surface . 

15
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:50,604
And we're gonna dive into those in just a minute first , though , because I like to think of this part case is potentially inspiration of young people considering stamp careers that is careers in and technology , engineering and math . 

16
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:55,392
I usually ask my conversation partners to get a bit out of biographical first . 

17
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,389
So let's do that . 

18
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:01,673
And you were an ambitious undergraduate for one earning group of in both chemistry and physics . 

19
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:07,113
Are you going to chemistry degree myself and italia , that was enough of a challenge for me . 

20
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:13,180
So when I think of you take taken on both chemistry and physics , once I know you were committed and very busy . 

21
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:28,865
So what were the influences in your life that instead you with an interesting science that was so strong that you collected those two degrees as an undergraduate , went on to become a car carrying PHDand physics , and and beyond that , it brought on an entire career in science . 

22
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:29,350
And now. 

23
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:40,266
然后就代表我们，i think that the two major influences in my life were probably one starts at the next generation , number two natural philosophy . 

24
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:49,830
You know , the show that I watched all the time of my father will start at the next generation , and I added that they are joining the forward to their chief engineer . 

25
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,300
And zhang looked at the cabinet , the enterprise where my two favorite characters . 

26
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:02,130
And so you know what those type of of shows are , including a science fiction reading . 

27
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,810
It really gives an area for us to sort of explore humanity and what it might look like in the future . 

28
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:26,830
And of course , I was always obsessed with the , with the technology , right , you know , how is it possibly go faster than the speed of late in the released , in theory , for this TVshow , when I just all the physics that's incorporated into that show , I think the other big influence in my life has been . 

29
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:42,979
Philosophy is so i've been interested in philosophy , you know , before I knew a philosophy was right in our justice , the young child to ask those questions why and how , when I always just thought I used to look up at the sky when I was the bus stop , when I was really anger , kept woken up . 

30
00:04:42,979 --> 00:05:04,490
So we know whether the solar system , then also an effectiveness of the large scale structure , the universe , and it's going to have an essential liberty for trying to understand the natural world , and it is made sense to me that I had to keep going with physics , palestinian chemistry and all the wonderful science is out there to be export. 

31
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,940
I know I love those influences , and you know , one being science fiction . 

32
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,810
I too , have just loved the entire set of thorough series . 

33
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,432
Jordan is an interesting character to me too , because you mean he was sort of a champion in a way at an illustration of optical physics . 

34
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:25,970
You know , when you think of the flies or he had so the hero , instead of just seeing a little rainbow of visible like that , we see , right . 

35
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:35,601
My understanding is right of what that technology was supposed to be able to get gave invasion all the way through the entire electoral magnetic spectrum . 

36
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:55,440
So , and then , just , you know , your boy , who , you know , wonder , just looking up at the stars and allowing yourself just to be so instead , by the mystery and wonderful that , so that's kind of , in some ways , the , the origins of some of your intellectual interests , but you also , one of the few program managers are dark at any particular time , and who goes to work in a military uniform . 

37
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,850
So tell me briefly about how you entered into military servicemen and made it clear about. 

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,875
I know when you younger life is pretty simple . 

39
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:19,580
So going from high school to to undergraduate , the plane was simple , and I was going to join the air force , become a pilot , five hundred and two , and I was going to test pilots go , and then I was going to be an action up so I could be in space , just like starting at the next generation . 

40
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,310
But my fresh mania of undergraduate september eleven has happened . 

41
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,490
And you know , that variously changed the scope of our nation and where our resources went . 

42
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:38,850
And so , you know , one of the things that sort of alcohol consequence of that is that our space program was no longer a higher priority . 

43
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,350
Is it was , of course , because we were involved with everything that happened after september eleventh . 

44
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:54,390
And so that being the case , my sort of sense of duty still to go over , and even though it's naturally join the military for if you will selfish reasons . 

45
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,930
I thought it was a good path to be an asian september eleven completely changed my outlook . 

46
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:07,720
And so I have in a cap with the military ever since , and I actually did get my pilots . 

47
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:23,520
And I started undergraduate palestinian UPUT, but in the most I had to , as I called it kill a childhood dream , you know , and working at what fires do and also knowing sort of my own skills . 

48
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:43,390
QIC, when I can do in scientific technology , I told myself , know what if it is probably better , you can do more for the service by being a physicist and developing the next generation of tools , techniques , capabilities , then you can be in a pilot . 

49
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,150
Clearly nothing against pilots . 

50
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:57,820
I think they are on the greatest occupations in the world , and I still look in afternoon and two , and after the fires and said in myself , man , I could have been me , but at the same same time , kind of like a third man with grip . 

51
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,810
Hair comes great responsibility . 

52
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:09,920
Dessert of being software of my skills , and I told myself , it's probably best that you go be a physicist in the military , and you can probably do more good . 

53
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,180
And ever since i've stuck with being in the military at three seconds then. 

54
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:24,680
And thanks for sharing that it always fascinates me to hear those kind of transformed of moments at which someone's life really kind of takes on a different trajectory . 

55
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,090
So one more question before we start talking about your programs , I am always interested in . 

56
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,220
How did you get to dark story ? 

57
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,370
I'd like to hear yours , but. 

58
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,716
How I get to double , I will call that work , and bad luck . 

59
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:43,872
I mean , the definition of luck , where preparation with the opportunity , just a quick bit of background . 

60
00:08:43,872 --> 00:09:00,940
So when I was going through my PHDprogram , I was supposed to immediately become a professor arrangements , but afterwards , but the air force said , nokia have to do was called intervening operations tour to sort of payback for the education . 

61
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,640
We know the time was a lot of the opposite , because I really want to be a professor immediately . 

62
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,870
But however , I want to defend threat reduction agency . 

63
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:19,110
Let's write it a whole lot of offensive corner WMDadvanced development , weapons of mass description . 

64
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,140
And so it was through the work that I did . 

65
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:48,300
There were a double PMtook notice of it and actually came down to understand the research that I was doing , and that my office was doing that actually invited me up to starbucks for about a month that hope this PM worked on a new start program concept , and I was absolutely enthralled , right , because in a barber has always been a one of my dream , but not sort of . 

66
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,430
It always has been one of my dream jobs , so you know , I think I was a cabin at the time . 

67
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,090
So , of course , i'm super excited . 

68
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,890
I'm going to divert . 

69
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,780
I'm helping them all . 

70
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,150
This is fantastic in the month past . 

71
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,670
And what about natural men ? 

72
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:13,148
And once I finished our deadline assignment , I was then able to go ahead and go back to air force sensitive technology to the , and it was the sort of one on one of those days . 

73
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:23,750
I know , I believe it was at the beginning of two thousand and seventeen , as at my desk , and I got a phone call from this PM , who became an office director . 

74
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,650
So hey , how things have been gone ? 

75
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,170
I remember working with you . 

76
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,520
And would you like to come bring an interview to to be APMand it. 

77
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,290
Who was the scheme with it was a technique . 

78
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,800
It , an interesting point there . 

79
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,000
And I went to the finish to , how did I get to dark a story ? 

80
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,620
Taylor required was my first conversion . 

81
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,830
He was PMthat I featured in my very first Voices from our proposal . 

82
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,220
I was like to find it for him . 

83
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,810
So there were even a more of a funders. 

84
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,390
So yeah , that was . 

85
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:59,930
So it was , it was kind of shocking to me , because I , at least in my world , that is the equivalent form . 

86
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,500
Call of saying , hey , congratulations , you're an astronaut . 

87
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,420
And I put on my best military bearing and said yesterday to come from an interview . 

88
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,290
What needs to happen , and I remember getting off the phone and going to talk to then adviser . 

89
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:27,290
But now colleague that after day with weeks , I wanted my phd under , I went to his office , told him what happened , and my hands at the level when I said to myself , what if they do not accept me ? 

90
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,950
And he says , well , you have the chance of the opportunity go for . 

91
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,670
And then I said , what if they do , accept me ? 

92
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,240
Hey , and gonna , be APMAdark owners . 

93
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:56,697
Can I be the slope of responsibility so that that's going to help it , and I bring up the lock , the preparation plus opportunity pieces that said , beginning , there's a phrase that we use in the air force all the time , and that is a bloom where you are planted , meaning , of course , being in the military , we don't get to choose where we live all the time . 

94
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:59,786
We don't necessarily get the truth with assignments . 

95
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:16,710
We too , and so that the phrases to say that , no matter where you are , do the best that you can do , because it's going to help out the country , and you always have to be prepared for when opportunity knocks , excellent opportunity , and my opinion shows up at everyone . 

96
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,300
store . 

97
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:25,830
Question is , what are you going to prepare for the opportunity when it , it took a lot of preparation ? 

98
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:32,220
Pretty much I think of my entire air force career up until that point to be ready for this opportunity . 

99
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,650
And it worked out last. 

100
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,130
Now that we have some idea regarding , from once you have come a day , but let's take a tour of where you are now . 

101
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:49,003
And that means let's talk about your dark programs , and let's start with two of them that , to me , share several thematic threads . 

102
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:58,860
And these include sophisticated mathematics , computation and making sense of things in the midst of changing , uncertain and incomplete information . 

103
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:12,100
So one of the programs referring to goes by the name backgrounds , which I think , is not for the eighteen century mathematician joseph lewis playground , and the other goes by the name virtual intelligence process to talk me about those things. 

104
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:20,590
All of these programs are a mathematics programs , and I see said in the midst of changing , uncertain and incomplete information . 

105
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,760
So we'll start off with the ground , which is a program all about optimization . 

106
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,570
So optimization is everywhere , but the type of optimization were talking about here . 

107
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:37,670
I will put in the difficult arena of trying to solve . 

108
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,880
This is not your typical in or take the function . 

109
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,820
I said , the reality of equal type of optimization . 

110
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,140
This is optimization , where the model changes over the time , but the constraints change over time . 

111
00:13:51,220 --> 00:14:01,240
And you get an information that is dreaming , and the sort of the traditional MPhard problem , if you will , an optimization as the traveling sales person problem . 

112
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:17,280
And let's see now , you have a number of locations that you would like to visit that are connected in certain ways , and you want to visit each location and the shortest path possible that actually is an extremely hard problem to do . 

113
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:45,087
And so what the laboratory program looked at was , instead of looking at it from your traditional outbreak point of it , really looked at it from a geometric and top electrical point of view to see we can bring in those tools for most areas of mathematics , and these optimization problems also , wanna say , as well as the , you know , the problem of optimism is probably the problem . 

114
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:59,660
And the department of defence rate , because we want to always optimize for most performance , lowest costs , make sure that we apply our resources correctly , and we don't waste any . 

115
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,810
And so some of the interesting things that have come out of grass , what branches has ended , but we're moving until the transition period . 

116
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,632
We're getting . 

117
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:11,510
Some of these technologies are into the worldwide . 

118
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:23,829
But I think one of the , the news thinks it came out of algorithms program , according to highlight , is a night to the traveling sales problem called the travelling physicist problem . 

119
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:30,190
So one of our performers , inspired by what NASA had done bargainer the space race . 

120
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:49,310
So when you are trying to , for example , get satellite out to other planets so that you can study those planet if you take your typical travelling sales person , thought brain work to that , then you try to go from planet to planet in a straight line for a lack of better term . 

121
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:57,140
But that doesn't work so well when you have gravitation of potential , because it would cost a lot of energy to go from point to point . 

122
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:09,640
So what else I did at the time instead , was well thinking about orbital transfer manufacturers and orbitals link shots that , you know , have a longer path and figure to the next planet . 

123
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,300
I would never try to study , but it cost less energy to do . 

124
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:22,500
And so our performer was inspired by that and applied this type of thinking to an orange tearing problem . 

125
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,960
So an orange orange problem is , for example , where you have a platform that's trying . 

126
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:51,606
Uh , ISRintelligence , advanced recognition and has multiple objectives , rather than taking a picture or scanning a certain area , or just being trained on a particular area for a certain amount , you have to combine that with the constraints of the actual platform itself in a platform , being a airplane or a satellite sooner software . 

127
00:16:51,606 --> 00:17:19,217
So this is one of those optimization problems , and they are able to reformulate this problem using the language of function , which is sensitively sort of lives in a dollar space of your typical lecture spaces , and was actually able to piece together using some geometric and top logical wait , not just optimized for distance , but optimize for other things that might be of use . 

128
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:32,530
I already discussed a little bit about less energy , but now you can start to bring in sort of those human defined type of musician ideas , like the number of collections you want to take , or the order . 

129
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,390
I want to take those collections . 

130
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,500
You can start up the machine over time . 

131
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,160
Saturday doesn't really , really cool . 

132
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
Highlight the came out there to A. 

133
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:57,550
Interesting is , okay when i'm hearing is like going at the fundamental mathematical foundations and and really the basics of models that you have to come up with tools and frameworks that then can be applied in many ways to many different kinds of optimization tasks. 

134
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,045
Absolutely , and so I thought of trying to explore , sorry , no word else . 

135
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:12,540
Can we use this framework , this methodology , as we are looking at things like rejected redesign is another problem that could be method onto the mathematics are coming out of this particular problem. 

136
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,830
So now maybe you can talk me a little bit about the others are a very mathematic heavy program , virtual intelligence. 

137
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,730
Yes , the VIP is a fantastic program . 

138
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:30,402
It was conceived and started by michael ali , who has now moved on to the analysis . 

139
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:42,940
But is the idea here for the VIP program is to be inspired by how the rain works and try and manifest that enter new mathematics . 

140
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,740
And we were looking to apply all this course . 

141
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,040
Is starbucks push for third wave artificial intelligence ? 

142
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,470
That's artificial intelligence that is contemporary , aware that is a partner with us . 

143
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,252
We know , versus the second way , watches more big data and statistical influences . 

144
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:15,118
So one of the need things about the VIP program is not only looking at new mathematics , but we are also looking at what we call non violent movement computing architectures . 

145
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:21,212
So these are hardware architecture that mimic the way the brain processes . 

146
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:26,176
So we're talking about various types of networks and hardware . 

147
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:31,068
We are also talking about combining computing and memory and one . 

148
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,242
And what we call men computing . 

149
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:46,320
And so I think one of the highlights that I like to tell one of the mathematical tools that were using and try to employment here is this idea of using what we call high dimensional factors . 

150
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:01,528
One of the next thing she can do with these very large factors is that if you can find a way to take dance information , say images that you might want to classify and be able to sparse a further information action to these factors . 

151
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:08,079
Others are unique mathematical property and which all these factors are what's called quiz or thug in all . 

152
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:15,130
So there are different , but almost the same in certain areas , and what you can do is you factor those very quickly ? 

153
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:38,780
So what that allows us than to do is to process dance information very quickly , and people to learn on that information very quickly , and it's all been inspired about thinking of , how can we map are a lot of mathematics to the way that the brain processes and functions cause our brains are very good classifying things . 

154
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:45,250
So it is blue at the dog that the cat that threatens not a threat , right ? 

155
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,660
We do that very quickly . 

156
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:54,900
So how do we get our machines , if you will our processing to do that , we know hands moving to technologies to get us to the third way of. 

157
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,790
Okay , then before we move on , wearing a lifecycle of a program is virtual or just processing. 

158
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,780
So it's a slightly month program . 

159
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,420
We're finishing up the first year here , and we're right now making decisions to see . 

160
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,820
But who is moving on to too . 

161
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:22,610
So we hope that the outcomes of this VIP program for lead and to figure darker programs are surrounding things like unconventional computing. 

162
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,080
Now we want to move on to another paragraph programs that also seem to share a thematic threat . 

163
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:36,943
But in this case , the challenge of knowing what is going on , invest volumes of space or monitoring characteristics of those uniquely revealing . 

164
00:21:36,943 --> 00:22:04,520
In this case , i'm talking about one of your programs called space environment exploitation , the sea program , and that's reaching tortured capability , accurately forecasting space weather and conditions and ethnically connected to to another program atmosphere as a sensor , or at most sense , that investigating how events on the surface of the earth leave detectable impressions in the vast admit spiritual gray , which thereby conserved , perhaps as a sensor for those earthbound . 

165
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,990
If that so talked to me about each of those. 

166
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,440
Yeah , so we , we go from the mathematics . 

167
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,450
So that is a large scale , at least large scale in terms of our own environment . 

168
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,070
right ? 

169
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,110
So the space involvement , exploitation has A, Ithink that a fairly fun background . 

170
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:42,060
I said , when I was at an athlete , I just got back from a nine months appointment was the joint special operations command , and as I was getting back , the swing of things be a professor agenda to continue being professional , my , my colleague and my good friends at ten o'clock on an hour walking to my office one day . 

171
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:58,837
And I don't know , just for a few months at the point and asked your question if you take one electron and you inserted into the earth ionosphere , which consists of a bath of electrons , a sea of electrons . 

172
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:04,050
If you will , I , as can you predict how the honest fear is going to respond ? 

173
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,580
So I looked at him . 

174
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,450
He looked at me . 

175
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,770
I looked at him again , and I started laughing . 

176
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,940
So anyone who has been through the throws of a statistical mechanics course , or a thermodynamics course . 

177
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:30,410
Just you , you laugh at the almost intractability of that problem on the microscope because they would take a computer , you know , at least half the age of an university to answer that question . 

178
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:42,596
So I started digging a little bit more to what he was asking to understand what the operation we happened to be talking about the second part when we were a bar and did no higher . 

179
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:49,539
So sort of that year , you'll typical in a year at a conference , so you write on the back of an action type of thing . 

180
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:59,700
I started some of the things that I saw during the appointment with what he was looking at and trying to help out some more fires and bring our capability . 

181
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:07,350
So in the end , as we want to go , visit the UK, want to go , visit japan and see what their capabilities were . 

182
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,900
Of course , we , we talk to all the relevant organizations within the united . 

183
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:50,860
I started thinking to myself that I don't think we have the right set of capabilities to bring the prediction of the near of space , environmental relevance model being my relevant , that a decision maker , like when we're deployed , would actually take that information into account when I make a decision to assign some degradation of keep bodies , if you will , when we're deployed , that I think I was that , you know , there must be something going on in the space environment , because everything else seems perfect , but we use comes all the time , and those comes you link to a satellite . 

184
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:57,900
So you know , if I could give a prediction to say , you know , this is what the space environments can be doing to us today . 

185
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,920
That will be fantastic for the war fighter . 

186
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,160
That's all the sea program sort of came to be . 

187
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,660
And it was towards the end of that exploration , right at the phone call from DARPA . 

188
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,860
And I said , hey , let me tell you what hard problem work on right now . 

189
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,712
So that became the sea program . 

190
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:23,320
I am , we're looking to do with this program is we're looking to be able to to predict that near a space environment of the specificity and occasions that's useful for the war fighter . 

191
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:39,930
So if you look at the matrix for the program that I put out as a challenge to the community that challenges to be able to predict every hour on the hour for seven years , what that space environment is going to be like uh over particular area of responsibility . 

192
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,170
So , as I saw at the time , there is an opportunity to sort of start over again , right ? 

193
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,858
So let's take everything that we , as this community knows . 

194
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:56,282
Her put together worth with current model simulation and delivers simulation . 

195
00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:58,747
So let's take all the lessons learned . 

196
00:25:58,747 --> 00:25:59,980
Let's start over . 

197
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,677
We do the physics representations . 

198
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:15,870
And now what supply things like executive computing , GPU s and TPU , lots of child machine learning techniques , because I think we have a chance to bring this type of prediction to relevance . 

199
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,990
And so that were pushing for right now. 

200
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:27,240
One quick question on that , because we , we have had a capability of predicting , forecasting space weather for a while , for a very example of this is a solar flare . 

201
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,850
We have some idea what that , what that can mean for the earth environment when that will happen . 

202
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,500
Sounds to me like what you're getting out here . 

203
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,715
There was a kind of granted of that forecast that we've never heard it . 

204
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:46,640
Someone's like going to the no weather forecast inside and putting music code in the same when he was , what was the weather going on for , here is that kind of idea? 

205
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,120
Yeah , that's not a bad way to look at it . 

206
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,100
You know , it's one thing to to predict solid players , and all that . 

207
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,310
That's important . 

208
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:06,425
But when you look through the literature , and you talk to scientists and engineers , part of the variability from me that we see in the atmosphere actually comes from below . 

209
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:30,260
So let's sort of the neutral atmosphere pushing on and protecting the atmosphere , and in terms of being an operational tool , bringing operation relevance , you know that the commander on the ground and now in space doesn't really , you know , care if you will , if there is a software for our coming , I mean , they do . 

210
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:37,070
But when we look at the kittens , we conduct operations on in a way through sorts , every hour of the power . 

211
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:44,770
So we need that green , you already , as you talked about to understand , I think even more so to maybe exploit certain situations . 

212
00:27:45,030 --> 00:28:02,637
You know , one of the things that were taught as officers going through our military education is that you want to be able to understand the environment that you are operating on or with them , so that you can take advantage of it , and or to take advantage of that , be able to predict it and a particular degrees . 

213
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,260
Magic and use that information. 

214
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,518
So david , you just spoke about the space environment exploitation program . 

215
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:14,340
And now I like you to talk about atmosphere is a sensor or atmospheric program. 

216
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:25,070
Yeah , so that the amazon program is really fun program , the genesis of this program , of course , did come a little bit from a space environment exploitation . 

217
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:42,220
But I think I am also , what sort of my microbiologist wonderment of what we could do , different one trend that we see both the and commercial world is the evolution and building of the slow earth orbit , satellite clusters . 

218
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,470
We know , make them distributed , make them your best so that we can better communicate . 

219
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,950
We can better do ISR, so and so forth . 

220
00:28:50,440 --> 00:29:02,310
I'm so in my head , and I am thinking that is a great idea , but that's going to be a lot of cost , a lot of energy that you have to out there to put into orders , right ? 

221
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,220
It's the oscar rotation of potential of the whole schedule . 

222
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:18,490
So I said , what , how else could we maybe think about looking at conducting similar missions , today's layer clusters , or really , I think , more importantly , how can we bolster ? 

223
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,310
How can we support those missions ? 

224
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:26,370
So I sit around one day and I said , well , what are the open orbit while the atmospheres are the open orbit . 

225
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:46,478
But when you start looking through the literature , the atmosphere really access an information , results of war , so things like earthquakes and tsunami they push around , or they move the neutral atmosphere , and the mutual atmosphere responds in a way that you think it worked from classical mechanics . 

226
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:58,280
You get AArebounding for a safety ruler , harmonic type revision , and this energy then gets transported through the atmosphere all the way up with the atmosphere . 

227
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:07,290
So we're talking to your column to holding up to a hundred kilometers sweep , and we could attack this if you look at the measurement for GPS. 

228
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:17,630
So from a global positioning system , tolerate on content measures , so the GPS cannot have two different faces available for us to look at . 

229
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:32,650
And since that electronic energy is propagating through AAcharge atmosphere , meaning the honest fear , my different frequencies , you can see different faiths , and so you can back up with those faithfully honest here . 

230
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,670
Wave was bouncing packaging fourth , and so those can be correlated to earthquakes and tsunamis . 

231
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,630
And so in my head as well , this is a , this is a huge sensor , right . 

232
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:56,840
And so it started then to get me to think about what's the smallest detectable disturbance you might be able to pick up not too different than oats moving an ocean . 

233
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:04,470
Anyone who has ever been selling knows that awake book makes if the speed boat versus a big tankers different , right . 

234
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:20,980
And so I started thinking along those lines , and then , once again , doubt on a literature , and it leads to me and the arguments that made is , there's a lot more basic science that we need to understand about energy propagation in the atmosphere . 

235
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:39,200
So this release is our basic science program to better get a handle of how the whole atmosphere responds that the troops fear , the strategic fear , the mother's fear and ionosphere how energy propagate through the whole atmosphere , because the atmosphere does change , rate . 

236
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,084
It changes the density of changes that constituency . 

237
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,114
And so reactivity . 

238
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:55,010
And I think that there are six dollars in the atmosphere that we might be able to learn , understand and then try and back out what polluted it so on this way , I think of the atmosphere is a big information . 

239
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,900
Reservoir is just right for exploitation . 

240
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,930
I love how big. 

241
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,630
Thinking this is really a sort of . 

242
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:11,430
Just think about the entire gear system , the entire kind of planet dairy system as having sensory capabilities that we might build . 

243
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,180
Who are tapping to when and the certain things that we otherwise might not . 

244
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,440
So I love to watch out the program . 

245
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:25,280
Emma , since unfolds as you continue to oversee it , one program of this program is that worker is not going to talk about . 

246
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:32,300
It goes by the short name that stands for quest for undiscovered energy storage and thrust . 

247
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:43,960
And the reason we are not going to talk about it is because I know you can hear that from my city , who I was a program manager in d so , and just recently left , and he was also with me on a package , and we spoke about quests there . 

248
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,750
So i'll just direct listeners to the mike fitty podcast to learn about that program . 

249
00:32:49,750 --> 00:33:08,110
But it is fascinated , saw that china , you know , apply pretty sophisticated and abstract quantum mechanical ideas and phenomenon to potentially use space itself as as a means of generating thrust in proportion without maybe the need for traditional kinds of fuels . 

250
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:13,700
And , you know , in the sense , taking energy at the vacuum itself , and so I just could not be more interesting . 

251
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,720
And so it's , and we must be fun for you to take it up. 

252
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,890
Oh , I love it . 

253
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,110
I love it so much . 

254
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:27,760
I mean , I really thanked my favorite food that together , I was always with them for a little bit in about some ideas with music formulating it . 

255
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,893
So happy to to be able to take that over , but it does not start tracking . 

256
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:33,100
I don't know what it. 

257
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,821
That's right , it really happened . 

258
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:37,576
It does not go back to that original inspiration for you . 

259
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:44,395
So now , as we do so to approach the end of our conversation , there is an opportunity I want to take , and I want to squander . 

260
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:58,063
And another I have you talking with me , but also at a time when we're on a society skills , sort of critical look at ourselves regarding systemic ratio and in justice in our history , but also in these current times . 

261
00:33:58,063 --> 00:34:06,054
So the under representation , northeastern fields in our science , technology , engineering and mathematics , and that's long been known . 

262
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:13,780
And this shortfall is also apparent when you going to institutions in places like double , we actually have been , I am not beneficial . 

263
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,083
Yeah , cell for quite a lot of the pandemic . 

264
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:22,992
But here you are going to do , you know , black scientists of physics professor or technology developer , now it are a program manager . 

265
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:34,450
Just wondering what you can share with us about your experience of being a black person managed to navigate so successfully through the sustainable obstacles and racism that you surely have. 

266
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:43,810
Yeah , so I think this is an important discussion to have , because there are so many different settings that's surrounding this conversation . 

267
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:51,850
So I think I like to sort of start to answer this space , putting up the difference between individual racism and , of course , systematic racism . 

268
00:34:52,400 --> 00:35:04,480
I think one of the things that I has been difficult for others to have this conversation with me is the fact that sometimes users , and example to say that racism has disappeared . 

269
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:13,790
You know , people are david , you know , you have APHDERand the air force , like , we really mean those races are still on the world that we could all that you achieved . 

270
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:27,890
On the one hand , I, Ido agree with them was , in fact , that as far as individual racism goes , I can only probably recount , maybe two situations in my whole life . 

271
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:35,820
We're slurs were thrown on my way , or I was denied something because of the color of my skin . 

272
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,615
I think the I know it is in my , my world . 

273
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:51,120
The individual racism hasn't a big deal , but what I think has been a really big deal is the systematic racism that exist rounders . 

274
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:59,930
And so I think i'll account myself fortunate , and I think this is probably also serves a template to how our country is . 

275
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,450
And she needs to be moved forward . 

276
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:12,700
But when I look back at my life , I have essentially been protected from systematic racism by what are called intersection , airline ship . 

277
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:22,140
So those people are , of course , what the colors who are , who are stewards were allies to protect me from the systematic racism . 

278
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,920
And looking back , this is kind of happened . 

279
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:36,080
I almost argued before I was born first out of data to point out my grandparents , who taught my father that you have to be the smartest in the room . 

280
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:45,683
You have to be the best in the room , and you cannot make any mistakes because of you leave one person back in the armor , they'll focus on the fact that you're black . 

281
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:55,800
So you know , my grandparents , in order the right and the sake of all the sovereign's movements that happened in order markets ago . 

282
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:01,310
And so they pass the spots that learning on how to behave even as well to my dad . 

283
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:14,490
And he passed it down to me , I think another example would like to bring up forever , you know , being protected by systematic racism , and ah was actually my father's first boss . 

284
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:28,660
So my father's advertise power engineer , logical engineer , and he told me a story when he got his first race , his boss would give it to my dad's , like when she gave me my raise . 

285
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:35,470
And so my first boss was like already gonna do with this money , and my father really had no answer at the time , right . 

286
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:41,460
And so it was my desk for his boss who said , you know , come back to me . 

287
00:37:41,460 --> 00:38:00,950
What's an idea what you can do with this extra money , and then , so you know , let have to point out this first boss , my father's husband and I called my , my , my granddad , because he thought I told my father , at least at the time , song basics about financing and investing , song and so forth . 

288
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,490
That was not talk about my grandparents . 

289
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:10,790
They were talk to my grandparents , play their parents who were not talked to because they know they are busy with the sovereign movement . 

290
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,150
And so I think that said , it is my dad on a path . 

291
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:20,130
This was what it takes in this information that isn't where I was introduced to people of color . 

292
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:32,326
I think another story that I like to bring up a second of three that I can protect it from sort of systematic racism was with my six grade teacher , you know , and six grade , I thought I had this . 

293
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:38,090
I don't know reputations to the right word , but refugee always thought that was bored in class . 

294
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:38,921
Great cause . 

295
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,790
Get the homework assignments . 

296
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,414
I do that . 

297
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:47,231
My tunnel man , read all the books sector , and I just kind of bought and moving from sixty seventh grade . 

298
00:38:47,231 --> 00:39:01,370
I was going to go into the local high school rape , but my sister teacher actually called my father , and I once again knew his white male and said , I don't think your son should go to the local high school school or the district high school . 

299
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,080
And my dad was kind of like , what do you mean like , where should we go there ? 

300
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:22,470
And it was like , I think your son is fairly gifted , and it would be better for him to go to AAprivate , high school so that , you know , and i'll be real so that he doesn't get caught up and sort of the social desperately get caught up in your activities . 

301
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,420
That , yeah , they are , you know that I look great upon . 

302
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,200
And so my sister , teacher actually helped me get into that school . 

303
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,980
and. 

304
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,650
Find ways to pay for it . 

305
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,960
That's fascinating . 

306
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:40,810
So in a way , without maybe knowing it or having words for recognizing her , the systemic racism in the education system . 

307
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:50,310
And I am happy here that he took a step to try , at least in your case , in the individual case , help you bypass that systemic episode . 

308
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,880
yeah. 

309
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,920
Yeah , I know it is . 

310
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,030
Yes , it is one of the things that you don't realize into to your order . 

311
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,150
Much older , right ? 

312
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:19,570
And so I think the , the last thing that I think we're thinking , protected by systemic racism is I have involved , especially in the world college , but more so in a big my fifty years there , I have always tried as best I can to seek out working for women bosses . 

313
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,120
And i've done that . 

314
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,390
What's the idea that you know what we're talking about right now ? 

315
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:33,420
Races on colorado skin sold in south australia , but these are intersection issues that also cross as well . 

316
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,400
You know , we should just all call them human rights issues . 

317
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,430
But what I have found with working with women . 

318
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,770
Actually , the majority of my boss is healthy , and women , about half of them as a scientist . 

319
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,200
So glad that had the other half in . 

320
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,980
But you know , women face the same type of issues as well . 

321
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,220
And what are they breaking to the glass ceiling , right ? 

322
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:10,690
And so I always found myself that when I work for people who have also become their obstacles , who've broke these glass ceilings that I am more protected from those systematic issues and allowed to . 

323
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:19,460
And so I think my navigation through a workout , this racial atmosphere has been enough . 

324
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,400
I'm just so thankful , really , it takes a whole pound . 

325
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,190
It takes a whole village to raise . 

326
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:37,550
I've been the , you know , on the advantages end of that , and I also would like to point out that it is comforting , and it was a privilege to serve in the military , within the military . 

327
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,590
It is absolutely illegal to discriminate . 

328
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,340
I can start protective categories , raise being one of them . 

329
00:41:44,560 --> 00:42:02,680
So I have , in the case of the military , not saying that they're perfect , because we're still working on our , our systematic issues , but it's comforting to know that if something happens , I can go to the equal opportunity and file a claim felt like the better term . 

330
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:13,060
And so I think that's a nice safeguard to know that I actually have a legal officer if they could help rule this out . 

331
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:25,080
Yeah , I consider myself thankful i've been the on the advantages and a lot of interested in our allies shape , and I think that's really , really , really four need to go after this country . 

332
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,190
So you know , justice is , it has been the benefit of it . 

333
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,690
You know , it's my turn to give back . 

334
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:37,800
And so let's wear also for opportunities to mentor , also for opportunities to teach , so on and so forth . 

335
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,220
Because let's go to the strength of america . 

336
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,300
I think over military is. 

337
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:51,810
Well , not our diversity , just before we leave this subject , which cannot be left and will take years in years , truly work out in good ways . 

338
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:58,930
Let's stand back a bit of , you know , to sort of the technology development context , and , of course , darker is in there . 

339
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:23,430
And just went , you know , if you got some ideas of what will take to close the racial guys , bring more equitable opportunity , not only in a sort of on the same education side of things , but beyond that , into all of the ranks of your program manager there , there is also office directors is all the way to the director of an agency like dark , and it's not just dark , but let's think of the entire in the infrastructure of the country . 

340
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:29,100
What do you think it will take to have equal opportunity and representation through all of those things? 

341
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,900
Yeah , that's , that's a difficult one to answer . 

342
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:41,390
On the one hand , you just have to sort of keep pushing , keep fighting against the momentum that was initially established . 

343
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:52,290
I think that education is the great equalizer and terms of my definition of lock rate , preparation plus opportunity . 

344
00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:10,070
I think that the stamp issue that were talking about now speaks more than preparation , said , and that is continuing to try and make education less expensive is possible to make education more throw . 

345
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:21,620
I think one thing that this in occur and democracy highlighting is that we need to figure out how to conduct education , virtual means . 

346
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:40,620
And I think we will figure it out , and I think that's going to be another technology and the framework that allow the field , because now you are , the code , does it dictate whatever education you have access to , if it can be done virtually , I think the other part of that announced the opportunity . 

347
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:46,090
I think we just have to continue pushing with our making . 

348
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:57,360
All people of color understand these opportunities are available to them and try and show them release , explain to them in what type of preparation and you need to engage . 

349
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,474
And so when the opportunities do come , but you can take hold of them , the opportunities are there . 

350
00:45:03,474 --> 00:45:06,769
I actually believe the opportunities and everywhere . 

351
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:09,185
But she had to be prepared to take them . 

352
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:11,601
I think , finally , all evening goes for us . 

353
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:12,480
Get back to days . 

354
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:12,910
The okay . 

355
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:19,400
And in fact , then it was nationally , it was national pride to say , i'm going to go work from asia . 

356
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:30,734
I mean , to go to develop this technology , I mean , because it's going to put our country heads and tails above our evil series of the time , right ? 

357
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:42,690
And so we've got to find a way to get back to a cool idea with , with the , what can you do for your country when you know , the second quarrel back at the air force trade service before yourself ? 

358
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:52,522
So I think that there's a lot of society we need to push back towards the really good america at the world where we are . 

359
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:54,076
And we were going to go . 

360
00:45:54,076 --> 00:46:01,180
I still have a lot of hope and confidence in america , where innovators and we actually quite a good friend who. 

361
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:25,270
David was really a bleeding to hear that positive consequences that could come out of our covered nineteen experience and referring to the sense that as we're learning online education , in fact , having to move in that direction , that that could have fascinating consequences of the couple . 

362
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:34,258
In a sense , education from location and potentially having a positive effect in providing more education opportunity in a more egalitarian way . 

363
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,841
So we'll see out that unfold . 

364
00:46:35,841 --> 00:46:45,520
And I think it is going to take some real attention already on the the part of some people care about this to make that happen , but it ability to meet you hear about the possibility . 

365
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,290
So one more question before I let you go . 

366
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:55,450
And it is , this , is there anything that did not come up during the conversation that you think would be important or interesting for our listeners know about? 

367
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:07,630
You know , right now , we're going through in a sort of , and so many lifetime situation with this pandemic , I think one thing that I like to leave our listeners with . 

368
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:12,170
I just think about the opportunity we have the country . 

369
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:21,570
And as the end of vegetables , tit to seize this tough time and making an opportunity out of it to think about what is the future look like . 

370
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,400
Where do we want the future to go ? 

371
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,650
Okay , it seems like we say in the upper , sometimes , if you want to bring the future , just create yourself , right . 

372
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,300
But I think we have an opportunity here to release what a change length . 

373
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,915
I thought we do things and variably . 

374
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,400
This is going to change . 

375
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,070
Our economy is probably going to change aspects of our governance structure . 

376
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:48,590
You know , not saying that we're not going to be capitalists were not going to be democratic . 

377
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,716
We're gonna evolve , and it's gonna . 

378
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:53,479
Be interesting to see we'll evolve towards . 

379
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:59,220
And so I think it's important to further for right now to think about what they want the future. 

380
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:14,010
In the beginning of these packages , I save in what do program managers do and the platform that I would say at the beginning , every parker is to read fine was possible , and it shouldn't sound like that's what you're doing as a doctor . 

381
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,956
May you be successful in all of your endeavors , your dark . 

382
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:21,670
I just want to say thoroughly , enjoy the conversation and thank you for sharing this time. 

383
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,630
That sounds great to talk with you , and thank you once again very much. 

384
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:39,980
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dark thanks also to bend , celebrate for his partnership in producing this program . 

385
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:51,659
