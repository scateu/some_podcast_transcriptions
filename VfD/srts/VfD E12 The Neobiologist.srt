Stuff technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand on tournament operation technology is a driver of our times since its founding and nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , durban , the defence advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology . 

2
00:00:32,772 --> 00:00:41,580
Welcome to Voices from darker a window on toddler's core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,125
My name is iphone a motto on your dark host today . 

4
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,942
I am pleased to have with me in the studio . 

5
00:00:47,942 --> 00:00:53,810
Justin gallery , a program manager since twenty fourteen in dark is biological technology . 

6
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:28,540
Justin , on the bachelor of science degree in chemistry at the university of illinois , urbana champagne and aged in chemistry from kale tech for fourteen years prior to arriving at dark , he was a professor in the chemistry department at emory university and inland georgia there , he LED a research program in synthetic biology , which is all about uncovering the rules and genetic programs by which sales behavior upgrade and to learn how to manipulate those rules and programs so that bacterial , fungal plant , animal cells can make drugs , fuels , coatings and other useful molecules . 

7
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:39,880
Materials at DARPA , government continues to be driven by some of natures own most or dishes , biological feeds , such as the growth of a great soccer redwood tree from a seat . 

8
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:57,256
What if it were possible to leverage biologist own evolutionary home powers of chemical growth , cellphone organization , self healing and reproduction in the context of our build landscape of buildings , road vehicles and other constructions . 

9
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:59,237
That is the first question . 

10
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:02,751
Just asking johnson , thanks for joining me in the studio today . 

11
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:03,930
Glad to hear everyone . 

12
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,790
Let's start by talking about your background and how you became interested in science in general and in chemistry and a synthetic biology in. 

13
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,171
I actually started out . 

14
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,947
It was very interesting physics . 

15
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:24,418
I was inspired by a people like richard firemen , and he told these wonderful stories seem like an incredibly interesting guy , sexual , one of the things that promise a cow tag . 

16
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:30,533
I thought , you know , if this character could do such a great scientist was placed that I wanted to be . 

17
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:37,850
I quickly realized after about a week in college that I was not going to be a physicist whenever the less I like . 

18
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,940
So chemistry seems like a good option . 

19
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:49,090
And I always like the idea in chemistry of the ability to create things didn't exist before it is core chemistry as an analytical size . 

20
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,369
We understand the world around us by studying browser is a synthetic site , which means creating new opportunities . 

21
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:57,300
And that was something I was really wrong . 

22
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:07,127
Interestingly enough , I sort of put off biology , my biological education that is formally pretty much handed in the night grade . 

23
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:22,350
But it's time when , on , during a graduate school in post dog , I went from this time where the word DNA and a architect owners do not attend to appoint where I really start to respect the remarkable chemistry that biology does . 

24
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:28,774
I ultimately concluded that no matter how good of chemist I was that biology do better . 

25
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:37,073
So asked the question , okay , well , can we harness the power of biological systems to essentially do our beating for us ? 

26
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:47,490
So how can I reprogram a system that wants to do with one thing and get to the thing that I wanted to do , and that let me into the serious antarctic biology . 

27
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,987
So we were interested in taking advantage of some of the properties that bacteria , simple microbes could do . 

28
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,905
They are really to make stuff . 

29
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,822
They are really to send stuff . 

30
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,980
And I got really interested in. 

31
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:10,190
Ramming that before we talk about the two programs that you're running here dark , but I would like to hear about the sequence of events that let you from your own experience . 

32
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,900
And emery , as a professor to develop itself . 

33
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,600
So how do you and appear? 

34
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,449
So it's a funny story . 

35
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:26,991
I was at a meeting in cold spring harbor , new york , which is beautiful laboratory family's laboratory and long island , female for molecular biology . 

36
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:28,709
and 真的是sure of DNA 。

37
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,924
That's , we're meeting right outside of his office . 

38
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:35,828
We got to see him walk through , coming back from his tennis matches . 

39
00:04:35,828 --> 00:04:40,192
And I was , there was part of a short course on synthetic biology . 

40
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:45,352
So the organizers had brought faculty members from around the country , around the world . 

41
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,788
And about that time , double had announced . 

42
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:53,325
The living foundry is programmed , which is one of the seminars in that biology programs . 

43
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:53,990
Here are dark. 

44
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,020
And then just tell listeners what was the cracks of that. 

45
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:07,970
So the cracks of that program was engineering groups to produce new molecules and to reduce the time of the design billow test learn cycle to do that . 

46
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:19,104
So instead of taking a decade in a billion dollars to generate , they wanted to reduce the time down to maybe days or weeks , and reduce the cost dramatically . 

47
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:19,824
Dropped her . 

48
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:30,216
Just put out a call on early hundred million dollars of investment , and I think , and he likes to say people at this meeting , who are all in this area , got really excited about it . 

49
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:43,190
But we also were sort of amazed by the insults in the authority of a DARPA was asking , and I was getting really excited about this , and I got talking to the younger faculty members of these mostly sister professors that organize the meeting . 

50
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:53,350
And they had mentioned that in a darker was expanding heavily in the senate biology , they were looking for program managers , and it's the program manager . 

51
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,270
I was kind of interesting one in the sense that we're all temporary , dark . 

52
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,950
It doesn't hire permanent staff . 

53
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:07,841
This program , we have an exploration date on our badge minus thirty december twenty eighteen , like , is yourselves , emergency of it . 

54
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:08,994
It certainly does . 

55
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:16,640
So in order to come to this job , you essentially have to leave what you are doing before , with the expectation that this is only going to be a temp job . 

56
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:27,704
So for the folks that come from academics , you more or less have to have a tenure position if you intend to go back because early in your career , you cannot do this and be an assistant professor at the same time . 

57
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,078
It just wouldn't work out . 

58
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:37,140
But since I already had ten year , a lot of my colleagues that you would be great , you know , the field , you have the ability to take a break . 

59
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:48,170
Ironically , after about three years appear , uh , I leave for memory , my team said , are you coming back something I never thought I would say is said , no . 

60
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:55,440
So I gave up a ten year faculty position , a lifetime appointment , something I worked incredibly hard for . 

61
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,200
And scientists , or the end of the bill of a career . 

62
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,250
And I gave up . 

63
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,820
So I am currently have been observing at the pressure of the traffic leadership. 

64
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:17,330
And don't know what i'm gonna do next hurry , but that also is an indication to me that you develop the certain kind of devotion and excitement about the programs that are involved with maybe more than you even expected . 

65
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,080
So let's talk about the two programs . 

66
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,580
The first one goes by the short name of breaks . 

67
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:29,000
BRICS, which stands biological robustness and complex settings . 

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,770
What is it that is now and what you hope to achieve. 

69
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,470
The origin of that program goes back couple of years before I join the agency . 

70
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:54,280
Santa biologists got good engineering bacteria to do what I would call parallel tricks , little cute things that work well in the latter example , engineering bacteria is such that when you expose them to light , they would change color so you could do photography . 

71
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,952
You could take a patriot that she could shine light and shadows and so on , and you could take back photographs . 

72
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:09,766
You'll cube kind of demonstrates the possibility for the field , but at the end of the day , you know , it's not going to put digital cameras . 

73
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:14,974
So I myself have been engineering organisms to follow small molecules with the idea . 

74
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:27,790
Maybe that you could chase down pollutants in the environments , you would have a bacterium that not only wanted to eat the oil , but actually could sense the oil and follow the road around if you wanted to clean up the environment . 

75
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,970
And in doing all this , the question , I would inevitably get asked as okay when you can have transition this to the field . 

76
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,950
And my answer , quite honest , because the systems that we are building work fine at thirty seven degrees . 

77
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:49,830
Sales in a petri dish in a stereo environment with the presence of energy , alex , to keep any competition away . 

78
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,626
So we were literally following these bacteria , and they could perform in that environment . 

79
00:08:55,626 --> 00:09:09,730
But if you said , okay , I want to take something that I engineered and laboratory , and I wanna put it in this contaminated site to clean up with them , it would never work because their microorganism is live everywhere . 

80
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,050
They establish their own . 

81
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:19,240
Nicholas , okay , so introducing this little weak laboratory strain of equality , it won't survive. 

82
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,290
It wouldn't work , and just another angle was there , even at that time of regulatory framework that I would enable you to? 

83
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:33,328
So from the lab out into the field , there is it like many regulator framework , sets a little bit complicated , but it does exist . 

84
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:44,160
But we were so far away from that that even the national idea that we would like to do , that was almost crashes in regulation wasn't going to stop us from being successful here . 

85
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:59,630
It was the science itself was going to stop the challenge , as I thought was we needed to be able to engineer organisms that for robust enough to survive , of course , have to deal with this problem of evolution . 

86
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,733
Large population sizes . 

87
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,962
Evolution occurs by mistakes . 

88
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:08,914
Okay , when DNA could be copied and correctly and introduced his mistakes . 

89
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:09,410
And it. 

90
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,010
And we are all grateful for billions of years and worth the mistakes , are we? 

91
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,150
Exactly the process works . 

92
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,930
The public concern offenders who are going to create a superbug . 

93
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,510
And my concern . 

94
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,080
Actually , it was at the other end of the spectrum than anything we built this kind of break , just gonna , be too fragile . 

95
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:37,180
So we have to be mindful of both if we want to engineer my crops that are resilient enough to do the job , but make sure that they are not innovating on the fly . 

96
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:44,090
And one of the challenges there is this notion of engineering robustness into systems . 

97
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:53,540
If you talk to hard core engineers , build things like airplanes , there are many ways to make sure that airplanes fly safely . 

98
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,870
Can we have multiply reduced systems ? 

99
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,910
We have lots of sensing control , activation and so on . 

100
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,894
We've got at the point now where air travellers incredibly safe , and there's entire engineering disciplines that help support that . 

101
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:26,460
So I will talk to these engineers who are used working in the micro physical and say , okay , how do you deal with uncertainty and say a biological system , so is an example if you're thinking about an airplane flying , you can make reasonable guesses to what environment is . 

102
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,170
Yeah , I know the temperature range that's likely to see . 

103
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,410
I know how highest going to fly . 

104
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,450
I can model the stresses on the wind . 

105
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,850
Examples you could draw box around it . 

106
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,169
Right , nature , you are very good thing that within a certain space that this should operate as expected . 

107
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:54,320
And then beyond that , all bets may be off , but we've done a pretty good job during a box around the problem , but in biology , it's a lot more complicated . 

108
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:59,240
We don't always know what an environment is going to be like . 

109
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Moreover , you have this past few thing of evolution , where is in physically engineered systems when something breaks generally , the fitness fertilized biological term of the object goes down . 

110
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:22,750
Okay , so let's say , part of the airplane breaks the performance of that aircraft is generally not going . 

111
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,430
Where is in biological systems breaking is innovation . 

112
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:33,010
So it is possible that the reputation and organism acquires a new function . 

113
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:39,610
It grows faster , now completes its colleagues when I talk to the engineers they go , is there an alliance of the world ? 

114
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:48,506
The mechanical organizers know that the airplane breaks , it doesn't start flying twice as fast and twice as high as performance goes down . 

115
00:12:48,506 --> 00:13:00,400
So so there was a lot of intellectual barrier there that people thinking about engineering robust systems work as of yet thinking about she . 

116
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,690
And it brings new challenges . 

117
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,780
And I recognize that , but i'm not an engineer . 

118
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,630
So I had no idea how to solve this . 

119
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,710
So when I came to dark , I had the convenient power of the purse , I could sculpt . 

120
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:22,727
A program basically asked , can we transition synthetic biology from electoral curiosity into the real world ? 

121
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:33,858
So one of the great technological advancements of the last decades , so is the dramatic reduction in cost of DNA sequencing . 

122
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:38,306
So we can study the DNA that's out in the world . 

123
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:50,890
And there is a lot of , and by doing that , we started to recognize that there is this incredible diversity of microbes that grow honors and enough . 

124
00:13:51,020 --> 00:14:14,270
It turns out that if you are account up , the number of sales in your body that are yours , that have your DNA , and then compare that to the number sales of bacteria that live on your skin in your gut , those numbers , there's still a little debate about it , but there are approximately comparable and okay , so you are being driven by your bacteria . 

125
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,530
They help you digest your food . 

126
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,800
For instance , they affect us in profound ways . 

127
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,000
We're just beginning to discover the and. 

128
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,850
But you should eliminate the straight . 

129
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,640
So you essentially telling me that I am have bacteria. 

130
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,340
More or less , more or less . 

131
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,420
So this opens up the tunnel is impossible . 

132
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,031
They're by manipulating those bacteria . 

133
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:40,738
We can develop their are politics , for example . 

134
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:43,304
So the trade diseases of god . 

135
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:49,810
Interesting , there's a typically hospital derived infection called ACDF. 

136
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,400
Commonwealth cluster . 

137
00:14:51,400 --> 00:15:01,950
Divorce is essentially what happens in hospital settings is that when people take a strong , so in a biotics essentially clears the bacteria out of your gut . 

138
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:11,980
Now see if lives in this very specific locations within your guards , that kind of hangs out in between some cells , and normally it's held and checked by everything else that's. 

139
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,890
In your guy , right ? 

140
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:24,867
And just because some with owners probably approve the term we are talking about to hear about the , the microbiome right here , the microscope of the god , when you are talking about the bacteria over all of us , and that's the entire microbial amount of body . 

141
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,969
I see you talking about the microbiology . 

142
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,020
Yes , so specifically. 

143
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,693
And I got . 

144
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:34,981
So what happens is that after and about a trip that got clears out , see if says , oh , my god , this is great . 

145
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:40,820
You know , it's like it's expanding into a vacuum , and it makes people very , very sick that can be deadly . 

146
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:52,930
The observation was made that perhaps by repopulating , the god with a normal gut bacteria , you might be able to knock down the city of infection . 

147
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,650
So where do you get those bacteria repopulate ? 

148
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:06,160
Well , the pilot terms these days are intentional microbiota transplant。

149
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,580
But you are talking about vehicle material . 

150
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,960
However , correct that i've been appeared , and the place you prove this is a transport. 

151
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:21,810
So in it works , if you eliminate a microbial community , you can replace it with a different community and restore function . 

152
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,670
Now it's great work . 

153
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,940
Some , it's something like ninety five percent successful . 

154
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:39,090
But as I felt just the egg factor , if you had to design a solution to this problem is that the best you could come up with that , you would take somebody's pope and stick on him . 

155
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:50,238
So if we started asking this question , could you build more to find communities from scratch , that might have the same function , but wouldn't carry all the extra packages . 

156
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:59,267
So in that pope , there is a lot of other potential viruses and other bacteria that maybe you don't want to reintroduce into the cut . 

157
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:08,180
So we , we , you've got very interesting this idea of building microbial communities that can perform a specific function , but have much more composition. 

158
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:17,889
This would cause be a tremendous service in a public health sense , because so many people , the astronaut testimony issues that seems to be related to the microbiome . 

159
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:20,660
So you can come up with ways that are more political and to. 

160
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,130
To treat that , there would be religion , but it is also a department of defence specific problem as well . 

161
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:34,147
So when soldiers deploy the place , reckon afghanistan , they're exposed to know my crops , whether something in the water and so on . 

162
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:37,779
Traveler's diary , many of your other way of suffer from it . 

163
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:38,460
It's not fun . 

164
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:52,480
And not only can it ruin a vacation , but if you think about from a deep respective , if you're taking young , healthy people , you're deploying them in theater with the expectation that they're going to do in job , right , and then the sick , that's no good . 

165
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:59,930
So one way that you could think about , maybe solving this problem would be to find a way of engineering robust community . 

166
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,270
The god that more closely matches where they're going , and maybe your transition , that community state said , so maybe you get a tony , but you can be treated . 

167
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,120
You're fine . 

168
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,550
And then you deploy our season . 

169
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,850
Don't have to worry about being not out of the game. 

170
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,550
Right , as you arrive , if you were to characterize the status , the program breaks . 

171
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,380
Now , how would you describe? 

172
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,740
It's going well actually , very pleased . 

173
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:46,370
So when we started that program , we realize that the science behind the microbiome is changing incredibly rapidly when launch the program , we didn't say specifically that we were going to solve this microbial engineering problem , because I felt that those problems were quite as well defined as we wanted . 

174
00:18:46,370 --> 00:19:02,770
So what we did was , what are the tools and technologies that we will have to develop that allow us to engineer microbial communities or microbiology that can function in complex environments , because we thought that there were gonna be some commonality . 

175
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,520
So a microbial community in your god has to deal with changing environment . 

176
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,580
Right , one day I drank a diet coke , and I had a breeder for lunch . 

177
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Then I ate a salad . 

178
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,900
So there is all sorts of different stuff falling through there . 

179
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:35,635
So what we said was , if you have the ability to engineer microbial community to perform a define function in some suitably complex environment , we figured we would learn enough lessons that we could then take that to maybe a different function in a different complex environment . 

180
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:51,688
So certainly some primitives , commonalities in terms of the problems that you would have to solve to engineer community , that's going to function , whether I ultimately want to reach near a got microbiome or skip microbiome , or soil microbial . 

181
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:56,078
There are probably some common allies to the solutions there . 

182
00:19:56,078 --> 00:20:14,010
You can have any research groups developing on this one , right it overall , the program is probably about a dozen , and they've come up with some truly creative solutions to some of the challenges that we give them is the beginning of the program . 

183
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:25,720
But we want you to engineer community that has an impact on an organism in a rational , predictable , safe , robust way . 

184
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:34,992
It wouldn't specify what the test case had to be , whether the performers who focus on came with ideas to find their own space . 

185
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:38,716
We , we define how complex could be or needed to be . 

186
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:46,829
But we didn't say engineer to get microbial of eggs , so we got some really creative solutions , including some that we're unexpected . 

187
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:53,947
So some of the ones that I say were a little bit more online with what we kind of thought would come in . 

188
00:20:53,947 --> 00:21:16,509
Was we have a group at the vincent statuted harvard LED by pam solar in her group now have engineered a microbes that concerns information , and it changes color when it senses information takes a diagnostic soap , it can result in the god of they're using animals . 

189
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:22,665
So using a mouse , it can resign the god of mouse for something like a hundred days without mutating . 

190
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:25,849
So this is one of the things that we are worried about . 

191
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:29,587
I thought this was going to be that the systems were gonna muted . 

192
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:31,009
Waitress that they don't . 

193
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:36,696
Actually , I am so as a pleasant surprise , they show that you can detect information in the bowl . 

194
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,930
Scott , basically by looking at the pool . 

195
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:52,677
So if there's information that might spot blue , so you can imagine , ultimately , using this is a diagnostic , one of the other more surprising test cases that agree with the university of texas LED by nancy . 

196
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:57,656
Marian came up with was the microbiome of the honeybee . 

197
00:21:57,656 --> 00:22:06,226
Got , so we were definitely not expecting this , but it turns out that the honeybees are really interesting test case . 

198
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:18,170
So unlike you and I , who have a lot of different microbes and architects , the honey bee has , depending on they , somewhere around eight or nine different species of bacteria . 

199
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,910
So much simplified web satisfied . 

200
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,290
So it was not one , but is not a thought . 

201
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:29,421
So we thought that this was a really useful test case , because it's complicated , irreducibly complex . 

202
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:35,258
And what also is it to think about the honeybee is the honey bee is a social animal . 

203
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:37,827
It displays learning in memories . 

204
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:41,096
You can train honey bees to do tasks and so on . 

205
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:52,450
So what the text team was interested in doing was manipulating the gut microbial of the honey bee to see if we could alter their learning memory . 

206
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,420
And it turns out that this actually works . 

207
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:01,600
It turns out that there is something that known as the good brain access . 

208
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:09,310
So there is an incredible number of nervously backwards from your brain and send up onto the god . 

209
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:17,370
If you think about it , you have the god brain axis and inside the gut , you have all these microbes living , and they're doing something . 

210
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,210
And it turns out that there's essentially , you got brain microbic . 

211
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,296
So the microbes in your gut can actually tackle your brain . 

212
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:28,110
We are the molecules they produce how to interact with the cells in the gut. 

213
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,630
So for absolutely amazing . 

214
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,700
So the potentially opening up the door of engineering my own god microbial , and a way that might make me a okay . 

215
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,770
So you know , we were , you know , that would be very cool . 

216
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,930
So you are there yet , but you know , so you went by up to you only told us about two , and the user is about a dozen other groups . 

217
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,220
We cannot get into all of them . 

218
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,013
In fact , I wanna move on now to the , to the second program , which is fairly new . 

219
00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:13,870
And this one goes by the acronym , and that stands for engineered living materials , and I know , and earlier discussion , none of the kind of metaphors that came up as we were talking about this result of a really beautiful one of when you think of where our thoughts come from , and then you think of the seeds that are the beginnings of all of those trees that collectively become the incredible landscape . 

220
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:20,940
So , but you are thinking about that sort of biological brilliance and landscape in another way . 

221
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,290
So talk was about what is and what the settings , what is. 

222
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:32,190
Great parts of these jobs that we get a pretty high level of view of the technology landscape . 

223
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,110
And I got to a meeting called by a fabricate . 

224
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,400
And I admit a group of a company , and you are called economic . 

225
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,260
And what economy was doing at the time . 

226
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:58,064
What is actually going to call their business is they were taking fundamental particulars of mushrooms , and in particular , the mycelia , which of the parts of mushrooms are grown underground . 

227
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:04,750
And if you ever walked out on your one one morning , and so yeah , you see mushrooms like where they heard of those comfort , right ? 

228
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,930
They grow really fast . 

229
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:16,311
Okay , I want economic was doing was they were taking this organism and mixing it the cheapest agricultural waste they could find . 

230
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:19,493
So we're talking in corn stocks that are ground up . 

231
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,235
Apparently there is a market for agriculture who , what they would do is they take the the waste . 

232
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,564
They would take the michelle year . 

233
00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:43,800
They were put it in a mode , a physical mode , and after a few days , the mystery would grow to feel the voice , and they were getting material that essentially has many of the properties of policy styrenes of style , phone pack material . 

234
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,110
And they can sell this as a packing. 

235
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:54,910
The material of the fungal system , those are more fibrous kinds of parts of enough mushrooming bodies are right now , right thinking about. 

236
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,300
Mushrooms , but in in here , it just kind of ends up looking almost like a film . 

237
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:18,540
Okay , so and I thought this was so cool because palestinian is pulling a pilot styling of cups , as we speak is one of the most useful yet prisoner's substances on earth , and that it is so inexpensive to make it is cheaper to make virgin palestinians to recycle it . 

238
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,284
And it turns out to go away . 

239
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:23,118
Where is these mushroom based materials ? 

240
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:25,780
If you throw on a composition , the golden way . 

241
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:41,177
And so I was really intrigued by this idea of growing material from a perspective , I was particularly interested in this idea of growing materials on a specific site . 

242
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:47,020
And one of the things that the egyptian folks had shown me was that they could take . 

243
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:56,549
There are mushroom materials that are not particularly dense , but if you put them under heat and pressure , you can get a material that's more or less equivalent to fiber board . 

244
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:57,692
I thought this is cool . 

245
00:26:57,692 --> 00:26:59,980
You can essentially grow these materials . 

246
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,650
Now , if you think about the department of defense , we operate all over the world . 

247
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:11,990
If you think about a rebuilding effort in afghanistan , and let's say , you need to get a pilot point there . 

248
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:26,700
And the delhi has the world's best logistics system out there , but shipping heavy pilots of private across the world in the dangerous ones to me seems it's necessary , but silly , right . 

249
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,252
It costs a lot of costs . 

250
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:30,846
Fuel is dangerous . 

251
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:48,060
Why couldn't you see it or effectively a seed like star and then grow the materials that you want on sight , so you reduce the logistic burden , you reduce the cost , you increase safety because you're not trying to truck inherently low value materials across the industry . 

252
00:27:48,060 --> 00:28:00,580
And then if you take this step further and say , well , what are some other remote places we might want to eventually produce materials if we ever decide to live on mars , there's no home people out . 

253
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,530
We're not going to get there by just shipping everything we need . 

254
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,310
We're going to have to be able to grow in for structure . 

255
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,740
So the own program really gets at this early stage of growing materials . 

256
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,911
Oh , and by the way , we want the materials to remain alive . 

257
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:27,700
So in packing materials , obviously , you may not want that to remain alive , but living systems have great properties right , they can sell for pair . 

258
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,050
They can certainly respond the environment . 

259
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:40,210
So could you imagine having a structure that upon damaging soil repairs in south marginal way that you do if you get a cut , that would be great . 

260
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:52,580
Could you have that that new changes are properties with respect to the , the environment , so temperature , they may change the color , so they'll become reflective or absorptive . 

261
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,910
If you were in general properties . 

262
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:01,670
So there's something about maintaining the living properties of materials that I think it's really. 

263
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,990
Compelling , like this absolutely makes the successful reminding me . 

264
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:28,350
This comes , I guess , I guess that of a tradition of something easy because of smart materials , smart material , an idea there I remember being , you can you build AAbuilding that might have a reactive process , it , depending on what humidity , what the media logic conditions are insulted in some ways of the building itself , just by changing its microstructure can accommodate . 

265
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,940
And so maybe you use less energy to heat and less energy for AC. 

266
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:39,630
The thing is amazing about this dose is i'm imagining living inside of a that is living . 

267
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:52,280
I love the thought of it , but I also , you all suggest me , the village with it makes me feel like I might be living inside of a body , and I like some money to want you to think about that for second , and I wanted , what should we be concerned about ? 

268
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,470
I keep food and refrigerator too long . 

269
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,000
It goes bad . 

270
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,130
And so could my house go bad and respect? 

271
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:05,569
Yes , these are some of the things that we've asked our performers to be thinking about . 

272
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:09,572
So if you have a system that grows , how do you control that growth ? 

273
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:17,833
And there's obviously a natural president for this right human beings go to roughly define shapes and sizes and so on . 

274
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:23,552
So , so nature has solved this problem of controlled growth and development . 

275
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:29,500
We have AAsecond track of the own program that is getting it just this question . 

276
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:38,380
So can we program biological systems in the to adopt specific sizes and shape? 

277
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:48,680
So can I just have to say so , this is one of the most more regular things to me about biology , about a seat , about a fertilized egg , because it comes fairly simple shape . 

278
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,770
And i'm looking at you , justin , and you have an interesting shape of human beings with all kinds of shoes . 

279
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,680
You know how to take that . 

280
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,280
I went in the best of ways . 

281
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:06,430
So what a dog descriptions idea too , actually , now try to build that more full genetic function of biology into. 

282
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,170
Engineering materials , right ? 

283
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,440
So you mention the seats , even building with once a live material forever . 

284
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,330
Right , we use would . 

285
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,252
And how do we get that , what we take this single piece , very , very small seat with digital in the ground . 

286
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,929
We grow it for twenty years . 

287
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,655
We get this beautiful living tree that you provide . 

288
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:25,333
Shade can be on help here it . 

289
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:31,810
So all these great properties can see you too out of the atmosphere and produce oxygen that we need to breathe . 

290
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:36,230
And then what we do , we cut the dancing , and then we put in the killing . 

291
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,250
We rendered an earth . 

292
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,040
We saw it up in the dimensional number . 

293
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:47,923
So could you think about starting with essentially a tree progenitor cell and grow dimensional number ? 

294
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:57,349
So the sales would keep dividing a specific developmental pattern , and they would know they would be programmed to go to specific sizes and shapes . 

295
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:01,080
So producing the national number without go to grow a trip. 

296
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:08,360
So jessica , that was absolutely amazing discussion of taking me on a conceptual journey that is just pleasing me now . 

297
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,250
And I just want to thank you for engaging in this conversation. 

298
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,392
It's been my pleasure . 

299
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,000
I wouldn't spend a lot of. 

300
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:32,030
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from double for more information about justin galab and his breaks and own programs and the other break through technology is dark .
