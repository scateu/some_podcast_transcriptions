1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,760
Still , technology , the internet GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight with operation . 

2
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:30,540
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research projects has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:40,160
Welcome to Voices from darker a window on the dark of the core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,797
My name is iphone , a motel on your dark post today , and please have with me in the studio , major christopher or laughs . 

5
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:59,930
Key , a program manager since twenty fourteen in darkness , technical technology , he comes to drop with an extraordinary combination of academic field and managerial experience and skill sets on the academic . 

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,477
He is a head trick of engineering degrees , a bachelor's , mechanical engineering , a masters in astronautical engineering and a doctorate in aerospace engineering . 

7
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,380
The last one from the university of michigan . 

8
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,060
His word time experience includes the deployment to operation record freedom as a tank opportunity . 

9
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:25,208
He has served as the officer in charge and science and technology for the joint robotics of pair detachment at background air field in afghanistan . 

10
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:42,450
There , he planned LED and coordinated personal training and feeling in the statement of thirty five hundred robotic systems before his tour in afghanistan , he served as chief military scientists in engineer for ground vehicle robotics at the USarmy tank , automotive research , development , engineering . 

11
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:58,510
A double all of this previous experience has channeled into a wide range of interest in research efforts , including men and amendment teaming and complex environments , biometric unmanned systems and technologies to improve the capabilities of dismounted war fighters on the ground . 

12
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,210
Major christopher laski , thanks for spending some time with me in the studio today . 

13
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,830
In the afternoon , I am going to be hurt . 

14
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:11,470
So before we talk about your programs , your adult , but I want to find out a little bit about you and your background , and have you got so interested? 

15
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:21,750
Yes , but I think part of it is a grandfather who he worked as an engineer in a pilot program later in alabama , he used vice president li siller . 

16
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,780
So he is always grown up around that type of thing . 

17
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,840
He was in the air force . 

18
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,250
I want my articles also was an engineer . 

19
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,950
So the young age was exposed . 

20
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,678
My grandfather is pretty cool . 

21
00:02:31,678 --> 00:02:33,246
You let me play with his computer . 

22
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:34,640
Let me work on his workshop . 

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,390
He let his five year old grandson worked on as a master of computer and tried to figure out of break it and use. 

24
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,480
Okay , for for those younger listeners . 

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,120
So how would you describe my stories? 

26
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,850
My best way to describe my own user in new york is on the genetic health . 

27
00:02:48,850 --> 00:03:04,590
Is there are not too many people in ways as a command line operating systems of you borders rescued the program instead of cooking and dropped down menu or double cooking at nine hundred and actually had no command lines , and where to find things that I bought all command scripts . 

28
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,650
Of course , I think my computer programming skills privately told from about five until I was in grade school. 

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:21,660
Right , there is not just a kind of amazing that I think of you to age of five are tapping away at one of these sort of early economic operating systems for some old computers , which took up at that time . 

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:33,150
But because half of a desk , so I am wondering , then I , you know how , how did you first learn about DARPA and and and how did you kind of end up here is a program and a tactical. 

31
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:43,221
Technology opposite the person I heard about darfur was actually playing the video game , mentally asylum , where you actually rescued the dark , or director at one point in the game . 

32
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:46,935
I know the idea of darker was , until they did that never got up as I got . 

33
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:54,308
It was pretty cool , but my first little exposure , a previous programming is now a targeted technology , or hit . 

34
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:59,980
It comes to target one of my jobs that target when I figured it , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 

35
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:14,640
A lot of research , development , engineering , santa , when I was there , I went to a legal squad support system review meeting after the last three program review , meeting at a wolf and massachusetts was my first thing when I got out of graduate school , I met with ten o'clock there . 

36
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,940
And later he came , and he breathed the new program concept to my organization . 

37
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:29,810
I moved on after that , the robotic system drawing project office knows an existing more , but at the time , it was the primary organization that filled it in programs of record for robots . 

38
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:38,870
And he breathed , and program comes upstairs as my first major experience that have a dark programs in the scope and complex of you , what they do and what their goals are are. 

39
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,330
Can you just take us a little bit further along the past way ? 

40
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,150
So you would heard about dark from , from the individual . 

41
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,600
And then how did you end up getting an offer to even worker? 

42
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,892
Yes , I do an additional technical head . 

43
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:59,980
I add up some coworkers in michigan and target who were recommended to talk to another attack on a nationwide moment . 

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,429
I guess they give you my background , and some of my , I guess what they claim technical expertise and recommended that something I should look into . 

45
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:08,841
So on . 

46
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:24,730
That took up by myself to reach out to both the tenets of women , and ten o'clock had , yeah , there were both two pianos at the time that asked what that golden path , how do you get in double , because I assumed at the time that I was a major storm that you need to be looking at currently takes the position . 

47
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:36,740
And next thing I knew it , I was emailing my resident , hey , what's called the officer brief , within a month , I was on the phone with occasionally whose the technical technology officer director in headphone interview. 

48
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,180
Oh , well , i'm sure that the doctor tells me anyone else you spoke with associated with . 

49
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,435
That was really impressed by your experience , inquiring the army . 

50
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:56,230
So can you tell me a little bit about that , and you know how you think that might have played a role in getting girls certainly will talk about that , how that played a role in the programs that that you are now running. 

51
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,152
Absolutely , I think one of the things that left out earliest we've been told is the experience with robotics , with the army . 

52
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:04,602
So on . 

53
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:10,000
Graduate school , I did some classes while I understanding about the work they move . 

54
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:21,680
I spent some time doing a little bit of time doing research to take a take a lot of research of them in engineering cinema before I went to afghanistan twenty two hours , but about six months , and I did very things . 

55
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:30,998
In addition , the meaning after in charge and being responsible for the people in all the robots I push , they are what we call it during urgent operational needs statement . 

56
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:32,520
So there was a requirement . 

57
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,920
Chinese junes are for small robots to support this modern operations . 

58
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,350
And so one of my main duties was to support feeling those robots to support what's called the full or of A. 

59
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:46,530
For the operational assessment , and you had to take a class in. 

60
00:06:46,610 --> 00:07:01,064
Remembering acronyms , right , but the cousin was before I went through of the same training regimen , or the most the same training regimen that we , at the time , the robotic systems for a project of his data to trained technicians . 

61
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:07,803
So I get trained on how to upgrade all the robots that get trained to fix some of them , which was kind of uncommon for a major to do it . 

62
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:14,010
And it's not typically our jobs , but it gave me a better appreciation of the systems , what the capabilities were with the limitations . 

63
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:30,316
And when I get into theater , and we're supporting operations are as able to make relationships with various units and get the systems out to a wide ride of units , and as much as I could , I will travel around the smaller bases from the larger basis and going to download . 

64
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:35,538
Top soldiers are marines and sellers and asking how they are using their systems , what to keep your bodies . 

65
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,030
They saw what limitations are. 

66
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,885
And how we could have to improve . 

67
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:41,319
Well , there is absolutely fantastic background . 

68
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,192
And one is particularly valuable . 

69
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:51,940
You and our dark , because one of the great challenges of the whole institution is , is to make that connection , you know , the , the orientation of the very verified . 

70
00:07:51,940 --> 00:08:02,646
And of course , it gets supply , but then , even when that is successful to know what the issues are , once you run the ground , once your feeling , this kinds of technology is absolutely invaluable . 

71
00:08:02,646 --> 00:08:05,481
So it explains what kind of talk about your programs . 

72
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:11,340
Now you have three of them in your portfolio , and all of them associated with imposing war fighters on the ground . 

73
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:18,481
Both his individual war fighters and is elements of on some boards of human robotic and vehicular teams . 

74
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:21,099
So let , let start with your oldest program . 

75
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:32,420
It's called wear web , which means almost sounds like a quest for a full body understood that can enable war fighters to essentially perform sort of like super hero in training capacity . 

76
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,184
I know that's a simplifying things . 

77
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:39,960
But how would you describe the worldwide programming and status? 

78
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:54,050
The worldwide program , the goal is to reduce the fatigue , soldiers carrying heavy loads and by reducing fatigue of by doing that , you can implicitly release our goal as I reduce the chances when. 

79
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,850
Yeah , and just want to quit me when you say , have you love you? 

80
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:05,345
Really meet , I absolutely mean heavy loss of our soldiers in iraq and afghanistan are carrying loads of up to one hundred and twenty hundred and thirty pounds . 

81
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,189
Are there carrying this up heavy ? 

82
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:11,244
They're carrying out of steep slopes and mountains , and it's not something new . 

83
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:11,982
I like a joke . 

84
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:17,217
Now it is not really new ideas anymore , just trying to figure out a better way to do things . 

85
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:25,343
Sometimes i've been to add the opportunity to the chicago in the science and industries , and want to see the difficulties with that was there . 

86
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:31,770
And the other part was used to visit my kids and had an exhibit about the teacher card . 

87
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,750
Army from china , and the same thing that they had its same issue . 

88
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:44,696
One soldier , when this man soldiers gonna fight two thousand years ago , they were carrying eighty pounds in the head specific troops of soldiers that were carried . 

89
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,482
Lastly , they be faster in last weekend . 

90
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:53,920
You could see the administrator , symbolic of soldiers there will be considered and had signs set up to talk about not surprised to the same . 

91
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,230
We said , the same problem today . 

92
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:02,370
So the warrior weapon programs were china's that the same issues were trying to is one approach has been taken on the past . 

93
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:16,370
And what dark did and dark , a funded in exercise and program in the middle , thousands of if I create a parallel scale team , and I could just transfer low to the ground , and then it takes the way off the soldiers , but the challenges with that word . 

94
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,870
Now , if you try to try to walk on a metal plate on your foot is very uncontroversial . 

95
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:28,016
Those who actually work hard to operate and increase the material cost of the needed the energy you had to exert to use them . 

96
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:32,820
And so there's they weren't generally accepted for inventory applications . 

97
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,928
Researchers are moving one piece of challenging to so that the goal is the . 

98
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:44,203
The program was the shift to lose this look at reducing their fatigue as reduced the energy cost . 

99
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:57,682
And incredibly , they could either walk longer with the same and be the same level of photograph , had the same remaining reserves at a certain point , or they can get to a place and be more physically ready were just directly tied . 

100
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,980
How cardinal ready they are to execute . 

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,006
That's the goal at this point . 

102
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:04,012
The program has been successful . 

103
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:06,270
We've met most of our program goals. 

104
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,050
We're at the point where there were two phases . 

105
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,760
One was to develop the elements of those . 

106
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,750
Now there was them to , I integrate them right ? 

107
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,780
So where? 

108
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:21,680
We're the end of the international face actually , so we are done with what we call tsb , which was the beautiful suits . 

109
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,947
However , it and the victims to do now , cambridge , massachusetts , was the primary effort that did that . 

110
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:35,067
And we finished testing of those suits with soldiers from foreign injuries are at the average improving ground . 

111
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,180
In july , we finish. 

112
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:44,590
Rather than a one early description or vision of what this might look like is something like a wet suit , crafts with a hydrated elements into a book . 

113
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,480
When , when you look at what is coming out of the program at this stage , where how would you describe? 

114
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,073
I described as good a great first step . 

115
00:11:51,073 --> 00:12:08,190
None of those good , great first step towards producing systems in the future that can be integrated into a larger soldiers and samples that can reduce defeating product and the carrier loads over hot , longer distances and make you make them try to run faster , cover the same distance and faster time . 

116
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,470
So today , it looks like a bunch of straps and wedding that goes around your legs . 

117
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,620
You needs your hips . 

118
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:25,160
There's actual waiters mountain , either under backpack should lower back that poor cables that either connect to your ankle or just behind your head and walk around , then move . 

119
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,060
And as it says , the system is , you move , the system traces that sounds like you walk and adapt the best you can to your , your style of walking . 

120
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,160
Is everybody different and provide the best systems and. 

121
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,540
And no matter , this is my imagine that most of thinking there must accountable , accused the government to eliminate . 

122
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,640
So , as you , as you move in , most of things like this. 

123
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:52,290
Yeah , there is , there is quite often in a sound of the actuates pointing in the cable , pulling the cables and and pushed them back out , crackers away . 

124
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,562
And this is merely good work that the harvard teenagers in great work actually do standards . 

125
00:12:56,562 --> 00:13:05,100
And so to the point where , by the end of the program , there are controls new york complaining about the lack of noise because they used to use the noise as a way to trouble shoot the system . 

126
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,750
So when the noise is that studying in a different pitch or different , something was wrong . 

127
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,510
Now it's so quiet that they can do that anymore. 

128
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,780
Which is a good thing for some answers are getting in the field in a few of the engineers . 

129
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,990
It's a personal problem . 

130
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,610
I get to be more clever and keeping the improvement moving along . 

131
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:30,920
And there was one of the things that I find interesting about the goals of the program , which was that the host , who would be powered by something like one hundred . 

132
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,090
And so in obviously , last week to keep from having to add a battery , wait up and where you alone A. 

133
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,050
So we're workloads we're using . 

134
00:13:40,050 --> 00:14:08,640
So using batteries like the portable engineering , something like that in backer , soldier , but we did come in a little higher than that , because we are one hundred years ago of twenty five percent about production so often times with the dark program , you set goals , that metrics that you honestly don't know if they achieve it , will you hope they are that we were doing the research to seek the greatest bars and calm down with system traded in the program where we could meet the material reduction of twenty five percent . 

135
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,100
We could meet the total system . 

136
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,120
A total system must have been less than eight kilograms , but toward john were twenty percent . 

137
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,540
So , and I included the batteries . 

138
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:25,700
But the other job was higher than other words , because largely we move to the quiet the quarter . 

139
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,990
Actually , at the end , we should not draw more power. 

140
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,140
Okay , but I think we're good luck with the continued progression in that program . 

141
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,990
So I likely move now to a second program . 

142
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:51,880
This one called the ground experience , go technology or GXPTprogram , and just from the middle of some of the sort of the artist concept images , I can see that this one would have some particular residents for you duty , your experience in the records of tank resolved . 

143
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Tell us about the. 

144
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:16,071
GXDTprogram I would like to describe the program as the focus is how to improve the capabilities we know about individual ground combat vehicle , how to make the crew better , how to make the vehicles self better , which explicitly does make data decreases their effectiveness and increases their so primarily focused at this point , I was looking at technologies at argument . 

145
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:24,127
The crew , so to provide them more efficiency or effectiveness in their individual , or improving the mobility , the platform . 

146
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:34,080
So the platform container had access to motoring so that with the same bureaucrats in real or I can actually move faster and safely. 

147
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:45,499
And over the same types of train right now , I think I read you want these vehicles to be of the access upgrade in ninety five percent of the trend they might encounter . 

148
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:48,690
So as a huge range of possibilities , right , right now. 

149
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,376
Absolutely , and so there's one of the challenges that we look at three , three main different ways to do that . 

150
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:59,980
So there is , there is an eagle that there is a listens thirty and forty . 

151
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,656
There is a concern argument between tracks . 

152
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:03,473
Racist wheels . 

153
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:10,830
What's the best application for even manifested in the worldwide two years alone to have drug vehicles , whether it was in the front . 

154
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,050
Well , one year first we looked at this . 

155
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:19,700
We have a reconfigure of a wheel track where you could have a wheel and transform it into a track and back again . 

156
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:27,440
So if you need to drive the road in wheels , if you understand software , snow , those types of train , you can transform in which I can reduce the ground pressure. 

157
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:35,870
I'm trying to get a sense of this is a single kind of vehicle element that that exactly can reform into a wheel and then reform to A. 

158
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,722
Yeah , I saw it . 

159
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:42,050
So the , the , the wheel and transforms into a triangle ship track on demand as necessary. 

160
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,280
It does actually remind one of the move of the transformer movies above. 

161
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,373
Yeah , that was nearly . 

162
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,210
Maybe she told my kids that I work on transformers and anything at school . 

163
00:16:51,210 --> 00:17:02,271
I have a couple of things working there as we've got a suspension effort to get a result in a full vehicle demonstrator with the goal of driving the standard army test , threatening the vehicle in its classroom . 

164
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:16,930
So , so a hungry , you can take that road at ten months power , we'd like to do it at eighteen and twenty , if possible , while not exceeding the safe driver limits that their standard limits of how much energy can be put into a ever hitting bumps , hitting all is going over after rain . 

165
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,630
And so where are goals to go as fast as possible when maintaining? 

166
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:30,765
I understand , also , the program doesn't involve components like censors , other things that will increase the economy situation , awareness of those who might be inside . 

167
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:33,500
Just talk a little bit about some of those important. 

168
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,900
The one of the things is the challenge of your goals are the windows tend to be the weapon . 

169
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:53,260
I need to look outside the vehicle to be able to see an operator in windows can provide weaknesses that were usually typically less , less safe or less dancing had less ability to withstand entire army threatening missiles , zebra rounds . 

170
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,490
So you can tell me when you get rid of the windows , that's one of the exploration is getting rid of the windows . 

171
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,653
Thanks , and I have windows , you know , patient blocks , but you can see a lot out of them . 

172
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:27,820
So two efforts were looked at in harder if you remove the windows as one is looking at driving from a near the air , but has a display that takes in stereo images from around the vehicle and projects them to your eyes and a cool thing about that is , if you ever driven a vehicle by just a screen , others think of the risk of reflects where your eyes expect a certain amount , but the screen doesn't give that to you , and it can make people who are natural . 

173
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:37,965
So some people very successful to what others can kind of train themselves to be less acceptable , but still , over twenty minutes , you can get sick in the ashes and not operate the platforms anymore . 

174
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:53,887
So by now , projecting a stereo image , you can actually reduce that particular and almost eliminate the national , and you can try these things for a long time to add that it will the group , honeywell , with the company that did it modify the player's platform , you drag the completely block out . 

175
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:57,410
And I think I got a lot of thirty five months per hour and. 

176
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,930
couple weeks ago , with no nurture, 我到哪去。

177
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,420
Well , well done . 

178
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,970
Okay , i'm sure there are many more components that are part of your DGXBtea program we can talk about , but I do want to move on to the third . 

179
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,140
We can give business sense of all about you talking about . 

180
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,180
The third one is called the squad eggs core technologies program , if no more often , just the squad eggs . 

181
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:29,560
And this one is a systems of systems project , which i'm glad we can be allowed to talk about that dark is doing more and more books , and it just from the sound of it . 

182
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,030
You can tell , this is a very complex kind of pursuit by system of systems . 

183
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:52,733
This is a project of many parts , each of them with their own challenges , and but they all intended to come together in ways that infantry squats on the ground would then have unprecedented degrees of situation when awareness and capabilities and ability to adapt to complex and rapidly changing situations . 

184
00:19:52,733 --> 00:20:06,100
Again , we went out of time to talk about all of the pieces of scottice , but I would be gratification a little bit of november you may be , but some of those components that are excited to the most so. 

185
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,795
Let's start talking about scottish , there's one best way to describe scripts . 

186
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:21,148
You mention the system , the systems we destructed , and sure that it is focusing on the squad as the system as a whole monument , motivating factories for forming that program was experienced , talking to complete manners . 

187
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:26,992
And afghanistan , who asked and for feedback on the robots , we have provided them in training soldiers on . 

188
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,167
And one came back to me . 

189
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:41,490
So when I using it , because we've got all the other girl responsibility to carry the throne , all the individual girl , adults , whether it would be mind , provides exposure of device systems , and we just have no soldiers to carry these things that. 

190
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,281
So i'm just an interesting point here , because you know , we've earned a kind of a technical philip environments . 

191
00:20:47,281 --> 00:21:00,802
We tend to think the technology is a good thing , but hear what we learning is that immediately has to work in the practical , especially for our war fighters , or who have so many things to worry about , so things to carry . 

192
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,370
So this was a kind of interesting lesson for you to learn. 

193
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:13,553
I saw that any part of it is , for my least , my viewpoint is in the army more important than a very good job , or especially with fast fifteen players , were of a quickly individual soldiers . 

194
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:21,848
But sometimes we get slaughtered if I threw too much at individuals , soldiers and marines , I don't look at what the impacts to a fire team are squad so on . 

195
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:26,698
The main focus areas of squad access to look at what is the effect on the past performance . 

196
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:30,614
It's the smallest formation in the military that can conduct what we says . 

197
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:34,922
Fire manufacturers that can fire while the other teams newspaper in the target . 

198
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:42,099
And so I just admitted what fighters might have an army squad today has none soldiers , and a morning coastguard has dirty and thank you . 

199
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:46,656
So that's the scientists we're looking at , and we're looking at how we can hold , listed and improve . 

200
00:21:46,656 --> 00:22:04,834
So in taking a system supposed to do that , looking at the total waiter , this quarters of votes to tolerate the individual person , the , the effectiveness of the global is the effective of a single person , for example , and well matrix scientists have been done before the holiday , quantity , leisure and improving scott . 

201
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:23,210
And so that I think some of the coolest things are most potential benefits we have is really , truly how funeral , how we can integrate men systems into a scott and providing capabilities don't result in a soldier marine being headed down because of a soldier rings being headed down , trying to control a robot that they're not paying attention . 

202
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,450
And that's one last rifle that's in the site . 

203
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:34,080
So a couple things will look at how we can have one main systems of royal ground robots , or a robot move with a squad information . 

204
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,020
Sounds very simple . 

205
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:42,842
The military , if we can we manufacturer information , but we have different formations for different missions in different conditions . 

206
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:48,150
So can we get robots that recognize what is doing , and manufacturer without intolerance to do that ? 

207
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,250
Can we get robots ? 

208
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:56,190
The municipal scouts , and from the squad to the side of the squad , whatever the most appropriate position would be. 

209
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:58,263
So that they can actually provide support , right ? 

210
00:22:58,263 --> 00:23:10,980
And again , this is without the human life , parts of the system worrying about the the robotic ones , raising , thinking that they're just gonna conscience , know what to do almost as a collective kind of energy or going forward. 

211
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:17,310
And as we do that , someone else thinks we're looking into , not just going to robots to move reliably , but then what useful tasks can they do ? 

212
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:34,900
So we have efforts out their techniques so that canadians and systems are cameras carried by design systems gotta , find humans and environment , report back to the square that there may be humans overhear and even trying to get the point , we can distinguish whether another carrying. 

213
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,410
And that is quite noted . 

214
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,690
So you been here , I think what since twenty fourteen sounds like a tremendous amount of are in the effort . 

215
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:58,296
And yet you're also coming to , and the vietnamese here , as a program manager , that is an interesting aspect of darker , and that the program manager role is a pretty short live one anywhere from two , three , or maybe sometimes five years . 

216
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:04,449
So because you send emergency , but the halloween realized is for the no , right that is my last halloween . 

217
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:05,085
All right . 

218
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:25,570
So you're behind of these programs to your , to your fellow program managers and see if they can take them to the finish line , but because you have the kind of the benefit of remembering the beginning , leaving the middle and now coming to the end of your program manager status , I think you got a kind of a good porch for you , saying a little bit about the whole experience of being a program manager . 

219
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:34,200
What would you you learned about that role , say , as part of the europe innovation ecosystem in the context of national fans. 

220
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,374
The biggest thing i've learned that being a program manager is that the innovation in collaboration , it's a team effort I don't do by myself . 

221
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:48,568
There is no way I could begin to find them to manage all these programs and all these efforts that are , rather than by myself . 

222
00:24:48,568 --> 00:24:53,980
So I have a great team , a great support team that helps our technical experts in the field , in their fields . 

223
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,420
And the ultimate events is not the ones that do . 

224
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:14,010
It is the engineers and scientists at japanese and universities and defence contractors that we found that are the ones that ultimately are going to bend metal and write code and then deliver these capabilities to our fires that can forget the war fighters either , because they are invaluable advice . 

225
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:20,730
Stations are also part of a loop , such a collaborative ecosystem that results new innovation that provides these new capabilities. 

226
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:32,366
No , it was actually beautiful way of connecting what is happening in this dark headquarters , which is mostly kind of a typical building reaching out the researchers record of the performer community . 

227
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:38,688
And in your case , you have several for each of your programs and ensure you multiply three by whatever , i'm sure you got . 

228
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:49,380
Probably , it doesn't know many more than that performers out there , all of your work in your colleagues have to go out and make sure everybody is gonna doing what we all agreed would would happen in these programs . 

229
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,680
But then you're taking it all the way out into the fields . 

230
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,935
This is really an draws , the , the full line , so is really interesting to hear that . 

231
00:25:57,935 --> 00:26:02,430
But because you are leaving on halloween , I have to ask you now also what? 

232
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,200
What's next for european ? 

233
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,170
So i'll be a scientist , penalty gun and a part of my duty . 

234
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:20,790
There will be to take a lessons , take the lessons I learned and pass assignments , especially the lessons are not going to stand up to others to problems for the army , where we need capabilities in A. 

235
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,506
Well , okay , we'll be good to know that this can be someone who is said , a lot of experience . 

236
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:34,617
You are dark and in the field , and now over in the panic and looking at the host of technology equation in context , national advances , thanks for sharing all that . 

237
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:36,344
Chris , you've been here dark . 

238
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:45,720
And I often think of dark as a place where technologies that are for the moment , fictional , sometimes become nonfictional or real . 

239
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,177
I am wondering if you are someone who has been inspired by science fiction in your life . 

240
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:59,980
If you've been a science fiction reader of the fictional technologies movies , you've seen some advanced technology in on the field . 

241
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,040
Employments is there fictional technologies kind of you find fascinating in my one of our ultimate? 

242
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:22,900
When they see becoming a there is , actually , I have draw quite offensive danger that I go mind OGHOcartoons that I grew up on it for a technologies that geologists had nearly , it is , and use those , they have robots that move to them and have capabilities to protect . 

243
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,040
Joseph , take , take the fight to the enemy is necessary . 

244
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,350
So do you have your own comic books ? 

245
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,740
Sir , I had the old cartoons . 

246
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,030
Still , you actually report them much to my wife , grand. 

247
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:42,060
And so kick it , it means amazing to me that you might be able to go back to some of these two images that you saw the child and then compare them to what you are actually doing now. 

248
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,040
And happened as a as a dirty program manager , let's be quite fun . 

249
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,320
Spent a great , great experience being a double program manager. 

250
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:56,370
What christmas beneficial to help you in the studio , thanks for sharing with us a good part of your experience of dark . 

251
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:13,098
And just before you're about to leave on halloween , so your colleagues are gonna miss you when you go , but thanks for all that service here , I just want to thank you for sharing this time with me and our listeners , my pleasure , thanks for helping me and thanks listeners for ease dropping on us . 

252
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,440
I hope you again , boys from dirt .
