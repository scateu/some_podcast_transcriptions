00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:16,935
Going to a science engineering laboratory , close your eyes and listen in a biomedical lab , you might hear an operation tribute as it separates the components of assembled in a chemical analysis lab . 

2
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:29,780
You might hear the wind of a turban pump as a evacuates , the chamber of a , in a missile proportion research facility , you may hear the aggressive white noise from a textbook of a new jet fuel in each setting . 

3
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,420
You can hear a sonic fingerprint . 

4
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,100
What goes on . 

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,330
Welcome to a new periodic feature of our Voices from darker pipelines . 

6
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,580
We are calling it sounds of innovation . 

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:52,600
My name is , I have a matter on your dog host , rather than hearing the voices of program managers , which is normally what you get enough Voices from doctor parkers in each sounds of innovation episode , you will hear a few snippets of research escapes . 

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,814
They're part of jobless world and learn just a little bit about what new capabilities those songs could lead to . 

9
00:00:58,814 --> 00:00:59,980
Let's get right to. 

10
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:17,057
That's a signal with a set of towns just a tad above the highest piano generated by an underwater modem for sending and receiving data through water . 

11
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:32,180
This is the sort of communications and networking component that researchers in darkness , timely information for marijuana engagement program , timely for short , are working toward as they strive to realize a strategic framework known as music warfare . 

12
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:40,970
Think you have many discribed military assets in the and on and under the ocean , as though there are music tiles of a logical hearing to picture . 

13
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:59,980
Now think about dynamically integrating and reintegrating those towels into the most effective military action possible , and in any given situation and moment for that to become possible with assets across all military developments , including ones under water motors and signals like the one you just heard , probably will be part of the museum . 

14
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,190
Brace yourself for the next sound of innovation. 

15
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:30,470
That intense white noise is coming from a new experimental bioscience eclipse of you made with the help of genetically engineer as a campus and creates thrust in the first of its kind ground test of a liquid fuel rampage at the weapons division of the neighborhood center in china . 

16
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:42,069
Lake , california , in the mix of hydrocarbons in the fuel , which normally derived from petroleum , distributes not e sales , is just one of the many deliverables emerging from doctors living founders program . 

17
00:02:42,069 --> 00:03:16,740
In this case , from the biotechnology emmas a performer on the program based in memory of california , notable here is a gallon for gallon , the spiral synthetic fuel , dubbed by amazon as bio renewable one packs energy comparable to jet fuel , JPten , the current go to synthetic for missile platforms like the thomas hawk , says an achiever program manager for the living founders program , biologically produced fuels can have advantages in costs and performance over comfortable synthetically produced and could be an additional source of military grade fuels during times of great demand . 

18
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,570
Here's the sound of another kind of jet. 

19
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,548
What you just heard was a laboratory test of a drilled that relies on high pressure drafts of water . 

20
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:49,209
In this case , at one hundred and twenty five pounds per square range , jet out of another to cut through soil . 

21
00:03:49,209 --> 00:04:10,230
The clip captures just a few seconds of the workers that researchers at the colorado school of mines are doing for their part in darkness under minor project , the goal of under miner is to develop new , new , two more than techniques and to adapt ones from oil and gas , utility , geological , environmental and other industries for quickly borrowing tunnels to open new technology . 

22
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:22,470
Such a preposition in supplies in advance of military operation were providing ongoing resupply channels as troops move through an area , the ability to rapidly bore tunnels also could be helpful in rescue mission . 

23
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,020
Here's a partial spoiler alert , the next sound of innovation is also from the other minor program. 

24
00:04:47,870 --> 00:05:05,525
That sound clip was harvested by the engineering team from general electric , which is developing an earth warm , inspired tunnel , boring robot under contract with under minor program , rather than the size of saying toronto earth's warming your backyard , the robotic earthworm is six feet long and two inches wide . 

25
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:15,111
The robot snows will the boring tools penetrates earthly environments as a series water activated chambers mimicked the rising motion of an earthward . 

26
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:30,790
As a result , the system boats boards forward as the segments have come back and stable as the walls of the fresh brown , the sounds in the clip derives from inlet and exhaust files as they managed the water in fleeting and exhausting from the robots , bladder , like artificial muscles . 

27
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,870
The GEteam hopes to live over about account . 

28
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,390
They'll be able to borrow tonight more than five football fields in land in a time it takes to watch . 

29
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,690
Thanks for listening to this first episode of darkness , sounds of innovation series . 

30
00:05:45,280 --> 00:06:00,733
We will be posting more episodes in the series intimately as a feature of the boys is from darker parkers , thanks to benjamin for his partnership and producing this problem for more information about the programs , which sounds you just heard , as well as about other breaks of technologies .
