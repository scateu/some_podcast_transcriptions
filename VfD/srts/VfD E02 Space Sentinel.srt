00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,730
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand on tonight's operation. 

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:30,230
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , DARPA , that offends advance research projects has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:40,090
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,070
My name is iphone , the motto , and I am your dark host . 

5
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,540
And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio . 

6
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:56,336
Wen zim , alert , a program manager in tactical technology , where , since twenty fourteen , she has been running the intriguingly named space surveillance telescope . 

7
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:59,920
Where SSTprogram welcomes the two Voices from japan. 

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,020
Thank you so much for having me . 

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,220
I am really excited to be here. 

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,770
Well , i'm excited to have you . 

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,900
And before we dive in and talk about the space surveillance telescope , which packs some really amazing technology that i'm eager to hear about . 

12
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's talk a little bit about you . 

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,840
Um , what I like knows something about your background , how you became a program manager at the. 

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,760
Sure , so a while ago actually started as a photography major at the university , michigan , which you might think is a little bit odd . 

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,350
Start for a scientist . 

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,000
I was always inspired by the images . 

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,860
I would see you in a strongly magazine . 

18
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,690
And at that time , I thought all that means that should be a photographic major . 

19
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,930
But after learning a little bit more my time there , I dropped it over to our space engineering . 

20
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,873
I got my undergraduate degree in our space engineering there and a masters as well . 

21
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:59,980
And I went on to produce where it is some graduate work that enabled an assumption called the treasury planet finder , which was a new design for a space , total scope . 

22
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:09,850
After that , I had some marketed in policy and actually met a fellow program manager here double , who introduced me to the how double works and the double programs . 

23
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,360
And I was really exciting to me , and that's how I ended up a double. 

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,770
And before we do really talk about the advanced technologies that come together into this tour , the space surveillance . 

25
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,040
Maybe you can talk with a little bit about the problem that really backed in the screen for something like an SST. 

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,320
And when i'm referring to hears is the kind of landless abbott like a human made in cosmos made debris . 

27
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,200
So magazines really the beginning , the species. 

28
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,888
Yeah , absolutely , a minor . 

29
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:45,650
A user space is becoming increasingly critical to daily . 

30
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,719
I think a lot of people don't know when the space is even involved really anymore . 

31
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:56,000
And in order to do that , we are launching increasing numbers of minimum attacks in the space . 

32
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,420
There are tens of thousands of these objects in space right now . 

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,039
And so we have to be very careful that they don't come near each other and sometimes even collide with each other . 

34
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:19,908
And on top of that , we also have debris in space , some from man made objects , but also just natural objects , but also SSTis really focused on tracking and identifying debris and objects in orbit called geo geo synchronized orbit . 

35
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,812
That's about twenty two thousand miles about the earth . 

36
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:24,961
So really far away . 

37
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:25,880
Where did I? 

38
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,392
From leo rights , which is low authority , that was a lot of satellites . 

39
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:30,630
well. 

40
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,640
That's absolutely right . 

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,800
Leos much closer . 

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,060
So it's a little easier to see objects there . 

43
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,730
Jill has a volume of tens of thousands of oceans . 

44
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,840
So not only is it far away , it's gigantic . 

45
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,260
And so building a telescope that can handle both of those challenges since it's very far away over a very wide area . 

46
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,360
Yeah , I is really what our sister is best. 

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,930
Okay , I love that kind of image just gave us with with all of these oceans above the same . 

48
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,850
You need to be worked out and monitored . 

49
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,440
So that sounds to me like , like , you need some oil technology . 

50
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:18,440
And maybe this is a good time for you to talk those , those really advanced , unique technologies that you helped naturally come together into this remarkable. 

51
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:31,220
Yeah , absolutely , so you think about a digital camera that you have home when you use your zoom lens , you see the field of view on your camera , narrow in on the thing that you're looking at it as you get closer . 

52
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:44,310
And that is how a traditional telescope works as you change the design that the field of with SST, we actually had a unique optical design where we use a curved focal plane . 

53
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,950
So gone , thinking about your digital camera , there is a small focal plane , focal plant in your camera . 

54
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,930
Call the CCD. 

55
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,710
That stands for charge . 

56
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,180
Couple devices are very cool . 

57
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,890
The most of us know is just the academic. 

58
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,830
Thank you . 

59
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:14,290
Well , the weather system teams are very , very widespread of view , but still relatively very high resolution is actually , instead of having a flat CCD, Aflat focal plane , it is curved , and SSThad the first working curve to focus design. 

60
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,700
That we know over the world , and what was so special about the curved form embrace is a flat one. 

61
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:29,524
So the curve format allows you to actually focus the light a little bit better towards the edges of the CCDitself is also very , very challenging to build . 

62
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:35,300
In fact , I am a telling concludes who built the focal plane has to come up with the , the new process . 

63
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,030
I am able to to enable that character. 

64
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:58,525
Over the over the plane , right and philosophy might not know the legal legs are really fascinating place with AAhistory that goes back really to world war two with a task at that time to work on what really was some of the original weight or technology , and it's been really involved in updates , among other things ever ever since . 

65
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:07,160
Those are really interesting in partner , and in this case , what are some of the other technologies that have been really tough , dark , dark awards , the tiger , tiger. 

66
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:15,980
The the processing power of this total scope is quite impressive , and the speedy , which it can scand over the sky . 

67
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:34,080
And so we can actually view objects over one quarter of the entire jail belt over , you can imagine that is one quarter of each night from new mexico , and that is just an incredibly fast drive train on the telescope and requires incredibly fast processing . 

68
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,790
And those are two things that that we also developed under the assets to program. 

69
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:59,930
When I was called the standing volume to be thinking about this in the field of view of this instrument and anything , a kind of an amazing portrait writers is that the white sense mister ranges in mexico , which triggered smooth people there know is wismar , but it is on top of a fantastic way . 

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,993
The name played a pig called adam peak . 

71
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:07,175
Maybe you've been there , so maybe you can just sort of paint as a little bit of a picture . 

72
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,969
What is like to buy the telescope ? 

73
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:11,760
And why are you doing that describe the telescope? 

74
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,300
Sure , so the autumn peak itself is very high and very dry in a very dark location . 

75
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:27,622
So you can stand up on the peak and actually see the sunset out over the range , which is beautiful , and you are also looking right over a site called trinity sites . 

76
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:40,680
Trinity sites is actually where the united states exploded its first atomic weapon , which is kind of interesting to be standing on the egypt of two areas where technology was after sunset against incredibly dark . 

77
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:49,300
You can actually see the edge of the galaxy when you're standing up there , and after night fall , we can walk inside the telescope down . 

78
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:59,542
The facility itself looks like a very flat square building with a giant dome on one side , and you get inside that dome , which is elevated even higher above autumn peak . 

79
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:03,502
And then we'll open up the door for of the telescope dome . 

80
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:23,385
And almost every time I bend there , the wind is just blowing , and it's freezing cold , but everyone to stand up down because it just so need to see the stars in the toll scope , moving the toll scott movement itself is completely silent as they're just sitting there looking at the stars next to the instrument . 

81
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:24,010
And it was. 

82
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:32,950
Give people a sense of the scale of it , and how fast is moving , because when you say this instrument is silent , and I think about how biggest is and how fast is moving . 

83
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,560
It's almost impossible for me to think about it , right? 

84
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:41,520
So the telescope is offered several towns , and it's sitting on the top of many different gambles . 

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,130
And what is doing is the shape of the opening in the domestic return . 

86
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,962
And so it starts at the top . 

87
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:55,695
And the telescope movement is going open down and both open down in the vertical and also crossing the horizontal motion . 

88
00:08:55,695 --> 00:09:02,230
And again , it can serve the entire sky , so one hundred and eighty degrees of down the dome in one single nights . 

89
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,530
Again , that , you know , volumes and volumes of ocean A. 

90
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,720
Quarter , about in one night , right ? 

91
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,290
And so , so it literally is moving from one spot , taking a snap shot , moving to another , taking a snap shot . 

92
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:28,490
I, Iheard that there are some thousands of horse power worth of hydraulic piston and other moving elements that that actually can bring it from one spot to the , to the next . 

93
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:35,400
And yet the sound is something like when I heard this , maybe you can correct it , or you another matter about as loud as a microwave of. 

94
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,570
I think that's right . 

95
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,010
The only thing you can hear is the clicking of the shutter on the camera itself. 

96
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,220
Over the half of a microwave open right . 

97
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:52,605
And then so when the shoulder is open , and it's gathering the slide on on that through curved optical element that you talk to battle can look at such a huge volume of space all at once . 

98
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:58,546
The late itself that is going on to , as I think you might have seen essential like that in our cell phones . 

99
00:09:58,546 --> 00:09:59,980
Can you talk a little bit? 

100
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:07,440
Yeah , so i'll start with them as the appetizers open the light actually comes in and and hit several different measures . 

101
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,770
Similar sense . 

102
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:19,500
Mates article train , and it's about three point six meter mirror , so that gives you an idea of a sort of helping the hotel school visit itself at several meters larger than that . 

103
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:42,447
And so the labour comment in bonds through that that mirror and actually be focused , that occurred focal plane , where , you know , the late hits the materials in the focal plane , and that turns them into an electrical signal , which is an transferred into what we would think of his pixels based on the strength of the electrical signal year at the scene of brighter or a finger pixel . 

104
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:52,230
The longer the telescope is open and looking at a specific place in the sky , the center of the object you might be able to see , just like if you were doing it at home with your digital camera. 

105
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,510
Okay , so now i'm imagining the camera is sharing out to jail synchronism altitudes rapidly . 

106
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,300
What twenty two thousand ahead there . 

107
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:10,110
And it's picking out perhaps thousands at one time , thousands of even software sized objects that right? 

108
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,300
Yeah , that's about right . 

109
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,780
Maybe the size of what he bought. 

110
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,655
And if we focused on one of those objects , you wait with the whisky bottles , you just in the mountain . 

111
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,720
If you really are whisky bottle whirling around in orbit. 

112
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,510
One can only guess , right ? 

113
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,010
We have add astronauts of. 

114
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,195
So let's assume it's not a whisky bottle , but some other kind of debris . 

115
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:34,560
How many pixels with that single object occupy , and the sensor of. 

116
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:43,080
The SSTshirts will be very few , so assets can not actually take what we would think of as an image of something in gear . 

117
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,520
What , as I see , does this really see dozen streets ? 

118
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,110
So it is not resolved the military of an object in jail , but really an indication of where that object is. 

119
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,301
And how it's moving . 

120
00:11:54,301 --> 00:12:15,320
Okay , that's really all important when you really want another trajectory , because then you can map that trajectory until the trajectories of all the theme satellites that are out there , whether it's for deal , deal or other analysts , so calculate where there might be an unwanted to intersection of the strategic rate. 

121
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,235
Yes , that's absolutely right . 

122
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:36,540
And I also add battle primary user , the toast group , bring out , actually NASA , we partner with NASA to try to identify in catalogue new near earth objects , and as it sees , actually prolific at this , at finding what we call these news , primarily , astronauts are what we're looking at. 

123
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,410
Right , right ? 

124
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,380
So , so that has been sold in the test out phase in his earlier ten years . 

125
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,800
In a way , it has first light in twenty eleven . 

126
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,290
If I call my reading is that when it first went on top of item peak , or was that somewhere else ? 

127
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,690
No , that was an atomic . 

128
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,140
Okay , so since then , can you give the sense of the catalog observations that the associates made? 

129
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:05,843
Since then , I will , we worked , like I mentioned with NASA to look at objects near the objects , astronauts and comets . 

130
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:11,220
We've also takes some images of nebula and supernova , also for a partner's analysis . 

131
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,824
I worked very closely with the united states air force for the air force . 

132
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:26,630
We are observing very thing , objects in geosynchronous orbit and providing them information on , and that could be anything from a piece of debris to to a small satellite . 

133
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,810
We also work quite a bit on developing what we call the brain models . 

134
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,000
So new telescope is strong enough to see every piece of debris in space . 

135
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,060
And so what we do is we make estimates about where that debris might be based on what we know . 

136
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,010
So SSTcan see many more objects and other telescopes . 

137
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:53,440
And so we've been using our measurements to help develop models for what we think the reality of of the debris of. 

138
00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:02,370
Okay , that you mentioned many more telescopes that make me think of the larger context here , which is the , the largest of the space of violence . 

139
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:02,840
And that were. 

140
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,764
Sure , so the united states air force operates . 

141
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:07,429
We recognize the assessment . 

142
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:31,920
Everything has to have an agreement , the space network , and there are several different types of optical and radar sensors in that network , as it sees currently , not one of those sensors , even though we do provide data on an attacked basis to the air force , but very shortly , it is going to become one of the sensors in that network , as it is going to be transitioning over to air force use actually very soon . 

143
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,310
On october eighteenth of this year. 

144
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,300
That is an important kind of a successful drop . 

145
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:50,323
But when we think about , we're trying to do here is in developed technologies to further the cost of we really do what the sort of transition ultimately to happen . 

146
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:53,606
We do a lot of high risk kinds of technology development . 

147
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:57,276
So the transition doesn't always have the material case where it is . 

148
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,014
So can you talk to me about this ? 

149
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:11,880
But on hand of right , and where we are now so that we can make the hands off to the your force , and then perhaps also take us for to the sequence of events that will be able to , oh , oh , with the next few years. 

150
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,310
Sure , so I mentioned ASSThad first late in twenty eleven . 

151
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,750
I was a demonstration system that we developed. 

152
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:33,370
But I am just going to rub the case for those who don't know first letters , just as a wonderfully term in the telescope community , which really refers to that moment when all of the conception is over in the development in the building . 

153
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:44,910
And you finally know , open up with this wonderful instrument to to observation , and you desperately want to see what that first observation is that often referred to his first lights . 

154
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,530
So sorry to interpret that was that in february of twenty eleven , first life , respect. 

155
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,720
Yes , thank you . 

156
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,850
So at that time , it was a demonstration system . 

157
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,750
And here are double . 

158
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,590
We try to really push beyond the state of the art in a revolutionary technology . 

159
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,535
And sometimes you always don't , you don't always get a perfect the first time . 

160
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:10,102
And so it is the camera that we had in there in two thousand and eleven , we realized that there were some improvements that could be made . 

161
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:15,340
And so over the past year , so we've been developing a replacement camera for the wounded exist there today . 

162
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:24,390
So we're installing , we finished the installation of that new camera and had a game first lights on august this year . 

163
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,637
We are currently demonstrated the improve , improve capability of assets . 

164
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:40,339
He once that demonstration is done , and we really , really certain that the technology is complete , and we are just really excited to give this to the user force . 

165
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:49,250
It represents an order of magnitude , increasing capability from what they are able to see now with their existing optical sensors . 

166
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,990
And so we are very excited to to be able to give them that capability and have that actually run into operational. 

167
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:05,720
Right , so the air force will officially take stewardship of assets , tea and the official ceremony that would be happening up on item in a new mexico . 

168
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,220
What can happen? 

169
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:16,690
After that , I , after that , we are actually going to be , we've been united states going to be moving the telescope to australia . 

170
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,110
We have software around the planet . 

171
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,760
Yes , not an easy task for a very large telescope . 

172
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:38,474
And twenty thirteen , the secretary of defense and also the minister defensive australia , signed an agreement to actually move the top scope from white sands , massachusetts , to hear the whole naval area in western australia . 

173
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:53,930
And so once we complete , the technology demonstrated and transition into the air force , the air force is going to continue to work with our australian partners to physically move over the western australia that will be happening over the next , maybe two years. 

174
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,980
And that that sounds like an enormous project , probably worth its own engineering story . 

175
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,420
So why take the great pains to move this telescope and. 

176
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,173
I have a healthy adult way . 

177
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,383
I completely agree . 

178
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:11,610
The movement is potentially a dark problem in itself . 

179
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,300
The reason to do it is because that is a part of the world . 

180
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,660
They were very interested in observing what's going on up in geosynchronous orbits . 

181
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:29,679
We have a lot of very important settlements in that area to communication , and also , it represents a great partnership with the australian allies . 

182
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,780
It's really those two reasons why we want to move it. 

183
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:39,050
We've covered a fair amount for the time we have about the space . 

184
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,800
A surveillance health group is a question that you really wish I would have asked here that I did not . 

185
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,710
And if so , you get to ask them as well. 

186
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,157
Well , maybe not a question , but I have a statements . 

187
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:55,090
Um , my whole life I have been interested in . 

188
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:04,090
So looking beyond , we know what we can really see , and I think it's inspired , trying to work on an instrument that lets us see other galaxies . 

189
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,380
It makes it so real . 

190
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:16,141
In a way , it's one thing to look so about a picture in a magazine , and and it's another to be working with an instrument that can actually imagine napoleon and a supernova suffering me . 

191
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:24,880
Working on the program has , has been inspiring , not only from a science perspective , but also because we could contribute to you to our important mission for their fourth. 

192
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:40,810
When is your editor plays darker , which is kind of all about reimagining what is possible and actually taking steps to change what to take , what my previously been considered impossible , making it possible . 

193
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,210
So in a way is the place it's trying to make science fiction on fiction . 

194
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:53,190
I am just wondering if you have some water now , fictional technologies in mind that you think what to be real. 

195
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,980
So I have a couple . 

196
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,830
One is the universal translator . 

197
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,450
I think it might be on the the star track series . 

198
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:09,340
Uh , that is the technology of perhaps a superpower that I absolutely wish that we had . 

199
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:17,390
I think the other one is to travel beyond the stars , perhaps that that one you could guess it's not not for me to just look . 

200
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,350
I wish we could go there . 

201
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,440
and. 

202
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,910
That's a good place to end . 

203
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,080
I think so lonely . 

204
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,770
I just want to thank you for this a great conversation . 

205
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,310
Thank you very much . 

206
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,720
Gradually here , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us . 

207
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,520
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dirt .
