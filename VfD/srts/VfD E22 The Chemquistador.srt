00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,760
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight operation. 

2
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:31,220
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , double the defence advanced research projects , say , has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:40,560
Welcome to Voices from darker a window on the dark of the core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,200
My name is ivan . 

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:53,289
A motto , went on your dog by host , and today , and please have with me in the studio , doctor and fisher , a program manager since twenty , in the agencies defense sciences office . 

6
00:00:53,289 --> 00:01:29,491
That's where she had her fellow program managers PM , as they were known in house foreign , deeply into the fundamental chemistry , physics , optics , materials and other disciplines in search of new scientific engineering foundations for technologies that can matter for national and is making her market darker as one of the few chemists in the agency after receiving her PHDMchemistry from michigan state university with a catalyst project that relied on electrically conductive government , she did a couple of research stands at the neighbourhood research laboratory , which is the navy's broad based corporate laboratory . 

7
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:37,933
She also got her feet weight in technology world as a at the american association for the advancement of science , publisher of science magazine . 

8
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:58,480
Then in two thousand and nine , she began with continues to be her partnership with dark first as a contract scientists , and since early as a dark program manager , when a purpose accomplishments inspired by her own successful journey to become a woman scientist and a male dominated profession , she created a growth girl , chemistry . 

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,760
We took out of getting more growth interested in the molecular wonders of the world , darker . 

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,660
And fisher , welcome to the studio . 

11
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,420
That's great to be here . 

12
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,070
Thank you . 

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:15,622
So before we talk about your sizable portfolio of dark programs with names like make it and molecular informatics . 

14
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:19,785
And this one spectrum comes from ultra violet to terror . 

15
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:20,306
hurts . 

16
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:33,180
You've got to tell me how your interest in chemistry is , because if you will know most people , men or women vote with panic , the incident , you say something like the period of table chemical elements. 

17
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:46,189
Yeah , so , so that actually goes back to elementary school , sitting down at the kitchen table in my house growing up , and my parents bought chemistry , said that things I don't think you could probably buy today . 

18
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,261
They wouldn't be in the store today . 

19
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:59,391
It literally had a wreck on it with all sorts of different chemical , very dangerous chemicals that are probably only one of them what they were , and it had experiments and from an early age of very dangerous . 

20
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:19,510
And my , my mom , specifically , my parents , both sort of just encouraged this sort of explorer tour experimental nature , and I just launched on the chemistry then through her high school , sort of all over a science , second , really choosing , and it was really a solidified in my undergraduate education at the cultural western in western higher . 

21
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:30,990
And just there was something about chemistry and the way it was , and that department , that really just kind of catalyzed , essentially the rest enough of the graduate career and postpone work. 

22
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,880
Tell me it is a little bit about that distraction project , where you use the electrically conductive diamond. 

23
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:46,603
The group I was in a michigan state was really focused on developing electrically conducting diamond electors for variety of applications . 

24
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:51,710
And I was in the destruction of the lab that was working on paranoid applications . 

25
00:03:51,710 --> 00:04:09,910
So we were actually trying to develop a new and ultra stable materials for fuel cells that really was both at credit of chemistry , but with a very practical application , and that was in inner the early two thousand , where there is a lot of our confuse , odd development and a lot of our conservative term of turn of energy . 

26
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,750
They continue today . 

27
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,130
But that was really the journalism. 

28
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:20,400
For yourself being technology that makes the relies on fields , even something like hydrogen , but maybe hydro carbons and produces. 

29
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,180
From that electricity , that's right . 

30
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,630
That's right . 

31
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,167
And in one of the one of the promise at the time was the the stability of the electrons themselves . 

32
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:33,788
And electors are what converts sort of the fuel of you , all the harder , genuine an example case to electrons , electricity . 

33
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:37,400
And we were trying to enhance the stability of these materials. 

34
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:46,120
Okay , then before you move on to your strength in the research library , I do just wanna confirm that you did not walk with any of those who left. 

35
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,180
I love them . 

36
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,370
Unfortunately , there are not as beautiful as you might imagine . 

37
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,780
There are , there are distant films of. 

38
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,920
Really excellent , great . 

39
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:05,568
So tell me about neighbor research webbs in the world , the result in a little bit about that is because I actually worked for an error for a while . 

40
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:10,141
I was hired to write an institutional history for the submitted anniversaries . 

41
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,130
I got to know the place pretty well . 

42
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,920
It intrigued me to see the june. 

43
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah , so I worked there . 

44
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,530
I came radar , gorgeous hood to post doctor at naval research lab , working with them double roles . 

45
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,268
And they worked on power and energy related applications , not with diamond , but , but with other , the electoral types . 

46
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:39,980
And so I was assembly , taking my interest in insert of power , energy and alternative sources to a group that had a long history of of success in the space of the . 

47
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,740
So I spent A. 

48
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,240
Two years there , working with them . 

49
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,620
Actually , I got to know deborah , when I was , there are the two excellence , very excited to me the year . 

50
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,590
And then the funny thing I work at tripolis as well . 

51
00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:05,340
The american association for the events of where you've learned a finger to about science and technology policy , that's an interesting turned away from the lab and into this other component of the home scientific reports. 

52
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,500
Yeah , so I actually learned about the triples fellowship when I was in graduate school . 

53
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,620
And it's , you know , it's a one year potentially to your program . 

54
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm a , if you renew for a second year where scientists , engineers come to DCand either either serve on a couple of homework for members of congress or congressional committee , or work in executive branch . 

55
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:33,485
And scientists at my time , as a trouble's fellow working at the national science foundation , and that was my first kind of entry . 

56
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:43,400
If you willing to policy by the personal , essentially , how do we sort of change the scientific words by funding specific areas for technology development? 

57
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,290
Okay , so I am also realizing there is something weird about . 

58
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,490
I guess both of our cbs , because I am swimming you to your experience . 

59
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,091
And i've got double on my resume as well . 

60
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:59,230
I think this is practice is that i'm not going to mention it again , but there are some , some. 

61
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,420
Parallel , I just I wrote the open to follow you where. 

62
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,490
So let us let us turn to your topic experience . 

63
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:16,310
You started as a cedar contract worker , and then you became a program manager in the defense sciences officer , talk about the early city phase . 

64
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,760
And and how that kind of sacred into A. 

65
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:40,992
Your program manager face , yes , that's a really interesting thread , because I am eat shapes what my interests are today , all the , all the way back to the first day that I worked at arba , so actually heard about that from a friend who who worked for a company that had see the contract here . 

66
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:50,050
And well , he didn't work at our bodies that hate , there's this opportunity is something that the interesting is was right after my triple leadership was running up with me up . 

67
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,340
And I said , you know , that sounds pretty interesting . 

68
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:10,930
And the opportunity was , was working with a mathematician in the defence , signs of his bad man , ben was , is a server , a genius mathematician who wanted to surround himself by people who knew other things , chemistry , biology , physics . 

69
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:21,395
Those are the things , and so he was really looking for someone to come to provide a length to chemistry that sort of he could then think about how to apply mathematics in that space . 

70
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:27,126
And it was probably one of the scariest first days of my life , but I decided to do it anyway . 

71
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:37,130
I am , it was an image , amazing opportunity and realized the sort of the math in the programs that that he had going still again . 

72
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,040
As I , as I mentioned , all the impact my thought process today means the programs I have today . 

73
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,677
I am AIcomponent machine learning based components . 

74
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:50,726
I'm complexity , those sorts of things , which are things that are he addressed from a fundamental level . 

75
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:58,280
Many years ago , when I started , and I sort of weaved through a meal as I started a girls . 

76
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,550
None of us are here for all that long . 

77
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:13,480
And so I am worked for a material scientist , and I came after getting back a little bit closer to my roots , but still being able to bring in those things I learned from banned from his performers and the programs that he had and was developing and. 

78
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:22,990
Right , and just for listeners who might not know how this sort of the basic structure , who works is a program manager , who is in charge of a portfolio of programs . 

79
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:30,750
We're going to talk about that in your case soon , but then each program manager has , has one or several seaters assist . 

80
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,780
And so what might be a typical role for a seat on the typical program ? 

81
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,230
I mean , when they , when it comes to working with those research groups that become part of the overall program of. 

82
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:56,622
Yes , it really , it really depends on the programmers , often the program manager , but generally speaking , you serve as you can serve the subject matter expert where you have your person in the room with that expertise in chemistry . 

83
00:09:56,622 --> 00:10:11,955
And when questions arise about , for example , how to appointment authorities to accomplish related questions , you can then think about , well , you know , if I think about the material , and I think about some structural considerations of that material , those have dimensions associated with them . 

84
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:14,010
How that is that , could that be addressed ? 

85
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,309
Mathematical design for material eventually . 

86
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:55,796
So , so it is providing a subject medicines , but then also , how do you bring that perspective of that field in two of the program at hand , because it's always about sort of what the program is exploring and how various disciplines and and approaches can impact that , so subject matter expertise , providing a sort of reviews of literature and things like that in and some help with sort of program strategy , industrial programs are all about how you manage them to function more sufficiently and towards a specific goal . 

87
00:10:55,796 --> 00:11:03,640
And so that requires a team of people , I think , really kind of through all the different ways with which that might happen. 

88
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:16,105
Case something was about a year and half when you became APMAprogram manager , most PM and management is a few programs in the several positions . 

89
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:33,910
But you are , as we think you got seven , perhaps even more , or than that , some inherited from previous another program managers and some of the youth pitching , we will get approved through the hearing wedding process here , so we can talk about all reason and debt . 

90
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,580
So I would really love to , let's just talk about a few , and let's start with the makeup program , which I actually can tell you . 

91
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,310
It was started by former program manager here . 

92
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:52,561
Terrible required , who I have a special , funniest work because he was my first guests here on the Voices from global partners . 

93
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:59,320
So you've taken the time to to one day , make it program so tells little bit the vegetables is . 

94
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,670
And what this sadness is. 

95
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,380
The primary goal of the makeup program is to fully automate the sentences of small molecules . 

96
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:25,080
And what I mean by that is , is , we have a small molecule like I be proven that that might be some sort of pain medication or a small male to energetic or a small molecule agriculture chemicals are the building block materials for for what we have in it on a daily basis , and we need to to figure out how to make them . 

97
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:37,546
So , by and large , right now , that that that , by hand process and expert cameras were going to a lab and and mix things up in in biggest and testimonies and wrong bottom flasks , and really define , I wrote to a malaysia . 

98
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:44,356
So that round is like a recipe that you might have an introduction to be a cake with a certain taxation of certain flavor . 

99
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,885
And you don't know in advance what that route is . 

100
00:12:46,885 --> 00:13:11,470
So you going , and you test out very steps to i'll particularly molecule , so molecules might take a five steps in that crash means I need to go from a set of starting materials , and you five different experiments , five different transformations , if you will take it to the extra product to molecule , it takes much longer than you might imagine in your hand to design around to molecule that that noise done before it might take me through . 

101
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:28,240
Afraid for the six months to do so what we try to do with make it actually provide computational tools that can help us define that road , three machine learning , and then build a device that can actually implement that route. 

102
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:38,636
For completely hands free sympathies , and we are just needed to stop here with that machine learning and supply to chemical sympathy , which is very interesting sounding to me . 

103
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:53,900
And if it sounds like like you have to gather a tremendous amount of data from the chemical literature of feed to your machine , and so that it can pull out of that likely series of steps that would work raised to produce the military adventures. 

104
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:54,695
I get that right ? 

105
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:55,955
That's absolutely right . 

106
00:13:55,955 --> 00:14:15,182
And there are , there is existing data from the last hundred years ago of chemistry once in the literature , but we actually having to generate a lot of as well , because as , as you might know , the data that you need to train , machine learning algorithms is both what works or the positive results , and you also need what doesn't work . 

107
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:18,918
And it turns out the scientists typically don't publish what doesn't work . 

108
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:29,531
We might have the captured in our levels of books , but we don't publish that information , and it's not available in database , and that's what so that your machine learning doesn't take it on a dead end , right ? 

109
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,975
So that's right , it needs to know what doesn't work . 

110
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:37,210
And we actually had to both and generate that computationally , so we generate sort of negative result . 

111
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:49,883
If you and we also built a rapid screening platform that we can rapidly test various reactions , and we're collecting all of the data for the molecules are made , and then those molecules that aren't made . 

112
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:59,980
So these reactions that don't work when we want all of them information to them feed into these machinery and algorithms to them help us understand what's the best path or recipe to get to a certain moment. 

113
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,119
Okay , so this machine learning , but also in this , upon a mistake in its machine , making right . 

114
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,703
So so this whole thing is really automated . 

115
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:14,710
Your machine learning a song you have to try these intensification that it grows , and then then a bunch of gadgets are going to end right? 

116
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:24,250
Great , so we're trying to accelerate both the , the brain of the chemist in terms of of having to sort through and sit through what route to use and what route to test . 

117
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:39,080
And also then the implementation of that on a device so that there will be a fully automated process and not not only automated from the perspective of making one molecule , but we want one device that can make a lot of many molecules that's. 

118
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,680
A pretty complex undertaking . 

119
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:52,610
So as an invasion , the whole system , it is sort of making me think a little bit of sort of like a molecular version of the star trick replicator or something like that . 

120
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:59,930
But where maybe I would bring this , make it gadgetry somewhere under maybe to a to a battlefield where I might . 

121
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,090
This is that chemical , mechanical , can you take us through an actual scenario ? 

122
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,770
Let's say your successful with make it . 

123
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:12,430
You have these , make it technologies , these gadgets , boxes that you can shift them , or who might want that with. 

124
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,070
I think about this in insert of two main ways . 

125
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:27,237
One is , one is from the perspective of if there are times where you might need to generate some , some medicine , for example , remotely in the field , this device would allow you to do that . 

126
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:34,965
It will allow an announcement to come up the device and saying , I want medicine , eggs , and the device would then be able to define the road to that medicine . 

127
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:41,760
What is the most efficient route , most cost effective for out the most environmentally to be able to make that medicine for you . 

128
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:53,830
I also think about it from the perspective of a reproductive and enabling sentences for , for fields , for research , tool for fields that don't house and that it , but teeth . 

129
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:11,060
So , for example , the field of military biology practice , you can have a make a device in their lab , and in the rate small amounts of chemicals that they might need in their research without having to purchase sort of a large , large products , or in a products that are necessarily available commercially . 

130
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,820
They built them to navigate the research well. 

131
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,790
Interesting okay , well , well , good luck with with , make it me . 

132
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,620
You take it to the finish line . 

133
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:36,880
I wanna move to another program , which I find just absolutely fascinating molecular informatics , you know me , we've also gotten familiar with the idea of thinking of the oxygen to click as it as an information containing molecule . 

134
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,011
Names contains genetic information . 

135
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:45,348
We often think , say , it sort of it has the genetic or the molecular information blueprint of a person . 

136
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:54,270
But you're taking this idea of multilateral information to entirely different , and whether a dishes places , can you talk about? 

137
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,774
Molecular informatics , yeah , sure . 

138
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:10,270
So malaysian informatics is it kind of the crazy institution of a really , what would you do if you could actually store data in the physical form of a molecule ? 

139
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:17,374
So nature does that , as you mentioned in DNA , that's how that's how we store information for our genetic codes . 

140
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:24,500
And there there is worth going on to store actual digital data using ones of our digital in dinner . 

141
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,020
So dinner has these four building blocks , and you can essentially code . 

142
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,660
The zoo is in ones of our digital data into this for building . 

143
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:42,106
But you know , when we started to think about this in terms of how we could both accelerate ultra dance data storage . 

144
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:47,740
So that's the benefit that molecules providers is from a density perspective . 

145
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,260
You can store much , much more data in a very small physical form. 

146
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,650
But also then minutes as compared to say , the transition based to the storage on A. 

147
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,670
I like to worry , my name is very things like that . 

148
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,390
Take memory . 

149
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,200
But then if , if , if you do that , there are , there are so two threads here . 

150
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,690
One is that nature uses four building blocks for molecules to store our the complex instructions for life . 

151
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:31,208
But there are millions of molecules and and why limit ourselves to those for so we start to think about this from the perspective of if we could actually sort of address and access the richard political chemistry to store data . 

152
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:37,990
What could that then enable from either a density perspective or a computational perspective ? 

153
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,286
And that's what we started to see this . 

154
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:46,947
This mix between storing data and are carrying it , which is which um is really good with DNA right now . 

155
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:58,610
You , you write the data until the DNA strength , and you put in refrigerator and for later , but could you actually use that information in the molecular form ? 

156
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:08,978
So could you compute it on that molecule for some functions of computations are , like , you know , you might want to do an additional motivation , or you might want to do . 

157
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:12,860
You might want to a search of a large data set . 

158
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,380
So well , a large image set do some sort of machine learning on that image set . 

159
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:30,222
And what molecules offer is not only the ability to store data in a very , very dense way , but also a very highly parallel processing . 

160
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:41,720
And what I mean , you know , chemical reactions have been relatively quickly , and they happen centrally simultaneously . 

161
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:53,630
So if you have a bigger , full of money , you have multiple reaction parts , all happening at the same time , as opposed the sort of cereal processing , or one right after the other processing that that we might think about for today. 

162
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:02,800
And then there are particular kinds of problems where this molecular computation is would be better than than the kind of commercial case. 

163
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,905
Exactly what we're exploring . 

164
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:07,795
You know , we have high policies about where that might be true . 

165
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:14,588
We have some approaches that are looking at things like similarity , search for a very large of images . 

166
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:22,492
So can I find all of the images that have a range shirt , and can I do that much , much faster than a conventional computer might be able to do it ? 

167
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:27,700
We're looking at problems and involving signal processing and optimization . 

168
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,350
So so how can you optimize our response ? 

169
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:49,330
How can you get rid of the best I am function from that response , and what we're really looking at is , is , can molecules enable us to do things like that , and or can they enable us to do sort of a computation that a conventional computer that sits on your desk cup would not be able to do. 

170
00:21:49,980 --> 00:22:04,630
I just want to drilling on one part of this to see if you can help me understand , say , how is the result of a chemical reaction saying this molecular computation , some of our car responds to a red shirt in an image while white shirt in the image . 

171
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,410
How does that molecule? 

172
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,470
Map to the object , so that depends on how you encode the information . 

173
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,864
So I give you an example that kind of easy to grasp . 

174
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:17,002
We'll go back to DNA for a minute . 

175
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:45,001
So DNA again has these , these four base pairs , and we put them together , and and that string we can men with that string in the cold that we use for that string weather is ACTGor GCTAwhenever we design as the cold for a red shirt , we can actually then sympathize those DNA strength and an image that has a red shirt , and it will have that richard code , for example . 

176
00:22:45,001 --> 00:23:01,677
So if I have a string of a hundred of the ATCengines , the coach for that red shirt will be embedded within that , and we can actually search with that very quickly from with , in a molecular and and with DNA , we might do that with them complimentary strengths . 

177
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:07,187
So it focus understand that that DNA has is a sort of a double strengthen process . 

178
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:19,837
We're working in the encoding on the encoding and the story with single strength , so we can use that that sort of based pairing and phenomenon that that nature uses in DNA to . 

179
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:29,240
Then , how do we reach in to that sort of liquid steel of of data and only plug out those strengths that have that code? 

180
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,480
A red shirt that sounds absolutely amazing . 

181
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,860
One thing I think would be interesting to maybe try to give . 

182
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,560
This is a sense of is just how dance the storage can be . 

183
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:54,850
I mean , you know , sometimes you hear people talking about storing the entire contents of the library of congress uh in something the size of the sugar queue by the library , congress is becoming an information unit . 

184
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:05,990
So when you talk about DNA as storage me , how much say I mean , this might be difficult , but in indian aid that could pack into a sugar cube , like how much would that? 

185
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:14,291
The one of one of the best kind of images I can provide this , if you took all of the data that have been generated in the history time . 

186
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,674
Ubuntu , like twenty , fifteen or twenty sixteen . 

187
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:37,629
If you saw that in DNA , you could pack all of that into something the size of the next UV, absolute standing tip , sort of put an explanation point on that what we're trying to do in electronics is provides for the practical DNA storage solutions that we can compute on , as I mentioned . 

188
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:43,260
But access that brought a pilot of molecules which might provide. 

189
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,302
Higher density levels right ? 

190
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:59,920
So in that case , biological evolution leads to DNA with this four building blocks AC, but that doesn't mean we have to stop there if our purposes or something else like data storage , you might have medicinal building works at one thousand different functions that's. 

191
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,052
That's right , and it , it allows us a lot more flexibility in our , in our designs . 

192
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:13,040
We think a lot of doubt about not only developing enabling capabilities , but thinking about the ultimates are a scalability and implementation of those capabilities . 

193
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,430
And diesel really is looking at things that we might actually realize . 

194
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,480
In ten , twenty , thirty years , but we always have that in. 

195
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,600
But these are different . 

196
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,260
Scientists are up . 

197
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,700
That's right . 

198
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,070
young . 

199
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:33,100
Okay , so we've just touched on two of your other programs , just briefly , one of them , ACDC, that stands for egg , nasty . 

200
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,060
The militarization of chemical agents . 

201
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,910
And that just sounds like a great idea. 

202
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,100
Yes , it is a wonderful and necessary , necessary thing , unfortunately . 

203
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:53,100
So the ACDCprogram is , is designed to make transport of devices that can destroy chemical religions . 

204
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,930
So really what we're headed with this is actually building a device that is almost a conventional diesel . 

205
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,348
If you imagine a diesel engine and what we're gonna be doing with the diesel engine is using the commonwealth agent as a fuel . 

206
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:31,770
So just like as you would burn in engine , we're burning chemical warfare agent and destroying it in the process so we can produce energy from the sandwich , but we are also then destroying chemical for region , and ultimately , what we're building is a prototype to pick up truck with an engine in the front that this pickup truck can drive to a site run off of the chemical horrigan to store chemicals or region . 

207
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,810
And that we can drive. 

208
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:39,873
Well , that sounds like sorts of pleasures like , I think , okay , maybe you absolutely succeeded . 

209
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:41,385
And if you test this. 

210
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:44,207
Test we've tested the engine concept , and we're right now . 

211
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:45,090
We're developing . 

212
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,560
We're building the full system of developing the. 

213
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:59,580
Okay , the rest of your many programs that will talk that right now is scale is because I mentioned earlier in the interior that stands for spectral comes from ottawa . 

214
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,870
Harry hurts , and when i'm talking about here about comes that we used to make our hair look nice . 

215
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,760
Right , this is something else. 

216
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:17,339
That's right , the scale is , is a focused on developing compact sources for spectroscopy and spread trust pieces , essentially chemical measurements of various species . 

217
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:40,602
So if we want to know what species are present in the air that were breathing , we might expect us to find out , and snow was really designed to take a capability to have been developed at a single wavelength and expanded all the way from ottawa hurts , as you mentioned in the reason that you want to do , that is because molecules behave differently when there are sort of energies . 

218
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:47,407
If you wear weight late in the UVregime than they doing a terrorist regime and different systems respond differently . 

219
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:56,353
So UVis is very good for integrating biological systems and claims , whereas terror hurts might be really good for really complex mixtures like breath analysis . 

220
00:27:56,353 --> 00:28:01,180
So people are very interested in using terror space before for those complex mixtures . 

221
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:13,266
Until scott had sort of two threads , when is to develop the materials to miniature , rights are very sort of high fatality for spectro scope across the evidence . 

222
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:14,914
Heritage , swim light sources . 

223
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:18,623
That's right to use for the sort of spectroscopic application . 

224
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:25,010
And the other was um to actually demonstrate , let's say that we can build these things in a laboratory . 

225
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:36,230
What can we actually do with them than in the field , and what we've shown is that that scott offers the ability to do things much , much faster than conventional systems . 

226
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,570
So I can take a spectrum um in a matter of middle seconds . 

227
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:58,610
What might have taken me minutes to do before that is very important when you , when you have something that that is a matter of whether you want to know that there's a chemical attack , for example , you wanna know as fast as possible , and you want to know exactly what that agent was , this kind of spectacular tool can tell you that . 

228
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:13,142
And so we've been able to show that we can do the spectroscopy of a large distances , so much link distances , which is really important to monitor larger areas . 

229
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:20,057
This might have implications in oil , gas industry for gas leaks , for example , also for air quality monitoring across the city . 

230
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:24,570
There are a number of different factors that you can , and either all I save . 

231
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:37,760
So , so we don't worry about safety challenges , and we're really looking to find out how we might apply this special topic method uh in a , in a duty and an outside duty contexts. 

232
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:44,422
And you did just mention , along the way , even breath analysis that that begins to sound like a biomedical application going to the husband . 

233
00:29:44,422 --> 00:29:54,440
Research indicating that there can be in a really subtle science in the initiative of the chemistry , but of an explanation right that can be indicative of some conditions. 

234
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:09,152
That's right , and and really what we're getting in something like brazil analysis , or any other biological or complex system generally , is you getting a lot of chemical , lot of signals that might change frequently or over time in the concentration might be very , very low . 

235
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:13,124
So developing a technique that can can do both and do both deal with that . 

236
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:22,050
The complexity of the number of different analysts have feared them from different things in that sample , and also do it very quickly and distinguish them from each other is really important. 

237
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,438
Okay , then just finally honest that word COM . 

238
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:38,380
Umm , I take it because if you would look at the distribution of wavelengths and so that represent each one of those , then there is many lines in a way , look like the times of come. 

239
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,643
That's right , that's exactly right . 

240
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:52,370
So so you get AAlight source that provides many wave links all at once , but they have a very fine spectrum resolution , which is really important again for the sort of complex environments were dealing. 

241
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:05,604
Okay , so we , we've kind of touched on four of your programs , and we will have to leave the other ones for a another time , although our listeners can always go to the dark of website and find out more about those . 

242
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:09,006
So you've been a program manager for about a year and a half . 

243
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:12,609
And that means that you probably have a couple more years to go . 

244
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,010
That's typically the case . 

245
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:26,610
So just wondering if you imagine back to your time here at dark , but from advantage of of ten years from now , and you examine what has come of your work of your programs safe . 

246
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,220
Scott will make it . 

247
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,880
What do you hope you will be able to say at that time? 

248
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,024
I really , you know , looking back , we've spent a lot of time here . 

249
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm spending a lot of time thinking about where my , these things go , and that's a lot of what what are produced is built relationships without organizations to transition the technology that we develop . 

250
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,006
And so IODCseats to what that answer might be . 

251
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:57,569
There are some projects I have where it's going to be continued scientific and technical development . 

252
00:31:57,569 --> 00:32:06,161
This is going to be a lot of knowledge and might be in a twenty to thirty years before anybody sees anything , and it might not look anything like it does today . 

253
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:27,846
I think , for programming , like , like , make it , we might actually see these systems , and we might actually see some , some generation of the systems that we're building now as the first generation asked michael devices , we might see some of the industry and through the chemical production industry , using some of the , the competition , social tools that were developing . 

254
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:37,229
Um , I think the programs like make it in ACDC, Ican see a very practical sort of field application and more programs like military and dramatics . 

255
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:47,410
I think it's were just the forefront of defining what are the questions we should be asking to really begin to understand the opportunity for molecules in in something like computing. 

256
00:32:47,500 --> 00:33:04,890
Written as I gave myself , if I try to be you for a minute , I mean , if I knew , say , ten years from now that the ACDCtechnology that I work on helped to decontaminate time tons and tons and tons of very dangerous chemical warfare regions . 

257
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,050
Well , I mean , I would feel like I have come for something like. 

258
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,960
Yeah , after saying , even even even being at upon a daily basis is humbling experience . 

259
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:26,940
But then , you know , seeing something that you are working on , and their performers are working really hard to develop , become used in either the dirty or a broader context . 

260
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,970
This would be incredible. 

261
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:46,860
Oh , and then , as we're getting towards the end here , but I did just want to touch back on an interest of yours that you express way back when you are graduate student , when you were , you're a woman entering the world of science and in what traditions have been a male dominated kind of world . 

262
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:54,215
But going further , not just getting through that yourself , but also china , inspire young women and girls to do this the same as the girls . 

263
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:56,261
Go to interest , patching chemistry . 

264
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:59,422
I want to say a little bit about that particular experience . 

265
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:03,850
And then , if , but exactly continued that kind of ventures , even later in your. 

266
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,688
Yeah , so , so that it just really started in college , college in graduates . 

267
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:12,316
So I was actually part and held leadership bowls . 

268
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:22,537
And in organizations of my undergraduate and graduate institutions , they were really geared towards sort of women scientists . 

269
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:28,680
And we did outrage to , to to young girls and worked at science , personal things like that . 

270
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,500
But we also then work community for each other , and the faculty at our institution that is not . 

271
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,310
It wasn't something limited to a student population and a sort of professional levels . 

272
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:56,428
And and I learned a lot through a lot of these conversations about explicit bias and implicit bias , and an authority of couldn't cook reasons , you know , that there is an under representation of of both women and other under represented groups . 

273
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,314
But for me , it wasn't about finding the answer . 

274
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:02,802
The reason was about sort of empowering those around me . 

275
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:04,741
And that happened at that level . 

276
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:06,250
It still happens today . 

277
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:25,590
But I think I do it a little bit more organically now , as a possibility involved in organization is much more about and trying to fill a hole that other women might have in terms of , you know , having a circle of of people around them , men and women help mentor them and grow the careers . 

278
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:38,010
And that's one thing that that I do try to focus on , and also , then again , make sure that I have that in my own life as well , because it's important for everyone actually took , make sure they build those relationships for folks to the help. 

279
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,652
And teaching and learn and grow . 

280
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:53,650
Okay , so we works at a time , but I just wanted to ask you , if there is anything about science , double your careers , chemist or anything I suggested to come up , there would be an interesting thing to listeners. 

281
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,790
You do not know how funny songs . 

282
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,850
Well , tell me , I have fun . 

283
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:58,680
This one . 

284
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,270
Well , this , this big being being the podcast , but also live in january at DARPA . 

285
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:17,430
And and I say that because it interact with amazing top nut scientists on a daily basis , a lot of political times a day , and that's really exciting . 

286
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,860
And it is a really fun , and it's amazing opportunity . 

287
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:28,403
And those are the folks that are doing the hard work to employment , all of the ideas that we , i'm really put them to practice . 

288
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:39,190
And and again , from , you know , the perspective of coming to work every day and being humbled by that and being so excited and energized by what they have to bring in terms of various and their talents. 

289
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,900
So I just wanna thank you for spending time with me in the studio and getting up to speed on your programs . 

290
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,870
Thank you so far , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us . 

291
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,840
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from DARPA . 

292
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:10,000
We're more information about infrastructure , the programs that she and her colleagues run in the defence science office and the other breakthrough technologies dark is working on visit , darker now .
