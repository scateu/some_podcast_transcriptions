00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:30,230
Stuff technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand on tournament technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , the defense advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology . 

2
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:38,070
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window at the dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

3
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,460
My name is , I have a motto , and I am your daughter host today . 

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,060
I am pleased to be talking with darker . 

5
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,370
Michael fitty , a program manager . 

6
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:59,398
Since defense sciences office , we're recording it our conversation from our respective homes as we do our part to slow the spread of coffee , nineteenth , the pandemic disease caused by the crown by a source . 

7
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:01,271
Two is also what you might hear . 

8
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:25,680
Some ambient sounds like trucks and sirens prior is coming to darbar mike , as it is most often known , was that the university of north carolina at challenger , where he was the founding director of the center for optical , electronic and optical communications , and director of the national science foundations , industry , slash university collaborative research center for materials , which are a class that interact with light in the darkness twice . 

9
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,770
Michael urges PHDin physics from the university of london . 

10
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,960
And I am just , so please , mike , to join me. 

11
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,130
Well , thanks for the introduction . 

12
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,640
I went unhappy to be here. 

13
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:44,380
So I know like that your primary interest result in the many ways that , like other forms of electronic energy interact with the matter . 

14
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:53,930
But before we get into those interests , i'd like to hear , how is that you became an interested in science , and ultimately , in particularly article based on oil. 

15
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,300
As a kid , I used to play around with phenomenon magnifying in glasses , politician filters . 

16
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:10,350
I was always interested in trying to understand why visible light that we could say would go through some materials like glass . 

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,140
Oh no , others , I really just try to understand what the difference between the masses are the kid almost going on . 

18
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,280
The allowed me to see through a piece of glass . 

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,280
So I should chelsea causes when I went to college that focused on electric magnetics and light and scattering theory and. 

20
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:35,770
Whether any particular influences that that really in a sort of got to go in , this is a job of fantastic professor , were you parents ? 

21
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,360
Scientists have anything of that sort that that really steer you in the direction of a professional science? 

22
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:51,340
Yeah , I think I have to say that my father was using the lazy from mom , very younger age men are away from home to join the navy . 

23
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,930
Always had telescopes , and but not killers , are home and magnifying glasses . 

24
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:05,840
I think I picked up he's enthusiasm for image , bringing , bringing scenes up close to inspect them more carefully. 

25
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:22,680
Well , well , very interesting to hear that , and as you are saying that it also is images of the , the end of the sides of the sixteenth and seventy century came to mind because glass objects , you know , both in the form telescopes and microscopes really are kind of at the beginning of the scientific enterprise . 

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,190
So as the epidemic , I am not quite at all myself , but it shows the connection . 

27
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,000
So no , every program manager has a , how do I get to dark a story? 

28
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,832
I love you for yours . 

29
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:50,395
Okay , when IIhad some intellectual method of the years , and i've been talking to a program manager in d so who was starting a new very much in the area , which I was interested in being a possible performer . 

30
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:59,930
So I am , I haven't come to the discovered the so day when he talked about it , met with the announced director at that. 

31
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,840
我的手机。

32
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,550
And I just wanted to do that . 

33
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,220
There are still being defense sciences of us were listening to that . 

34
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,620
I could not. 

35
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:16,170
Sorry , I did me with the director of the officer time , and she suggested I might like consider becoming a program management . 

36
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:26,460
Since I had all these ideas that does not know what I could be funded to do , but maybe I could find others I could find to pursue them . 

37
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,720
So I am very quickly at the meeting I attended was in june , june . 

38
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,530
I think I started a couple of couple months later , september twenty. 

39
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:48,696
You have executed large portfolio of program managers and letterpress by with six different programs , but they focus on really some rather amazing ideas . 

40
00:04:48,696 --> 00:05:01,323
And we'll get to this a little while me , one of them really catches my attention , or things like tapping into the energy of the vacuum , perhaps even my level for things like proportion without fuel . 

41
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,857
As I said , we'll get that a little bit . 

42
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:09,386
I am kind of interested in at the moment , a more strategic level of your thinking . 

43
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:14,970
You have that informs already efforts in the programs that that you have ended up formulating and running . 

44
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,190
Effectives said , and they love this line . 

45
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:23,330
I am interested in electronic waves and their interaction with matter from DCto daylights . 

46
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,660
So I think if you explain that to listeners those lessons , you might not know what that means . 

47
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,690
I think that they might actually have some handle on where a lot of your thinking comes. 

48
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:38,900
Well , if we really got back to basics , we made up of items of charge particles . 

49
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,710
And in principle , if you accelerate a charge , particular , they will radiate . 

50
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:52,216
And so we are completely based by electronic magnetic fields , literally from DCto very high frequency failed . 

51
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:56,371
This is being direct , correct earlier , so is there are frequency . 

52
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,680
Think about this is zero frequency . 

53
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:06,370
So and my ，I bet my comment about looking through a piece of glass , how does that happen ? 

54
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:17,930
We have to think about electronic magnetic waves , whether they are very high frequency of the what much lower frequency punch , radio or microwave . 

55
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:35,480
And what are those fields doing , the carrying energy and the moving items around their exciting items as they propagate , and what we might want to detect that radiation , we might want to bend it or steer . 

56
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:43,450
We need to understand what those interactions are at all scales in order to exploit . 

57
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,440
It may keep a bit . 

58
00:06:45,030 --> 00:07:30,280
And what I am finding is that even though electronic goes back hundred years in the first radio was probably in eighty nine five , that classical picture , which evolved to describe electronic magnetic waves and interactions , is still surprising as when it comes to model the interaction of waves with structures that perhaps of the order of the wavelength in size , or when we try to explain interactions where is strong residencies of what we were called on linear effects . 

59
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:45,420
So the material properties that could be described by earlier electric theory , the classical electronic theory , keep pulling us to test them and stretch them into new rounds . 

60
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,720
Well , we are discovering new properties , new physics , new opportunities all the time . 

61
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:21,120
And I think all of the programs are healthy , and my poor , fully of touch on some aspect of the weather , detecting light looking at these nonlinear aren't strongly interacting relationships like half with engineering , matter with it over similar size and the right material properties to the wavelength is interested in to managing electronic waves for bad imagining . 

62
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,651
Oh , thank you . 

63
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:42,190
We've got one program we're looking at instead of imaging with frequency , we can see uh you could go to lower frequencies , much lower frequency and start thinking about trying to image through structures with very low service . 

64
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,640
The penetrate sounds like glass I can see through . 

65
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,350
I don't expect to see through a piece of metal . 

66
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,930
Very low frequencies can penetrate the piece of . 

67
00:08:52,330 --> 00:09:02,910
So can I extract information from radiation of low frequency , the cost to those materials like my phone and find out what's on the other side. 

68
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,250
Right , and so that's that mapping onto your program called , imagine through almost anything , anywhere , right , right? 

69
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:34,770
We've become more sophisticated in how we can model the emission of low frequencies from sources , maintenance and hurricane describe how those who will call narrow or crazy strategic fields with matter , and can provide this information about that matter , not interaction. 

70
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:42,370
Right , so this is reminding me one of your programs which really fascinates me that they all do is , is radio buyer , right ? 

71
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,670
So we are talking about , in this case , electronic interactions with biological material . 

72
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,560
And in this case , when thank you really looking more on the salary level. 

73
00:09:50,960 --> 00:10:13,530
Actually , that was the first program I launched AIIpitched the service by calling to dark , and it was ahead of previous work in north carolina , where I realized for some of these engineered materials have the kind of remarkable new properties the beyond seen before a good metal materials . 

74
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,780
It might be convenient to grow them . 

75
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:29,935
So I was looking at chemical methods that myself assemble some of these residents structures , some of these geometric , like shapes that interact very strongly with with light . 

76
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:35,560
And it occurred to me that some of these structures occur in nature . 

77
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:56,013
And I got to thinking about whether nature perhaps is already making use a very sad electronic interactions , but between cells , between organs , between individuals using electronic ways in ways that we haven't really thought about . 

78
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,149
It was studied very deeply . 

79
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:12,858
So the program had a , oh , you've trying to determine whether sounds or any scale by our systems , which we knew would be successful to exposure by different frequencies . 

80
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:34,906
We like to magnetic waves , whether these structures might actually be generating electronic magnetic waves , and if there could be some purposeful communication on over large ranges , the man would expect to see with normal chemical signaling by a chemical . 

81
00:11:34,906 --> 00:12:14,438
Sydney is usually used to describe as southern bus systems communicate with each other , and the programs still going is a very challenging problem , but it's quite clear that biological structures do eliminate electric magnetic waves across going back to GCto the airline , in fact , but okay , exploiting them for some purpose is , as a question we still try to answer if it turns out there is this network of communication going on in biological systems for some purpose . 

82
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:48,730
We have not understood in the closely opens up the possibility of perhaps being able to intervene and generate similar signals externally for foreign positive purposes to perhaps hill wounds , for example , if there were charges and fields involved in that process in so , I think it is a good area to think more deeply about , because it would be terrible to miss some opportunities for doing good if we just have . 

83
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,060
If not thought they played enough about what's going on. 

84
00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:10,000
So I wonder if , if any of the performers and that sort of double speak for the research , researchers , research groups that end up getting essentially contracts through program management to work on the programme and try to realize them the goals of the program have any performers . 

85
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:16,600
You're discovered things and published things in this arena that had happened , surprising. 

86
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:26,360
For a number of application areas of interest exampled by our phones , one performing team has established . 

87
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:43,300
But there are a couple of frequency ranges in the terror hurts when there are , which are some attempt to transmit , receive over a couple of bands , a couple of range of frequencies in the terror. 

88
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,339
Range range and just a couple of things , just so listeners know a bio film . 

89
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:53,190
I typically think of that as as as a kind of bacterial carpet of some kind. 

90
00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:07,490
let's write some via phones of extreme , useful , but they protect 早上的那一天，we have buy a films along with example , and some by a films are a pain to deal with likelihoods that grow on the bottom of shapes . 

91
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,620
Now , this great african leaders to collect so much other debris . 

92
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:37,239
If we could identify a communication channel in the territorial regime , which is selected to a particular buyer film that we don't want , we might be able to broadcast a set of frequencies to it in a way that confuses it makes you think practice time and move on . 

93
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:40,335
And it shouldn't continue to form a film there . 

94
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:41,220
That's one of. 

95
00:14:41,610 --> 00:15:00,029
Yeah , well , I just say the and fascinated by this idea of imagining is that there could be not knowing , but there could be a kind of whole world of electronic magnetic communication in account of the cellular and go wrong that we certainly have been . 

96
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:10,060
You know , blindness for , for not actually asking the question by asking the question is , then we'll know what to look for , but it will know what was signals to seek and. 

97
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:18,070
Picking up on that , I do like to remind everyone that we all thought the earth was flat for very long time , until we started looking more carefully . 

98
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:26,750
So I am a great believer in the fact that we've been doing science for a few hundred years , and the stone will follow up. 

99
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:35,040
Well , and so that reminds me of another thing that you said , I , this might have been at a dark conference called the sixty , which was in celebration of sixty . 

100
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:44,100
And of course , you might have been somewhere else , but you said that you're looking for a late matter interactions that we have missed , and certainly that's kind of that is what we were talking about radio . 

101
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,760
But outside of that program , where else does that stick to play on your programs? 

102
00:15:51,330 --> 00:16:26,512
What is there a few , for example , in the end of the program , coal nationwide matter , niceness is supposed to improve intellectuals that we might have missed or not really pretty much we're seeing the materials we'd have a reflective index close to zero , and that's kind of because free space vacuum air has a reflective index , one in the visible glass . 

103
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:37,470
But I like looking through my , haven't reflective in the one point , three , one point five that we can make a material that has a reflective index . 

104
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,630
It's close to zero . 

105
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,920
And what does that mean ? 

106
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,744
What is going to reflect the flag lie in a very unusual way . 

107
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:57,420
But we're finding that by looking more deeply at models for those interactions with the material , having those properties , these materials have very large northern areas . 

108
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,790
What does that mean ? 

109
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:16,012
That means if I illuminate the material with frequency , FImight generally frequencies two f or three f , it would generate higher or lower frequencies , depending on how I do it . 

110
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:29,033
But this causes a very important , for example , of a nightmare for a night convert employed wavelength to visible wavelengths to help even on driving sea battery night . 

111
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:43,860
This is a material now because of its structure and thanksgiving me , a much more efficient way of doing that than i've been able to so far with existing night vision technology . 

112
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,840
Oh , that's just one example of. 

113
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:59,428
In that one example that you also addressing an another question that I had , which is explaining how , you know , your kind of thinking you , which is to say how to slide and had a lot matter when you write . 

114
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:08,873
How is it that asking questions like that , and developing programs based on that idea , has that related the dark ambition , you know , of furthering national security . 

115
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:18,469
And as actually , you put it , also , at some point that you're trying to avoid a spanish like surprise based on electronic photographic phenomenon . 

116
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:25,770
So you did point directly to the possibility to wanna shake me one more , because you used to have a couple more ready to end. 

117
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:35,900
Yeah , well , the young different scientist office has a mission priorities for the agency . 

118
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,390
And one of them is anticipating surprise . 

119
00:18:38,960 --> 00:19:02,890
So whenever one comes across some interesting new phenomenon , physics and all electronic magnetic phenomenon is tempting to think about whether there could be a new capability buried in the that could provide the pound of defence has some new capability . 

120
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:13,510
Or is it worth investigating to see whether there is actually nothing there , nothing of any consequences , least for the next ten , twenty , thirty years . 

121
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,135
So we will not be surprised by new technology based on this phenomenon . 

122
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:52,734
So a lot of what we do is to investigate as rigorously as we can , these ideas either to see if there is a new capability for national security , or if it's really to be afraid of from nephew story , pursuing this work as long as we can tell , i'm so , you know , one example that has popped up a lot in the last ten years is all that different mechanisms for proportion that we've overlooked . 

123
00:19:52,734 --> 00:20:07,877
It might be electronic , magnetic nature that might enable proportion for sample in space , but without fuel , without physically having to have fuel on board . 

124
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:17,786
Some ideas have been floated to this based on electronic magnetic interactions with structured materials , with residents . 

125
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:26,630
Structures are committed materials or with , well , the pennsylvania might be strongly non reciprocal . 

126
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,100
Meanwhile , we got one way through it , but not the other way . 

127
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:51,545
And this , some sort of foundational math associated with consuming theory , which says that there are these fluctuations in space of electric fields and magnetic fields , a consequence of quantum theory that these fluctuations occur . 

128
00:20:51,545 --> 00:21:21,689
And I have a certain energy associated with now that energy dancing is not something we normally think we can take into , but we cannot rule out entirely whether one of these strongly non reciprocal structures might be able to be reflected just by its sitting learning space , immersed in these naturally occurring background fluctuations . 

129
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:28,360
It's probably highly , unlike we cannot look at this a bit more carefully , just in case. 

130
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:36,047
Right , and it's just one interject that I believe what you are talking about here is the focus of your quest program . 

131
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:49,590
One of the ways I heard that program described which fascinates me , is in some ways , is investigating the possibility of accessing or interacting in some way energies that are also set with the back government. 

132
00:21:49,620 --> 00:22:05,644
Space , yes , I think the usual moment even say a common sense view of it is that if you are already at the bottom of a while , you probably cannot go any lower . 

133
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:14,360
And this energy background , the contemporary says very most in , it's a sort of lowest energy state is the ground state . 

134
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:34,710
So how could we can we learn to somehow dip into it or serve across it , or manage it in a way that we could extract the management temporarily and put it back , or extracts a moment of first temporary , uh , it's a challenging problem . 

135
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,990
It's a question that's come up many times over the years . 

136
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,570
I would say that the time is right now . 

137
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:53,062
Well , we can make structures that , and we can do very exclusive experiments in terms of measuring threats . 

138
00:22:53,062 --> 00:22:57,570
We have more drawn theoretical models of these phenomenon . 

139
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:15,278
So the time seeing right to see if we could investigate more thoroughly this possibility , if we find in eighteen months time is really hope of getting any significant energy from this mechanism . 

140
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:26,680
So beyond , we've learned something simple to know whether our adversaries with their pursuing similar of of inquiry . 

141
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,210
I can hit the same. 

142
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:46,903
Great , well , and what was the account of to pursue with the reasoning , he said , chance that it could ultimately be realized because one of the greatest burdens to bear right in the space enterprises , holding teenagers of fuel through the atmosphere and into orbit and beyond . 

143
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:58,390
So if there is some authority of doing that nicely , in a sense , looking at this , being in the space where the space itself could become part of the mechanism of proportion . 

144
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,930
Well , really nice to know that is possible. 

145
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:12,380
It wouldn't a nearly adopt program ended a few years ago , looked at how nanos rubbish services can manage this energy . 

146
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:26,100
This fact , you managed dancing and by management , I mean , make it very specially across the surface so that is possible , attractive and repulsive . 

147
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,850
Forces nearly surfaces . 

148
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,540
These are called cosmic forces . 

149
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:53,952
We have some young faculty of all right now , looking at how these forces never surface may be sufficient to change tonight , energy levels and lead to different spectrum , scrappy signatures from items just by being closed to the services . 

150
00:24:53,952 --> 00:25:19,210
So if we can understand the forces interacted with matter and are shaped by the presence of matter , we may understand whether we can extract and exploit the energy associated with this phenomenon in some usual way , and that's what the program quest is designed to do . 

151
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,700
We're going to look more carefully what possibilities are to do. 

152
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,850
June thirtieth is your last day of a graduate . 

153
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:35,494
I forgot four years program manager and nuclear spokeswoman , average , ten year four program managers involved a lot of turnover by design at DARPA . 

154
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:45,020
Some just wondering you , as you finish your tenure here , what you've learned about the dark culture , and yeah , where it fits in kind of the innovation ecosystem. 

155
00:25:45,280 --> 00:26:11,800
What a sunny , very innovative place , and it's packed for the very bright , dedicated , and i've been overwhelmed by the college alleged respect , the sense of responsibility , strong sense of belonging to this agency to doubt it really is a wonderful place to work , and the responsibility everyone feels is the . 

156
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:22,350
This is taxpayers money being used to try to anticipate , surprise , come up with a new capabilities . 

157
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,980
So we restructure our programs in a way . 

158
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:34,340
But as you step forward through them , months by months , phase , by faith , we always want to fail . 

159
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:43,140
We're learning something a value of towards that poor , the mission of making , making the country a satisfactory place . 

160
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:57,810
So i've really been humbled , trooping the colleagues , and we might know we have service cheap follows to come , and we have our sites where we , we meet with soldiers . 

161
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,120
Amen , and we listen to do what's bothering them . 

162
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,400
What's what they say is their highest priorities . 

163
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:22,910
And we tried all of this perspective , we get from being adopted into trying to shape , design , plan and manage a program that the is truly beneficial to to our own fighters. 

164
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,816
Well , said , thank you for pursuing all of that . 

165
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:26,678
It , it also did . 

166
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:37,880
This makes me one as one following question in the sort of the end of tenured kind of sad questions , which is you had all these programs , you know , a good handful of programs , programs . 

167
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:46,400
This means that you have been working with a probably a large number of research groups over the years . 

168
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:55,360
And I just wanted to do anything particularly memorable , surprising our opinion to know that that do you think listeners might find interesting months of those interactions and. 

169
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:06,130
I think there is something special about the upper in the eyes of our performance , as well as I was fortunate enough to work the agency . 

170
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:35,940
I think that rapid turn over that since we can see the way well organized structure of the doctor has makes performers feel that they are engaged in something special when I get funded , and I want to give it , and I, Ido see a lot of performers who put in really a lot of extra effort to make those deadlines keep us informed style on track . 

171
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:54,413
I understand that we are using an arrangement with them where these program managers were in regular content , and we've been involved months by months , quarter by quarter , with , with what they are doing , and they don't want to disappoint . 

172
00:28:54,413 --> 00:29:02,480
I , the program has a goal , and the goal was approved for good reason , because , because it's addressing some needs . 

173
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,990
But they are , they? 

174
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:26,398
Hence , why is it interesting that you mention kind of that mission oriented , goal oriented , it is kind of research is supposed to maybe what we might think of this as curiosity driven coming out of the year , the great , endless frontier model science , postwar or two , I do find a dynamic at dark , absolutely fascinating where there is this big goal . 

175
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:33,400
There is a big missioner's , potentially large payout , and becomes this wonderful collaboration between program managers like you . 

176
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,050
And as you say , the performers that work on your programs. 

177
00:29:36,100 --> 00:30:10,180
The payment of a risk project , and as as we discussed earlier , pursuing a research project based on an idea that there could be something a value if the idea is correct , it is great , but an idea represents foreseeable threats if it's correct , but we establish that the idea was bad was wrong , that we get negative results is also extremely valuable . 

178
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:28,720
It's important to know what doesn't work , and this is something which , in academia is a private industry , I guess not acquired such high value , but for us to know what doesn't work is just as important . 

179
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:36,650
And this is a different mine set , especially to explain to performers that we just want to know . 

180
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,670
We want to the best signs , the best engineering we just want to know . 

181
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,251
Does this phenomenon occur ? 

182
00:30:43,251 --> 00:30:44,966
Does this this idea correct ? 

183
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:46,967
Does this theory predict eggs ? 

184
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:52,400
And if it doesn't ask , fine too , because we've learned something as well . 

185
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,550
That's very important , right in this world. 

186
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,670
A negative result has nothing to do with failure . 

187
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:02,600
It's actually a success , because it helps us understand the landscape of what is possible . 

188
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,730
Precisely , that's exactly right . 

189
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:09,620
Yes , okay , my glass question , you leave in garbage with next. 

190
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,820
Well , I have a couple of projects that i've got hooked by . 

191
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:35,470
So I will go back to the university for some of the time I will go back to the teaching focus on one of them , but some are exploring a possibility to stay up in the DCarea and work on one of the others with the , with the government lab . 

192
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,809
So nothing's completely firm yet , but it's moving in that direction . 

193
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:47,110
So i'm hoping to have the best and continue to work on some of these projects slide . 

194
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,900
I felt very compelling and could have some significant impact. 

195
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:58,200
In the near future , well , I just wanted to thank you for your four years or so of service as a program manager . 

196
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:07,320
Or , but may you have the best suppose world's may have a great next professional adventure , and I just want to thank you for spending the time with. 

197
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,490
But thank you . 

198
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,890
Algorithms , it's been a pleasure , and I appreciate you asking me to do. 

199
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:13,590
Thank you . 

200
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,720
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us . 

201
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:26,220
I hope you join this again for the next Voices from dark thanks also to bend silent for his partnership in producing this program .
