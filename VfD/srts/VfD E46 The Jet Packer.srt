00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,740
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight with operation . 

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:32,540
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt that offends advanced research has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,040
Welcome to Voices from DARPA . 

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,820
A window until dark is core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,230
My name is ivan a motto . 

6
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,120
And I am your doctor host today . 

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:01:02,060
I am pleased to be talking with alexander wallen , a program manager since twenty seventeen in the technical technology , obviously , we are recording our conversations from our respective locations to comply with company restrictions , because we are not in a recording studio . 

8
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,970
You might hear everything , sounds like traffic and birds . 

9
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:48,050
And as it so happens , insect noises from this year's brood of seventeen years occasions , which are just everywhere here in my location , alzheimer's agenda , as he is more often known , brought it up , but his interests in developing and demonstrating advanced aircraft , rapid design and prototyping for moving concepts as quickly as possible to operational practicality are also parts of his modest surrounding zenda has had his hands on the challenge of a vertical landing and take off or vital technology and demos of later than aircraft are capable of being navigable and having extended flight at stratospheric altitudes of eleven twelve miles and above that , we have a lot of time . 

10
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:56,630
His main programmatic focus today is with the program known as queen , short for control of revolutionary aircraft , with novel effects . 

11
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:11,090
Before joining japan's team of program managers , zander searched for twenty two years as an officer in the air force , beginning a nineteen ninety five and stretching all the way to twenty seventeen when he began his diaper years just before joining garbage . 

12
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:19,502
Peter is the program manager at the research library , oversaw bright technology portfolio over seventy projects designed for transition to the war fighter . 

13
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:32,130
He also helped positions in the f thirty five joint program office and the combined joint task force parliament , which between two thousand and five and twenty thirteen , helped manage the threat of improvised explosive devices in the war in afghanistan . 

14
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:43,900
He also worked in the office of the assistant secretary of the air force for , and that he will tell you later , he has had quite the adventurer and getting close up looks at aircraft of other nations , including china . 

15
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,136
Zenda , has four degrees . 

16
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:54,030
Three of them are in ironic engineering , including a doctor of engineering degree from george washington university . 

17
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,680
His first degree is an NBA from the university of massachusetts . 

18
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,220
One more thing , zander is a new father with a ten week old baby girl , alexander valley , though I shall call you zander from here on out . 

19
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,010
Thank you for joining me in this discussion and a huge congratulations on your new baby gear . 

20
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,397
Well , thank you very much . 

21
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:16,226
It's great via the end before we talk about your technology development work at the dark . 

22
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:21,860
But I would like to get some sense of how you became the sort of person ends up as a program manager . 

23
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:35,917
I can tell from your three aeronautical engineering degrees that flying technologies were on your mind by the time you are under graduate of the university and soda , what can you tell me about the influences in your a weather at home or at school ? 

24
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,860
And I just think you had met towards that LED to the interest. 

25
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,500
Well , thank you that a degree question . 

26
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,120
I think I combine this by my father . 

27
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:58,470
So growing up every year , my father's pilots and my three sisters and my brother and the car , when we go to the chicago air and water show and watch the blue angels of thunder bird and watch all the airplanes . 

28
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,280
My lesson about the time I was in faith , greater and beyond the only gifts I wanted for christmas on my birthday . 

29
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,680
War in cycle , pedia is a military airplanes , so I have always been interested in flight . 

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,930
My family to take me to go watch the world's land at the local air power when they do fly over the air shows . 

31
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:26,890
And so I really inherited from him a lot of their planes as I graduated high school in the college , I knew I wanted to be an engineer . 

32
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,330
And so I just put those two together and starting aircraft and flag in that sort of thing sense. 

33
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,169
Now you're doing your education . 

34
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,350
You also added in a masters in business administration . 

35
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,260
I'm assuming that this is a clue to what you can have had in mind for the wrong holidays , and what you want to do professionally. 

36
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:54,633
As a young officer near force of managing road to be small programs , and I noticed my counterparts and industry , I was always interested in the technology . 

37
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:59,980
But there are all these other concerns that had managed budgets that manage people they had worry about . 

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,505
And so I actually wanted to understand that side of the business side of it of running a program . 

39
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:13,654
And so I started my NBA and find out a lot of finance about the accounting aspect study economics , my spare time . 

40
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:13,854
now . 

41
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:28,449
So I got into an initially understanding the other side of the table as I was married in programs , and then turned out that I love that part of it as well , and I think it helped inform higher craft programs to the contractor , understanding of what the contract are on . 

42
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,140
What my counterpart in industry has to deal with above and beyond just the technology challenges. 

43
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,930
When I saw that you had the NBAdegree with thinking , well , you know , that has got to be really hopeful in your world . 

44
00:05:39,930 --> 00:06:03,684
Adopt , because in sort of best , i've got no program managers and what that role is emitted is like you're running in a corporate energy of full fledged corporately , where the kinds of issues of just running businesses and staying on budget , and all of the logistics of that are particularly , it's not just finding people who do cool technology , but it's also managing all that . 

45
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:08,290
So the NBA just seems like a perfect addition to the technical training. 

46
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:18,580
I think it is , and also thinks like market research and marketing now is one thing to , I have a great idea , but developers sell it and get people excited about it and market research . 

47
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:31,102
Understanding what else is going on and how you fit into a new weapon or a interesting piece technology to lose the type of things that I strive to learn , as well as the UMS. 

48
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:34,950
And I think i've tried to cooperate that background projects. 

49
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,700
So now let's move to your dark adventure . 

50
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,240
And I always love to hear the how I got to double a story . 

51
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,540
I guess that of almost all of the program managers that have spoken with for this particle . 

52
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,560
So let me ask you mean that you seek out a job , a doctor , did someone a doctor seek ? 

53
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,020
You will have to get here. 

54
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,000
So little bit of boats . 

55
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,526
So when I returned from afghanistan in two thousand and nine , it spent ten months corner influences opposed the device work . 

56
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:05,971
We are feeling new technology with long hours with tiring . 

57
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:15,772
It was exciting , and it went back to my old job in the penalty after about a month and went to my boss and said , this job is a learn easier than I remember . 

58
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,339
Do you have anything tougher ? 

59
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,824
And he just got a call from double looking for a deputy program manager , and so I set up an interview . 

60
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:26,350
And it turns out that david interviews there was a snowstorm . 

61
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,630
I have to leave six blocks away from dark at the time . 

62
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,950
So I watched six plus in a snowstorm to do an interview with the TTOoffice director . 

63
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:50,115
And at the time it was , I was in interviewer for , but I was excited , and so I ended up being a deputy program manager for two years at the dark of duty transition when the work's mother for assignments finished on my career . 

64
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:53,180
But from that point four , I knew that we want to come back . 

65
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:59,750
So I had the opportunity to reach , in a view as a civilian and get higher line in twenty seventeen after my first dynamic. 

66
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,740
Thanks for letting me know about that entry and into the agency . 

67
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,930
Love the detail with the snowstorm . 

68
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,620
So in twenty seventeen , as you just said , you joined darkness . 

69
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:19,630
Tactical technology of now , more than any office that offers developed technologies that move in a way around the ground and see in the air space . 

70
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,100
And in one of the now completed programs you work on . 

71
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,290
So let's talk about the past a little bit first before we talk about cream . 

72
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:41,288
You can't program that wants coffee adaptable later than aircraft program or autumn , and it did get some attention at twenty nine team when people across the country war crawling their necks , it and reporting strange white dots high overhead . 

73
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:56,360
The agency posted on facebook in late june of that year , twenty one thousand nine hundred and three test balloons have been to navigate from eastern cross country beginning cabinet maryland , and then ended with safe landings in northern california . 

74
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:15,730
So can you prefer to explain the technology you need that altered was designed to meet and and tell me what you can't about what is achieved in the autumn , piling questions , and you are also interested what you were thinking when mere reports were coming in from around the country about these sightings . 

75
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:22,700
Weight , let's start actually with what the program you know , was about , and what technology needs , you would hope it would deliver . 

76
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,870
And then what is it sad is now? 

77
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,800
Right to these variety of programming , I was , I was lucky enough to inherit that . 

78
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,790
So previous program manager has started that . 

79
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:40,193
And as what is the deputy for a few months and took their program over and what we are trying to do , there is doing a low cost strategic vehicle . 

80
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:47,706
So strategist theoretically , above sixty thousand feet , there are big advantages of you going to get a flying vehicle up there . 

81
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,940
Commercial airliners don't fly up there . 

82
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:56,340
And as he gave from sixty to seventy nine thousand feet , you get a good to view a lot of the earth from up there . 

83
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,820
So it , we call them suitor , satellites or suitor . 

84
00:09:59,820 --> 00:09:59,930
late. 

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,840
This , for context , were , were probably talking here eleven , twelve miles and above , right? 

86
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,050
Absolutely , yes , until the air is very thin upturn it , you build . 

87
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:26,310
These are lighter than their vehicles , almost more like a spacecraft , and you do an aircraft is there is , i'm so for a low cost in the occasion , processing , navigation and timing and a low cost of surveillance platform that was very appealing to the military . 

88
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:35,890
So we , we did this program , and we actually did a test flight about a year before that that graduates , an exercise or full cross country for that flight . 

89
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,410
We flew out of utah smaller port enough . 

90
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:53,633
The volunteer going to laugh , and we are taking pictures , and we began to notice that the brand and we appear and disappear based on the song , and there are very large vehicles , hundreds of feet across , but they're very far away . 

91
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,066
So it's very disorienting . 

92
00:10:55,066 --> 00:11:03,390
And the copy engineers and I looked at each other and said , dramatically , think that you , so we sort of suspect those gonna happen . 

93
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,910
So we were very trying to be very forthcoming . 

94
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,840
We , we felt with the FA. 

95
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,910
We did social media post thing we're gonna do . 

96
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,313
And the really , the only bet was how far across the country wouldn't get before the first you are so excited . 

97
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:21,446
I think we made it on the way that they know how before we get our first . 

98
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:31,990
You'll so , so that was fun , but we actually participate in with the army , and that we are ground units to communication exercises while we are gone over the us . 

99
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,333
And we are specific points we are navigating from a military technology . 

100
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:44,640
I think we demonstrate a very low cost , reactive way to sort of supplement satellites and build a local network on western world world . 

101
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,580
And you believe the flag constellation from one cotton it across . 

102
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,970
So I think we are very successful in , and I know about the army in the navy to have activities that are building on our success and. 

103
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,410
Great , so some chance of early degree of transition to potential and universe users . 

104
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,860
That's always the trophy that dropped ones with its programs . 

105
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:14,640
I wanted to well out just a bit more , because there is one very cool aspect of the , the technology that just wanted to hear a little bit more about . 

106
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,420
That's just the navigation aspect , because of I recall one way that you achieve . 

107
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:31,970
Navigation is by changing the of the balloons in order to take advantage of a university of different air currents and conditions at different attitudes . 

108
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,120
And I write about that , and if so , just tell us a little bit more headache. 

109
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:46,237
Yes , of the fundamental theory of why you can navigate with these balloons that the winds in the strategic fear are a very catholic and turbulent . 

110
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:48,552
And so winds going one direction . 

111
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:53,706
And at a few thousand fear bowler below , the letter began the other direction . 

112
00:12:53,706 --> 00:13:00,660
And so you know what they're doing , you can kind of you can change out to by moving , basically pumping air under the balloon . 

113
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,300
And it , you can make it go up or down . 

114
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,680
And we got zero mass because we are not actually changing . 

115
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,170
The massive vehicle were bringing iran or venting it off . 

116
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,290
And then the couple memory piece of advantage where you want to know the window . 

117
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,900
So we are . 

118
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:24,360
She also a windsor of sensor , the user laser actually measures the molecule movement of the air at seventy five thousand feet above the . 

119
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,656
And to do that , we took a piece of technology that NASA demonstrated that way . 

120
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:36,828
About fifteen hundred pounds and research for dinner or table and shrunk it down to something about the size of a coffee can await fifty pounds . 

121
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:51,460
And we demonstrated a low power satellite thief , lazier to connect three measure wins at three , five thousand feet and above , and the direction that you wanted to figure out if you wanted to assign to send , depending which direction you want to go. 

122
00:13:51,550 --> 00:14:01,531
Well , it's amazing to think about the vehicle that says that can remove her up and down in the atmosphere column to take advantage of different wind conditions as they , it's really , truly amazing . 

123
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,501
Now , let's move onto another program . 

124
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:13,390
You had worked on this one that had the goal of delivering an aircraft prototype capable of vehicle that is worker takeoff and landing , like it has never been done before . 

125
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,160
They know what were you hoping to achieve this program? 

126
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,721
Great question . 

127
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:40,074
So we actually had a program called vital eggs or lightning strike that was supposed to be a high speed vertical take off learning aircraft and by high speed three hundred and three hundred and fifty nine , which is about one hundred and fifty , if it is not faster than a helicopter or something like AVtwenty two top roller at the end of the day , that program ended up not going to fly . 

128
00:14:40,074 --> 00:15:13,798
We ran into the challenges with electoral higher proportion and an enlightener that actually got a lot of active investment in both commercial government said , I think we , we advanced it to allow you a fair amount of that program , but that's a , that's a great example of a program that didn't end up complaining international media machine , but we actually discovered where the technology needed to events , and we spend the and work with industry to , to push some of the generator technology and some of the , some of the underlying technology that would enable that kind of aircraft in the future . 

129
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:32,660
So , so we continue to work with folks and support the air force in their journey , prime and ever , but high speed fixed wing combines all the attributes like a helicopter , the efficiency of a traditional aircraft , and that's still something that there is altha to go do . 

130
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:42,360
And so we advanced some of the technology , but a legendary was still most of our configuration of what technologies have to mature before already for leaving capability. 

131
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,100
Right , and you know what I love to buy your description . 

132
00:15:45,100 --> 00:16:11,520
There was that it really is touch upon one of the signature aspects of the dark , but model , which is to take on extremely challenging a technology problems with the hope , you know , that you actually will get to the technology , finish line the generation ahead of time , but also with the understanding that if you don't , you learn all along the way that there is a value to that , and that helps you point in the direction or point away from what others be . 

133
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,150
That is so that in the end , it helps to work in accelerate a technology vision to to a good finish line . 

134
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:27,550
Let me know there when on your current program , queen , control of revolutionary aircraft with novel effectives . 

135
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,080
In july , the agency and asked the first three words in the program . 

136
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,950
And i'm gonna , let you talk about what I think . 

137
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:44,040
In short , the idea is a ploy was called active flow control , such that one can seal an aircraft without the need of movable services . 

138
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,750
Tell us the story of the queen program , the problem , need or capability that you invasion it will address . 

139
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,180
And what is the set of the program? 

140
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:02,324
When I was starting the cream program and installing it through my leadership , I used the example of an episode five versus award award aircraft . 

141
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:08,756
And I said he took an error in automatic engineer from one thousand nine hundred and forty and seventy five . 

142
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:19,732
He could do all the equations and tell you how to how far the move detail left , right , the rotters , how we control aeroplanes are not fundamentally changed in over one hundred years . 

143
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:26,180
Now that engineer from nineteen fourteen would have no idea how the challenge and work you were understand , right , are in their . 

144
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:36,298
But fundamentally , we are still designing airplanes the same way we did one hundred years ago , and that's by moving little bit of air foil open down or left and right , and that works pretty well . 

145
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,050
But what you find is from a design . 

146
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,178
It really limits your imagination . 

147
00:17:40,178 --> 00:18:10,400
And and so what we wanted to do with crane was take a technology in this case at the flow control , just basically blowing little bit of air over the wind as strategic locations , and that technology between the wire , but in wind tunnels and bring an academy for over thirty years , we wanted to create program that the aircraft designers to think differently and to work on the tools and the methodology to develop new and other ideas and give them the time space to do that . 

148
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,640
And so that's what we try to do on crane is , is really given the designers the freedom to think outside the box . 

149
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:26,280
And in one of the ways we did that , as we specifically said at the beginning of the program , don't come to us with an idea what they are planned look like . 

150
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:37,870
We've been the first year doing experiments doing when tunnels doing high power computing , we want to examine in dozens of different ideas , and then , as a group , decide what's the most compelling . 

151
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,961
Dama , what should the airplane look like ? 

152
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,242
And I , that was unusual . 

153
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,906
I had a bit of my leadership to give me more time of friend . 

154
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:50,294
And I said , if we go slow in the beginning , we'll get in much better product , middle faster . 

155
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:50,510
the. 

156
00:18:50,550 --> 00:19:06,720
Zenda , so you are really just getting these programs momentum going , and it sounds like it said , the first years can be really gathering IDyes , then bring the teams together , performers together to think about what would be the good next steps it takes . 

157
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,950
But as you just sort of game out , the entire program is dramatically what you expect will happen , how to learn for. 

158
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,400
Right , let us get a great question . 

159
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:48,831
So what about a year in the program that we're eleven months , and we've had three contractors who have started with over dozen different ideas and concepts of water prices should look like we have spent for last to eleven months doing winter and testing to on high park computing , building brand new tools , and in kind of working as a team to develop this new revolutionary concept of over the next month or so , we're going to start downstairs selecting to one or two ideas , and those who were going from what we are crawling , which we call face zero interface one . 

160
00:19:48,831 --> 00:20:02,150
And that is what will actually do the off the flying air vehicle will start doing , drawing your identify subsidies , and then you start to get an idea really of what is your look like , and what demonstrated . 

161
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,320
And the things were going to demonstrate us . 

162
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,330
We think , with this technology , we can make our plans to lighter . 

163
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:23,996
We can potentially do new interesting and manufacturers , and that we can be changed the way we design them and the way they look , but we can actually show improvements and weight and range and take off capability by thinking outside the box and applying this new technology . 

164
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,310
And so what will do that ? 

165
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:30,112
And then , from there were plenty downstairs , single airplane , and they will do that detail . 

166
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:39,090
Design will start construction , and then in three to four years , we actually have flying prototype out of flying in demonstrating some these breathers. 

167
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:48,854
Yeah , you know , this is also reminding me a little bit of hydrodynamics may be air dynamics in nature a little bit , you know of thinking of things like the like sharks . 

168
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:56,100
Can I do that has these little denticles , you know , which are all the best throwing eddie flows and turbulence in a sort of thing . 

169
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,900
It makes the shark much more efficient . 

170
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,580
Swimmer , biological analogies that some of your performers are bringing into the next. 

171
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:11,230
Yeah , so that's really interesting , because that's one of the one of the things you find earlier on is early in aviation . 

172
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,022
We try to mimic birds . 

173
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:30,003
And it was until the right brother's basically broke out proportion suffered from lift that we are able to keep flight and then over the best hundred years where we found is that the projects , you know what they're doing , because they , they can very small changes to the wings , especially storing bird . 

174
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:32,352
We've ever watched hawker eagle . 

175
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,178
It are very slight changes . 

176
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:47,800
They can begin to great removals with very , and so we have actually got some concepts that sort of borrow , that idea that that , rather than brute force , you're using big pieces of metal moving up . 

177
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,296
But if you effectively just change the way the error appears , you'll make little changes . 

178
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,732
The error you can , you can remove . 

179
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,168
And what I call more elegant manner . 

180
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:18,820
And so it's go from where we started trying to mimic birds to actually getting back to worry about the technology that computing resources actually model how to do that , because it is much more challenging when you try to try to do that , anyone would think , but there are really energies to the way nature is above that the wrong and how actually be able to sort of. 

181
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,619
Okay , just a couple of more questions , and then I will bring our discussion as it were in for lending . 

182
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,681
Forgive me with that . 

183
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:30,209
I'm asked to sort of imagining little , and they're forgiving me for that too . 

184
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:38,089
But several decades ago , and you're going to do , these are shows , and you probably screaming things like , well , that's cool to your dad . 

185
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:40,278
And now here you are a dark or manager . 

186
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:42,030
I'm in a seriously cool tech . 

187
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:52,410
She obviously thinks it could have some value in the context of defence , but in a serious idea of a new way of producing or creating navigation . 

188
00:22:52,410 --> 00:23:07,210
And but when you allow yourself to sort of imagine the coolest technologies that you dreamt about , even if they're not double related with what comes to mind , like what kind of error and article technologies have you dropped ? 

189
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,590
You wish could be so , but not. 

190
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,808
For me personally , the most exciting thing out there , the thing that we've all been promised are where our jet packs rate . 

191
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:26,820
And so we actually did a good approval , and we have a small business initiative to look at it will be called battlefield personal mobility . 

192
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:36,520
So the idea is , if I am a soldier , and I want to move five or ten miles is a way I can do that without being and point to point to the air . 

193
00:23:36,900 --> 00:24:05,409
And so we're gonna do several smaller words to look at some innovative things to include quiet paragraphers , personal level , helicopters and potentially some version of jet packs in a military context to say , if I need to move five or ten miles , can soldiers get off the road to get a get away from large vehicles and move around freely , so that sort of a really exciting thing and innocent technology . 

194
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:08,871
Let's just now emerging that might make that more practical . 

195
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,170
We got a lot of work . 

196
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,730
Batteries regard the rebecca is now quite capital or drowned . 

197
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:23,280
Yellow things can scale up , potentially to be something that men portable and transport , so still not there . 

198
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:31,520
But I think if you can do the personal mobility where you basically carry your own little vehicle and are able to move around five or ten miles . 

199
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,230
I think that it's a really exciting kind of opportunity to be. 

200
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,970
Well , that gets it just well for me , because you know , the jet pack comes up even in a lot of correspondence with dark . 

201
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,740
But let's start like , okay , you can do it . 

202
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,600
You can do it . 

203
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,040
What about the jet pack ? 

204
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:54,540
So as entrepreneur helping to deliver the jet pack , I think your name will go down quite well in the history of dark a party , the history of technology of general . 

205
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:00,545
So may you succeed in helping to deliver the jet pack , shifting direction just a bit . 

206
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:11,080
I'd like to ask you to reflect on your experience as a dark program manager in a place of darker , which is so notable in the overall innovation ecosystem . 

207
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:27,260
And this is kind of an interesting time to ask the question , because there is just tons and tons of discussion , both domestically and in other countries , about trying to emulate dolphin , whether it's an immune energy and intelligence , they are already even in the permanent transportation . 

208
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:33,180
There is a proposal now to create a transportation eccentric arab event research project agency . 

209
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:43,930
So i'm just wondering your opinion , what are some of the institutional and cultural characteristics of that you , we'll be most challenging for others to emulate , replicate. 

210
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:55,490
I am working that i've had the opportunity or adopt work a couple of projects with foreign governments on funding nations who are talking about sending throne garbage . 

211
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:17,750
And they often ask the same elizabeth two things , at least that i've seen that are that are really enabling and motivating the first as poor managers , we know , are a short time when it , typically two to five years , we have to start a project in and get moving in and really do do exciting work . 

212
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,700
And then after that , we're going to be basically thinking , have to go find another job in a summer on comment . 

213
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:32,940
And so what that means is one you very motivated to take an idea or find it , and make sure you really ready to go , and you can execute in the time fashion . 

214
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,640
And the second thing is to more complicated project , and it's going to take a little blanker . 

215
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:50,095
You really are motivated to to make sure that it turns out footing because the person coming next week behind you to take that program over may not love it as much as you love it right to the gatsby is gonna be compelling and scattered . 

216
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:57,100
Besides a technically the method to release in the second , I think , enabled and seeing the dark it does is one out of free the face . 

217
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:04,526
Well , I was not afraid to basically stop program weight , weight through and say , you know what this was harder than we thought . 

218
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:10,130
Let's take a step back , and when I stop doing this , maybe think about a better way to do it . 

219
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,130
And I think we do that in TTOAfair amount of wealth , our big successes . 

220
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:34,035
And so we're willing to to invest in things that that we think are disruptive and wealth willing to take changes that mean that panel , and that's a lot easier said than done and being willing to fail , and knowing that you will be looked as a failure if the program runs in the technology issues that is success . 

221
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:37,140
That you've discovered a new technology , road work. 

222
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:58,640
Thanks for sharing some of your insights and observations about the innovation culture at DARPA , especially like the way to describe the positive value of the agency EX from , you know , both delivering an original technology vision , but also from discovering road blocks that still must be overcome , you know , to reach the finish line . 

223
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,190
So very cool about that . 

224
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,580
And now , before we do close , I do monitor . 

225
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,590
Just we visit a little bit your air force korea before coming to durban . 

226
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,230
Can you share a little more about? 

227
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,660
Sure , I was in your first officer for twenty two years , primarily engineering focused . 

228
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,830
I had a relevant opportunity as my first assignment . 

229
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,410
I was sent to the national air and space intelligence center . 

230
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,324
And where's a chinese fighter aircraft hour ? 

231
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:52,500
So I got to look at four new aircraft and try to deduce their capabilities and have the opportunity as secondary tenant to attend the first error , chinese public aerial and nineteen ninety six , and that's received a deal that I let you know before I love their planes , and so I got it to look at four aircraft , and they move over and worked at one seventeen . 

232
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:02,320
B two has the opportunity to die during electronics when we lost in the first seventeen got to participate and figure out why that happened and how to avoid . 

233
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:31,648
Since that had the opportunity work on a lot of fixed rain aircraft , some special mission things , and one of the things I think , therefore , is really offered in an opportunity is , I got a new job every three or four years , and I got to take new challenges and work a variety of programs in a variety of the and try to take all of that background , knowledge and pilot into this four year to our doubt , to figure out what went well . 

234
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:37,549
It doesn't go well and where the gaps are capability , so had a great opportunity in their first day . 

235
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:45,912
They gave me a lot of opportunity every three or four years to get a brand new , challenging job , and that's when I think that exciting your bookstore poses , it's very similar . 

236
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:48,940
You got a very fixed window , you got a clear authorities . 

237
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,100
Did you take the backing of your boss near your total go ? 

238
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,090
Do something amazing. 

239
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,360
That would be a great conversation . 

240
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,930
You have taken my imagination or laughed . 

241
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,900
Thank you so much. 

242
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,790
For sharing the time with me , or it's been a pleasure , and there's a few things in life . 

243
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,070
I like talking about more than my programs or my new baby girls . 

244
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,220
Thank you for the opportunity. 

245
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:18,010
Well , the best of luck to you in your wife and raising this new life you brought into the world . 

246
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,440
And I also want to thank you listeners for learning us your ears . 

247
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,702
I hope you join it again for the next Voices from the other , thanks . 

248
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:44,550
Also , the time shortage for his partnership , introducing this program , for more information about alexander valley programs , he and his colleagues in the technical technology officer TTO, run in the many other way through technologies dark is working on visit , dark adult mill .
