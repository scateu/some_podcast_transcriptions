1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,020
Stuff technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand. 

2
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,420
Autonomous operation. 

3
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:40,280
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , DARPA , the defense advanced research projects agency , has been a driver of welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core a program managers their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,328
My name is ivan , a matter when I am your dark host , and today I am pleased to have with me in the studio . 

5
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:55,000
Lin horse , a program manager since twenty twelve in darkness , strategic technology offers with a background and physics . 

6
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,640
Lin spends a lot of this time . 

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,756
I doubt thinking about a world without the global position system , a system which is all about physics , engineering and the management of complex systems . 

8
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:22,094
And he thinks about bringing GPS functions under sea into other places where GPS signals cannot reach , in short , wednesday become one of the agencies go to guys in a technical area known as PNT, which stands for positioning , navigation . 

9
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:25,639
And thank you for your spending some time with me today . 

10
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,613
Well , thank you for inviting me . 

11
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:36,503
So before we talk about some of your efforts to develop plan b for when GPS might not be available or to create a and underestimate version of GPS . 

12
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:37,751
I just interested you . 

13
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:45,243
I want to find a little bit about you , your background , and maybe something about how that background explains how you ended up . 

14
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:45,660
Your read . 

15
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,520
Start in twenty twelve . 

16
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,560
Well , when I was growing up , I never. 

17
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,070
Thought about when I grow up , I won't be a navigation engineer . 

18
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,560
That was not something that was at the front of my mind . 

19
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:14,320
However , when I came out of grade school , my first job was a navigation flight controller for special operations , and I fell in love with the art and science of navigation , and it's been a common threat of my career ever said. 

20
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:19,475
What are an exciting entry , I mean to be working on the special program to say little bit more about that. 

21
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:34,870
But I was working on the space shuttle program that was we had GPS and saw the navigation system of the , the space shuttle used a variety of sensors to determine a vehicle was in space . 

22
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:48,560
So we are , the navigation system was primarily critical on the introduction of the mission that is when it returns from space to the learning field , but also accent and or on. 

23
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,990
One word with operations , you can . 

24
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,420
And what did you study in great school? 

25
00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:02,660
Physics and then I, Iquickly learn that theoretical physics was not my forty , but I still love physics . 

26
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,610
So I , my graduate degree was an engineering. 

27
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,770
Physics and is one of the things about your biography and sensor and interested in . 

28
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,180
This is your name , because I believe full first name is franklin . 

29
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:24,920
Cool , you go by lin , the second ceiling bowl for short , when most people who have the name franklin and shortage will go with the first of all , frank , so what's up? 

30
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,960
I think that my mother has a sense of humor . 

31
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,010
I am a junior , and she did not want to , frankly running around the house . 

32
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,940
So my father goes by frank. 

33
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:44,880
My girlfriend is so that indicates to me that there was a big dose of pregnancy in your home , and practice spilled over into where you work . 

34
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,511
So let , let us know , talk about some of your programs . 

35
00:03:48,511 --> 00:04:16,969
I think we'll start with the adaptable and navigation systems programme , as do all programs that double this one goes by the acronym , in this case , ANSwhat intrigues me about this one , but I want you to say more about it is that you are trying to tap into a huge diversity of signals here , things like signals and cell towers or TV signals that are already out there candidates in constructed environment , but also other kinds of signals in the natural environment . 

36
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:20,472
The one that just really stands out for me is lightning . 

37
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:28,620
So let me stop there , just as you to tell me and listeners a little bit about the adaptability of navigation systems program. 

38
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,640
Okay , ANSis actually a portfolio of multiple programs . 

39
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:47,420
One of those programs under NShas called aspen ASPN, which is short for all sorts , positioning , navigation , and it addresses the topic you , you are reference to . 

40
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:58,310
We like to think of it as developing a navigation , architecture and algorithm that can process what we call sensors of opportunity . 

41
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,341
That is any sensor that has special or temporary information . 

42
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:23,014
So consider an aircraft , primarily aircraft today use GPS are , and a either stand alone mode , or they will integrate a GPS receiver with what's called an initial measurement unit as basically a dead reckoning device has sensors in effort . 

43
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:26,865
That sense , accelerations and will sense rotational rates . 

44
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,851
And from that you can debt reckon . 

45
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:36,550
So the two GPS in an initial measurement unit combined for my very robust solution , but GPS sometime just not . 

46
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,330
And then that system will rely primarily on the IMU. 

47
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,984
And then let me just stop you there . 

48
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:46,550
What are the situations under which serve GPS might become unavailable? 

49
00:05:46,550 --> 00:06:04,418
For ground users , GPS can become unavailable when you are in what we call urban canyons that is dense , ordinary skyscrapers constantly , you think of downtown chicago or downtown manhattan were the buildings are obstructing the signals , especially . 

50
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:08,837
And this is on the context of maintaining very accurate navigation . 

51
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:13,566
The aircraft is specially military aircraft when they roll over , turn upside down . 

52
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:21,367
Now , the GPS santa has pointed to the ground signals are coming from the ground in case , or rely on the initial measurement unit to debt . 

53
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:25,370
Reckon until the GPS reservoirs is exposed . 

54
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:34,710
And because the GPS signal is so weak by design that it is very easy to interfere with a receivers of. 

55
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,800
That's signal , okay . 

56
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,780
So I should actually concept up the problem for us . 

57
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:44,880
And let me get you back to what you're talking about , which is to use some senses of opportunity out there to make up for the school. 

58
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:56,640
So what we recognized was that many platforms we have have centres owned them that are providing special information , but there are not being used by the navigation system . 

59
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:11,450
So the question we asked ourselves , let me come up with an algorithm and an architecture that can be rapidly reconfigured to use sensors that are already on board are platforms to navigate . 

60
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:21,770
When GPS is not available , or just as importantly , to provide redundancy and hence additional integrity to the GPS themselves. 

61
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,300
Okay , it's worth for a couple of examples of the kinds of sensing. 

62
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,710
Okay , so one , one that we have used very successfully . 

63
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:40,627
This injury , okay , consider aircraft with a camera looking at the ground with the advantage of satellite imagery . 

64
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:47,860
Think of google earth , all all those pixels and image had have an associated ladder to the launch . 

65
00:07:48,260 --> 00:08:03,120
And if we can correlate the image that is being observed by the camera on the airplane with that satellite that will be called geo registered satellite were able to determine whether aircraft is that's part of the problem . 

66
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,140
The other part of the promise . 

67
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:11,010
Now , how do I get them to my navigation system such that I can continue and navigate with that , and that's what uh the. 

68
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:21,946
Progress , that's where that you need that initial measurement unit and a sense of timing , combined with that imagery on the ground , you can then start to keep track of where you are now . 

69
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:24,400
And where are you going on , software , interesting here. 

70
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:43,830
But in for ground users , for example , we are being bombarded with radio frequency signals where we're sitting right now , but we're not using them from navigation , but they have special information in them , whether they be TV circumstances , radio signals , or if we were outside receiving many signals from satellites . 

71
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,898
And so we call those signals of opportunity . 

72
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:52,090
And we've shown that you can navigate very well with those signals , as well as well. 

73
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,470
So just drilling a little bit , and one of those signals of opportunity , white things . 

74
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,680
So how , how does that finish? 

75
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:09,760
That was a very fun signal for us when lightning strikes , it essentially lights up the entire electoral magnetic spectrum from DCto daylight and beyond . 

76
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:25,100
Researchers have shown that they're even extraordinary potential event gamely is coming out of a lightning strike christmas for a very short period of time , were talking one to several million seconds of duration in time . 

77
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:35,530
So huge positive energy that is in the spectrum that we call the very low frequency band , the elephant , which is the oil . 

78
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,540
The ten killer hurts region tender . 

79
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,560
Tony killers in general , that portion of the energy can travel around the world. 

80
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,150
It is almost like a wave guide right at between the earth and the ironic sphere , and those signals that tolerate. 

81
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,800
That is correct in the reason that's the wave guide is because it ten killer hurts . 

82
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,627
Your wave is now , oh columns . 

83
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:22,500
Okay , ten , twelve , fifteen kilometers are depending on what exactly exact frequency is , because there is only a few wave links between the yours and the bottom of the ionosphere , which is depending on the time of the around eighty coal , and you get a wave god effect , which has very low signal technologies , so the signal can be received at very high signal strength . 

84
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,540
And so the question of us , can we navigate with us ? 

85
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:37,510
So we went outside and put a violent receiver on the street , or even in in the building , you would be picking up the tens of signals . 

86
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,810
Prosecutor , the violent portion of a lightning strike is holiday spirit short for an atmosphere . 

87
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,850
That's a fairly old term , but that's what we call it . 

88
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,220
You would be receiving dozens of physics per second. 

89
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,130
Answer the questions , can you navigate with those ? 

90
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,350
This is amazing to think about navigating by lightning strikes . 

91
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,930
You have to know where those lightning strikes are in. 

92
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,070
For this tool tool correct , that is absolutely correct . 

93
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:21,830
And that is , in my opinion , one of the hardest parts of a lightning navigation system to detect those , we use a network of what we called monitoring stations or references located around the world that would geology . 

94
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,830
Those lightning strikes , yes. 

95
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,148
Right , and we've all seen . 

96
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:28,955
These are on whether reports were also shown in the lightning strikes from these. 

97
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:33,216
Many of the many universities have lightning detection networks in place . 

98
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:37,140
There are commercial products for getting that information as well. 

99
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,460
No , I have applied fascinating . 

100
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,190
So let's say the way okay to another program you are working on which was related to this one . 

101
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,430
This one is no , mercifully , in short form . 

102
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:58,890
STOIC, but directly short for the long form , a name of the program , which is a special temporal and orientation information in contested environments . 

103
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,700
But let's go with because it sees you to say , and this two is a deliverable of a backup GPS of sorts . 

104
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,817
And it involves a number of interesting sounding components that I hope we can talk about briefly to that . 

105
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:18,260
I mentioned our very low frequency signals , which we actually did touch upon already when we were talking about lightning . 

106
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:32,169
But another component here is the development of optical clocks , which rely on a quantum mechanical behaviors , and adams to keep a super accurate time and making the clocks are always a part of of these kinds of navigation systems . 

107
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:42,010
We can go deeply into the weeds on these things , but let's , let's try to talk about a little bit , gives a flavor of what stocks about and what technologies you are hoping develop to make. 

108
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,290
Okay , let's talk about the the real life component . 

109
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:52,730
First , it's interesting to note that the first global positioning system was not called GPS. 

110
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,620
It was called omega . 

111
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:10,490
It operated back in the from the early seventies through the early ninth , and it was a real life broadcast system and provide a global coverage with only eight transmits located around the world . 

112
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,310
However , it was not accurate . 

113
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:24,155
That system generally provided one tourist column levels of positioning accuracy , where , as GPS is generally below five meters . 

114
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:31,268
So the automatic system is clearly not accurate for what we now depend on today from GPS. 

115
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:49,160
So the primary challenge we have in stroke for the violent component ears , developing new models that can accurately replicate how that we all have signal , propagate from a transmit to receive . 

116
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,530
Can I suggest that we can get our accuracies to? 

117
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:02,040
Levels and and why the video left a very low , very exciting component of the full spectrum , many , many choices of frequency band steels. 

118
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:15,082
So you mentioned the wave guide effect , and we talked about the fact that the wave got a fact has significantly less signal attenuation such that the signal can be received at longer distances . 

119
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:21,765
So in the context of providing aim backup system to GPS that has global range . 

120
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:29,220
Clearly , we don't want to put a position begin , if you will , every few miles around the earth . 

121
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:42,730
So the ability to provide a positioning system with only a few , let's say , less than ten video of transmitters is very appealing , especially when the signals can be received at very high levels of. 

122
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:49,050
Right in this , thursday's pragmatic and cost issues that I believe we all have transmits often. 

123
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:59,389
So they are not only are they very big , but they're also very old is , in general , they're using nineteen , fifty , ninety , sixty technology . 

124
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,930
And so oh , using new technology , we are looking at ways of making them much smaller. 

125
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,220
More football and more portable . 

126
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,273
Okay , and then let's talk about the clock aspect during this case , obstacle clocks . 

127
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:16,335
And before you actually talk about this specific . 

128
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:30,960
So a quantum mechanical based collective technology , the europe , and here , just for those who do not talk a little bit about the role that accurate clocks play in systems like GPS , another geolocation and navigation systems. 

129
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:51,320
So there is a common phrase used in the navigation community , which is time as position and position , is time that data is all the way back to the sixteen hundreds of not sooner the maritime days when we navigated , offered the SUN when you left the . 

130
00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:02,810
Whether we have to say , when you left the portrait london , you would such a clock at noon , and then add sailed across the atlantic ocean . 

131
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:14,650
You determine how many degrees launched to you had travelled by looking at the time on your watch , on at the point at which the song was directly overhead . 

132
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:26,010
In that way , you could quarrel the number of the hours off of new york said , when you like your watch , but your coroner , in this case , versus noon at the at london , where you. 

133
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,487
From there , get your degrees . 

134
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:35,071
So the more accurate you'll flag , the more competition you could be of your position and determination , and the rest accurate , more , more than all days . 

135
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,830
It was very true. 

136
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,938
Position position is time with GPS , the same as also choose . 

137
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:44,561
So the key to GPS is indeed the clocks you're getting arranging . 

138
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:53,445
So in love for the GPS satellite , can you receive determines you don't measure distance what you are actually measuring is time . 

139
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:58,472
How long did it take that signal to travel from the satellite to receiver ? 

140
00:16:58,472 --> 00:17:16,700
So the satellite tells this signal left my eye , and tonight , at time , one , you look at a receiver clock when that singer was received at two and time to manage time , one is the time of travel , time of travel times . 

141
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,680
The speed of light gives distance of transactions . 

142
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,510
The key that is where the range comes from , but it all goes back to the clock. 

143
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,340
Let's speed of light , which we know in this concept , that sort of a kid here , right , all right . 

144
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,910
Without that , you would be able to just from a measurement. 

145
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,199
No , with the range was that that is correct , and there are a lot of other things . 

146
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,545
Your GPS receiver has been. 

147
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:43,250
To do as well , but that primarily drilling to it is remarkably complex and sort of every level by an image or cute . 

148
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,130
You can imagine applying to it . 

149
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,240
So let's move now to a third program is with the last one . 

150
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,100
I think we talk about . 

151
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,876
This one is known as president , and that stands for positioning system for deep ocean navigation . 

152
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,980
So sounds like you're going for an underwater. 

153
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:06,140
A GPS system , yes , the bottom line , GPS does not work under water . 

154
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:16,680
Actually , you can receive it very shallow depth in people have shown that , but that's not relevant to where we actually operate . 

155
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,850
We want , we want to be able to navigate at much deeper levels . 

156
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:27,180
Personnel about bringing a GPS like positioning capability. 

157
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,550
Submerge users . 

158
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:44,750
So when I think about the emerged users , I don't think about radio operation there , though I know there are some other real , interesting work in trying to bring radio with with violence and ultra low frequencies are down into into a underworld operation . 

159
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,227
But I hope I think of immediate , believe acoustic types of signals . 

160
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,080
So I presume that that's part of what you are correct. 

161
00:18:51,080 --> 00:19:07,160
Climate research community has been using low frequency acoustic signals for several decades now to monitor the temperature of the ocean as a functional time in and by using low frequency signals . 

162
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:22,410
If , you know , again , the knowledge of justice , value of the time is key here , if you know , when the signal lefty transmitter and compared that to the time you received it at another location , you can get the time of flight of that signal . 

163
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,428
Now , for underwater is so important for GPS . 

164
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:28,236
The speed of lighters is , is constant . 

165
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:43,260
That's not quite the case for under water , the speed of the sound of the underwater is a function of many things are primarily temperature , but also a depth and solidarity and some other terms as well . 

166
00:19:43,460 --> 00:20:11,380
So we have developed models that account for all that , in addition that the acoustic signals underwater don't travel in a single line between the transmitter and receiver , which radio frequencies typically occur signals , will take many pets on the way from the source to a receiver , because the signal is getting reflected due to temperature profiles uh in the ocean . 

167
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:22,810
Pressure profile and things like that , when you hear in signal , low frequency signal at receiver that was admitted far away , you actually hear multiple instances of that is like an echo . 

168
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,540
And there are four we call that multipass . 

169
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,540
There are multiple paths that is going to take. 

170
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:36,200
So it sounds like with this multi path phenomenon going on that one of the big issues here is , is gonna . 

171
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:49,160
Be had you been digging by all those signals coming in , and so that sounds like algorithms , that sounds like computational issues are just to make sense of what otherwise would be just my arrests of acoustic signals. 

172
00:20:49,360 --> 00:21:10,790
You're correct , and that is exactly what we're focused on in the program initially is , can we improve current models , develop new models that can accurately account for all those pads that a signal take such that we can extract an accurate time of flight , and hence and accurate distance measurement . 

173
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,650
Most we get the distance from that signal . 

174
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,470
The navigation part is , is fairly easy , the hard part. 

175
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:26,808
Is the signal measurement model , and just the GPS depends upon consultations of satellites and forgetting the number now . 

176
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:39,993
But as a couple of dozen , generally exact number as regular general is around thirty year , around thirty would perceive an undersea GPS system also rely on a consolidation of acoustic biggest distributed to the oceans . 

177
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:43,710
Yes , falling out thirteen for a given area also in the ocean . 

178
00:21:43,710 --> 00:22:02,720
Is there a phenomenon like when we talked about for a very low frequency radio signals in the silver skirt in the air through the earth and the ironic spirit , that sort of long wave guide effect acoustic sounds can travel from many distances in the ocean , right , the wheat on taking care of how wealth communicate of great businesses. 

179
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,580
That is cracking with , and that is the exact effect we're exploding . 

180
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:23,510
There is what is called a sound channel , the depth of a sound channel is in generally function of of temperature , but in general and depositions , it's about a columna deep and so low frequency acoustics will travel for very long distances . 

181
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:33,850
There is a seminar study in the nineties that showed a low frequency signals could be received in the sound channel , many thousands of kilometers . 

182
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,590
I believe it was almost nine thousand kilometers. 

183
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,802
Absolutely standing , and it also just brings another question to mind . 

184
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:52,020
I don't know much about how these weekends working with their characteristics are other issues of concern for animals living in the ocean , where these signals will be will be a propaganda. 

185
00:22:52,140 --> 00:23:02,790
Absolutely , a key tenant of the program is we have to develop a system that complies with all the federal regular relations , protecting memory , memory , wife. 

186
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:13,080
So when I take it , one of the things that drives you is the concern that we have become utterly dependent upon GPS , just the way we are utterly dependent on electrical grade . 

187
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,748
We all know when electrical grid goes down that we become friends , given five minutes of power out . 

188
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:21,082
We are going not . 

189
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:22,949
So GPS has similar problem . 

190
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:23,750
rebellion . 

191
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,000
Tell me about that aspect of how you think about technology and security. 

192
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah , so there was a phrase that some people used to have fail , safe and fail operational and create your primary system fails , and is the failed to a safe models , or it fail first to , you are still operational . 

193
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,250
And then if it fails again , you are still safe . 

194
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,720
Okay , so you have that built and redundancy so much in the paragraph one of the power goes down the building . 

195
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,530
Come on , if you need to continue as well as a power in that building . 

196
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,760
The same thing is , is happening in the navigation community . 

197
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,566
The consider tonight's vehicles , which are on the horizon . 

198
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:16,221
Clearly , they can't solely depend on GPS to tell the car where it is located , because some of the things we talk about , others , such as they're in urban canyon . 

199
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,346
The campaign of the GPS signal . 

200
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:39,160
So the artist , seeing more dependent on the other sensors for providing positioning information , whether the layer lazer raid are or or imagery , for example , or even the doubled sensors you have on the vehicle security scene , redundancy , starting to be built in two systems that are going to be dependent on navigation. 

201
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,918
In the future . 

202
00:24:39,918 --> 00:24:55,040
So when we think of the three programs that we've just talked about , and as so , I can decide , and I should point out that you just handed off the witch of this program to a colleague in the strategic technology offers , can you give us a sense of what the status of the victim is? 

203
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,560
So analysts is ripping up . 

204
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:04,750
Analysis is transitioning to the end users to the services are in various ways , and that's a good thing . 

205
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,890
Storage is almost halfway through a three phase programs . 

206
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:23,440
We're in faith to the store programs that we've demonstrated feasibility came up with an initial approach generated evidence to support that approach . 

207
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:31,660
And in fact , we are now employment in that approach and doing higher federal data collection , but scientists just getting started . 

208
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,870
We are in the middle of what we call. 

209
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:42,730
One of the sudden , just one more question for you , and that's what question do you really wish ? 

210
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,750
I would assume that I didn't . 

211
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,270
And if such a question comes to mind , you can ask it. 

212
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,710
Answer yourself , so you mention the article clerks. 

213
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,820
Thanks for reminding me , I, Ishould push it as you like question earlier. 

214
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,320
So enough to go clock , this is an atomic clock . 

215
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:12,230
We have a thoma clocks today , such as a rebellion clock or a season being clocked both of the racism beam has been around since the fifteenth of the night. 

216
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:24,510
Senior just one intermediate for a second , a simple way of thinking about these things when white atoms can be , clocks is because there are vibrations isolations associated with nuclear . 

217
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,587
But rather than that , the kinds of association do you think about it in our accountable fashion ? 

218
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:37,560
Clark , with a pendulum , I mean , some ways that was going on , but it's going on a billions and trillions , and of isolation is in what we consider duration of the second. 

219
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:46,220
So in the atomic clocks of today , we are exploiting signals immediately by atoms in the microwave region . 

220
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,090
Giga hurts level signals . 

221
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,670
Okay , google hurts is billion times per second . 

222
00:26:54,810 --> 00:27:03,830
An optical clock is exploiting a time of energy level transition that have frequencies over four hundred . 

223
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:15,980
Terror hurts another five waters of magnitude so that the clock at the ottawa clock takes five words of management faster than the atomic clocks of today . 

224
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:28,694
And by virtue that that's more precise time , and we get much improved stability out of applicable clocks a day in general , are about the size of a small laboratory . 

225
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:31,241
Universities had the optical clarks . 

226
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:53,400
At least the nationalism to for standards and technology has the world most table optical clock double in the past headache program that showed by making some trades in sized , weighing power and performance , you could reduce the size that optical clock down to the size of a shoe box from a laboratory sized down to a shoe box . 

227
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,120
Yes , but that clock is still taking adult to call frequencies . 

228
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:06,616
Another doctor program , should , you could make a very small and robust device colleagues , frequency come . 

229
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:19,410
That acts like a set of years and transfers that very stable obstacle took in the four hundred terror hurts region down to all of frequencies , very frequently frequency . 

230
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,910
Okay , then you can generate a timing . 

231
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:29,725
Second , that is systems of the data , one post per second , ten mega hurts , referenced on one hundred meter hurt reference systems . 

232
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:49,260
So the story project is integrating those separate technologies that develop into a single unit , such that I like to say , we want to pull out the season , being clock and plugging the stock obstacle clock , and your time stability has improved by , at least in order of one hundred and eighty . 

233
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:55,460
So imagine by clock that they would keep GPS level time accuracy for over a year. 

234
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,780
With no GPS research , the best name , the thanks for giving us a favourite vote in africa . 

235
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,540
O'clock is , I know that its complexities go up the church , but I think it gave us a sense of what you have to do . 

236
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,340
So , thanks a lot . 

237
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,960
And then I started to understand that in another suggestion future , you're going to be . 

238
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,132
You've got him in twenty twelve , you'll be leaving this year . 

239
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:22,402
You've got this amazing sort of skill set in mind , said , particularly with the navigation technologies . 

240
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:28,620
We've been talking about a time , a clock , a lot of of abilities and skills in different areas . 

241
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,890
Are you imagine that you're going to keep applying that particular set of interests in your post or professional life? 

242
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:45,579
Absolutely , positioning and timing are built into so many systems we have today . 

243
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:48,636
And it's because of the success of GPS . 

244
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:55,511
Other nations are building their own satellite navigation systems as as well . 

245
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,745
And GPS is embarrassed . 

246
00:29:57,745 --> 00:30:06,730
So many things , things you , you would even think about the eighteen young google cash from GPS is in there , but like trying to trading on the stock. 

247
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,031
GPS is , then I just occurred in that case . 

248
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:13,640
It's mostly the timing function like , as you need to know when those transactions have happened. 

249
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:22,704
Agricultural precision agriculture GPS is under power distribution to the electrical credit . 

250
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,930
GPS and GPS is provinces . 

251
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:49,090
I want to continue to enable systems today to provide that same level of positioning in timing with , with cafe villages that are redundant to GPS providing integrity , but also going beyond the level of positioning , attempting performance we get today with GPS such that we can enable new capabilities that we can even imagine today if we . 

252
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,650
That much more accurate timing and position. 

253
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:55,370
Information it sounds like exciting frontiers out there . 

254
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:02,730
I'm sure you have no problem pushing on those frontiers when this has been a fantastically interesting conversation for me . 

255
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,655
I feel probably should spoken with you for a while . 

256
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,410
So I wanted to thank you for. 

257
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,010
Joining me in the studio today . 

258
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:09,940
Well , thank you . 

259
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,250
This is , this is a lot of fun. 

260
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:18,710
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from doubt .
