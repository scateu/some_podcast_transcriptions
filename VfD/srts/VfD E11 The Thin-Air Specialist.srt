1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,020
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand. 

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:32,030
Autonomous operation technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight in the midst of the cold war , the defense advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:41,420
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as a core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,398
My name is ivan a motto , and I am your daughter host . 

5
00:00:45,398 --> 00:01:23,895
And i'm please have with me in the studio today , choosing a program manager since twenty fourteen , industrial systems technology of others try earned a pair of bachelor's degree is one in electrical engineering and one in computer engineering from west virginia university and our masters and doctoral degree and electrical engineering from the university of michigan for a decade prior to coming to DARPA , try founded and LED a series of programs within the micro electric mechanical systems technology department of sandia national laboratories in elbow cookie , new mexico , thanks for a journey in the studio today . 

6
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:24,570
Now the point . 

7
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,010
So i'd like to start out of discussion with some background about you . 

8
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:38,760
I'd like to tell me about your education if there are teachers that were important to you growing up , and that let you in the kinds of engineering correction that you have. 

9
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:54,188
Yeah sure , so I grew up in a small town in west virginia , western , western , to be exact when I was in high school , I had exhausted the math classes were available at my local high school , so I ended up going part time to west virginia wesley in college . 

10
00:01:54,188 --> 00:02:01,020
And they set up kind of a class for many students from my high school , go to a class for high school students , the local college . 

11
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,550
And before that , it was been good mass , but I never really knew how to apply it . 

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,560
I figured I would go in the medicine or something of that nature , and it's part of that special class they set up for us . 

13
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:22,640
The first half hour professional bride would come in , and he was engineering physicists , and he would come in and relate all of the calculus we were learning to physics problems . 

14
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,270
And I just found that fascinating , so that one of the junior high school , and from that point forward , I wanted to be an engineer. 

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:37,690
So I like to hear a little bit about the base of your career where you really work a lot on men and get next steps from micro electric mechanical systems . 

16
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,280
I know you did that even before going to a sandy as I talk a little bit about that whole man. 

17
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,180
Part of your work in graduate school to university , michigan , I worked for a professor . 

18
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,491
Canvas is one of the founders of names there . 

19
00:02:50,491 --> 00:03:08,440
I worked on analog interfaces for normal recording electorates , so I was developing integrated circuits to be able to record nervously potentials the brain for doing things like restoring function to people who have nervous system disabilities like paralysis . 

20
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,808
Could , could be other things in the stimulation sense , like blindness , or are hearing loss or other of that nature . 

21
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:23,187
I didn't went to send the international laboratories , which things a little bit of michigan I was designing circuit in their faces for members . 

22
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:30,284
And sandy , I started exactly designing the max components and let the team of people designing and employment in those . 

23
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:33,729
Primarily , we were working on small acoustic devices . 

24
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:40,390
So you may not know that in your phone and all of signal is immediately converted into an acoustics of. 

25
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,970
And I arrived by our female radio frequencies. 

26
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:59,330
Corrector , yeah , yeah , I mean , radio frequency , the radio frequency signal , which has a really long way of linked this converted into a acoustic signal , which has very small wavelength , which allows third in a small form factor before it's create , turned back into an electrical signal . 

27
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:15,580
Uh , my joy was working on technologies that do that function , but more for department of defense applications , rather than the elephant , also worked on other things that really at the interface of the vibrational systems and acoustic systems and electronic systems and. 

28
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,960
All right , and then what was the pathway from sandy? 

29
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,420
Two drop , I was a performer doing a lot of the research on those small acoustic violence components . 

30
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,270
Bill chapel , the current director of microsystem technology office , was my program manager . 

31
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:37,640
And so when he was promoted , he called me out of the blue one day , I think that was in march of the twenty fourteen . 

32
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,980
Instead , he tried , this is built chapel . 

33
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,140
How would you like to come the dark , but be a program manager ? 

34
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,320
I think you be great at it . 

35
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,060
And I shared north , as was the bodies that was kind of a strange conversation . 

36
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,080
I said , yeah , that that sounds like a great opportunity . 

37
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,560
Can I call you back at a few minutes? 

38
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,820
And is that that all all it took a few , just a few minutes , and then you know what your. 

39
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,320
Oh , of course , i'll mean after that , I mean anybody who is an opportunity to come in to the album is fantastic opportunity . 

40
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:18,010
Of course , I had to come in our view and put together talk that outlined the programs I would start to have to come in a view with the office director , but how it all started was from a phone call from belgium. 

41
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:32,110
Speaking about those programs were gonna die when to talking about a number of those who have a very large portfolio , the most program managers that will only talk about a few , but there are two questions I want to ask you before we do that one has to do with your name . 

42
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:39,450
Try , I call you try , but your official name is roy , and i'm just wondering if you could tell us the story of your name. 

43
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,821
Yes , so my fish name is royal herald . 

44
00:05:41,821 --> 00:06:05,450
Also , the third turns out my dad really wanted me to be named after him is clearly roy herald's in junior , and my mom wasn't the biggest fan of the name roy , but so they made a deal that I could be named royal holders in the third , and everyone will call me troy and enforced this when I was a small child , as legend has it , I would sit in my high chair . 

45
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:11,450
And if people called me roy , I would throw green wings at them and pound on a high chair , telling them the money in the morning was. 

46
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,420
Nothing like negative reinforcement . 

47
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:21,384
And so let some move on to we'll just some of your programs too , that I think our associate with one of those who can talk about them together . 

48
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:34,410
Go by the short names of equals and paper equals stands for inbound controlled air releasable unrecoverable systems and zebra stands were vanishing programmable resources , and the vapor came before equals . 

49
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,430
So I wanted to tell us a little bit about the labour across story , which is an ongoing woman. 

50
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,004
Yeah , so um , in the department of fans , a lot of times we have problems with electronically behind . 

51
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:50,050
We don't want to leave things on the battlefield where other people might collect them . 

52
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:59,930
We came up with the paper program , which is vanishing micro electronics program , is designed to be able to make micro electronics that have reliability . 

53
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:07,100
Four months , commissioner , with commercial of the shelf electronic components that don't vanish . 

54
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,230
But that when we want them to can rapidly vanish and and be invisible to the naked eye. 

55
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,620
Okay , and do you mean when you say vanish in the most people to think of puff , it's gone . 

56
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:28,915
Talk to me a little bit about the kind of technical path with some of your performers , which is to say , the research groups have been working on the kinds of pathways they're taking to try to realize this idea of vanished ability. 

57
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:32,995
Yes , it is really too approaches that have been really prominent in the paper program . 

58
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:57,930
A one was developed by the palestinian o'clock , and it is a vanishing glass substrates that basically turns into dust like particles , and that glass can be bound to integrated circuits and other things , and causing an entire system to you to vanish , and by dozens like particles , the part of the order size of one hundred mile crowds , which is about the weight of human hair . 

59
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:05,840
So those ones vanished , but the material himself doesn't know physically completely vanish . 

60
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,670
We did develop a material that does that . 

61
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,346
There was worked on there at the university of annoying and george attack and cornell . 

62
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:19,555
Many of those materials were walking away where they're thermally unstable room temperature . 

63
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:22,660
They'd like to be a monument or be a guess . 

64
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,649
So exactly make them at very cold temperatures , say , like minus fifty degrees . 

65
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,840
See , in this case , these vanishing materials of polymers . 

66
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,370
And we'd like to make a really long polymer chain to get home like you are right , makes the parliamentary tough . 

67
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:40,400
And then we link it in a certain way at the very cold temperatures that we raise . 

68
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,650
The open temperature remains stable , then in that material will in bed , something that called it . 

69
00:08:46,650 --> 00:09:10,690
There are photo generator or a thermal laser generator networks , just like you might expect to those when you figure , when you expose it to a certain wavelengths of light , photos of generator criticism , if you take the thermal laser generator and exceed a certain temperature , it also creates an asset that asset can break one of the bonds between the polymer change . 

70
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:19,590
And at that point , then it becomes storming unstable room temperature again , and the rest of it just vanishes and by vanishes . 

71
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,540
It take turns from a solid directly into a gas . 

72
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,340
Mental illness vanishes right before your eyes . 

73
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,210
The first time you see , it is truly amazed , and actually , the second time you see it actually raised. 

74
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:38,494
They're gonna , always be aware , and it really is amazing chemistry to bring into the capability of vanishing materials . 

75
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:43,210
And this , the program was successful enough in your eyes that you created the following program , right? 

76
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:43,980
That's correct . 

77
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,060
So we were brainstorming , what else beyond micro electronics , could we do with these materials ? 

78
00:09:50,470 --> 00:10:02,555
We were thinking , where else could we push this materials would lead the new fundamental discovery and developments , and could be also at the same , sometimes useful , the permanent defence . 

79
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:14,690
And we came up with the idea of vanishing air delivery vehicles for being able to deliver things in a very precise way into difficult , rich locations and not having a leave behind . 

80
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:22,030
That could either destroy the environment or or lead to detection of the delivery . 

81
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:34,580
And so the exercise program was born , and that program is currently in facebook and is developing vanishing air delivery platforms in the two phase. 

82
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:48,500
Right , and I know one of the exciting potential applications for these kinds of vehicles would be in sort of public health disease outbreaks tells a little bit about those kinds of humanitarian applications of. 

83
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,452
Absolutely , so one of the first things we started brainstorming out . 

84
00:10:52,452 --> 00:11:09,560
The idea met hepburn , whose program manager started interacting with me , introducing the idea of being able to deliver medical supplies using the technology and how exciting that would be thinking about things where there's many humanitarian disaster and the wrong ways are destroyed . 

85
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
Roads are impossible . 

86
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:31,820
How can I get really critical supplies , vaccines , blood medications , water to locations that needed or needs to be precisely delivered and do that in kind of , in some cases of massive response without having to worry about going and collecting all of these air delivery vehicles . 

87
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:43,480
How do I get not only the thing to biodegrade and disappear back into the environment , but how do I make the cost low enough that you can basically have a glider that you don't care if you ever go achieve. 

88
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:55,070
This is an exciting time in the lifecycle of the program , writes , because I know that in the coming months , you can move outside of the glimmer and the eye and fundamental europe , but toward vehicle. 

89
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,850
That's correct . 

90
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:14,820
So if two things that are going to be coming up , that will conclude face of the program , a one is a flight test launching from thirty five thousand feet , showing a range of one hundred and fifty kilometers , and landing with ten meters of accuracy and doing that with a material search of it . 

91
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:27,064
So the glider is made out of material that has as exact as possible , the same material properties as the vanishing material and the same manufacturing processes were trying to test out . 

92
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:46,540
Can we actually meet these flight profiles using something within the constraints of the material properties and manufacturing of vanishing material , at the same time , we are also building a non flying demonstration of the vanishing material . 

93
00:12:46,540 --> 00:13:00,650
For example , we might build nonsense of four the plane , just the wing of an airplane , but build that out of the vanishing material and show that we can extract significantly complex structure from the vanishing with terrorists . 

94
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:07,220
And then one year after those flight test , we will do a flight test of the actual vanishing. 

95
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,420
Air delivery vehicle , no right . 

96
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:17,590
Well , I will be excited to a keep track of that and will applaud with you when we see a first vehicle european disappear . 

97
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,260
I wanna move to another program . 

98
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:27,850
This one goes by the name zero , which kind of connection with the ever ever more sensor late in world . 

99
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,810
And so it tells a little bit better. 

100
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:40,100
Yes , so in the error is a problem designed to basically take the internet of things and move it right to the tactical launch . 

101
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,960
So today , when we think about the internet of things , it can't be what we really want to be . 

102
00:13:46,280 --> 00:14:02,640
We can take about a plane to our refrigerator or toaster , maybe our car , but we really limited things that either can be plugged into the wall , or that a human can take and plug into the device , or every couple days to recharge the battery . 

103
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:18,280
And that's because the energy efficiency of our electronic cooperating off of small , cheap batteries today is not high enough to sit there and monitor the environment all the time and report back things that it says . 

104
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,920
So what we're trying to do in zero is taken of a new paradise . 

105
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:28,890
Well , we actually look at a very low power levels of nearly our power to me means less than ten . 

106
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,760
And what and I choose that value , because that's the leakage of a small coins of battery . 

107
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:45,030
What we wanted to be able to set their continuously monitored environment , looking for an event that we are specifically tuned to . 

108
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:53,870
That doesn't happen very often , but can't be missed , and then be able to wake up this higher power consuming electronics when we see that event . 

109
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,260
So you can imagine what kind of events could those be . 

110
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:28,012
Those could be like , maintain bridges and infrastructure with these types of sensors looking for a specific failure mode , earthquakes , you could imagine putting these throughout the environment , more thinking about augmenting vehicles to look for and find engine failures earlier , you could imagine dispersing the environment and detecting things like false fires or chemical leagues or other things of that nature . 

111
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:38,490
We will hold class of these types of sensors looking for acoustic vibrational , inferior chemical , and and all of all being developed . 

112
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:46,330
All that can sense these very specific profiles , reject background influences and consume less than ten and a watch . 

113
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:52,820
So they basically said they are always active , always listening , but consume , basically stand by type power. 

114
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,963
Consumption right ? 

115
00:15:53,963 --> 00:16:00,900
I have fascinated , think about some of the world becoming the innovated with all kinds of sensors , almost aware of our bodies . 

116
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,300
Are , I want to move on now too . 

117
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:12,222
Just one more programmers goes by the name of neighborhood , am EVA and one form of that is mechanically based . 

118
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:22,680
And tana , and I particularly interested in this , because I think it revealed , sort of the way you apply your engineers , mine to this invisible world . 

119
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,683
A variety of frequency signals that that all around us talk to us a little bit about a member . 

120
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:29,127
Okay , sure . 

121
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:29,350
so. 

122
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:38,660
A member kind of comes from my love of looking at problems and thinking about the ways we solve them today and how those are insufficient . 

123
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,870
And if we could just do it this other way , it would be so much better , but we have some technology , the standing in our way of doing that . 

124
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:59,900
So when the people were trying to do is people communicate from really difficult environments , say , like underground or underwater , or over very long distances without some type of repeater network and. 

125
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,850
I should point out right through ground and throw water . 

126
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,510
Radio signals do not travel very well through those media. 

127
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:18,540
I would say , high frequency radio signals don't travel very well through those media , and the key then is to operate low frequencies , and that presents a very significant challenge . 

128
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:36,420
Is that the wave linked at low frequencies is extremely long , in effect , that is the reason that they propagate water and ground is because the wavelength is very long , and that allows the signal because of the physics to be able to propagate through those media over much larger dimensions . 

129
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:48,380
So the way we build in tennis today , we basically push current through wires , either kind of straight wires to build things like a lecture type of antennas or through coils and other things . 

130
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:57,962
And it's very , very difficult to produce a significant amount of an arcade magnetic field when the antenna is very electrically small . 

131
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:06,124
That means small with respect to the wavelengths , using those techniques of techniques are fabulous at higher frequencies . 

132
00:18:06,124 --> 00:18:16,970
But when you get a very low frequency where you want to be main portable , it just seems nearly impossible to make an internal with any type of efficiency at. 

133
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:24,290
Those scientists believe that the military does have some antenna systems that can operate in these low frequencies , but there. 

134
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:34,990
In nervous , yes , they're either the size of whole islands or counties , or sometimes they travel states to communicate these banks . 

135
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,120
In other cases , you might real , a very long wire . 

136
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,940
That's a column or and link out of an airplane to communicate these frequencies . 

137
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,720
In any case , the dimensions are very , very large. 

138
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:57,650
So it's going to take a lot of interesting physics to go from something of that size to amazon portable technology that will generate the same. 

139
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:11,730
Long wavelengths that's correct until our insight was that when we pushing those currents to those wires , what were doing is were creating electric and magnetic fields and were spending energy men . 

140
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:40,630
And of course , we do that specific rate to determine the frequency , and what we did was , we looked in said , well , what if we just started with something that actually had a high amount of store magnetic field , for example , like a permanent , and instead of then using our power to create that magnetic field , we would take advantage of what nature has given us , which is this permanent magnet , of course , we've created and and machine that , but is a natural material phenomenon . 

141
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,460
And instead , we created the art of frequency by moving it . 

142
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:52,610
And then we also had the insight that moving things mechanically becomes very efficient , the lower in frequency you go . 

143
00:19:52,610 --> 00:20:12,087
So while mechanical based and tanner may be completely inappropriate where your iphone operates at giga hurts frequencies , it's in fact , very appropriate at a killer hurt type frequency to take a magnet and spin it , or mechanically move it to create an authority magnetic field . 

144
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,010
Of course , magazine , only . 

145
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:27,130
We're looking at the other types of materials that store these types of permanent fields , electric store , electric types , and there are other types of materials that are will be looking at the problem . 

146
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:39,950
Another insight that we had was that if we should just took one really big thing and tried to move it , that the amount of store mechanical energy there will be very high , and that also would lead to a lot of efficiencies . 

147
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:59,260
So one of the really key ideas , the middle program is , can we break that large thing up into a number of small , synchronized things that lower the total store energy and lower the power consumption and the risk that we're trying to mitigate is how small pieces can we break it into ? 

148
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:08,444
But for the interactions between the pieces , particularly the magnetic and electric interactions between them started dominate the overall system performance . 

149
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:10,939
You can imagine two magnetizer costs together . 

150
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:14,010
I have a lot of force between them , they and around us one . 

151
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:21,340
So trying to manage your controllers in the reaction is the big , risky part of the program that we're trying to overcome here at all. 

152
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:31,030
Okay , and if you get your topic , and you imagine this program being successful , you want to be gives a sense of what additional communications capabilities would offer. 

153
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,620
Yes , so this is a low frequency transmitters . 

154
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,410
You are thinking about things like voice and test . 

155
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:58,480
So at these types of frequencies is not really possible to do things like video forwards and employees , but will give you a new capability , say , from underground , if you are minor to be able to text or do voice to somebody above grounds , or if there were something like a mining accident , you could tell somebody where you were at , and you would have that type of communications . 

156
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:13,330
Similarly , under water , maybe sixty two , one hundred meters under water , one could communicate text from underwater to the surface or to something even flying overhead , which today is , it is just not really possible. 

157
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:26,870
And there is one other application that is quite interesting to me in that the way these low frequencies can travel through the atmosphere in unusual ways that it potentially could enable very long distance communication between. 

158
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,498
Two points , that's correct . 

159
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:32,782
Oh , um , at a slightly higher frequency , save around ten kilograms . 

160
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:37,969
There's a wave guide that formed between the ionosphere and the surface of the earth . 

161
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:41,750
We often that wave guide to bounce signals off . 

162
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,470
And what's called the high frequency event . 

163
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:55,910
So things like ham radios work based on that physics , but you have to know the location of the receiver to know how to bounced down to the receiver . 

164
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:03,918
So if you don't know that you much rather feel that wave guide the arrival , and that's what happens as a technique hurt . 

165
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:21,206
So we're trying to build something that can do that wave , guide and want you couple that we've got the propagation physics or the loss of the RFStravels over distance is very favorable compared to things that don't propagate in the wave guide . 

166
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:37,550
And so that's what would enable you to reach these really long range communications , thinking things again , like voice and text over hundreds of kilometers from something that you can really hold in the palm of your hand , just not possible today , using other technologies. 

167
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:46,120
We've talked about four different programs , and when I think about all the different technical components of them is rather amazing . 

168
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,490
So this makes me in a realize that your engineers mind really covers a lot of territory . 

169
00:23:51,540 --> 00:24:05,863
I think we once had a discussion where you telling me that in some ways , you think the attack of the engineer is quite a great one that there is really kind of connection between the kind of problem solving engineers do , and the creativity that we might even see in the orders . 

170
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:13,050
I'm just wondering if you got some thoughts about that and how you might comparing contrast those kinds of ways of exercising our minds. 

171
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:22,100
Yes , so it takes me an idea that I borrowed from my thesis adviser can wise you at the university of michigan on their north campus . 

172
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:32,970
They have centrally located our music engineering , and I think , believe architecture and his point was all they basically stuck all of the creative fields together . 

173
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:45,220
This is uh some people might not think that music and engineering would go together , but I think that was his insight that becoming an engineer and being an engineer requires quite a bit creativity . 

174
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:53,420
I think , particularly if you want to make anything more than an incremental improvement to the way things are done today . 

175
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:16,020
It really requires the type of creativity to look at the way that they are done , understand patients of that and then come up with some completely new approach that would allow you to get beyond those limitations and make you the ten x hundred x jumps and performance that we are seeking , particularly here adopted . 

176
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:25,876
So creativity is a huge part of being able to found new programs , particularly in areas that are not obvious that are leading in life from one program to another . 

177
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:32,927
How do I get off the certain trajectories and get myself on a different trajectory , which is the one I want to be on . 

178
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:36,660
And I think it's really the creativity that allows you to make that. 

179
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:47,893
That kind of jump before we close tribe , I just wondering if there is a science fiction technologies , technology that you might have learned about when your kid , you might have read a great science fiction book . 

180
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:54,270
You saw something in the movie up with a society yourself that does not exist now , but that you really think well. 

181
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,760
Absolutely , I think both come from back the future . 

182
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:09,440
So I am actually optimistic that one day I might get a whole car , and I would love to be able to do time travel . 

183
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,930
So I am not so optimistic about that , what , but. 

184
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,820
You never know . 

185
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,850
Well , so , and if you could do time travel , would you be more interested in going back? 

186
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,776
We're forward , I would definitely be more interested in going forward in time . 

187
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:22,460
I was say what. 

188
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,466
But I knew you are going to say that this has been absolutely amazing . 

189
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:34,757
We've gone from vanishing materials and managing vehicles to censors that use of almost , but I were paying attention to the environment . 

190
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:36,705
We've talked about harvard vehicle . 

191
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:40,796
So this is just been an amazing conversation for me , and I want to thank you . 

192
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:42,550
Try for spending the time with me. 

193
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,910
Thanks , i've been , I really enjoyed. 

194
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,130
And thank you listeners for sharing this time with us . 

195
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,790
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dirt .
