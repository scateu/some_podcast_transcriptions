1
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,780
South technology , the internet. 

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,864
GPS in the palm of your hand on tonight . 

3
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:17,760
operation. 

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:38,740
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research projects agency has been a driver of welcome to voices from darker a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:49,200
My name is iphone a matter when I am your dog house , and today I am pleased to have with me in the studio , blake backing a new program manager in darkness , biological technology office . 

6
00:00:49,930 --> 00:01:00,882
He arrived in march of twenty sixteen from the university of texas a , and he brings into dark a particular love for the anti magical kindness , insects that is . 

7
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:11,910
And it is betting that a combination of insects and genetic techniques can open new passwords to protecting the crops we depend on from both natural and human perpetrated threats . 

8
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:21,910
These are things like droughts and storms on intentional introduction of invasive species and intentional release of platforming , biological warfare agents possible . 

9
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:38,693
He just rolled out his first project called insect allies , which is challenging the research community to develop plant protective viruses that insects working as allies with can deliver efficiently to threaten plants and bustle protection on them in a single season time from that can stabilize the threat . 

10
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:43,569
So thanks blake , for coming into the year study on spending some time with me , that's great to be here . 

11
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,440
Thanks for help me . 

12
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,730
So before we talk about the insect allies program , let's talk about you , your background and what? 

13
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:58,430
Brings you to double , well , I can do double , because I saw a fantastic opportunity for my research community . 

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:15,510
The dark admission is unlike things that i've done in the past , because the darker mission is to look at high risk , high reward projects that could benefit humanity in so that twenty to fifty year time frame . 

15
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:27,010
And it also gives an opportunity to the risk some programs and projects so that they can actually come to lightning and see you . 

16
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:35,420
So when the opportunity to come to opera presented itself , I thought it was just this awesome chance to do some really great science . 

17
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,870
And I was encouraged because I was asked to think about things that traditionally won't find it. 

18
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,482
That I think so , let me just save you for a second . 

19
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:53,422
As you said , when , when the opportunity presented itself , of course , it didn't present itself somehow that that happens is you knew somebody or you , you heard about an opportunity in opening . 

20
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:53,865
So how? 

21
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,405
How did you actually occur ? 

22
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,345
So I was at a meeting . 

23
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:02,244
I have moved into an immense , the university of texas at thailand . 

24
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:12,738
So we haven't event every year we can dedicate you , and we get to meet program managers , and and I actually talk with java lane , who was the a director of biological technology at the time . 

25
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:18,999
And I wasn't sure that harper really had any interest in agriculture , so , but he was such an interesting person . 

26
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,564
I wanted me to talk to them . 

27
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:23,590
So I talked to him after he gave his presentation . 

28
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,390
And I said , I don't know if we have any overlap and more interested in , but I would love to work with you at some point . 

29
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:47,600
He said , what actually we're looking to get into agriculture , you know , and that sort of started this journey of a significant with the kind of minds that we have a double , which is , you know , these kind of difficult technologies that need to be developed , that could benefit humanity . 

30
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,800
And and so I was , it was a good fit right in A. 

31
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:58,140
Taylor , you were a professor biology , but you also had another head on , which was the system vice president for research and technology transfer . 

32
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,680
so those are the two things that are 这个第二。

33
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,350
There are similarities . 

34
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:08,800
There are uh , you know , the people that you work with , and you're directing the team to try to achieve an objective . 

35
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:20,760
And so were definitely doing that in working in agriculture as a professor , you spend a lot of time where you go out , and you think about the technologies that are , uh , you know , genetic base , molecular base . 

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,940
Things are happening , but you also have to the reality of situations when you go to central america , you walk in a potato field . 

37
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,360
You start to realize that technology is great . 

38
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,890
But how do you get that technology to the field? 

39
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:43,674
Actually , get it to the finish line , so we'll talk about that with the insect galaxy program in just a month , but is one worth thing I have to ask . 

40
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:49,781
And that's because when you read your website dropped out of the male , the last line is very intriguing . 

41
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:57,940
It says that you were on the discovery channels , reality TV show , called tethered in twenty fourteenth . 

42
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,500
I just , I just have to hear stories that I know how did that happen , what did you do ? 

43
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,180
And we were in sex part of that. 

44
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,503
To start up , I am interested in science education . 

45
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:26,270
And so I like the idea of putting a positive spin in science , not just the bottom wearing geeky professor in ottawa person , as scientists said that , you know , kids could despair to be a good , strong , normal person . 

46
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:40,860
And so there is an opportunity that came up to be on a reality show , and the idea when you are in a survival situation , people that are alone don't do as well as people that are appeared with somebody else in a group . 

47
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,480
And so this target to the next level where I was literally with a six foot. 

48
00:05:46,950 --> 00:06:00,350
这个时候，我们就可以看到这里面有一些不同的地方，比如说你在哪个地方，你可以看一下，我们这边的话就是那个什么东西works 。

49
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:08,280
And so through the episode , we had to learn to come and work together and get together on some things , and we actually became very good friends . 

50
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,300
We survived not going to end in a way , but i'm sitting here today . 

51
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,810
So I must have worked out okay evidence , but I would tell you that that experience was a harder sand . 

52
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,190
real . 

53
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,330
They don't give you food , they don't give you water . 

54
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,850
So we are a boy love our water . 

55
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,210
We had to find the food that could sustain us to do , and we didn't do really well . 

56
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:36,800
I was in alaska at the end of the summer , so that just wasn't a lot of food around , and we ended up at one point . 

57
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:49,630
The entertainment aspect was that we ended up finding a dead moose in the middle of a and river , and decided that I had to have that credibility as an animal legislator . 

58
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,500
So we scooped model there , cooked mouth , and we ate crickets . 

59
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,780
Markets out of the. 

60
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,780
Well , okay , that sexy might be a nice secret . 

61
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:06,061
Then to talk about your new program in sector allies , those markets where your allies out there have to survive . 

62
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,987
So talk about the program here are doubt what it is . 

63
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:12,540
What's the program all about , and what you have to accomplish with. 

64
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,696
So my broad interests are sustaining agricultural capabilities . 

65
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:29,200
So as we move forward in the future , when working on growth , population to ten billion people in the next twenty five years , how are we going to sustain the food? 

66
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:32,379
Supply right , and we were about about seven point , three billion dollars . 

67
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,021
They were talking about an appeal of time . 

68
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:34,320
another. 

69
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:43,880
To increase and a traditional agricultural approach is great , and does it does a really good job of sustaining foods supply right now . 

70
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:51,020
Forward thinking , what we can do in the future to innovate and make things better . 

71
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,540
And so insect allies really comes out of that . 

72
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:02,200
Born out of we want to utilize insects to deliver genes and planes that could benefit the plant . 

73
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,160
Previously , capabilities were only in tissue culture , and that meant that you had to grow up . 

74
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:23,363
Those plans after genetic modification , and then you only find out of the genes do what you want to do after you've gone through this sort of long , painstaking process in a world where drowned and threats from insects and pathogens are always around . 

75
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:27,380
And how can we actually protect our plans in the fields where they are ? 

76
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,050
And so this mutual plan transformation idea came about , and then that presents a second problem . 

77
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,610
How do you actually get the genes into the plants where you want them delivered ? 

78
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:52,689
And so that's where the insect outlines come about insects , insect factors in particular , very moving , these pieces of genetic material in two plants very efficiently and effectively . 

79
00:08:52,689 --> 00:09:00,570
So why couldn't we use that natural to actually move these genes in the plans that give positive characteristics to the plants ? 

80
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,750
So that's what we want to do . 

81
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,330
We want to use insects to deliver genes and plants that will benefit them and. 

82
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,220
Right now , what are our options in case crops are threatened somehow , by a past general or some other threat ? 

83
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,850
What , what do we do when that happens? 

84
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,110
Well , currently , what we do is we try to contain the outbreak . 

85
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:34,500
And so what that usually means that we have to destroy the crops that are , in fact , and you know , if you don't think too much about the situation that just given some innocent fields of rock , some trees and an orchard . 

86
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:41,205
But the reality is , if you run that seat source for the next year , you also impact the next year's production . 

87
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,888
And the next year , the next year . 

88
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:47,700
And so it's not a small problem to have one of these invasive problems . 

89
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,950
And i'm going to a slash and burn mode to get rid of the disease . 

90
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:59,980
So if we could actually recover those crops very quickly , and we could stop those eminent threats , then we wouldn't lose. 

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,237
Action for multiple years , I mean , it all sounds like a little bit like a medical model . 

92
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:11,440
I mean , if I go into doctor's office , because i'm not feeling well , I might have , you know , I might get somewhere about action in a week and feeling better . 

93
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,070
I mean , in some ways , it sounds a little bit like that because your time frame here is to solve a threat to to make up a plan. 

94
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,800
Better when , in a very short time , is that right ? 

95
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,300
That's exactly right . 

96
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,455
And you know , a good example of where this technology could really benefit would be in a tree orchard type situation . 

97
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:33,917
And further right now they're dealing with such a screening . 

98
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:40,530
This is a bacterial pathogen that transmitted by an causes trees to decline rather quickly . 

99
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,110
And the answer is , you need to remove the trees , and if you find outbreaks of disease , you need to get rid of the thread . 

100
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:57,000
And so in tree crops , you actually lose those trees for several years because trees take a while to start producing fruit again . 

101
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,425
So those threats are a very bad review could actually turn on genes that allowed them to survive . 

102
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:05,780
That would be much better situation and. 

103
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:16,044
Okay , and because we are here at dark , a defensive man's research project agency , they're generally as a sort of national security angle on our project . 

104
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:19,440
So what is that angle here or four in satellite? 

105
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,950
Well , there is really too full . 

106
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,520
So the first idea is that we want to protect our domestic food supply . 

107
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:52,060
So if there was a threat that came , and whether be environmental , something like drought or flooding , or if it was passed , that was released accidentally or or on purpose , would want to be able to handle that challenge so that we don't destroy our food supply , because there's a lot of evidence that shows that unstable food supply leads to unstable culture . 

108
00:11:52,340 --> 00:12:00,700
And we definitely don't want that happens that I can release to the second part , which is international food safety and unstable regions in the world . 

109
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,870
Footstep bilateral stability are things that lead to even less stable condition . 

110
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:17,760
So if we can have hand at the beginning of that problem and provides food to these populations , then I think that that definitely is a national security concern . 

111
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,120
And that something that we have the ability to address now. 

112
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:28,862
Okay , let's dive in just for a little while on an actual biotechnology that you are pushing this several components to it . 

113
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:43,920
We've got the inside our eyes , but they're gonna , be the ones that they're going to deliver in a sense of the threat , reducing a virus that you're gonna , maybe talk with a little bit about , and then what you hope the end result might be out there on the field . 

114
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,240
Such to talk about the components of insect and how you can now maybe move the state of your effort. 

115
00:12:50,290 --> 00:13:02,150
Yes , we'd broken up into really three areas of the virus , so taking a virus and a lot of people think of viruses only in a bad context , but in reality , says can be benign . 

116
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,480
They might move genetic material around , and you know , non dangerous ways . 

117
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:18,370
And so what we want to do to find viruses that have very limited negative effects on any host , and then remove any possibility of negative outcomes from and use those . 

118
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,370
These are shuttles to get genetic material placed into the plants dinner . 

119
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,210
And so we're going to use insects , which are very good movers of viruses . 

120
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:35,170
If you select the right virus and you select the right insect , it can be a very specific . 

121
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,470
And we also have the. 

122
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,870
Opportunity to safeguards is when you say specific means . 

123
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:47,510
If if there's a certain plan that is threatened , it will go to those plans specifically in the first ten , twenty other species around , hopefully. 

124
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,480
They would ignore those . 

125
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,540
There are generalists . 

126
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,138
We'll feed from a lot of different host plants . 

127
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:55,275
Those are the insects that we would select in this program . 

128
00:13:55,275 --> 00:14:01,221
Rather , we want to select insects that have a very specific relationship with maybe a those species of plants . 

129
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:05,410
So if you used in this way , they're not going to go feed on everything that's out there . 

130
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,330
So it's a very specific relationship. 

131
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,090
Okay , maybe it makes this concrete . 

132
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:15,750
Can you imagine a potential scenario , a specific crop that has a specific threat on it ? 

133
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:23,060
And then what kind of virus you might device to treat it , how you get that into insect and potentially. 

134
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:35,340
Medicate thread so I can think a lot of ideas , but well , well , I think what we want to do as our performer community , we want to go out and ask the research community , what are these major threats ? 

135
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,760
What specific relationships do they see that can be utilized in this way ? 

136
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:49,760
So this is a very open program , and we're going to ask the research community academics to come to us and tell us what problems need to be addressed . 

137
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,740
And water the players. 

138
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,726
Okay , so rather than specifying at this point , you want to keep this opening . 

139
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:59,980
And that way you maximize sort of the creative potential of your performer based research based. 

140
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,690
Right , I know so many people have there , an active measure that have great ideas . 

141
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,830
I wanna give them a chance to come and tell us what they need to address and have A. 

142
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:22,610
Now I , we can speak a little bit , generally , though , about some of the molecular tools , because they think proudly , what one of the things that gives you such strings made the moving forward with releasing ambitious program is because we relevant seeing some new , remarkable kinds of molecular tools . 

143
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,200
Maybe you can just talk about one or two of those to skip or listeners a sense of what is becoming possible . 

144
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:27,930
shirt. 

145
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:35,080
The revolution in electrical biology has been based around the two thousand twelve finding of christopher last night. 

146
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,430
A new utilization of that tool . 

147
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,630
And just briefly , I know that that's a mouth , one sentence or two about what that sort of does. 

148
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:55,700
So christopher kazakhstan is a molecular tool , allows you to edit the genome of a host , and it doesn't wait so that cuts in the are based on a couple of letters . 

149
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,470
So it's very specific where it will go . 

150
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:04,860
So traditionally , when you don genetic , a lot of occasion , you end up head of putting it into the genome and hoping that it goes to the right place . 

151
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,060
These new tools allow us to be very specific in world's place . 

152
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,690
So doesn't that? 

153
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,548
There are needed . 

154
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:31,180
Okay , and so so that means that there's all kinds of threats that there , if we know something about genetic basis of those , then we can use it to all like christmas cards , nine and going very specifically , and maybe do a kind of genetic fix , and that can happen in in a single season , and thereby that might be the approach friend . 

155
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,450
A new way of protecting our football play. 

156
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,140
right ? 

157
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:41,500
A lot of these gym suggests that we would use to solve these problems are already been looked at . 

158
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,600
A good example would be flood resistant rice . 

159
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,560
That's all the sweet of genes. 

160
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,810
And that's what you know about . 

161
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,390
Drinkers said , sweet dreams , right? 

162
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:55,101
The sweet of genes that would allow it to survive and difficult situations . 

163
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:59,131
There's the same type of technology is being found for high , silently . 

164
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:02,190
Drought result stands drought tolerance . 

165
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:10,110
And so if we could actually figure out where to put those genes into the crops that were interested in , then we could get through those bad situations. 

166
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,700
All right , so this is the sense of a great idea we're going . 

167
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,290
You know , our population keeps going up . 

168
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,510
Maybe we're going to reach ten billion . 

169
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,800
What you know about bundle and safe food supplies of a sense of great thing . 

170
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:27,773
But this is just only one way you are interested in the human insect relationship , but you have some other ideas . 

171
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:31,867
I think about how our partnership with insects might expand . 

172
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:32,550
Maybe you. 

173
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,720
Tokyo slopped about that , yeah . 

174
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,170
So I also been interested in alternative protein sources . 

175
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,780
And so I have a program in the spiral program. 

176
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,820
And that is beer that that's really work with small businesses . 

177
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,220
grant . 

178
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,580
and. 

179
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:58,090
We're actually looking at delivering high protein sources from insects using technology to improve our ability to do that . 

180
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:07,500
So one side of it might be too use technology to manage paston passenger problems and insect colony ring . 

181
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,620
So could we shut down viral infections in this colonies that usually caused in? 

182
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,160
collapse . 

183
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,450
So we talking about the deep collapse. 

184
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,760
Issue similar right there . 

185
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,150
There is a whole host of viruses that caused that same problem in other insect species . 

186
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:33,330
And so , and crickets , for example , which are probably one of the most popular edible insect producers out there . 

187
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,590
There is a similar virus that causes collapse . 

188
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:46,680
Their colleagues of european companies that was an invasion of the virus might cause a complete collapse of all of lifestyle。

189
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,030
什么玩意？

190
00:18:48,080 --> 00:19:01,550
And then we can go the other direction and actually utilize these insects to also deliver needed nutritious neutrons , like vitamin a , violent a , vitamin a , see vitamin d . 

191
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,800
Hong kong's of different ideas . 

192
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:12,090
There is , there is really no lack and ideas what it could produce , but we could actually develop insects and a little insect into a wrong . 

193
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,390
Well , not only can they feed nation , but they can also deliver additional. 

194
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:24,090
Resources now , have you already practice what you seem to be pitching here , which is the citizen sex might become part of the country . 

195
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,360
So have you been? 

196
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,710
Yeah yeah , and you know , it's funny . 

197
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,040
I realized that people have an aversion of this . 

198
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,150
There's an version of this in my own family . 

199
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,030
And so I understand it very well . 

200
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,570
However , eighty percent of the world eats insects , the stable protein source . 

201
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:47,550
And so , you know , in the western world were kind of an idea where we don't utilize this opportunity . 

202
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:56,113
Again , you know , there is great sources of protein right now that everybody enjoys , if you like state , if you like chicken , if you like all these other things . 

203
00:19:56,113 --> 00:20:02,790
But again , when we get to a point where our population continues to , we're going to need to have alternative sources . 

204
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,810
So we're really thinking into the future. 

205
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:13,139
Well , this could someone not remembering it early on the conversation you did mention on the other short terror that said , you found those whenever were markets , the remark is in the moves . 

206
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:17,482
So among the very simply , sexual tried , somehow , I imagine you tried crickets . 

207
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,061
Where , where do they stand ? 

208
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,825
Remark is great , but they not as good as something. 

209
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:34,135
You know , honestly , the magazine were relatively yesterday's , but I cooked them with a little bit of different , locally sourced alaskan fireweed , so they were delicious . 

210
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:37,250
They actually took on the flavor of what you. 

211
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:45,662
So a blake's error , a question that I should have asked you that I didn't do just tell you wish I had enough . 

212
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,250
So you can even rescue. 

213
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,780
We should advise me why I am interested in insects , and all of that question . 

214
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,420
And the answer is , I haven't always been . 

215
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:01,080
I didn't grow up as a child wanting to be in and technologies inside collections . 

216
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:24,500
Brother was interested in the world in general and how things worked , and so that dreamed to biology , one of the college students and through my college classes that they invited northern iowa , I family took an ethnology class , and it opens up this idea that we could ask these biological questions , and we could use insects to answer them . 

217
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,220
They're living organisms . 

218
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,449
They are abundant . 

219
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:34,577
And I also realized that going into my career as an academic that we're always going to need to eat . 

220
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:38,510
And so funding for agriculture is always going to be . 

221
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:53,570
And so it was a good way to actually marry some of the ideas that I had of asking questions about the world , and then also working in the field that super important , because in our food security is going to be a problem going forward . 

222
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,830
So I ended up as an amateur out of he . 

223
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,750
This is a great way to ask the questions that I want answer. 

224
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:10,540
So one of the things that fascinates me here adopt and having the opportunity to get to know a lot of different technologies in the making potential technologies . 

225
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:25,586
Yeah , these are technologies that have the potential to do a lot of good , but there are also bringing capabilities that could be used for the furious reasons on the case year of developing new kinds of ways of getting genetic material until living in this case , plans . 

226
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:33,921
That sounds like a great thing when it comes to to crack protection , but it also sends to me like it could open doors to new kinds of save biological or failed . 

227
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:35,190
What are your thoughts on? 

228
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,920
Well , I think that there are potential negatives . 

229
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,360
They could come out of technology being developed like this . 

230
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,328
But I think the overwhelming thought is that this is a positive technology . 

231
00:22:49,328 --> 00:23:04,820
There is much easier ways to cause a large agricultural damaging regions that certainly wouldn't have to take off this level of sophistication , and so that there is definitely much more benefit than risk. 

232
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:13,960
Right , I mean , successfully set up , go down deep into the into the molecular machinery is , is probably a lot harder than what just going in spring chemical. 

233
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:21,715
There is something bringing chemicals or identifying viruses are past that , you know , aren't in the region that you could bring in release that kind of thing . 

234
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:24,167
And so really , that's what we want to guard against . 

235
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:36,800
There is the potential that technology like this could be used for various purposes persons , but you know , the positive that can come out of those in the world changing abilities that we can again is , is incredible. 

236
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,192
I just want to thank you . 

237
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:42,030
Play for this great conversation from the water , and thanks for for spending. 

238
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,530
It's timely , what i've heard me . 

239
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,800
This is very exciting. 

240
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,940
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next voices from darpa .
