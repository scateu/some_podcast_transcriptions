<b>as kids to lots of different things so i</b>

80
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:09,833
<b>was busy you know doing sports and music</b>

81
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:12,083

<b>a teacher and a librarian and a nurse my</b>

83
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,916
<b>dad was a university physics professor</b>

85
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,625
<b>really important in our family as far as</b>

86
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,916
<b>science</b>

87
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:25,666
<b>i really loved problem solving when i</b>

88
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:27,500
<b>was a kid and i also liked building</b>

89
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,708
<b>things</b>

90
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:31,125
<b>when i was little i used lego blocks and</b>

91
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,375
<b>as i got bigger i used meccano which</b>

92
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:36,500
<b>here we call erector set and so you know</b>

93
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,458
<b>tiny little uh nuts and bolts and</b>

94
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,500
<b>putting things together was sort of my</b>

95
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,750
<b>my specialty and really that's sort of</b>

96
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,750
<b>what my career looks like i i do a lot</b>

97
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,750
<b>of problem solving and building tiny</b>

98
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:48,791
<b>little things</b>

99
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,375
<b>yeah fascinating to think about the</b>

100
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:52,375
<b>erector sets which you know had</b>

101
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,375
<b>macroscopic parts and you could actually</b>

102
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:56,541
<b>manipulate them with your hands and and</b>

103
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,833
<b>when i think of the</b>

104
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,416
<b>the devices and the parts that you're</b>

105
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:01,833
<b>working with now on the micrometer and</b>

106
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:03,750
<b>smaller scales it's just kind of</b>

107
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,375
<b>astonishing</b>

108
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,000
<b>now you spent</b>

109
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,166

<b>and i</b>

112
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,291
<b>would guess that</b>

113
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:15,958
<b>while there and maybe even before you</b>

114
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:18,750
<b>had heard about DARPA but uh i also do</b>

115
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,333
<b>like to share with listeners the how did</b>

<b>this particular program manager get to</b>

117

118
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:29,458
<b>you was it somebody you knew at darpa</b>

119
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:32,041

<b>you and your interest how did you get</b>

121
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:35,458
<b>here</b>
<b>-  yeah you know it's a little bit of</b>

122
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,333
<b>all of those back when i was in grad</b>

123

126
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:44,291

<b>and</b>

141
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:16,291
<b>it turns out no actually they had seen</b>

<b>some of the work that i was doing and</b>

143
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,000

<b>familiar with darpa but hadn't really</b>

146
01:05:22,916 --> 01:05:24,583
<b>thought about coming to be a program</b>

<b>manager but you know given that</b>

148
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,916
<b>opportunity i thought about it really</b>

149
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:31,333
<b>hard really quick in fact we had to make</b>

150
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,166
<b>a decision pretty fast</b>

151
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,250
<b>and came out and interviewed and and</b>

152
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,541
<b>things things moved quick picked up the</b>

153
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,708
<b>family and moved out of new mexico and</b>

154
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:41,875
<b>came out to the east coast so i've been</b>

155
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,833
<b>at darpa since 2017. so that's a big</b>

156
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,125
<b>decision i mean one thing that always</b>

157
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,500
<b>amazes me about program managers</b>

158
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,916
<b>is that you know you come in knowing</b>

159
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,416
<b>that this is not</b>

160
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,500
<b>almost certainly not a lifelong</b>

<b>appointment you know in fact</b>

162
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:58,333
<b>you know one of the pieces of the secret</b>

163
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,458
<b>sauce one of the ingredients of the</b>

164
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,375
<b>secret sauce of the organization is that</b>

165
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,583
<b>you know you come in knowing that you're</b>

166
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:03,958
<b>just going to be here for three four</b>

167

<b>five years that sort of thing some</b>

168
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,000
<b>people do of course come back for second</b>

169
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,625
<b>tours of duty later but tell me just a</b>

170
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:10,833
<b>little bit about</b>

171
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,166
<b>you know why you had so much confidence</b>

172
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,625
<b>and sort of excitement about coming to</b>

173
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,625
<b>darpa that you were willing to leave a</b>

175
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:20,416

01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,333
<b>innovative</b>

181
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:34,416
<b>scientific research and development and</b>

182
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,125
<b>leading the community to go do new</b>

183
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:39,375
<b>things that had always been my passion</b>

184
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:42,208
<b>and i didn't go into science and</b>

185
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:45,541
<b>technology for a a stable long-term</b>

186
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:47,875
<b>job at one place i wanted to make an</b>

187
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:50,125
<b>impact and darpa was clearly the way to</b>

188
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:51,166
<b>do that</b>

189
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:54,041
<b>what comes next we don't really know but</b>

190
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:56,125
<b>i feel like my life has been this series</b>

191
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,916
<b>of fortunate events that kind of stack</b>

192
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:00,750
<b>up and and i'm sure there'll be great</b>

193
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,333
<b>opportunities after i'm done here</b>

194
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:05,958
<b>well may that good fortune continue</b>

195
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,833
<b>so gordon now let's dive into your</b>

196
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:11,708
<b>portfolio of programs when i look at the</b>

197
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,541
<b>half dozen or so of the programs you you</b>

198
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,458
<b>have taken on i think one of them has</b>

199
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,625
<b>gone to completion that they're</b>

200
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,333
<b>thematically connected in several ways</b>

201
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:22,916
<b>one of them has to do with the design</b>

202
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,916
<b>and integration of micro devices that</b>

203
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,541
<b>manipulate and manage electrons and</b>

204
01:07:27,541 --> 01:07:29,958
<b>photons but also connecting all of the</b>

205
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,875
<b>technology work that you're doing is is</b>

206
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,958
<b>a kind of another sort of technology</b>

207
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:36,416
<b>advancement that i've seen at darpa can</b>

208
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:39,375
<b>be even more consequential than say an</b>

209
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,333
<b>initial invention and i'm talking here</b>

210
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:44,416
<b>about a term that we hear uh and you</b>

211
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:46,833
<b>hear in technology circles called c-swap</b>

212
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:49,000
<b>that's c-s-w-a-p</b>

213
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,458
<b>it refers to uh the challenge of taking</b>

214
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:53,250
<b>or transforming what originally are sort</b>

215
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,000
<b>of big expensive power hungry</b>

216
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,333
<b>technologies and making them smaller and</b>

217
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,333
<b>lighter and more energy efficient and</b>

218
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,625
<b>cheaper and this then opens them up to</b>

219
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:04,291
<b>kind of wider access because say they're</b>

220
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,583
<b>cheaper and not so unwieldy(笨重的) and</b>

221
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:07,541
<b>essentially you're taking something</b>

222
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,375
<b>that's impractical for many and making</b>

223
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:10,750
<b>it more practical</b>

224
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,000
<b>so it's those kind of two themes that i</b>

225
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,791
<b>see</b>

226
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:15,958
<b>and if you keep those in mind and</b>

227
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,125
<b>feel free to bring other themes in</b>

228
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,333
<b>as well</b>

229
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,375
<b>take me and listeners on a tour of your</b>

230
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,833
<b>programs</b>

231
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,666
<b>sure yeah well the</b>

232
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,750
<b>the term c-swap that you you bring up</b>

233
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,791
<b>you know it stands for cost size weight</b>

234
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:31,000
<b>and power</b>

235
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,791
<b>and it really is a way to quantify</b>

236
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:36,750
<b>uh the benefits of miniaturization</b>

237
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,625
<b>and</b>

238
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:39,333
<b>if i look at the portfolio of programs</b>

239
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,541
<b>that i've got i'd say there's sort of</b>

240
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:44,375
<b>two big themes the first is</b>

241
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:46,750
<b>generally optical microsystems</b>

242
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,625
<b>and the idea being if we</b>

243
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,791
<b>build systems out of very small</b>

244
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:52,916
<b>components</b>

245
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:55,000
<b>integrate them together</b>

246
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,750
<b>then we can make them</b>

247
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,625
<b>low-cost make them mobile deploy them</b>

248
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:02,500
<b>all over and add new functionality</b>

249
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,666
<b>typically the way we do these optical</b>

250
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:07,250
<b>microsystems is through another thing</b>

251
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,666
<b>that's sort of a theme of my programs</b>

252
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:11,083
<b>which is heterogeneous integration</b>

253
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,500
<b>and that means different things to</b>

254
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,500
<b>different people but really it's about</b>

255
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,416
<b>bringing different materials</b>

256
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:19,458
<b>technologies and functions together into</b>

257
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:20,125
<b>a</b>

258
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:22,833
<b>really small package we often</b>

259
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:25,333
<b>think of many of these programs as</b>

260
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:27,375
<b>creating some sort of capability in the</b>

261
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,708
<b>size of a sugar cube rather than a beach</b>

262
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,250
<b>ball</b>

263
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,208
<b>one that goes back a ways is</b>

264
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,375
<b>moab let's start with that one</b>

265
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:40,041
<b>modular optical aperture building blocks</b>

266
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:42,291
<b>and i remember first encountering this</b>

267
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,541
<b>and thinking</b>

268
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:45,875
<b>a sort of this remarkable idea of taking</b>

269
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,291
<b>what might be a whole system of lenses</b>

270
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,291
<b>you know think of a telescope or</b>

271
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:52,500
<b>binoculars or those are more familiar</b>

272
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,833
<b>ones but then uh in a way flattening</b>

273
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:57,250
<b>those down all into into something like</b>

274
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,166
<b>a more integrated kind of optical system</b>

275
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,833
<b>that would be much less bulky than the</b>

276
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,000
<b>originals you inherited that right and</b>

277
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,166
<b>so tell me a little bit about</b>

278
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,833
<b>what you got where you took it and where</b>

279
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:08,125
<b>it's at now</b>

280
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,875
<b>yeah great so moab was one of the</b>

281
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:12,666
<b>programs that i inherited back in 2017</b>

282
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:14,833
<b>when i arrived at darpa it's a great</b>

283
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:17,458
<b>example of this optical micro system</b>

284
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,333
<b>integration concept</b>

285
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:22,500
<b>and the idea is that most of the lidars</b>

286
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,375
<b>that we build today this is a laser for</b>

287
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:28,416
<b>3d ranging it's become really exciting</b>

288
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:30,708
<b>and enabling for autonomous vehicle</b>

289
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:33,458
<b>navigation also used on on your phone</b>

290
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,291
<b>perhaps to recognize you so typically</b>

291
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:38,375
<b>lidar systems that we use in in the</b>

292
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,833
<b>military are large systems they have a</b>

293
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:43,083
<b>telescope they have a gimbal</b>

294
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,916
<b>and they're hand assembled</b>

295
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:47,458
<b>right and so they tend to be big slow</b>

296
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,750
<b>expensive</b>

297
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,708
<b>and so MOABB is a program that looks to</b>

298
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:54,416
<b>shrink all of that down onto a chip</b>

299
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,583
<b>sort of like a postage stamp</b>

300
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:57,958
<b>non-mechanical</b>

301
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:00,916
<b>optical beam steering particularly for</b>

302
01:11:00,916 --> 01:11:03,083
<b>for lidar and other kinds of optical</b>

303
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:04,291
<b>techniques</b>

304
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,250
<b>and</b>

305
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,000
<b>a lot of this is done through</b>

306
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
<b>integrated photonics which allows you to</b>

307
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
<b>take discrete</b>

308
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,791
<b>optical functions like modulators or</b>

309
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:15,625
<b>lasers detectors</b>

310
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:18,291
<b>and put them into sort of micro scale</b>

311
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:19,875
<b>and then assemble them together onto a</b>

312
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,708
<b>chip and maybe put thousands or tens of</b>

313
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,875
<b>thousands of components on a chip that</b>

314
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,708
<b>you manufacture in a semiconductor</b>

315
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,958
<b>foundry just like you do with integrated</b>

316
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,625
<b>circuits</b>

317
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:32,291
<b>the program is now in phase three has</b>

318
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:33,375
<b>made</b>

319
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,125
<b>enormous progress we've had many world</b>

320
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,833
<b>records over the last few years scaling</b>

321
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,666
<b>this technology and</b>

322
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:43,625
<b>now it's actually being flight tested</b>

323
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:46,500
<b>and shows a path for doing things on on</b>

324
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,750
<b>small uavs and other kinds of mobile</b>

325
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:49,708
<b>systems</b>

326
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:52,041
<b>okay and do you imagine that those kinds</b>

327
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,875
<b>of systems are the ones where this</b>

328
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,708
<b>technology will see at least its</b>

329
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:57,958
<b>widest initial application or do you</b>

330
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,208
<b>imagine also that there are some other</b>

331
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:03,000
<b>very big application areas down the line</b>

332
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,916
<b>yeah that's a good question and you know</b>

333
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:06,666
<b>i'd say that for most of the integrated</b>

334
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:09,458
<b>photonics technologies that we look at</b>

335
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:13,333
<b>there is a very large commercial driver</b>

336
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,541
<b>for most of the things that we pursue</b>

337
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:16,750
<b>and so</b>

338
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,583
<b>if you think about the the engineering</b>

339
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,083
<b>cost of creating something like MOABB</b>

340
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:22,916
<b>there's a whole lot of upfront</b>

341
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,458
<b>development cost</b>

342
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:26,916
<b>eventually though you get to the point</b>

343
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:28,666
<b>where you can</b>

344
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,666
<b>essentially stamp these</b>

345
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:33,375
<b>chips out in a foundry</b>

346
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,375
<b>and</b>

347
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:36,041
<b>it would allow you to scale these to</b>

348
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:38,125
<b>sort of millions or hundreds of millions</b>

349
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,375
<b>of units</b>

350
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:40,375
<b>where the</b>

351
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:43,000
<b>the unit price can be very low and so</b>

352
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,375
<b>for for MOABB the path there is for</b>

353
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:49,375
<b>commercial automotive where you can see</b>

354
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:51,250
<b>you know there are hundreds of millions</b>

355
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,791
<b>of cars every year that need</b>

356
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:57,000
<b>lidar systems that are small compact</b>

357
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,375
<b>and so MOABB might be good for the dod</b>

358
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,125
<b>initially and in certain uh cases but</b>

<b>that you would use to</b>

<b>of the future for microelectronics but</b>

453
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:23,708

<b>where moore's law has sort of put us</b>

457
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,083

<b>better as you shrink it down</b>

462
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:44,041

463
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,041
<b>create all of this data on chip but you</b>

464
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,708
<b>can't move it from one place to another</b>

465
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:50,208
<b>very efficiently and we've reached a</b>

466

01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:55,333
<b>terms of total capacity and the energy</b>

468
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:57,333
<b>that we use to move data becomes</b>

469
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,250

<b>system</b>

471
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:02,208

<b>different solution and optics is that</b>

473

<b>solution</b>

474
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:08,208
<b>if you think about the internet or data</b>

475
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:11,333

01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:18,583

<b>emission and detection of light and then</b>

539
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,125
<b>those might be interconnected with glass</b>

540
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,958

<b>apart depending on the on the</b>

544
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:36,291
<b>application </b>
<b>- great thanks for those</b>

545
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,416
<b>details okay now i would like to</b>

546
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:40,500
<b>continue and talk about a couple of more</b>

547
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,000
<b>of your programs next let's move to</b>

548
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,708
<b>lumos which i think maybe is one of your</b>

549
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:48,291
<b>uh newest this stands for lasers for</b>

550
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:51,625
<b>universal micro scale optical systems</b>

551
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,791
<b>what are you up to with lumos</b>

552
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:56,291
<b>yeah so lumos is the program that i most</b>

553
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,000
<b>wanted to do when i came to darpa lumos</b>

554
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,958
<b>was</b>

555
01:19:59,958 --> 01:20:02,833
<b>it's a heterogeneous(异构) integration program</b>

556
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:05,250
<b>that that basically integrates new</b>

557
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,291
<b>materials in sort of a 3d way</b>

558
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:11,458
<b>onto semiconductor wafers (晶圆) and so</b>

559
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:14,041
<b>if you look at integrated photonics</b>

560
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:16,291
<b>today it's moved very fast in the last</b>

561
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:17,458
<b>decade</b>

562
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:19,708
<b>because silicon photonics has been very</b>

563
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:20,833
<b>successful</b>

564
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:23,958
<b>we use silicon in traditional</b>

565
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,708
<b>electronic circuits</b>

566
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:27,791
<b>and by leveraging the fabrication</b>

567
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:30,125
<b>techniques people have moved silicon</b>

568
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,250
<b>photonics forward very fast you can</b>

569
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,416
<b>fabricate</b>

570
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:36,375
<b>really complex</b>

571
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:38,750
<b>photonic integrated circuits</b>

572
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,750
<b>however silicon is actually not a great</b>

573
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,166
<b>material for optics</b>

574
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:45,458
<b>it's really good for fabrication but</b>

575
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:48,208
<b>it doesn't emit light at least not very</b>

576
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:50,291
<b>efficiently doesn't really detect most</b>

577
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,750
<b>of the light that we care about and it</b>

578
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,500
<b>doesn't do other effects like nonlinear</b>

579
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,416
<b>effects that we might care about</b>

580
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:59,166
<b>so LUMOS is about integrating materials</b>

581
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:01,791
<b>onto silicon or other other low loss</b>

582
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:02,833
<b>materials</b>

583
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:05,875
<b>particularly to make lasers so</b>

584
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,875
<b>lasers and amplifiers in the in the</b>

585
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:11,083
<b>optical space are really foundational</b>

586
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,375
<b>the laser was invented about 60 years</b>

587
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:15,625
<b>ago around the same time darpa actually</b>

588
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,166
<b>they co-evolved</b>

589
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:18,125
<b>yes</b>

590
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,625
<b>and you know people</b>

591
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,708
<b>realized really quickly that that lasers</b>

592
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:23,791
<b>were going to be really important they</b>

593
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:25,541
<b>shrunk them down to make semiconductor</b>

594
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:28,416
<b>lasers and you know we keep finding new</b>

595
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,666
<b>applications for for lasers silicon</b>

596
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,291
<b>photonics doesn't really have lasers and</b>

597
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:34,500
<b>so you need to integrate separate laser</b>

598
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,333
<b>chips to build up a system so LUMOS is</b>

599
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,708
<b>saying how do we put lasers directly</b>

600
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,875
<b>directly on these wafers and so the</b>

601
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:43,625
<b>teams are doing various things they're</b>

602
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:46,041
<b>they're growing compound semiconductors</b>

603
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,708
<b>right on top of silicon they're</b>

604
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,791
<b>integrating tiny little chiplets on</b>

605
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:52,041
<b>silicon they're doing non-linear</b>

606
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:54,583
<b>wavelength conversion so that we can</b>

607
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:56,666
<b>create new wavelengths maybe in the</b>

608
01:21:56,666 --> 01:22:00,208
<b>visible for quantum or atomic systems</b>

609
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,375
<b>and looking at how do you amplify light</b>

610
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,666
<b>to get to sort of watts of power on</b>

611
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,583
<b>these on these wafers</b>

612
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:08,666
<b>well so it sounds like tremendous amount</b>

613
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:10,666
<b>of versatility both kind of in the</b>

614
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:13,791
<b>spectrum element and also power</b>

615
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,166
<b>you know when you think of two or three</b>

616
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:16,750
<b>applications that would just tickle you</b>

617
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,583
<b>if you saw them getting out there in the</b>

618
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:19,333
<b>in</b>

619
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:21,791
<b>real life what comes to mind well so i</b>

620
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:23,333
<b>think that there's going to be a lot of</b>

621
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:25,458
<b>new applications beyond just moving data</b>

622
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:27,083
<b>around which is what photonics is used</b>

623
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:28,750
<b>for today so</b>

624
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,666
<b>so sensors for</b>

625
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:32,416
<b>positioning navigation and timing that's</b>

626
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:34,375
<b>a big thing that we care about in in the</b>

627
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:36,416
<b>dod but understanding where you are and</b>

628
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,041
<b>navigating in the world</b>

629
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:40,500
<b>often we make precision sensors with</b>

630
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,583
<b>with quantum systems or atomic systems</b>

631
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,166
<b>and you have to interface with atoms</b>

632
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:46,416
<b>every atom might be different it might</b>

633
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:49,166
<b>be a rubidium atom or a cesium atom</b>
<b>铷原子或铯原子</b>

634
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:51,375
<b>and LUMOS is trying to address this by</b>

635
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:53,166
<b>making a flexible platform that can</b>

636
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:56,583
<b>create really narrow line width lasers</b>

637
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:58,416
<b>at just about any wavelength that you</b>

638
01:22:58,416 --> 01:23:01,458
<b>care about on a chip right and is this</b>

639
01:23:01,458 --> 01:23:04,125
<b>where the optical frequency combs come</b>

640
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,375
<b>in which i've been hearing about and</b>

641
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,041
<b>actually had a little bit of a challenge</b>

642
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:10,291
<b>with a public affairs colleague of mine</b>

643
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:12,833
<b>uh to see if we could uh just if you</b>

644
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:14,416
<b>could describe that in a way that most</b>

645
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:15,875
<b>people would understand</b>

646
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:18,041
<b>well sure i can i can give it a try so</b>

647
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:20,750
<b>uh yeah optical frequency combs have</b>

648
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:24,291
<b>seen sort of a huge explosion of advance</b>

649
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:27,541
<b>in the last few years the idea is</b>

650
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:30,291
<b>typically using non-linear techniques we</b>

651
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:32,583
<b>go from a single optical frequency if</b>

652
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,375
<b>you think of a laser it's sort of one</b>

653
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:37,958
<b>single color and we create a number of</b>

654
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:39,875
<b>different frequencies that are all</b>

655
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,666
<b>equally spaced in the frequency spectrum</b>

656
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:45,458
<b>if you think of them looking like a comb</b>

657
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:46,916
<b>that you would you know comb your hair</b>

658
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:49,083
<b>with each one of these tones equally</b>

659
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,708
<b>spaced this essentially becomes a very</b>

660
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:54,416
<b>precise ruler and it can be used in many</b>

661
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:56,583
<b>different applications can be used for</b>

662
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:59,250
<b>frequency metrology it can be used for</b>

663
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,541
<b>spatial metrology</b>

664
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:04,416
<b>and it's really created a whole new area</b>

665
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:06,666
<b>of science and applications including</b>

666
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:09,458
<b>some of my other programs uh like DODOS</b>

667
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:11,791
<b>and griffin okay we'll get to that just</b>

668
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:13,333
<b>in one minute but some i was thinking</b>

669
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,583
<b>about these</b>

670
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,375
<b>optical frequency combs the other day</b>

671
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,125
<b>sitting back on my deck and i was</b>

672
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:21,333
<b>wondering like if in addition to</b>

673
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:23,250
<b>kind of specifying</b>

674
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,291
<b>this</b>

675
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:26,833
<b>you know range of frequencies if if you</b>

676
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,750
<b>can individually</b>

677
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:32,375
<b>also determine and specify the intensity</b>

678
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:34,500
<b>of each of those frequencies because</b>

679
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,375
<b>with that then you'd be able to kind of</b>

680
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:37,625
<b>simulate</b>

681
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:38,583
<b>the</b>

<b>color</b>

<b>experience of any particular thing like</b>

01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:44,916
<b>a leaf or wood and the way each of those</b>

685
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:47,541
<b>absorbs and emits a different</b>

686
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,041
<b>portfolio of light frequencies can you</b>

687
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,791
<b>do that with an optical frequency comb</b>

688
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:53,625
<b>or are all of those component</b>

689
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,291
<b>frequencies the teeth of the comb as it</b>

690
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,750
<b>were or tones as you refer to them</b>

691
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,166
<b>are they all the same intensity well so</b>

692
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,250
<b>typically they start out maybe similar</b>

693
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:05,000
<b>in intensity but you can certainly</b>

694
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,958
<b>modulate each one of them and and create</b>

695
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:10,375
<b>just about any spectrum that you want</b>

696
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:11,541
<b>and so</b>

697
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:13,166
<b>you know one of the</b>

698
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:15,083
<b>clear uses for optical frequency combs</b>

699
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:18,125
<b>would be for spectral sensing and so you</b>

700
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:20,750
<b>could imagine creating thousands of of</b>

701
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,083
<b>tones at different frequencies</b>

702
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:26,375
<b>and sensing maybe a gas plume and</b>

<b>understanding exactly which molecules</b>

704
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,375

01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:02,375
<b>and then modulate each one and now you</b>

718
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:04,583
<b>have hundreds of of optical channels</b>

719
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:07,375
<b>each carrying their own data</b>

720
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,000
<b>yeah astonishing</b>

721
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,458
<b>so let's finish out your</b>

722
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:14,666
<b>tour of programs with with two that are</b>

723
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,041
<b>related</b>

724
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:18,125
<b>and one preceded the other i'm referring</b>

725
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:21,541
<b>here to the two programs known as dodos</b>

726
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:23,458
<b>and griffin</b>

727
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:26,916
<b>and i'll let you spell those out and</b>

728
01:26:26,916 --> 01:26:28,125
<b>tell me</b>

729
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,750
<b>the technology trajectory that they</b>

01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,416
<b>amount to</b>

731
01:26:32,416 --> 01:26:33,708
<b>sure so</b>

732
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:37,791
<b>dodos is uh the direct on-chip digital</b>

733
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:40,583
<b>optical synthesizer this is a program i</b>

734
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:42,666
<b>inherited also when i arrived back in</b>

735
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:46,208
<b>2017 it's a fantastic program and it's a</b>

736
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:47,958
<b>little esoteric so for people that</b>

737
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:51,166
<b>aren't in the optical physics space</b>

738
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,541
<b>it'll take just a minute to explain but</b>

739
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,708
<b>if you're familiar with microwave and</b>

740
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:59,000
<b>radio frequency technologies the direct</b>

741
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,958
<b>digital synthesizer or dds</b>

742
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:05,250
<b>is commonplace today in a radio in your</b>

743
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:07,875
<b>car you no longer have a tuning knob</b>

744
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:10,375
<b>that you kind of have to tweak and find</b>

745
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:12,125
<b>the right frequency</b>

746
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,875
<b>instead you just hit a button and your</b>

747
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:16,375
<b>radio goes there it generates the right</b>

748
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:19,541
<b>frequency optics today is kind of still</b>

749
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:22,500
<b>stuck in the microwave world of the 60s</b>

750
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,666
<b>where we build a laser</b>

751
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:26,375
<b>and then we measure what the output</b>

752
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:28,375
<b>wavelength is or the frequency you might</b>

753
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:30,291
<b>be able to lock it to something but you</b>

754
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:32,916
<b>don't really just tell it where to go</b>

755
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:35,625
<b>and dodos which is looking to make an</b>

756
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:38,500
<b>optical analog of the dds</b>

757
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,416
<b>is trying to do that we just finished</b>

758
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:42,416
<b>dodos this year and made enormous</b>

759
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:45,166
<b>strides and the idea is if you use</b>

760
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:47,791
<b>optical frequency combs as your ruler</b>

761
01:27:47,791 --> 01:27:50,208
<b>and some microwave techniques where we</b>

762
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:52,416
<b>know frequencies very well hopefully you</b>

763
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:54,416
<b>can create</b>

764
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:56,916
<b>optical frequencies with incredible</b>

765
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:59,791
<b>precision and accuracy and so in fact</b>

766
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:02,291
<b>under DODOS we've we've seen many many</b>

767
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:03,875
<b>orders of magnitude improvement in the</b>

768
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:06,500
<b>accuracy of of optical frequencies and</b>

769
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,791
<b>this is all using chip scale</b>

770
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,208
<b>technologies so again trying to to take</b>

771
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:12,375
<b>technologies that today look like a a</b>

772
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:14,916
<b>room or a rack and put it into the size</b>

773
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:17,083
<b>of a sugar cube right and just to help</b>

774
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:19,166
<b>listeners who might be impressed that</b>

775
01:28:19,166 --> 01:28:21,458
<b>you can get the highest precision on a</b>

776
01:28:21,458 --> 01:28:23,458
<b>frequency might be impressed by that</b>

777
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:25,375
<b>capability but it doesn't know why what</b>

778
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:27,625
<b>do we get from that well sort of again</b>

779
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:30,583
<b>like changing the paradigm(范例) the way that</b>

780
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:33,708
<b>digital synthesis did for radios we also</b>

781
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,000
<b>use optical frequencies for</b>

782
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,375
<b>communications</b>

783
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:38,583
<b>and so you could imagine incredible</b>

784
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:40,500
<b>improvements in</b>

785
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,750
<b>optical communications by having</b>

786
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,750
<b>precision control of frequencies at both</b>

787
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:45,541
<b>ends</b>

788
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:49,000
<b>essentially doing coherent communications(相干通信)</b>

789
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,041
<b>where both sides know</b>

790
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:52,375
<b>what wavelengths are being communicated</b>

791
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:55,541
<b>very precisely or you could do precision</b>

792
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:58,500
<b>uh lidar where maybe you have one source</b>

793
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,125
<b>emitting and a different source</b>

794
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:02,500
<b>receiving it's also important for for</b>

795
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,833
<b>doing optical sensing where you perhaps</b>

796
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:05,875
<b>know</b>

797
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:07,541
<b>the precise wavelength of different</b>

798
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:10,375
<b>transitions for different molecules or</b>

799
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:13,458
<b>again quantum anatomic sensors</b>

800
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,333
<b>okay and then just one more point on</b>

801
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:16,666
<b>this one because as you were talking</b>

802
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:19,875
<b>about you know if i know and can produce</b>

803
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:22,125
<b>an extremely um you know precise</b>

804
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:23,333
<b>frequency</b>

805
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:25,333
<b>for communication and i want my</b>

806
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:27,708
<b>recipient to be able to do that same</b>

807
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:29,958
<b>thing or if my recipient can that sounds</b>

808
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,458
<b>like it would open up kind of you know</b>

809
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,958
<b>privacy and security channels</b>

810
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,541
<b>yeah that's a great point you could</b>

811
01:29:35,541 --> 01:29:38,916
<b>certainly do that so DODOS was the prior</b>

812
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:41,000
<b>program that led into GRYPHON talk about</b>

813
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,083
<b>GRYPHON right so as we got near the end</b>

814
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:46,583
<b>of DODOS we saw this this great advance</b>

815
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:49,083
<b>in technology in fact i should say that</b>

816
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,666
<b>under dodos</b>

817
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:52,833
<b>perhaps the biggest outcome here was</b>

818
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:55,250
<b>seeing the whole community</b>

819
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:58,208
<b>get excited about non-linear photonics</b>

820
01:29:58,208 --> 01:29:59,625
<b>we had</b>

821
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:01,625
<b>from the the performers under DODOS we</b>

822
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:04,125
<b>had well over a hundred peer-reviewed</b>

823
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:05,708
<b>journal submissions</b>

824
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,291
<b>and we had more than 25</b>

825
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:10,583
<b>high impact journals in in the nature</b>

826
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,750
<b>and science suite of journals</b>

827
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,166
<b>this is really changing the field and</b>

828
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:16,750
<b>there's whole sessions at conferences</b>

829
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,833
<b>now on DODOS's technology</b>

830
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:21,000
<b>now on to GRYPHON</b>

831
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,541
<b>which stands for generating rf with</b>

832
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:25,958
<b>photonic oscillators for low noise it's</b>

833
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,333
<b>a little bit of a stretch but we like</b>

834
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,250
<b>the name the GRYPHON  program is a</b>

835
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,500
<b>recognition that if you can make</b>

836
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,375
<b>extremely precise frequencies in the</b>

837
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:33,958
<b>optical domain</b>

838
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:36,208
<b>and then divide those frequencies down</b>

839
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:39,000
<b>from these sort of 100 terahertz</b>

840
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,458
<b>frequencies down to the microwave</b>

841
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:43,250
<b>you actually reduce noise when you do</b>

842
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,916
<b>that and that means you can get</b>

843
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:46,375
<b>incredibly</b>

844
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:49,083
<b>precise low phase noise oscillators in</b>

845
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:50,666
<b>the microwave regime</b>

846
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:51,541
<b>so</b>

847
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,375
<b>oscillators</b>

848
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:55,625
<b>are important in our entire world right</b>

<b>they</b>

850
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:59,875
<b>they form the clock that drives every</b>

<b>precise microwave oscillators</b>

857

<b>noise very quiet</b>

859
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:20,916
<b>essentially a pure tone if you think of</b>

<b>it is something that's sort of an</b>

<b>exquisite oscillator and it gets used in</b>

01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:35,250
<b>again exquisite systems but using</b>

<b>GRYPHON kinds of techniques or dodo's</b>

<b>oscillators(振荡器) not with RF(射频) electronics</b>

<b>that was kind of an amazing tour of all</b>

897
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:47,541
<b>of these programs i mean when i think of</b>

898
01:32:47,541 --> 01:32:50,416
<b>the technical challenges when i think of</b>

899
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,583
<b>the probably dozens of research</b>

900
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:55,000
<b>performers who are working across these</b>

901
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,458
<b>half dozen or so programs and you</b>

902
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:59,625
<b>keeping track of all of them and</b>

903
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:01,958
<b>and seeing how they can all integrate</b>

904
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:04,916
<b>and synthesize uh you have really got a</b>

905
01:33:04,916 --> 01:33:07,333
<b>lot on your shoulders i uh give you some</b>

906
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:09,083
<b>pats on the back for doing all that and</b>

907
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,208
<b>it's exciting to think about the</b>

908
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:12,208
<b>technologies that will move forward so</b>

909
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:14,125
<b>before we kind of come in for a landing</b>

910
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:15,958
<b>here i just want to see was there</b>

911
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:18,416
<b>anything that you thought of afterwards</b>

912
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:20,750
<b>from any of these programs that you know</b>

913
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,291
<b>you'd like to just share with listeners</b>

914
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:24,208
<b>before i do take you in for a landing</b>

915
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:27,166
<b>and liberate you so i think that there's</b>

916
01:33:27,166 --> 01:33:29,375
<b>a whole lot of unknowns as to where this</b>

917
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,708
<b>technology could go and there's a lot of</b>

918
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:35,000
<b>potential and so you know i worry about</b>

919
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,333
<b>occasionally on our DARPA  programs which</b>

920
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:39,333
<b>are very focused right we're trying to</b>

921
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:41,958
<b>solve one particular problem that that</b>

922
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:44,208
<b>we're missing things there's</b>

923
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:45,791
<b>there's other things like you know</b>

924
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:48,583
<b>biosensing or medical applications</b>

925
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:51,250
<b>and so we need to to kind of look at the</b>

926
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,000
<b>big picture and always keep looking for</b>

927
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,458
<b>new opportunities i would say that one</b>

928
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:56,833
<b>thing i want to make sure that the</b>

929
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,208
<b>listeners hear</b>

930
01:33:58,208 --> 01:33:59,375
<b>is that</b>

931
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:02,666
<b>good ideas come from everywhere and</b>

932
01:34:02,666 --> 01:34:04,750
<b>you mentioned the limited tenure that we</b>

933
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,375
<b>have at DARPA we're always looking for</b>

934
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:09,375
<b>new people and so if you've got ideas i</b>

935
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,000
<b>care a lot about</b>

936
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,833
<b>optical microsystems so for sure come</b>

937
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:14,750
<b>see me if you've got ideas in this area</b>

938
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:17,333
<b>but you know get involved DARPA is not</b>

939
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:19,083
<b>one person or one place it's a</b>

940
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,916
<b>collection of people that are excited</b>

941
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:23,333
<b>about moving technology forward and so</b>

942
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:24,916
<b>you know maybe you want to be a program</b>

943
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:26,833
<b>manager maybe you want to work as a STAEA</b>

944
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,666
<b>maybe you want to be a performer and</b>

945
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:31,625
<b>keep doing research but uh reach out and</b>

946
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,458
<b>get involved with darpa</b>

947
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:35,083
<b>all right you hear that listeners it's a</b>

948
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:37,166
<b>pitch for you guys to get in touch and i</b>

949
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:39,875
<b>should point out that the acronym aceta</b>

950
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:44,500
<b>stands for the scientific technical and engineering </b>
<b>assistance</b>

951
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,375
<b>who</b>

952
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:47,333
<b>work with program managers like you,</b>

953
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:49,083
<b>Gordon, to take</b>

954
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,666
<b>programs through their entire life</b>

955
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:52,125
<b>cycles</b>

956
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:54,041
<b>so as i see it you're kind of in the</b>

957
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:56,125
<b>business of turning science fiction or</b>

958
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:59,166
<b>at least sort of visions of technology</b>

959
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:02,208
<b>into reality we've talked about a num a</b>

960
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:04,125
<b>number of the ways you're trying to do</b>

961
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:06,750
<b>that but i'm wondering if as a kind of a</b>

962
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:08,583
<b>技术狂热</b>
<b>technophile and a technology developer</b>

963
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:11,166
<b>yourself do you dream about non-existent</b>

964
01:35:11,166 --> 01:35:12,416
<b>technologies</b>

965
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:14,375
<b>not yet hear technologies that you wish</b>

966
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:18,416
<b>were real things yeah well</b>

967
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:20,291
<b>you know right now</b>

968
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:21,541
<b>time travel</b>

969
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:24,125
<b>or maybe slowing time down</b>

970
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,708
<b>there's so much</b>

971
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:27,000
<b>that i want to do</b>

972
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,916
<b>and you know sometimes it's at work</b>

973
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:31,000
<b>sometimes it's it's being at home with</b>

974
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,666
<b>the family sometimes it's it's going and</b>

975
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:34,416
<b>doing other things and there's just not</b>

976
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:36,833
<b>enough time that would be it</b>

977
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:38,666
<b>right so that would be a technology that</b>

978
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:40,833
<b>would kind of end the lament(抱怨) that we all</b>

979
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:43,625
<b>have you know so many books not enough</b>

980
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:45,958
<b>time you know so so many careers to</b>

981
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:47,541
<b>pursue not enough somebody might want to</b>

982
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:49,333
<b>climb not enough time gordon i think if</b>

983
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,583
<b>you can actually solve that problem</b>

984
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:52,375
<b>that's the one you will be most uh</b>

985
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:54,375
<b>remembered for though i don't think</b>

986
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,708
<b>that's going to be a darpa program as</b>

987
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,250
<b>far as i know who knows</b>

988
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:59,166
<b>but you might be able to pitch that to</b>

989
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:01,083
