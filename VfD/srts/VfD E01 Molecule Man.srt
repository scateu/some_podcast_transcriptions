00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:32,227
Soft technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand alternative operation technologies , a driver of our , since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt that offended that research project agency has been a driver of technology . 

2
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:36,460
Welcome to voices a window entitled with core of program managers . 

3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,530
Their job to redefine was possible . 

4
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,990
My name is taiwan acquainted since two thousand and thirteen , i've been a program manager in darkness . 

5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,950
Defense science is office , and i'm your dark host . 

6
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,381
Taylor , elected startup , which is sort of learning a little bit about you as a program manager . 

7
00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:03,292
So maybe you could tell us something about your background and how that relates to the kinds of programs you then developing . 

8
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:13,290
And i've been a molecular day , I love molecules I have since I was in high school and even beyond high schools are earlier . 

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah , i'm a server nova junky . 

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,560
Because most billions and billions of stars . 

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:31,531
Well , I was more interested in the billions of militaries i've always wanted to be an exploring , but the time I got the age , yeah , I might explore something all the year charted . 

12
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:35,395
Plans have been charged , and there were no more uncharted planes . 

13
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,122
So I looked at kind of frontiers that did . 

14
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:49,890
Did you couldn't see and molecules fit that look more defined in physics , because you can put it in a bottle all at times , especially in the area that I am very comfortable in organic synthesis . 

15
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,300
You can make stuff and insert . 

16
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,940
You can test the properties , and you can play with the combination of items that are together . 

17
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,430
And in really , it was sorted . 

18
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,490
This palette that I could play with . 

19
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,590
Then I really like that . 

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:20,460
It was exploring the world in a totally different way , always been amazed that have just putting together items and certain geometries , certain bonding patterns and can come together in two materials with all kinds of different properties in a scheme and bonus at the crazy rate . 

21
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:34,940
I mean , you go from having something they can buy to something that explodes to something that makes beautiful colors to something that makes your cookie smell great and taste great events , all chemistry , your molecules . 

22
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,440
Guy , no , galaxy are not that many molecules . 

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,210
People do your double , which is interesting . 

24
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:56,678
So as a wrap of this minority , how are you taking that interesting in the form of programs in the defense scientist office , one of the things that is going on right now , one of the ziggy's is revolutionized . 

25
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:08,873
How do we do science better , and one of the means that is interesting about chemistry , especially when we're talking about the makers , the people who make materials , make medicines . 

26
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,741
It is especially slow process . 

27
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:17,870
I really like the idea of reinventing scientists and in chemistry , there is a lot of opportunity to reinvent the science . 

28
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:25,240
So I ask , when you say we invented science , maybe you mean the actual process that we were asking questions that we were trying to answer those questions . 

29
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,333
Can you be a little more detailed about , what would you have ? 

30
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,152
Men , chemistry is a tough subject . 

31
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:46,650
We have lots of primaries that we don't often know how are controlling them , but if we did all of the chemistry in much more controlled environment , where the environment was being monitored , we might come up with much , much more reproducible chemistry , which will then mean it can be transportation . 

32
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:59,930
So in other words , if I have a machine that is doing the chemical reaction , recording how it does the net code that record can be sent from one love to another , so you could accelerate the same way to the end . 

33
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:15,830
Internet allows you to accelerate how information was transport , what if you could do that with molecules , tell you this might be a good time to talk a little bit about the two of the programs that you're working on , and what I have in mind is the full effect program , and they make it program . 

34
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:37,710
So when we start with full effect , full effects , that's a program , it stands for a full , did non natural with biological function in the photo , fact , program were making polymers that meet natural polymers so that we might biotherapeutics moral bust . 

35
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:47,451
So right now , if you get one of the more modern drugs right now , a good portion of them are made from proteins , and some people like it , I entire bodies . 

36
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:53,125
So , for example , humana or installing those are examples of protein biotherapeutics . 

37
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,488
The problems they are not heat stable . 

38
00:04:55,488 --> 00:05:00,471
And if something is in heat stable , it's not going to end up in a except . 

39
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:04,240
So our soldiers are a very place , rather than to be most . 

40
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:22,656
Bono's boomer don't have access to the most banks , medicines , as many of them are just gradual , and so we have to transport them back to an environment where you have refrigerators , you have a handling equipment that can allow you to control that the environment around the medicine . 

41
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,953
What if you want to make an unnatural ? 

42
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:32,761
There are lots of natural fibers that we used to use , and we've replaced them with non natural fivers , because they're more robust . 

43
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,140
Do you mean like silk to ? 

44
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,387
So what if he wanted to take the same ? 

45
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:44,610
So the beneficial properties are yet from plastics , and you were emerging with the beneficial properties of the biological balloons , like proteins in DNA . 

46
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,000
The full effect program that is a platform . 

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,150
It's about how we make those in and how we discover them . 

48
00:05:50,570 --> 00:06:17,190
So in a way , if you think about all of the possible molecules that one could make the small ones , you know , like , like an aspirin or the below larger ones like these protein based medicines you're talking about , they're really sort of being infinitive to possibilities , like an infinite space that you could possibly search an example which you say here is your trying to develop some tools , even just a few people took to go explore some of the regions of this influenced space . 

49
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,980
They just have not been looked at before . 

50
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,450
I'm getting on my own track . 

51
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,780
Oh , you're so on track . 

52
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,260
It gets back to my whole desire to explore that . 

53
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:33,543
I talked about , you know , but it is really about giving researchers a capability to be able to explore these , these universes . 

54
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:39,690
It's almost like a hubble telescope for this particular galaxy or universal regular space . 

55
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,830
So that was full of effects . 

56
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,570
Young , i'm also interested in the makeup program . 

57
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,300
Can you say little bit about what you're doing there make it is a platform technology for making small . 

58
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,200
And in this particular case , we're trying to do is we're trying to democratize chemistry . 

59
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:22,640
So what if you could have a system that biologists or any scientists came up and type , and the machine figured out how to make it , even if there was no recipe available so that the machine would figure out a possible set of ways to make something , and then we'll go about testing each one of those ways and tell it on the solution , and it would log that solution in a cloud or in its data bank . 

60
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,600
And now that molecule could be made any time . 

61
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:33,000
In addition , the system would also be able to have to make more of so that initially , I would do really small scale sympathies . 

62
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,380
That means milligrams . 

63
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,820
And then once it figured out a solution , it would also automatically scale it up . 

64
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,960
Can you offer to us a concrete example ? 

65
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,490
maybe you could think of a, 这个时候我们就可以看到这样的一种方式了。

66
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:58,870
在此之前也许会有很多不同的东西可能会有interacting with that the receptor in perhaps solving medical or other biological problem . 

67
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:07,390
Yeah , you know , for example , one very popular target for the heart disease is PCSKnine . 

68
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,410
And so there's probably many papers that come out every year . 

69
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,122
They describe inhibitors that have been discovered against that target . 

70
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,123
The structures are available . 

71
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:28,740
Let's say that I am a researcher , and I want to study some aspect of a complex soil system and having access to the PC inhibitor would be really useful . 

72
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:39,700
But maybe I wanted to selective in a certain way that is commercially available , but somebody is reported now , I might contact that researcher who is made it before . 

73
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,490
Maybe they ran out , and it can take them three months to make it . 

74
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:52,340
But if I have access to make it device , I could just go tie business structure and half the material , maybe the next day , or at the end of the week . 

75
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,340
And in addition to that , I have it memorized . 

76
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,750
The machine has kept that in his memory . 

77
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:18,570
Banks , university environment , for example , wants to make that they typed it in a little bit out that day , because the solution would be , it's a way of saying chemistry has been documented since its inception , especially santa chemistry , through what a colleague experimental . 

78
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,760
These are documents that the researcher is using to try to capture what they didn't . 

79
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
A laboratory make something to write a dynamic recipe . 

80
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:34,040
So a lot of times will leave out that we think are not necessary , but are necessary . 

81
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,600
And sometimes we didn't even know there were necessary . 

82
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:44,890
So when another researcher comes in and try to read that cookbook like a experimental , it might take the month to reproduce it , and it may never . 

83
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:55,590
Why should we waste our human effort by not making sure that we document that outcome , that experiment in a way that can guarantee production . 

84
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,980
So you're talking about capturing procedural knowledge . 

85
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:08,830
Correct , yes , the magic system is not just the artificial intelligence system or a cloud system is archiving . 

86
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,196
It's a machine that's doing the chemistry so that the machine will be reproducible . 

87
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:41,760
You'll be able to recreate that machine in any love you want , as long as you replicate that machine faithfully , and it runs the routines that you recorded one lab versus another faithfully , you're going to reproduce chemistry everywhere you want to one of the things that I find fascinating about that , but is that it is perhaps unit in its place in the overall technology development ecosystem . 

88
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,700
And as a program manager and someone who has been an academy , I think , also an industry . 

89
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:58,625
And now here a doubt , can you talk to us a little bit about how darker might be playing some interesting or perhaps even unique roles in the overall technology ecosystem . 

90
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,950
And yeah , it is a very exciting role . 

91
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:12,110
Darker is that one place where we are thinking about innovation on constraint , like , where can we go ? 

92
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,370
No , in my mind , the way remember doing that is because it fits our mission space . 

93
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,435
If you want to create a prevent surprise , it's best to get to that new universe of chemistry sooner rather than later . 

94
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,729
And so we take innovations from all of the other funding agencies . 

95
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:36,508
In other words , they're seeding it , and we look for one away with the beginning , and we pushed hard and not across . 

96
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:55,640
The fact just double is critical because we are structuring what I consider to be that christian investment , as we are trending towards something amazing , and the internet is an example , and I am really immunity net with , make it . 

97
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,580
I want to create the internet of molecules . 

98
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:05,350
How do you change for molecules from one place to another in the same way is a three day printing concept ? 

99
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,700
You have a design . 

100
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,460
You could put a design and a cloud . 

101
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,410
And then if you have three printer , you could transfer that design from one place to . 

102
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,640
So they are related . 

103
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,040
And I have been no , constantly inspired by what dark has done . 

104
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:31,640
Is there a question , tyler , that you wish I had asked you during the discussion that I didn't , even so ask the question yourself and answer , what's my favorite aspect of chemistry ? 

105
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,938
The answer for most cameras ? 

106
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:35,727
What , what's the answer for ? 

107
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:42,627
Most cabinet cameras dive , and you know , I love that the structure of molecule relates to the function . 

108
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,650
Now I love them . 

109
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,750
Yeah , most of my friends media is for the crowd magnets . 

110
00:12:47,020 --> 00:13:11,790
I guess everybody likes explosions , but I actually like the smell of organic chemistry , so pretty much amongst all actors like people going to like one flavors are thinking of , maybe it omit chocolate cheap , but actually smelling all of the esters and wondering , I wonder if that's disaster , or that I strength and tell the fluctuations , and also an astronaut refers to a particular chemical motive . 

111
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,260
If I recall of my own organization must be part of it . 

112
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:24,600
There's a carbon with the oxygen job , abandon a few other things we don't have to go into the details , except to say that is a particular kind of molecular motivated and variations . 

113
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,130
Yeah , classic compounds . 

114
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:36,720
So I, Ireally like the class of compounds that are associated with flavourings , and I don't mean just not a natural flavorings and natural unnaturally a coconut . 

115
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,970
It smells the way it does because of chemistry , and that that always just really makes me excited . 

116
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,490
The teller I really enjoyed talking with you today about the your programs by chemistry , by dark . 

117
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:59,930
So thanksgiving , you , I mean , it's always a pleasure to build you , and thanks for having me and really glad to relate my thoughts about chemistry and and thank you listeners for sharing this time with us . 

118
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,390
Tony , next time for another voice from double.
