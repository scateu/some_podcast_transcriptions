1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:20,158
Going to a science or engineering laboratory , close your eyes and listen in a biomedical lab , you might be an ultra central , huge raving up as a separate to the components of assemble in a mysql proportion research facility . 

2
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:26,850
You may hear the aggressive white noise from a test burn of a new experimental jet fuel in a computer simulation center . 

3
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,800
You might hear the harm from a variable or*****ra of cooling events in each setting . 

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,130
You can hear a sonic finger print of what goes on there . 

5
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,500
Welcome back to sounds of innovation , a feature of our Voices from darker parkers . 

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,070
My name is iphone motel on your dark house in each sounds of innovation feature . 

7
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:52,475
You'll hear some of the soundscapes of research and development in the moments they are happening and learn just a little bit about what new capabilities . 

8
00:00:52,475 --> 00:01:03,940
Those things my friends go to the doctor , program managers and their teams , as well as to the research performers working under contract for those teams , for help in harvesting the sound , you are about to hear . 

9
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,240
In each case , I first will play the sound without telling you what it is as you listen , try to guess where the sound comes from . 

10
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,720
Then I will tell you , alright , here we go . 

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,360
Let me give you a few hints about these first two sound clips . 

12
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,210
One hit is that they come from researchers working on dark as persistent a quarter , leaving sensors program , or pales . 

13
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,980
Another hint is that you are not about to hear recordings of big fat rain drops slamming onto A. 

14
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,480
Now , for the second clip , it sounds little sad. 

15
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,186
What is coming to both of those clips is the right of crackling noises . 

16
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:01,122
They derive from a real life's superpower will die . 

17
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:17,441
A common committee and widespread secretary , known as snapping shrimp , turns out that these two cinema cross stations have some specialized cloud enemy , a tightly fitting pegging cup of sorts that can do wonders when the shrimp slams the pig into the cup structure . 

18
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,662
It produces a tiny jet water this interim generates . 

19
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:43,232
And I am not making this up a super carbon trading under sea bubble that , in mere microseconds , developed five thousand degree temperatures in midst a flash of light , and then as ocean pressure instantly squeeze the back out of existence , what amounts to an underwater club of thunder , one thousands of the shampoo snapping it sounds like a pumpkin popcorn , a hardware . 

20
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:45,290
Or , as some have described it from. 

21
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,980
The energy from these implanting bubbles can stand and even kill nearby prayer , just what the snapping trip need to see the unresilient of another day . 

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:15,640
Just a few more specifics on those sounds , the first one you heard was picked up from a hydrophone placed by the peer at town point in north africa , beginner by team of powers , research performers from the government due university and the underwater technology from cold octopus . 

23
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:24,330
The second sound clip was captured six thousand miles away by a set of power's performers from the neighborhood warfare center , based in new port . 

24
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,495
In their case , the hydrophone was immersed in the whale friendly waters by her poorer hawaii . 

25
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:34,660
One working , you might be asking yourself why dark cares about all of these snapping shrimp . 

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,190
Well , because it is possible to think of all those swimming snaps as millions of sooner pinks get a good enough . 

27
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:54,840
Understanding , uphold those pings , bounce of objects and get good enough of gathering and analyzing those are , and you just might be able to create a global partnership with snapping shrimp to improve maritime situation . 

28
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,300
Awareness about what is in the water , where things are in the water and what they are . 

29
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:11,478
The next audio clip comes from an engineering research firm in new hampshire , working on a critical technology of interest to program manager steve , comedian of the agency , tactical technology . 

30
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:25,240
Obvious , which you need to know before you listen to is that I had to slice and splace what was originally an eighty second clip into a much shorter version that you would be willing to listen to the progression of towns provides you as a hint about your hearing . 

31
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,830
It's a big journey . 

32
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,730
So hang in there. 

33
00:04:47,440 --> 00:05:04,490
What you heard in the clip is an experimental , compact turban generator system with the microphone , approximately six feet from the test stand , you heard it increasing from a startup speed using an electric start to a speed of over sixty thousand revolutions permitted for RPM. 

34
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,720
That's an assumption rate of . 

35
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:18,255
Are you sitting down a thousand revolutions per second and its ultimate rotation speed will be over twice that novel and advanced proportion systems , including ones for unmanned vehicles . 

36
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:26,490
Instrumentally are under his research menu , this potential component , a hybrid electric turbo alternator about the size of a washing machines . 

37
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:33,730
Chamber , is being designed by engineers at britain , energy inhabitant , new at the fantastic rotation speeds . 

38
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,378
It can achieve the turbulence . 

39
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:50,570
Compressive developed enough pressure to support stable and extremely efficient computation using a variety of fuels , and then can start generating access electrical power four up to thirty five kilos of power at one hundred and thirty thousand . 

40
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,409
The technology is intended for multiple users . 

41
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,637
Among them grounded aerial hybrid . 

42
00:05:56,637 --> 00:06:10,520
Electric vehicles were man's men and unmanned a , according to the dark team interested in this research , the technology could be enabled for small to medium hybrid electric aircraft platforms , rather than developing proportion itself . 

43
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:19,816
Disturbance concept efficiently converts fuel compulsions into electricity to run the vehicles , electric models , which , in turn can power fans or propellers . 

44
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:22,040
The electricity can also provide sensors . 

45
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:39,484
A terrible alternative like this can shift the design paradigm for aerospace designers by loosening restrictions on engine policemen , the ability of the device to run on various fuels further , as I will close out this sounds of innovation episode with a trio of audio clips . 

46
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:54,820
They're from the so called foundery of a boston based biotechnology research performer , with , especially in requesting bacterial cells into new and useful forms , analysis to the way a traditional foundry cats and requests metal into useful shapes. 

47
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,840
Here's the second clip. 

48
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,040
Now , for the final clip of the trial. 

49
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,048
That first sound , the one with a throne to it , it comes interview to the gingle buyer works . 

50
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,773
Researchers used to concentrated bacteria cells into a deco palace . 

51
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:28,195
These cell concentrates become the focus of other experiments and measurements , such as DNA analysis for determining which genes correctly sympathized , were assembled or tests to see if an introduced gene leads to an expected activity at a top speed insurer clip , the central future reached a spinning rate about four thousand two hundred revolutions , the true break inside the central future was well balanced . 

52
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:35,330
That's why the machines thrown , rather than make a wrecker the way of washing machine does when a unbalanced load of clothes enters the state . 

53
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:47,463
The second sound you heard comes from what dingo folks referred to as an integrated workshop is a highly automated robotic workstation . 

54
00:08:47,463 --> 00:09:03,637
That , in this case , is preparing thousands of tiny whales in multiple ways that are shaped a bit like naturalized cupcake baking sheets , the machinery and close the robotic arm that retrieves multiple wail place from a holding and then shuttles them to other locations at these locations . 

55
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:09,698
Other automated machinery adds this through that liquid containing cells , cultural media or text chemicals . 

56
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:15,083
Other actions on the workstation include ceiling and unsealing , the world and barcode labelling them . 

57
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:21,032
So a computer contract , each whales contents conditions in the procedures it has undergone or will undergo . 

58
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:28,004
This kind of automation is what makes it possible to screen thousands and even millions of samples in a reasonable amount time . 

59
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:33,861
It's called HTSor high swimming , whose health , health telephone can cause . 

60
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:38,700
Head of the foundry , explains the value of such systems for his HT. 

61
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:52,020
So our HTSteam , rather than setting up these places by hand , use this robotic workshop to set up many hundreds of places , as you see in this , this hotel here , all track by barcode . 

62
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,490
And that way , they can be fed to other instrumentation to run different kind of analytical tastes . 

63
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:14,010
And so the idea , the , by doing everything robotically tracked by our custom software , were able to know exactly what is in every plate , and very well that played and then drive that logistics to run really complex work flow . 

64
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,210
Those are other other robot cliffords. 

65
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,427
The final song clip of the ginger buyer work series comes to another robotic workstation . 

66
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:24,518
This one is preparing one other name . 

67
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:32,021
Ninety six will multiple places by adding cell infused goose rural solutions into the world that have been pre loaded culture medium . 

68
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:41,760
The results in ten thousand , three hundred and sixty eight wells with specific bacterial cells growing under specific medium conditions , will undergo specific measures . 

69
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,210
The darby connection here is that ginger buyer works is under contract in a few of the agencies efforts . 

70
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,260
One is the revictual program . 

71
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:56,873
Its goal is to engineer bacteria that can temporarily alter the microbial ecosystem or microbial on a war fighter skiing . 

72
00:10:56,873 --> 00:11:02,140
Another relevant collaboration between the company is in the programming on the SDtwo . 

73
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,180
Let's stands for synergistic discovery and design . 

74
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,782
It's all about leveraging large data sets from high school , put to develop data driven models . 

75
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:24,230
These empirical approaches can accelerate scientific discovery and provide guidance for developing technology , especially for domains such as migrants , for which a full theoretical understanding is not yet in hand . 

76
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,760
Well , that's it for this episode of sounds of innovation . 

77
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,290
Thanks listeners for joining , thanks also to time , short , rich for his partnership in producing this program . 

78
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:43,326
For more information about the programs associated with the sounds , you justify the program managers who run those programs , as well as other breakthrough technologies .
