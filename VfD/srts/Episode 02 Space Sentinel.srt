Since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War DARPA the defense Advanced research projects agency

00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
Has been a driver of Technology

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Welcome to

00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024
Voices from DARPA

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,352
A window onto DARPA score of program managers

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Their job

10
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
To redefine what is possible

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,008
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,568
Today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,592
Lindsay Millard

00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,648
Welcome NC to Voices from.

19
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
Thank you so much

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,720
Much for having me I'm really excited

21
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
I'm excited to have you

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,632
And before we dive in and talk about the space surveillance telescope

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,448
Which packs some really amazing technology that I'm

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
Eager to hear about

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Let's talk a little bit

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
About you

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
What I'd like to know is something about your background and interests and

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
How you became a program manager

29
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,296
Sure so a while ago actually started as a photography major

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
At the University Michigan

31
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,160
What you might think is a little bit odd start for a scientist

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,768
I was always inspired by these images I would see and astronomy magazine

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,584
And at that time I thought I was that means I should be a

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Photography made

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,984
But after learning a little bit more my time there I I drifted over to aerospace engineering

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:50,848
I got my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering there and a masters as well

37
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
And I went to Purdue where did some graduate work

38
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,968
Like the naval to NASA mission called the terrestrial planet

39
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,528
Which of the new design for a space

40
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,880
After that I had some work I did in policy

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,976
Actually met a fellow program manager here at DARPA who introduced me

42
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
To the house charcoal work

43
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
And the DARPA program

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
I was very exciting to me

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
And that's how I ended up a

46
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,704
And before we do really talk about the

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
Advanced Technologies that come together into the

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Is too low

49
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
The space surveillance

50
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Telescope

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Maybe you can talk to us a little bit about the problem that really

52
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,272
Beckon the scream 4 something like an SST and what I'm referring to here is

53
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Is the

54
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Relentless growth

55
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
A boat

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Maggie's human-made and

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
Cosmos made degree so

58
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
I guess that's really the beginning of the Space Age

59
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,792
Yeah absolutely I mean

60
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,376
Where are uses space is becoming increasingly critical to daily life

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
I think a lot of people don't know

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
When space is even involved

63
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
What's really anymore

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,568
And in order to do that we are launching increasing numbers

65
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Man-made objects

66
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Into space

67
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Are there tens of thousands of these objects

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
In space right now

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
And so we have to be very careful that they don't come near each other and

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
And sometimes even collide with each

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
And on top of that we also have debris

72
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
Get some from man-made object

73
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
But also just natural

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
SST is really focused on

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,376
Tracking and identifying debris and object

76
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
In an orbit called Geo

77
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Geosynchronous orbit

78
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
That's about 22000 miles

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
The Earth

80
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
The really far away

81
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,384
Why did I differs from Leo right which is low earth orbit

82
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
A lot of satellites are there as well

83
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
That's absolutely right

84
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Leo's much closer so it's a little easier

85
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
To tusayan

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
Go has a volume of tens of thousands of ocean

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
So not only is it far away

88
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
It's gigantic

89
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
And so building a telescope that can handle both of those challenges seeing things very far away over a very wide

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Area

91
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
It's really what I see

92
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
He is

93
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
Okay let I love that kind of image you just gave us

94
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
With all of these oceans above that needs

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Looked at in

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
And monitored

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,248
So you have that sounds to me like like

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
You need some old wow

99
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,624
Technology and maybe this is a good time for you to

100
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Talk about

101
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
Those boys really Advanced and unique Tech

102
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Help

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Nurture to come together

104
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
Yeah absolutely still

105
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
I think about a digital camera that you have at home

106
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
When you use your zoom lens

107
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,103
You see the field of view on your camera narrow in on the thing that you're looking at it as you get closer

108
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
And that is

109
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,991
How a traditional telescope works as you change the design that the field of view Narrows

110
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,831
With SST we actually had a Unique Auto

111
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
I were use a curved

112
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Focal plane

113
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,815
So again I think about your digital camera there is a small focal point focal plane in your camera call the CCD

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
And that's dance for

115
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,423
Charge-coupled device if I recall

116
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
What does the acronym

117
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Mccd

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Thank you

119
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Well as T obtains that very very wide field-of-view but still relatively very high resolution

120
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,223
Is actually instead of having a flat fee CD or a flat vocal play

121
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Eye is curved

122
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
An SST had the first working curved book

123
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
That we know of in the world

124
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
And what what's so special about the curved

125
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Format versus

126
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,327
As liquor format allows you to actually Focus the light

127
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,631
It's a little bit better towards the edges of the

128
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
CCD

129
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
It's also very very challenging to

130
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Build

131
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,287
In fact mit lincoln Labs who built the

132
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
The focal plane had to come up with a completely new process

133
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Unable to

134
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
To enable that curvature

135
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Over the over the

136
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,831
Writing for those who might not know the Lincoln lags Labs is a really fascinating place with a

137
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
History that goes back really to World War

138
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
2 with a task

139
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Skip that time to

140
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Work on what really

141
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Was some of the original

142
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Radar

143
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
It's been really involved in objects among other

144
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Who sings ever

145
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Ever since

146
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
So it's a really interesting

147
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Partner in this case

148
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
What are some of the other Technologies.

149
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
The Devon really tough

150
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
DARPA DARPA worthy type of Technologies

151
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
The processing power

152
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Telescope

153
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Quite impressive

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295
And the speed at which it can scan over the

155
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,623
And so we can actually

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
View objects / 1/4

157
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Of the entire go belt over

158
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
Imagine it is 1/4 of the Earth

159
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
I eat tonight

160
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
From New Mexico

161
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,215
And that is just incredibly fast drivetrain on the telescope and requires incredibly fast

162
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
And those are two things that

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
But we also develop

164
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
Grandma's coming to standing volume

165
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Not to be thinking about

166
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
How does in the field of view of this instrument

167
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
And it's in a

168
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,111
Kind of an amazing perch right this is at the White Sands

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Missile Range

170
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,743
In New Mexico which I guess most people there now is Whismur

171
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,607
But it's on top of a fantastically name

172
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
A peak called Adam Peak

173
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
Admit you've been there so maybe you can just sort of paint this a little bit of a

174
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
A picture what it's like to be there at night by the

175
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Telescoping and while you're doing that

176
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Describe the telescope

177
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,711
Sure did the atom tickets self is very high and very dry

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
I am in a very dark location

179
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,623
So you can stand up on the peak and actually see the sunset out over the range

180
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Beautiful

181
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
And you're also looking right over a site called Trinity

182
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,071
Trinity site is actually where the United States exploded its

183
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
First atomic weapon

184
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,959
I was just kind of interesting to be standing on the edge of two areas where technology

185
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
He was developed

186
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,847
After Sunset again it's incredibly dark you can actually see the edge of the Galaxy

187
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
When you're standing

188
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
And after Nightfall

189
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
I walk inside the telescope Dome

190
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,623
The facility itself looks like a very flat Square building with a giant Dome on one

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Decide

192
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,279
When you get inside that dome which is elevated even higher above Adam Peak and they will open up the door

193
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Off of the telescope down

194
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,935
At and almost every time I've been there at the wind is just blowing

195
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,567
And it's freezing cold but everyone wants to stay in that down because it just so neat

196
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
All the stars in the

197
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Telescope

198
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
The telescope moving itself is completely silent

199
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
They're just sitting there looking at the stars

200
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
Give people a sense of the scale of it and how fast it's moving because when you say

201
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
This instrument

202
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Is silent and I think about how big it is now

203
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Fastest moving its

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Almost impossible

205
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
For me to think about

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
So the telescope itself weighs

207
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Several tons

208
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
And it's sitting on it

209
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Top of many different

210
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Gimbels

211
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,799
And what it's doing is the the shape of the

212
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Opening in the dome is rectangular

213
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,175
And so it starts at the top and the telescope movement

214
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Is going up and down

215
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Look up and down in a vertical and

216
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
Autocross in a horizontal motion

217
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:00,671
And again if it can survive the entire sky so 180° around the Dome

218
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,023
In one single night again that you know volumes and volumes of ocean

219
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
A quarter of that in one night

220
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,143
Right and some soda literally as it's moving from one spot

221
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
Taking a snapshot moving to another

222
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
Taking a snapshot

223
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,591
I'd heard that there's some thousands of horsepower worth of

224
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
Hydraulic

225
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Piston

226
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Other moving elements

227
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Good actually

228
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Can can

229
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Bring it from one

230
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
To the next and yet

231
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
The sound of something like

232
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
I've heard this maybe you can correct it or will you have another metaphor

233
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
About as loud as a microwave oven

234
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,071
I think that's right the only thing you can hear is the clicking of the shutter

235
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
On the camera

236
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Over the hum of a micro

237
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,775
Right and then so when the shutter is open and it's gathering this light on with you through that curve.

238
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Element that you talked

239
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
Too bad so I can look at such

240
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Huge

241
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Volume of space all at once

242
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,247
The latest cell phone is going onto as I think you might have said Central like that in our cell phone

243
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Can you talk a little bit about that that censor play

244
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,695
Yes I'll start with as the aperture is open the light actually comes in and and

245
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Hit several different mirrors

246
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Summer saying Schmidt

247
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Optical train

248
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
And it's about a 3.6 m m e r

249
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
So that gives you an idea of a sort of how big the the hole

250
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Old telescope

251
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Stop at several meters

252
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Text larger than that

253
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,591
And so the light will come in and bounce through that that mirror

254
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,175
And actually be focused on to that curved focal plane

255
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Where

256
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
You know the light hits

257
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,063
The materials in that focal plane in that turns them into an elect

258
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Signal

259
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
Which is then transferred into what we would

260
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Think of it

261
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Pixels

262
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Based on the strength of the Electra

263
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
Cycle signal you're either seeing a brighter or fainter

264
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
The longer the telescope is open and looking at a spa

265
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Pacific Place in the sky

266
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
Defeater the object

267
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Might be able to see just like

268
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
If you are doing it at home

269
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,103
Camera okay so now I'm imagining the camera staring out

270
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
To geosynchronous

271
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
High altitudes roughly what 22000mah

272
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
Our heads there

273
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
And it's picking out

274
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Perhaps thousands

275
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
At one time thousands of even softball-sized

276
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Objects is that right

277
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,767
Yeah that's about right maybe the size of a whiskey bottle

278
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
If we focused in on one of those

279
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,447
You waited with you Whiskey Bottle you just said now I'm wondering if there really are whiskey bottles

280
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Whirling around in orbit

281
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
One can only guess right we have at astronauts

282
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
So let's assume it's not a whiskey bottle but it's some other kind of debris

283
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
How many pixels would that single

284
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Object

285
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Keep eye on that

286
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
The sensor

287
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,391
Shirts will be very few so SST cannot actually

288
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Take what we would think of as an image of

289
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,023
Something in Chia what SSD doesn't really see

290
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Datsun Street

291
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
So it is not resolved imagery of

292
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,215
Of an object in Geo but really an indication of where that object is

293
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
And how it's moving

294
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,567
Okay that's really all important you really want another

295
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Trajectory

296
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
Cuz then you can map that

297
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Projector onto the trajectories of

298
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
What if all the

299
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,759
Satellites that are out there whether it's for.

300
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Or other entities

301
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
And you can then

302
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Calculate

303
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Where there might be a

304
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
A nun

305
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
An unwanted

306
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Intersection of those

307
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Trajectory

308
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
Yes that's absolutely right and it also add that

309
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Primaries are the telescope right now is actually NASA

310
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
We partnered with NASA to

311
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
Try to identify a catalog new

312
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Near-earth

313
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
NSS is actually prolific at this

314
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
At finding what we call these Neos

315
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
Primarily asteroids and comets

316
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Looking at

317
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
Right right so that's been serving the test out phase

318
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
In these earlier

319
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Years in a way

320
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Fence first light in

321
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
2011 if I recalled my reading

322
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,535
Is that when it first went on top of Adam's peak

323
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Where was that somewhere else no that was on

324
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Okay so since then can you get a sense of

325
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Of the catalogue of observation

326
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Since then

327
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
We work

328
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
At like a mansion with NASA

329
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
To look at objects

330
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Near-earth objects

331
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,247
We've also take some images of nebula and supernova

332
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Also for a Partners at NASA

333
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,855
I work very closely with the United States are

334
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Force

335
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,951
For the Air Force we are observing very faint objects

336
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
In geosynchronous orbit

337
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
And I'm providing them information on that

338
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,399
And that could be anything from a piece of debris to to a small satellite

339
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,751
We also were quite a bit on developing what we call debris models

340
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
I still know telescope is strong enough

341
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,895
To see every piece of debris in space

342
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
And so what we do is we make estimate

343
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,015
About where that debris might be based on what we know

344
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,855
SOS St can see many more objects than other telescopes

345
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
And so we've been using our measurements

346
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,511
To help develop models for what we think the reality of of the debris is

347
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Pangea

348
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
Okay that you mentioned many more telescopes and that made me think

349
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,191
Of the larger context to your eye which is the

350
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
The largest of the space surveillance Network

351
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,127
Sure so the United States Air Force operates we recall at the SSN everything has

352
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Have an acronym the space surveillance Network

353
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,527
And there are several different types of optical and radar sensors in that Network

354
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
SSC is currently not one of those sensors even though we do provide

355
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
Data on an ad-hoc basis to the Air Force

356
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
I've been very shortly it is going to become

357
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
One of the sensors in that Network

358
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,143
SST is going to be transitioning over to you Air Force use

359
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,471
I actually very soon on October 18th

360
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
That is a

361
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Important

362
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
Kind of success for DARPA

363
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
When we think of what we're trying to do here is

364
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Developed

365
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Technologies

366
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
To further the cause of of national

367
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Security

368
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,647
We really do want this sort of transition ultimately that happened we do a lot of high risk

369
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,487
Kinds of Technology developments of the transition doesn't always happen but here is a case where a

370
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
It is so

371
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Can you talk to me about

372
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Does Baton handoff

373
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
Frightened

374
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
Where we are now so that we we can make this hand off

375
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
To the Air Force and then perhaps

376
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,823
Also take us forward to the sequence of events that will

377
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Over the next few years

378
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,479
Sure so I mentioned SST had for slight in 2011

379
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
I was a demonstration system that's a weed developer

380
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Is wonderfully poetic

381
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Term in the telescope

382
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Community

383
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,375
I would really refers to that moment when all of the conception is over in the development in the building

384
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Hanging you finally

385
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,983
Open up this this wonderful instrument to

386
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,847
2 observation and you desperately want to see what that first observation is nuts

387
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Often referred to as

388
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
Slight so excited Intrepid that what that was

389
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
In February 2011 the first electricity

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
Yes thank you

391
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,415
So at that time it was a demonstration system in here Darby we try to really push Beyond

392
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,719
The state-of-the-art Yuna revolutionary

393
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Technology

394
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,815
And sometimes you always don't you don't always get it perfect the first time

395
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,679
And so with the camera that we had in there in 2011 we realized there were some improvements

396
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Could be made

397
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,287
And so over the past year or so we've been developing a new

398
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Replacement

399
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Camera for the one that exists

400
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
There today

401
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,199
So we're installing we finished the installation of that new camera

402
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
And had a guy again first light

403
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
On August 18th of this year

404
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,415
And we're currently demonstrated the approach improve capability

405
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Of SST

406
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
Once a demonstration is done

407
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,351
And we really a really certain that the technology is complete

408
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
We are just really excited to give this

409
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
The US Air Force

410
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,519
It represents an order of magnitude

411
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,127
Increasing capability from what they're able to see now with their existing opt

412
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
Vehicle sensors

413
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,015
I am so we are very excited to be able to give them that capability and have that actually

414
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Run into operational use

415
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
Right so the Air Force will officially take Stewart

416
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
Ship of SST in an official

417
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
Ceremony that will be happening up on Adam Peak

418
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
I'm in

419
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
New Mexico

420
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
What's going to happen

421
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
After that

422
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
I asked her that we are actually going to be leaving the United States are actually going to be moving

423
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Telescope to Australia

424
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
Are we have some

425
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,711
The planet is not an easy task for a very large telescope

426
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,807
In 2013 the Secretary of Defense

427
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,135
And also the Minister of Defense in Australia signed an agreement

428
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,023
To actually move the telescope from White Sands Missile Range to you Harold e Holt Naval Air Station

429
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
In Western Australia

430
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,143
Until once we complete the technology demonstrated and

431
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
Transition to the Air Force

432
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,543
The Air Force is going to continue to work with our Australian Partners to physically move it

433
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Over to Western Australia

434
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
That will be happening over the next

435
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Maybe two years

436
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
I know that sounds like an enormous project

437
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Probably

438
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
Worth its own engineering story

439
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,159
Why take the great pains to move this

440
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Telescope

441
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Ihaveplanet

442
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,327
I completely agree the movement is potentially a DARPA hard problem in and of itself

443
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,215
The reason to do it is because that is a part of the world that were very interested in observing

444
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
What's going on up in geosynchronous orbit

445
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,151
We have a lot of very important that lives in that area to include communication

446
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,503
I'd also it represents a great partnership with our Australian allies

447
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
It's for the really those two reasons why we want to move

448
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
We've covered a fair amount for the time that we have

449
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
About

450
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
The space

451
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,095
A surveillance telescope question that you really wish I would have asked here that I

452
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
Did not and if so

453
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
You got to ask it now.

454
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
Well maybe not a question but I have a statement

455
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
My whole life

456
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
I've been interested in swerve looking Beyond

457
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
You know what we can really see

458
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,759
And I think it's inspiring to work on an instrument

459
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,343
It went to see other galaxies it makes it so real

460
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,695
In a way it's one thing to look sort of at a picture in a magazine

461
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,327
And it's another to be working with an instrument that can actually Imogen nebula and a supernova

462
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,887
I said for me working on the program has

463
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
Has been inspiring

464
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:24,031
Not only from a science perspective but also because we get to contribute to two very important mission for

465
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,407
You're at a place DARPA which is

466
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Kind of all about

467
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Reimagining what is

468
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Possible and actual

469
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Who taking steps to

470
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Change what you

471
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
To take what

472
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
My previously been considered in Paw

473
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,023
Send a ways to places trying to make science fiction nonfiction I'm just wondering if

474
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,559
You have some

475
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
What are now fictional

476
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Technologies in mines

477
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
I bet you think

478
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
What to be real

479
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
So I have a couple

480
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
I want is

481
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
The universal translator

482
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,407
It might have been on Star Trek series

483
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,783
That is a technology or perhaps a superpower that that I absolutely wish

484
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
That that we had

485
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,695
I think the other one is to travel beyond the stars perhaps that's a

486
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,303
That way he could have guessed it's not enough for me to just look I wish we could go there

487
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
That's a good place to end I think

488
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,679
Tell Lindsey I just want to thank you for the great conversation

489
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Thank you very

490
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,799
