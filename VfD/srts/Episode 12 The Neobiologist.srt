00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
Welcome to Voices from DARPA

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
A window at the DARPA score of program manager

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
Their job

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
To redefine

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,216
What is possible

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,544
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your door post

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,360
Today I am pleased to have with me in the studio

17
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
Justin gallo

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,992
A program manager since 2014 and DARPA's biological technology

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:58,880
Justin earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
And received his PhD in chemistry from

21
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
Caltech

22
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,048
For 14 years prior to arriving at DARPA he was a professor

23
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
In the chemistry Department

24
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,632
Is Emory University in Atlanta Georgia

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,216
There he led a research program in synthetic biology

26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,568
We just all about uncovering the rules and genetic programs by which cells

27
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
Behaving operate

28
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,664
And then to learn how to manipulate those rules and programs

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
Tibet bacterial fungal

30
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,088
Plant and animal cells can make drugs fuels coding and other useful molecules in materials

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
Adura Gallivan continues to be driven by some of Nature's Own most audacious biological feats

32
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,840
Such as the growth of a great Sequoia redwood tree from a seed

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
What if it were possible to leverage biology own evolutionary on Powers of chemical synthesis

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Growth

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Self-organization

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Self-healing

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
And reproduction

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,432
In the context of our built landscape of buildings

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,736
Roads vehicles and other Construction

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
That is the sort of question just in his ass

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
Justin thanks for joining me in the studio.

42
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Gladtobehere Ivan

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,696
Let's start by talking about your background

44
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:11,328
How you became interested in science in general and in chemistry and then synthetic biology in particular

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
I actually started out it was very

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Physics

47
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
I was inspired by people like Witcher

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Fine men

49
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
He told these wonderful stories seem like an incredibly interesting guy actually one of the things that brought me to Caltech I thought you know

50
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
This is a place where this character could do such

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Great science

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
The place that I want

53
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
I quickly realized after about a week in college that I was not going to be a physicist but nevertheless I'll

54
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
I like the hard Sciences

55
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
So chemistry seems like a good option

56
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
And I always liked the idea in chemistry of the ability to create things

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Didn't exist

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
Credit score

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Chemistry has an analytical sides we on

60
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,336
Understand the world around us by studying it and also has a synthetic side which means creating new Opera

61
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
And that was something I was really drawn to

62
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
Interestingly enough

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,504
I was sort of put off by biology

64
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,832
My biological education release formerly

65
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,880
Pretty much ended in the 9th grade

66
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
But as time went on during graduate school and post. If I went from this time where the word DNA

67
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
Hey in a seminar titled mint do not attend

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
To a point where I really started to respect the

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
Remarkable

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
Chemistry that biology does

71
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,128
I ultimately concluded that no matter how good of a chemist I was that biology would always do

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Better

73
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,528
So ask a question okay well can we harness the power of biological systems

74
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
To essentially do our bidding for us

75
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
So how can I reprogram

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
A system that

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,464
Wants to do its own thing and get through the thing

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
I want it

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
And that led me into this area of sin

80
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Biology

81
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,912
So we were interested in taking advantage of some of the properties that

82
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Bacteria

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Simple

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
Microbes could do

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Their ability to make stuff there

86
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
$0.02 stuff

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
And I got really interested in programming

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Before we

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Who talked about

90
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,528
The two programs that you're running here at RPI I would like to hear about the sequence of events

91
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:11,648
That led you from your long experience at Emory as a professor

92
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
To darp itself so how did you actually end up here

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,791
That was a funny story I was at a meeting in

94
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Cold Spring Harbor New York

95
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
Beautiful laboratory famous laboratory on Long Island

96
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,311
Famous for molecular biology molecular biology the structure of DNA

97
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,199
Wait we are meeting right outside of his office we got to see him walk through coming back from his tennis match

98
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
And I was there as part of a short course on synthetic biology

99
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Carrizo

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Organizers had brought in

101
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Faculty members from around

102
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
The country around the world

103
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
And about that time DARPA had an ounce

104
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
The Living foundries Program

105
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
How much is one of the Seminole synthetic biology

106
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Here at DARPA

107
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
Can you just tell listeners what was the Crux of that

108
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,799
The Crux of that program was engineering microbes to

109
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,127
Produce new molecules and to reduce the

110
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
Time of the design-build

111
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Test learn cycle today

112
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
So instead of taking a decade in a billion dollars to generate a product

113
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
They wanted to reduce the time

114
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Down to

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
Baby days weeks and reduce the cost dramatic

116
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
DARPA Hedges put out a call

117
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
Nearly a hundred million dollars of investment I think

118
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,471
And needless to say people at this meeting who are all in this area got really excited about it

119
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
But we also or sort of

120
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Amazed by the

121
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
The audacity Of what DARPA was asked

122
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
And I was getting really excited about this and I was talking to some of the younger faculty member so these are mostly system

123
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
Professors that are organized the meeting and

124
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
They had mentioned that

125
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Ann Arbor was

126
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Expanding heavily in

127
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
The synthetic biology Arena they were looking

128
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
For program managers

129
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
And

130
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,839
It's the program manager I was kind of an interesting one in the sense that we're all

131
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Temporary

132
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Stop it doesn't hire permanent

133
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,239
Staff is program managers we have an expiration date on badge

134
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
Mine is

135
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
30 December 2000

136
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
18 Lexi's yourself emergency it certainly does

137
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,943
So in order to come and do this job

138
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
You essentially have to leave

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,063
What you were doing before with the expectation that this is only going to be at

140
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
So for the folks that come from academics

141
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
He more or less have to have a tenured position if you enter

142
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
Because early in your career

143
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
You can't do this and being a sister

144
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
The professor at the

145
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
I just wouldn't work out but

146
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,703
Since I already had 10 year old lot of my colleagues said you would be great

147
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
You know the field

148
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
You have the ability to take a break

149
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,639
Ironically after about three years up here

150
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,455
On leave for memory by Dean said are you coming back

151
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
And something I never thought I would say is

152
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
So I gave up babe

153
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
Tenured faculty position a lifetime appointment

154
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,303
Something I worked incredibly hard tour in sawdust or the end-all-be-all of a career

155
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
So I am currently

156
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,263
Serving at the pleasure of the DARPA leadership and don't know what I'm going to do

157
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
All right but that also is an indication to me that you developed a certain kind of devotion and excitement about the programs

158
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,807
But you are involved with maybe more so than you even expected so let's talk about the two programs the first one

159
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
Goes by the short name of bricks brics

160
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
Which stands for

161
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,815
Biological robustness and complex settings what is it status now and what do you hope to achieve with it

162
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
The origin of that program goes back

163
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
Couple of years before I join the agent

164
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,567
Synthetic biologist got good engineering bacteria to do what I would call parlor tricks

165
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,383
Little cute things that work well in the laboratory

166
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
Example was

167
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
Engineering bacteria such

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
That when you expose them to light they would change

169
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Color

170
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
So you could do

171
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Photography

172
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
You take a petri dish

173
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Shine light and a

174
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Shadows and so on and you can take bacterial

175
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
You're cute

176
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Kind of demonstrates the possible

177
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
The fields but at the end of the day

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
It's not going to put digital cameras out of business

179
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,847
I myself have been engineering organisms to follow small molecules

180
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
With the idea maybe that

181
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
You could chase down pollutants in the environment

182
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Once you have a bacterium that

183
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,063
Not only wanted to eat the oil but actually

184
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
Could sense the oil and follow it around

185
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
And if you wanted to clean up

186
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,999
And in doing all this the question I would inevitably get ass is okay when are you going to

187
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Transition this to the

188
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
The field

189
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Am I answer quite honestly was never

190
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
Because the systems that we are building

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Work fine

192
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
37° C

193
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
Petri dish

194
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Sterile

195
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Environment

196
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
With the presence of antibiotics.

197
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Any competition away

198
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
So we were literally

199
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Cuddling

200
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Is bacteria

201
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,391
And they can perform in that environment but if you said Okay I want to take something that I engineered in the laboratory

202
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,231
And I want to put it in this contaminated site

203
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Clean up what was there

204
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
It would never work

205
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Because

206
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
There microorganisms

207
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
Live everywhere they've established there

208
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Niches

209
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,311
I soaked introducing this little week laboratory strain of e-coli

210
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
It wouldn't survive

211
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
It's just

212
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
It wouldn't work

213
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
And just on another angle was there even at that time a regulatory framework with that would enable you to go from the lab out into the field

214
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
There is it like

215
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
Many regulatory Frameworks it's a little bit

216
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:35,231
Complicated but it does exist but we were so far away from that that even

217
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
The notional idea that we would like to

218
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
Do that was

219
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Almost out of the question is

220
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
Regulation wasn't going to stop us

221
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,751
From being successful here it was the science itself

222
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,103
The challenge has I saw it was we needed to be able to

223
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Engineer organisms that were

224
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
Robust enough to

225
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
To survive

226
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
You of course have to deal with this problem

227
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
Of evolution

228
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,903
So when you have large population sizes Evolution occurs by

229
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Mistakes

230
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Okay when DNA

231
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
Copied incorrectly

232
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
It introduced

233
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Mistakes

234
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Call grateful for billions of years worth of mistakes aren't exactly the process work

235
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
The public concern off

236
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
So you're going to create a

237
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Superbug

238
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,431
And my concern actually it was at the other end of the spectrum than anything we've is going to break

239
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
Just going to be too fragile so we have to be mindful

240
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
If you want to engineer microbes that are

241
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,415
Resilient enough to do the job but make sure that they are not innovating

242
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
And one of the challenges

243
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
There

244
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
Is this notion of engineering robustness

245
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Intersystems

246
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
If you talk

247
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,935
Too Hardcore Engineers that build things like

248
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Like airplanes

249
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
There are many ways to

250
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Make sure that airplanes

251
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Fly safe

252
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Redundant systems

253
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Sensing

254
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Control a

255
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Actuation

256
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
And so on so we've gotten to the point now where air travel is

257
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
Ratably safe and there's

258
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
The entire engineering disciplines that help support

259
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,463
So I would talk to these Engineers who are used to working in

260
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Your microphysics

261
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
World's End say

262
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Okay how do you deal with

263
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Uncertainty

264
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
In

265
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Say biological

266
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
So is an example

267
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,567
If you're thinking about an airplane flying you can make reasonable guesses as to what environment

268
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
And it's going to say

269
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
The temperature range that is likely to see

270
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
I know how high it's

271
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,575
Find a fly I can model the stresses on the wing what kind of ruins it might exactly you can draw a box around

272
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,159
Wright Engineers are very good at saying that within a certain parameter space

273
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Fat

274
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,023
This should operate as expected and then beyond that

275
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,095
I'm all bets maybe off but we've done a pretty good job of drawing up

276
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,959
But in biology it's a lot more complicated than

277
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Because

278
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
We don't

279
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
Always know

280
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
What an environment is going

281
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Be like

282
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Moreover

283
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
You have this

284
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Pesky thing of evolution

285
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Whereas

286
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
And physically engineered systems

287
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
When something breaks

288
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Generally the

289
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Fitness

290
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
She's a biological term

291
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
Of the object goes down

292
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Okay so let's say

293
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Part of the airplane brakes

294
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
The performance of that aircraft is generally not

295
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Where is in biological systems

296
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
Breaking is innovation

297
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
So it's possible that

298
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,639
Do mutations in an organism acquires a new phone

299
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
It grows faster it out competes its

300
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
A colleagues

301
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,319
When I talk to the engineer's taking is there a g in

302
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,207
The mechanical are the answers know that the airplane breaks it doesn't start flying twice as fast and twice as high

303
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Performance goes down

304
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
So that was sort of

305
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
An intellectual barrier there that the people that

306
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Think about

307
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Engineering robust systems

308
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Weren't

309
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
As of yet

310
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
Thinking about biology and it

311
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Brings new challenge

312
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,919
And I recognize this but I'm not an engineer so I had no idea how to

313
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
So when I came to DARPA

314
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
I had the convening power of two

315
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
The purse haiku

316
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Sculpt

317
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
A program that

318
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Basically asked

319
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Can we transition

320
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
Synthetic biology from

321
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
Laboratory curiosity into

322
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
The real world

323
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
So one of the great technological advancement

324
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
The last

325
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Decade or so

326
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Is

327
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
The Dramatics

328
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Reduction

329
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
And cost

330
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Of

331
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Dnac

332
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
So we can study

333
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
The DNA

334
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
That's out in the

335
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
And there's a lot of

336
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
And

337
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,319
Why doing that we started to recognize that there's this in

338
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Credible

339
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Diversity

340
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Of

341
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Microbes

342
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Acroanna Saint Denis

343
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
It turns out that

344
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,351
If you were to count up the number of cells in your body that are yours

345
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Should have your DNA

346
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
And then compare that to the number of

347
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Cells of bacteria that live

348
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
On your skin and in your

349
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Your gut

350
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Those numbers

351
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,639
There's still a little debate about it but they're approximately

352
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Comfortable

353
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,759
So you are being driven by your back

354
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
They help you digest your food friend

355
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,927
They affect us in profound ways or just beginning to

356
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Discover

357
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
And

358
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,815
So you're essentially telling me

359
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
But I am half bacterial

360
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
More less more

361
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
So this opened up the tantalizing

362
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Impossibility

363
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
That by

364
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Manipulating

365
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Those back

366
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Stereo weekend

367
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Therapeutics

368
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
For example soda

369
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Treat

370
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Diseases of the gut

371
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
An interesting aside

372
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
There is a typically Hospital

373
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Derived

374
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Infection

375
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Called c-diff

00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Common lyrics

377
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Clostridium

378
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Difficile

379
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Essentially what happens in

380
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
Hospital settings is that when

381
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,327
People take a strong course of antibiotics

382
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Essentially

383
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
Clears the bacteria out of your

384
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
L C diff lives

385
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,799
In this very specific locations within your guts that kind of hangs out in between some cells

386
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
And normally it's held in check by

387
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Everything else that's

388
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:16,479
In your gut right and just because some westerns probably have heard the term we are talking about here about the

389
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
The microbiome

390
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
Right here this year the mybatis biome of the gut

391
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,927
When you were talking about the bacterial over all of us and that's the entire microbiome on our bodies

392
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,279
I hear you're talking about the microbiome of a gaseous specifically in the gut so what

393
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Happens is that after antibiotic treatment

394
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Got clears out

395
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
C-diff says

396
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,959
Oh my God this is great you know it's like it's expanding into a

397
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
It makes people very very sick

398
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
It can be deadly

399
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
The observation was made

400
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
That

401
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Perhaps by

402
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Repopulating the gut

403
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
With

404
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
Normal Got Back

405
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Bacteria you might be able to knock down a c-diff in

406
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
So where do you get those bacteria to repopulate the gut

407
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Well

408
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
The political terms these days are

409
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
Intestinal microbiota

410
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
What are talking about

411
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,055
Fecal material however correct I am going to be a group

412
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Transplant

413
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,919
It works if you eliminate a microbial community

414
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,247
You can replace it with a different community and restore

415
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
No

416
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
It's great it works I mean it said something like 95%

417
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Successful

418
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
But aside from just the it

419
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Factor

420
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,999
If you had to design a solution to this problem

421
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
Is that the best you could come up with

422
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
That you would literally

423
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
Take somebody's poop and stick it in you

424
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
So

425
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
Can we start asking this question

426
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Could you

427
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
Buildmore Define communities

428
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
Scratch that might have the same function

429
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
But

430
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
Wouldn't carry all the extra baggage so

431
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
In that poop there's a lot of other

432
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,599
Real potential viruses and other bacteria that maybe you don't want to

433
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,743
So we've got very interested in this idea of building microbial communities

434
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
That can perform a specific function

435
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
But have much more to find Copper

436
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
This would of course be a tremendous service in a public health sense because so many people have gastrointestinal

437
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Personal issues

438
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,639
That seems to be related to the microbiome so if you can come up with ways that are more palatable any sense to

439
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,015
To treat that would be really Department of Defense specific problem as well so when

440
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Soldiers deploy to place

441
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Iraq and Afghanistan

442
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
They are exposed to do microbes

443
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Water and so on

444
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Travelers diarrhea

445
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
Many of you out there may have suffered from it

446
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
It's not fun

447
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
And not only can it ruin a vacation but if you think about from a

448
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
DOD perspective

449
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
If you're taking young healthy people you're deploying them in theater

450
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
With the expectation that they're going to do a job right away

451
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
And then they're sick

452
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
That's no good

453
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,991
So one way that you could think about maybe solving this problem would be to

454
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Find a way of engineering robust

455
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Community

456
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
In the gut

457
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
That more closely matches where they're going

458
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
And maybe you transition that

459
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Community States

460
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
So maybe you get a tummy ache

461
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
But you're here

462
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
You can be treated

463
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
You're fine

464
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
And then

465
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
You deployed overseas and don't have to worry about being

466
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
Knocked out of the game

467
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Right as you are

468
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
If you were to characterize the status of

469
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
The program Prix

470
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Now how would

471
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
AccuWeather

472
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,735
It's going well I'm actually very pleased so when we started that program we

473
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Realize that

474
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
The science behind the microbiome

475
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
Is changing it

476
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
Incredibly rapidly

477
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,999
When we launched the program we didn't say specifically that we were going to solve this

478
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Microbial engineering problem

479
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
Because I felt that those problems were

480
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
Quite as well defined

481
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
As we want

482
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,191
So what we did was we said

483
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
What are the tools in

484
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,287
Some technologies that we will have to develop

485
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
App that allow us to engineer

486
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,151
Microbial communities or microbiome

487
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
That can function in Campo

488
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Text environment

489
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,319
Because we thought that there were going to be some commonality so a microbial community in your

490
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Your gut

491
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Has to deal with

492
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Changing environment

493
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Right one day

494
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
I drink a Diet Coke

495
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
I had a burrito for lunch

496
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Then I ate a salad

497
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,327
So there's all sorts of different stuff flowing through

498
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,959
Through there so what we said was if you have the ability to engineer a microbial community

499
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Forum 8

500
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Find function

501
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,079
In some suitably complex environment

502
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
We figured we would learn enough lessons that we could

503
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Then

504
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
Take that to

505
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Maybe a different phone

506
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
In a different car

507
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
So they're going to be some primitive

508
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Commonalities

509
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
In terms of the problems that you would have

510
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
The salt

511
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
To engineer a community that

512
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Weather I ultimately want to

513
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Re-engineer a gut microbiome

514
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,703
Aura skin microbiome or a soil microbiome

515
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
They're probably some commonalities

516
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
How many research

517
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,151
Right over on the program is

518
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
Probably about a dozen

519
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
And

520
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
They've come up with some

521
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
Truly creative

522
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
Solutions to some of the challenges

523
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
At the beginning of the program we said

524
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,559
We want you to engineer a community that has an impact

525
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
On

526
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
An organism

527
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
In a rational

528
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Predictable

529
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Safe

530
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Robust

531
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Way

532
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
We didn't specify

533
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
What

534
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
The test case had to be

535
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
We left the performers

536
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Folks at

537
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
Came with ideas Define their own space

538
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
Wewe to find how complex

539
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
Could be or needed to be

540
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
But we didn't say

541
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Engineer the gut microbiome of

542
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
So we got some really Creative Solutions in

543
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Including some that were on XP

544
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,535
So some of the ones that I would I'd say we're a little bit

545
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
More in line with

546
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
We kind of thought would come in was

547
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
We have a group

548
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
At

549
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
The recents

550
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Attitude at Harvard

551
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Bye-bye

552
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Pam silver

553
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
She and her group

554
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,359
Now have engineered a

555
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Microbe

556
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
That

557
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Can sense inflammation

558
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
And it changes color when

559
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
It senses inflammation

560
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,575
Shenzhen Diagnostics a diagnostic

561
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
So at

562
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
Can reside in the gut of

563
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
They're using animals

564
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Freezing a mouse

565
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
It can reside in the god of a mouse for

566
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Something like a hundred days

567
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Without mutating

568
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,424
Thanks for this is one of the things that we were worried about I thought this was going to be a huge problem

569
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
But the systems were going to meet a wife

570
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,032
That was a pleasant surprise

571
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
They've shown that you can detect

572
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
Inflammation in the mouse gut

573
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
Basically by looking at

574
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Set the color of their poop

575
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,272
Poop if there's inflammation the mice poop blue

576
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
So you can imagine ultimately using this as a diagnostic

577
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,232
One of the other more surprising test cases that a group at the University of Texas

578
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
Led by Nancy Moran

579
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Came up with

580
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Was the

581
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
Microbiome of the

582
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Honey bee

583
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
Got so we are definitely not expecting this

584
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
But it

585
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
It turns out

586
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
That the honey bee is a really interesting

587
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Test kit

588
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
So unlike you and I who have a lot

589
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
Of different microbes in our guts

590
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,576
The honey bee has depending on the day somewhere around 8 or 9

591
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
So much simpler

592
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
What is the

593
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
So it's not

594
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
But it's not a thousand so we thought that this was a really

595
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Useful

596
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Test case because it's

597
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
Complicated but not irreducibly,

598
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:35,264
And what also is interesting about the honey bees the honey bee is a social animal

599
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Displays learning and memory so you can train honey bees

600
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
To do tasks

601
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
And so on so

602
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
What the Texas team

603
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Was interested in doing

604
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,528
Was manipulating the

605
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
Gut microbiome of the honeybee

606
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
To see if we could alter their learning and memory

607
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
And it turns out that this actually work

608
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,304
It turns out that there is something that

609
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Antonis the gut

610
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
Brain access

611
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
So there is any

612
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Credible number of

613
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Neurons

614
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
That go from your brain and synapse

615
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Got

616
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
If you think about it

617
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
You have the gut-brain at

618
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
It inside the gut you have all these microbes

619
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
Living in there doing

620
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
And it turns out that

621
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
There's essentially a gut brain microbe axis

622
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,672
So the microbes in your gut can actually tickle your brain

623
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
Via the molecules they produce how they interact

624
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Absolutely amazing soda

625
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:35,680
Potentially opening up a door of engineering my own gut microbiome in a way that might make me a better learner

626
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:40,288
Okay so that would be cool not there yet but

627
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,176
You know you said you weren't my only told us about 2 I know you said there's about a dozen other groups we cannot get into all of them

628
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,016
Fact I want to move on now to the to the second program which is

629
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:55,136
Fairly new and this one goes by the acronym Elm and that stands for

630
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
Engineered

631
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,560
Living materials and I know in an earlier discussion one of the kind of metaphors that came up as we're talking about this

632
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
Beautiful wanna one you think of where I

633
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Forest come from

634
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:12,288
And then you think of the seeds that are the beginnings of all of those trees of collectively become this incredible LAN

635
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Of a forest

636
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,384
So what would your thinking about that sort of

637
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Biological

638
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,016
Brilliance and Landscape in another way so talk to us about

639
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
Elm what it's about

640
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
And what the status

641
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
One of the Great

642
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,928
Perks of this job is that we get a pretty

643
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
High level

644
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
View of the

645
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,816
And I had gone to a meeting

646
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Called biofabricate

647
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,424
And I had met a group from a company

648
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
In New York called ecova

649
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
And what

650
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Ecovative

651
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Was doing it

652
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
At the time and what is actually think

653
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,664
The core of their business is they were taking

654
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Fungi

655
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Particular mushroom

656
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
And in particular The mycelial Witcher

657
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
The parts of mushroom

658
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Set grow under

659
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
And if you've ever walked out on your lawn one morning

660
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Where the hell did those come

661
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Front right they grow really

662
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Fast

663
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
I would eat oveta was doing

664
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,912
Was they were taking this organism

665
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
And mixing it with

666
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
The cheapest agricultural waste

667
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
We're talkin

668
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,080
Corn stalks that are ground

669
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Apparently there's a market

670
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Paraguay

671
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Futures

672
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Poodle

673
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
What they would do if they take the waist

674
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,832
They would take the my Celia they would put it in a mold

675
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:35,744
A physical mold and after a few days my silly would grow to fill the voids

676
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
And it would get a material that

677
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,632
Essentially has many of the properties of polystyrene

678
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Styrofoam head

679
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Material

680
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
And they can sell this as a packing Pro

681
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
Do my Celia of the fungal system those are more fibrous kinds of parts of a not the mushroom and body the Rye

682
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,784
Ritenour mushrooms button in here it just kind of ends up looking almost like a

683
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
So and I thought this was so cool

684
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Cool because polystyrene

685
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Is

686
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,488
Holding a polystyrene cup as we speak

687
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Is one of the most

688
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,328
Useful yet pernicious substances

689
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
In the sense that

690
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
It is so inexpensive to make

691
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
It is cheaper to

692
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
Make virgin polystyrene the Nerdist

693
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Recycle it

694
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
And it tends not to go away

695
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
Where is these mushroom base materials if you throw in a compost

696
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
They go away

697
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
And so I was really intrigued

698
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
By this idea of

699
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Growing

700
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Materials

701
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
And

702
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
From a

703
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
DOD perspective

704
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,208
I was particularly interested in this idea of

705
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
Growing materials

706
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
On a

707
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Site

708
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
And one of the things that

709
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Ecovative Folkston

710
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
Show me was that they could

711
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Take

712
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,776
Are mushroom materials that are not particularly dense but if you put them under Heat

713
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,848
Pressure you can get a material that's more or less equivalent

714
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
2 fiberboard

715
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
I thought this was cool

716
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
You can essentially grow

717
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
These materials quickly

718
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,576
If you think about the Department of Defense we operate all over the world

719
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
If you think about

720
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
A rebuilding effort in

721
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Afghanistan

722
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
And let's say you need to get a pallet of plywood there

723
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,864
LED ody has the world best Logistics system out there but

724
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Shipping

725
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Heavy

726
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Pallets of plywood

727
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Across the world in the danger zone

728
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
Sounds to me seems

729
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
If necessary

730
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
But silly

731
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Right cost a lot

732
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Crossfuel

733
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
It's dangerous

734
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Why couldn't you ship

735
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Accede

736
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Or effectively accede

737
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Starter

738
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
And then grow the

739
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
So you reduce the logistic burden

740
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
What's the cost

741
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
You increase safety because you're not

742
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,328
Find a truck inherently low value materials across the

743
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
And then if you take this a step further

744
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,752
And say well what are some other remote places we might want to eventually

745
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Priest materials

746
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,848
If we ever decide to live on Mars

747
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
There's no Home Depot up there

748
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
We're not going to get there by just shipping everything weed

749
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
We're going to

750
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Have to be able

751
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
How to grow in

752
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:13,440
So beyond program really gets at this early stage of growing material

753
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
Oh and by the way

754
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
We want the material

755
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
To remain alive

756
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,608
Sew-in packing material it's obvious

757
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Want that to remain alive

758
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
But living systems have grapes

759
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Bacon

760
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Self-repair

761
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,056
They can sense and respond to

762
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
The environment

763
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,688
So could you imagine having a structure that a pond

764
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
Damaged or insult

765
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Repairs itself

766
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
In the way that you do if you get a cut

767
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
That would be great

768
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Could you have materials that

769
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,184
Change their properties with respect to the

770
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
The

771
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Temperature

772
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
State

773
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
Change the color so that they were become

774
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,888
Reflective or absorptive if you were interested in

775
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
So there's something

776
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
About maintaining the living properties

777
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
Materials that

778
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Takis

779
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Really

780
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Compelling

781
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,688
Try this absolutely amazing this is also reminding me this comes I guess out of a tradition

782
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
Summit used to be called

783
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
Smart materials

784
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Smart intelligent materials

785
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,160
And idea there I remember being you can you build a building that might have sort of

786
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,816
Reactive porosity the humidity when the meteorological conditions are and so in some

787
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
The building itself

788
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,656
Just by changing its microstructure

789
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
Can accommodate

790
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,776
Hayden and queen maybe you lose use less energy to heat and less energy

791
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Before AC

792
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,640
Is the thing is amazing about this though is I'm imagining living

793
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:41,504
Inside of a building that is living I love the thought of it but I also

794
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,600
It also gives me the willies what's makes me feel like I might be living

795
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Inside of a body

796
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,792
And I still might want you to think about that for a second and I'm wondering what should we be concerned about like if I keep food in the refrigerator

797
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Too long

798
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,632
It goes badly so could my house go

799
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Bad in this respect

800
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,032
Yes these are some of the things that we've asked our performers to be thing

801
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Thinking about so

802
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
If you have a system

803
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
That grows

804
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
How do you control that grow

805
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224
And there's obviously a natural president

806
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
For this right

807
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,784
Human beings grow to roughly

808
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Define shapes

809
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
In sizes and so on so

810
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
So Nature has solved

811
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
This problem

812
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
Controlled growth

813
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
And development

814
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
We actually have a

815
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Second

816
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Track of the

817
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
Program that is getting it

818
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
Just this

819
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
So

820
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Can we

821
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
Program biological

822
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
Systems

823
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,032
To adopt

824
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
Specific sizes

825
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,432
Okay I just have to say this is one of the most miraculous things to me

826
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
About biology

827
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,296
About a seed about a fertilized egg because it's comes with

828
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,696
Fairly simple shape and I'm looking at you Justin and you have an interesting shape of a human being

829
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
I don't know how to take that so what did DARPA s

830
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,912
Audacious idea to actually now try to build that

831
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,496
Morpho genetic function of biology into

832
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Engineered materials

833
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,592
Right so you mentioned the seeds we've been building with

834
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
Once alive materials forever right we use would

835
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:17,760
And how do we get that would we take the single this very very small seed we stick it in

836
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
The ground we grow it for

837
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,368
What years we got this beautiful living tree that

838
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
Lightshade

839
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
Help heal itself all these great properties

840
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:32,352
I can take CO2 out of the atmosphere and produce oxygen that we need to breathe and then what do we do

841
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:38,240
We cut the damn thing. And then we put it in a kiln we render it inert we saw it up and it

842
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Dimensional Lumber

843
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,824
So could you think about

844
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Starting with

845
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Essentially like

846
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
The tree progenitor cell

847
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
And

848
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Grow dimensional Lumber

849
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,832
The cells will keep dividing in a specific developmental pattern

850
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
And they would know

851
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
They would be programmed

852
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
To go to sleep

853
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
Dick sizes and shapes

854
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
So producing dimensional Lumber without having to

855
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
How to grow a tree

856
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
Suggesting that was absolutely amazing discussion you taking me on a conceptual a journey that is just pleasing

857
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Camino and

858
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,288
I just want to thank you for engaging me in this conversation

859
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
It's been my pleasure Ivan

860
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
It's been a lot of fun

861
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,176
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us
