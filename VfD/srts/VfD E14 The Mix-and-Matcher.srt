00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,981
Still of technology , the internet GPS in the palm of your hand are tonight . 

2
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:22,240
Operation technology is a driver of our times . 

3
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:33,790
Since its founding nearly sixty years ago , in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , the defense advanced research projects agency has been a driver of the technology . 

4
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:43,000
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,154
My name is iphone a motto , and I am your dark post today . 

6
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:53,270
I am pleased to have with me in the studio , gym girl numbers , a program manager since twenty fifteen . 

7
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,690
Industrial technology , as we will learn in just a few minutes . 

8
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:14,010
He is among the dark program managers who was oversee programs that fall under the system of systems category , which is to say , very complicated technology frameworks with lots of components and moving parts among the technologies he integrated into unprecedented framework . 

9
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:26,040
Maritime defence include undersea communications on the men , vehicles and systems , maritime power , energy systems or tournament's operation and networking of men and other systems . 

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:44,790
Prior to joining double , jim was the director of the advanced technology office at the applied research electoral located a pencil in a state university there , he oversaw a research projects , including our indian solar systems and underestimate power systems for tropical and unmanned vehicles . 

11
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:56,350
Jim earned a bachelor's urine physics from the USneighbourhood academy and then served five years on active duty as a nuclear trained officer in the USnavy following activity . 

12
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:04,030
He joined the neighbor and earned his masters and doctoral degrees , nuclear engineering and plasma physics from the university of washington gym . 

13
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,606
globalized . 

14
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,525
It's so good to have you in the studio . 

15
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,060
It's my pleasure to be here . 

16
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,555
Let's start by talking about your background . 

17
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:18,250
You are background physics when you escape academy , and I suggest me that you arrived at the academy with some interests in science and the navy . 

18
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,030
So where those interests come from? 

19
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,890
Well , I think my interests in the science and engineering really came from a my father . 

20
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,020
I was raised in a family that had a lot of engineers , so that was kind of an expected thing . 

21
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:39,850
And and I did pretty well in those subjects , although I didn't really know that man like most students , but I was kind of good at it . 

22
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:47,110
And one thing about the neighborhood made eighty percent of everybody was the engineer nose day , so wasn't a hard. 

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,616
And I would guess that you're interested in plastic and physics . 

24
00:02:51,616 --> 00:03:01,080
That's what you studied in your regular years , which is central to the process of nuclear fusion , somehow emerge from your time serving a nuclear submarine , which relies a nuclear enforced proportion . 

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,420
I think you said to me one time that you would , you did a lot of boiling of water , but tell me about sort of that that connection you have with position and fusion. 

26
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:25,310
Yeah , well , it was all the interests of mine , just as a garden engineering , the whole world nuclear industry , and using fishermen to make power , of course , being in the navy , the opportunity go on a submarine and and serve was really the attraction . 

27
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:34,770
That's what got meant to it , that the fusion piece actually came about from experience ahead at the last animals in the summer time . 

28
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:45,320
And I have to confess that I did that solely to get out of spending a hot summer and maryland yelling at freshman , I looked for ways to get out of that . 

29
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,820
One of the options was to do a research of system . 

30
00:03:48,990 --> 00:04:13,020
It blows almost national lab , and I ended up working with the group in a plasma physics , doing fusion work , and the key piece that was just breathy for it was the first time that I was in a laboratory , and we were trying to do something where we did know how it was going to turn out previously that in classrooms and laboratories are those scientists in high . 

31
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,710
You were usually just trying to make something work that you knew . 

32
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:42,570
The answer was just , could you make it happen , and it was at last , almost where I finally saw we were doing experiments , and I realized these really bright people , they hope they know it was happening , but the reality was we did experiments to find out , and then we adjusted , and that was very exciting to me was to see this whole really doing research to explore , as opposed to just get something right . 

33
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,800
You could get a great on it. 

34
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,272
A tester of alabama , poor . 

35
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:50,960
So it was sort of that that excitement about discovery really slowing something you want nature totally. 

36
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,180
My , my whole view , and that's what let me choose and do that for grade school , I wanna get out of the navy. 

37
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,630
And then after your service and education , you , he went often to the defence industry for a while . 

38
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:10,370
He worked on such things as under water , shark systems directed energy , weapons , counter , rocket armor and laser based instrumentation . 

39
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,266
And well , so the fantastic surrounding phenomenon and technologies . 

40
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:24,818
And then you went into a more academic , there's still defence central setting up in state , and then somewhere along the way , you went to sector with dark . 

41
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:25,482
So can you ? 

42
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,915
Yeah , that intersection happened actually. 

43
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:42,140
Manufacturing happened when I left grad school , and I joined the small company called vice power technologies in industry , which was the small company where you mention some of those projects and a undersea shark. 

44
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,940
Programs for listener rice , who do not know what that mean , what , how would you describe that? 

45
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,170
It's by the way , I pad more fun . 

46
00:05:49,250 --> 00:06:11,140
One of the anybody should , as far as the kind of range of projects we get to do what we were looking at was the whole idea of , can I create a nursing shock wave , which means basically light , often explosive under water , but do it in a way that we can shape the shock , waste or pile up on top of each other and smash something like a mine . 

47
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,850
So we're actually looking at mine clearance , doing that . 

48
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:22,140
And that was an idea that we , we saw the darker as something that they would be interested in seeing if we could make it work . 

49
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,700
And that became my introduction to dark. 

50
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,860
But so what i'm reading from that , that is that you are , what industry speaks is your performer . 

51
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,410
Yes , and performers are those who end up getting research contracts , working on some program . 

52
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,541
So you are a performer worker in that particular project . 

53
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:44,650
And then so I presume that my new met other program managers may be enough to director , and that LED to a discussion. 

54
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,390
Yeah , we , we actually did a number of programs . 

55
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,538
I probably three or four dark pilgrims as a performer during those years . 

56
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:59,148
Then when I transition to the applied research lab , it can stay we , we picked up a couple of more . 

57
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:12,930
So I had a had an ongoing relationship , actually , through multiple organizations of being a performer , doing dark programs , and exactly as you described as actually a former PM. 

58
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:27,520
And at the time that video office structure climb light , can you point me aside and wanted to see , hey , what i'd be interested in , according to the site of the table and conceiving ideas and being a program. 

59
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,306
Okay , and you quite evidently did come over here . 

60
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:38,871
If I just go into your program manager page on the website , and or if I am talking more directly , I learned that you have three programs on your wing . 

61
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:48,450
Now , two of them , the blue wealth program and hunter programming both have to do with on men under water systems . 

62
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,350
And there is one very multiple program . 

63
00:07:50,350 --> 00:08:10,270
It's the cross domain and maritime surveillance and targeting program were known , in short , as city mass , and that's really a program which there was an unexpected systems of systems idea , of course , which the other two programs kind of feeding too is kind of component systems of the systems of systems . 

64
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:20,542
So maybe we can talk about city masks and the whole idea of systems of systems , which really is a theme throughout durable . 

65
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:27,330
You see , that kind of category is defining many programme's wealthy , the six technical offices . 

66
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,610
So tell me what you think of with. 

67
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,320
This concept of an absolutely an , exactly , in fact , and this is what kind of need about darker . 

68
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,520
This is what IItalked to kind about the shoes talking about bringing me and was to look at . 

69
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,890
We have this initiative to do system systems . 

70
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,770
We want to look at american version . 

71
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,740
Would you do that ? 

72
00:08:47,740 --> 00:09:07,000
Well , first , you had to understand what we mean by system of systems , and it's really this idea that as our defence has matured over the last few decades , and we make more more capable platforms , and a good example would be saying airplane or a submarine . 

73
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,750
These are becoming very sophisticated . 

74
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,320
Platforms are very capable , but they also expensive . 

75
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:24,820
They also take a long time to make , and what we're finding is to make them even better , cost a lot of money and time . 

76
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,020
And you don't necessarily get that much more capability than you . 

77
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,410
If you wear it is kind of creating like an awesome top , is you put more effort into it . 

78
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,070
It's getting increasingly. 

79
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,370
And nobody seems to be a limited , yeah , just how much. 

80
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,055
How much employee , yeah , that is tipping over . 

81
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:56,520
And and so the whole idea that is , is there a better way to look at things to say , if I really want to do what dark is supposed to do , which is major capability gains and big strides . 

82
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,620
Is there a different way to look at things , and one of the ideas is what ? 

83
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,090
How about if we distribute some of the functions that are on this platform ? 

84
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,430
So if you think about a platform , what is it ? 

85
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,060
It has the sense. 

86
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,940
It has to defend itself and by platform you might. 

87
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,530
I entered an aircraft , yeah , aircraft to a submarine exactly the . 

88
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,556
So it has this function that needs to sense . 

89
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:29,774
It needs to communicate , it needs to defend itself . 

90
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:32,410
It needs to do data process , I think . 

91
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,840
And if I put that , all there is great , I concentrated . 

92
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,870
But now , as I said , it is incremental gains . 

93
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,540
And at each time I make a change of the facility of the stuff. 

94
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,920
What if I. 

95
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,510
Do a term we call what we disagree that I take these functions , say the sense in function . 

96
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,500
And I put it on a lower class platform , say , like an unmanned system that I can put farther away . 

97
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:12,070
So now I get even greater dancing , because instead of being stuck on my platform , it's now far away , and in broader , and maybe I move forward , even open the earth of the nearest exactly , so I get high advantages . 

98
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,280
The key pieces is I still have . 

99
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:22,730
I have to be able to communicate , but if I can do that and handle the networking part to make all these things worked together . 

100
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:35,820
Well , now I really covers in my adversary , a difficulty , instead of doing what they are doing now , which is boring , lots of money , and to be able to go after these single platforms that are high value . 

101
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,590
Now they have to decide g do I go after the sensor thing ? 

102
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,970
Well , I get that . 

103
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,350
What's those two others are three more ? 

104
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,880
Okay , you got a little bit of my sensing , but I am still going . 

105
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:57,610
And oh , by the way , the main aircraft or ship is still going , and so it forces them to now spread their forces to cover more . 

106
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,200
thanks . 

107
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:14,870
And this whole idea is , I try to do this in a way that my total class is less than what I would for just a single platform , but my capability is much increased , and the problems I cause for the other side are much greater than. 

108
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,057
It sounds to me that it also adds two things like versatility and resilience of the versatility . 

109
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:27,753
Now you can mix and match all kinds of different things until these systems of systems at the same time of one , it thinks , taken out of the other . 

110
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:29,254
You still have this resilience . 

111
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:32,280
We are , you're not thinking of shape , you're making so easy. 

112
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:39,137
No , you've written because that whole idea of an all talk about it is a adaptability . 

113
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:47,280
Maybe I want to change my mix in real time , which means , hey , we know what the mission is , and we need some better . 

114
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:56,070
Let's say , jamming capability or something I can put that in the mix , much easier than I can change it out on the whole platform . 

115
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,320
We kind of get what you get . 

116
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:05,820
One else is an interchangeable parts , and you hit it on the head with resilience and see it means they have more things to deal with . 

117
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:13,960
And so if they take care of one or two of them , and we like to use the term , we degrade gracefully , as opposed to either , are more . 

118
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,000
I am done . 

119
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:23,070
And the other way , it's adaptable is over time , in the sense of hey technologies changing . 

120
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:30,730
That's one of the biggest factors for , yes , we see it in our commercial world all the time , and new iphones are coming out . 

121
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,600
New capabilities hit of filming a movie . 

122
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:51,240
I do all I want my military systems to be able to adapt on those time scales , as opposed to it's gonna , be five years before we can build the next airplane if I more disagreed and disagreed and disagree , it is easier to change those parts out . 

123
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,790
So both over long scale. 

124
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,990
This is another theme i've been hearing about your job in other places . 

125
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,392
The technology cycles are just speeding up so much . 

126
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:08,140
And so there is this interest in more editorial in turning that cycle faster without the huge amount of expense in the matter time it has taken the past to do that . 

127
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,550
They go from version one to two , to three to four . 

128
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,020
I guess this is in the maritime domain. 

129
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,880
And absolutely , it affects all the domains . 

130
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,980
And one of the issues there is your heroes used to turn . 

131
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,950
And one of the challenges with compatibility . 

132
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:38,070
How can I get better and quickly pulling these things in and making them so that they go to it together easily , and I don't have to do lots and lots of engineering and test steam to put these two things together . 

133
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:44,080
And that part of the system system challenges is getting good at being able to rapidly compose and policy. 

134
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:53,020
Systems together , okay , so for some reason , as you were talking about this aggregation , I was thinking about a human body , which is a system of systems that got eyes that the system of get a liver . 

135
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,770
That's sure that this system of cells , and if that would disagree with it , actually , we and it will still be a living body with them . 

136
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,620
The , it was an amazing task of command and communication and integration . 

137
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:16,620
Kind of aware metaphor , perhaps , but it seems to protect yourself if you taking apart what has been an integral system like carrier , and you know , this , aggregating this into all kinds of pieces , what about that integration ? 

138
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,250
And that sounds like a hard problem , it. 

139
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,618
Absolutely and and you've done two things . 

140
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:39,610
And I like the body example , because the easiest thing to think about in our eyes , or a primary sensor , and I know how much better could you survive if you had to set the eyes that were yellow fifty yards in front of you , and you had an extra nose that you could put out over trying to do it . 

141
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:51,363
But now you've hit on the head is , well , it works good my body , because those nerve endings you'd only have to go from my brain down to my nose or my eyes . 

142
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:52,706
That's not too far . 

143
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:54,050
Now I put it there . 

144
00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:08,740
So we put the prayer on being able to set up effective communication passed that are reliable , because otherwise , what good is that knows that she should sit mouth there that could smell everything . 

145
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,280
But if you can get it back to the brain , it's of no value . 

146
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:22,122
And so you've tied in when we talk about these system of systems programs , sometimes people ask , well , you are really developing a lot of new technology . 

147
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:24,197
You kind using existing stuff . 

148
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:37,590
And exactly right , the dark , but hard part , the challenges , yeah , but i've got to do this now and make these reliable communications and networking and functions . 

149
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:43,700
He knew , now i've got instead of two eyes , i've got four , what i've got to have a brain now that can handle that . 

150
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,060
Which means how do I sequence things and do things because i'm getting more information . 

151
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,170
It's a good analogy to see what we're trying to do with the system of systems from a military stamp , right? 

152
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:59,430
And again , when you talking about dark but hard , we are talking about systems and systems . 

153
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:05,781
When you are entertaining , very ambitious ideas like this , more than entertaining , actually trying to make them . 

154
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:10,451
So what also then comes in here are issues that of communications , security . 

155
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:14,010
And you know what I might want to try to spoof the system . 

156
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,221
I might want to try to generate . 

157
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:21,530
And so suddenly these kinds of considerations become part of your above thinking. 

158
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,520
Oh , absolutely , becomes a huge deal . 

159
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,670
I can't afford to have somebody call up . 

160
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,510
You know , my forward eyeballs and turned them to look at the wrong direction to me . 

161
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,690
And so it's a good example of technology . 

162
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,160
We're taking advantage of things . 

163
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,450
But after then , look at what's the counter move and and do this straight off . 

164
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,080
And and by the way , this is why we were doing . 

165
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,570
This is dark , but it's not a hundred percent certain that this is the way to fight the future . 

166
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:59,930
It's our high politics , and there's a lot of evidence suggests , if you can do it , it's a great way , but that's a big year , and that's why we're doing the research . 

167
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:06,250
So can we really make this work and be secure and reliable , and all these things that happen and. 

168
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,500
Right , so you really probably what is possible . 

169
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:20,781
And in , and if it is possible , even if it is desirable in the end , right when you do get together with other program managers here , other other professions here at the top to talk about systems of systems . 

170
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,690
Who are you talking with , what are , what are some of the other ways ? 

171
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,340
I guess programs that you think of when the systems of systems , categories on your mind. 

172
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,580
Yeah , and it is funny . 

173
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,540
There's kind of two versions that I do . 

174
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:44,530
So when I talk to other , when I true systems of systems PMand others program managers were doing other systems systems program , you know , in the defence science is office . 

175
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,505
John passed with . 

176
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:47,212
He is really looking at . 

177
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:56,460
Hey , can I come up with mathematical constructive to help me do that composition instead of a state of , hey , I think this looks good . 

178
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,770
Let's try it now , let's go from there . 

179
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,230
So we talk about what about , hey , how can I have machine learning ? 

180
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:18,430
An intelligence helped me pull the stuff together , and interestingly , we almost always end logistics , because one of the issues is , now , i've got more things spread over part . 

181
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,790
How do I get on there , and how do I sustain them ? 

182
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,650
You know , the body works while the eyebrows come with the head , and it's a nice pack like it . 

183
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,560
Now i've got these two extra boards out there . 

184
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:41,021
Who's going to hold on the doors and keep them care and fed it saturday , the other way , though , that I talk to PMabout programs is , how is there particular technology ? 

185
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:47,363
So maybe they're making a better unmanned aircraft , or a better sooner . 

186
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:48,805
Where does that fit? 

187
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:51,815
Under the system of systems where those systems feature. 

188
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,336
Where do they fit in ? 

189
00:19:53,336 --> 00:20:03,480
And that's where we've had really fun dialogue because of the next one of the big problems for somebody can come up with a great idea for a better sonar . 

190
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,460
And I work on that now developed it. 

191
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,510
But danny kind ends up. 

192
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,585
Porch of the panic on with I will this great sonar , but where do I put it in ? 

193
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:18,136
How should I employ it and enjoy by ten of them , or do you know what I do ? 

194
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:28,104
You know what's interesting in system and systems you started to think about the whole , and it helps guide some things to say , you know what we really need . 

195
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:36,300
That song is be able to look wider , not necessarily farther or different things that might help direct their work . 

196
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,440
But at the same time , we're giving them a great story to say a husband fits in . 

197
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,530
And my gosh does. 

198
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,856
Make a difference , right ? 

199
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:46,045
Such an interesting thing that I elected . 

200
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:59,980
You're putting out potential technologies capabilities , but then you're getting back information from the field where the commanders and work hard , who are exactly giving you feedback and say , you know , this is what we really need is this is what we've experienced in an dynamic . 

201
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,700
You come up with something that really does . 

202
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,050
Further reino national security. 

203
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:09,070
Absolutely , in what's unique in this program that i've done , that , i've never done in my research career . 

204
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:25,860
We actually spend a lot of time working with the navy and organizations to create a very sophisticated war fighting scenario , very realistic , based on the , except for more to guide our research . 

205
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,870
And that's not normally done . 

206
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:34,900
We usually kind of think k or look at an engagement in this would help me defeat this aircraft if they came against me . 

207
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,300
Very rare to look at in terms of , hey , what would I do to win the war ? 

208
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,140
And that's the phrase we like to use . 

209
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,760
Hey , this is great . 

210
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:52,610
That's a nice technology , but doesn't help me win , and that's not usually question that we ask , you know , we usually just say , doesn't make me faster. 

211
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:59,699
Stronger , better yet , so as you bring in some languages in here , like , like music with the work . 

212
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There's , there's another phrase I heard roundup , but I think it must relate to this next music or fair had that relate to systems of systems . 

213
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,430
yeah. 

214
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,510
Music welfare is , in some sense , it is a different name for a system system . 

215
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:34,100
Certainly this system fits into it , but it's this whole idea of the ear of bringing lots of pieces together , and no individual piece does everything tells the story , but collectively get the picture . 

216
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:40,870
And what's interesting is , you can afford to lose a few pieces , and you still get the picture . 

217
00:22:41,340 --> 00:23:01,820
And that's this idea of being able to compose to make your music , tell a different message on our case , do a different function for the military and be able to put that together , make it , do that , rearrange the pieces , but does something different . 

218
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:09,910
Tell the different story , so to speak , and it can withstand the fact that , like I said , if a few pieces get knocked out , you're not done . 

219
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,700
So it's really that the same idea . 

220
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:19,450
But when I liked with the music is when you talk about this , the imagery of here , I can rearrange these two different stories to me . 

221
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,050
That means I can recompose a new , different mission. 

222
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,100
Right now , in a sense , that's been going on for a long time , but we have different military services that are different capabilities . 

223
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,800
They work in a kind of different domains . 

224
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:43,260
And so you can almost think from a generalized point of view there , there has been this kind of music thinking , but here will also bring that down more on the technology levels. 

225
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,960
Absolutely , and there is a little bit , you know , nothing is new , but we're trying to take it to a greater limit . 

226
00:23:50,530 --> 00:24:12,200
And one of the biggest differences there is , is , were really trying to bring in I men systems with man's systems and and game , create this much more rapid , adaptive , because yes , things have changed , but usually it would take decades to say , oh , organized this way differently . 

227
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:20,325
And among the user , this kindness system differently in and in many years , it will come out and we'll put it together . 

228
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:24,010
And so you get very aesthetic kind in how you operate . 

229
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,930
This is to be much more fluid . 

230
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,380
So if you write its an extension , but really trying to take it to that lemon. 

231
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,810
I said that you have had experience and academic . 

232
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,690
I was more violent on the sudden side . 

233
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,651
Thanks , you've had industry experience . 

234
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:50,670
You're networking in the government setting , in particular , darker , some , just wondering how you view double and weight in the overall innovation ecosystem . 

235
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,650
Where , where does it fit? 

236
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,056
Yeah , we have the services that have more traditional hay . 

237
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:58,413
We've got these products , and we need to get better . 

238
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:09,750
So what do kind of product improvement if you will , as opposed to dark is , hey , i'm gonna create a whole new virus product in terms of a whole new capability . 

239
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:16,040
And so it's the defense department , and really , that's the way we operate fairly quick . 

240
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,760
We pull ideas together . 

241
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,000
You then have an opportunity to make your case . 

242
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:37,038
You need to baby , do a small project to get some data to tobacco position , but then you go forward and you meet with the tech council , and in a very short time , you'll get an answer that says , yes , let's go forward . 

243
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,610
And now you are after the races to really make. 

244
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:56,190
By tech council , you're referring to what I understand here for program managers , or sometimes rehiring experiences where you have to go in front of leadership and really make the case for why the research is worthy , why it could have benefit to tax players and national security . 

245
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,930
And I think one other thing I was here when you use this VCeventual camp . 

246
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,908
Local analogy is that there , also , I think , is unusual willingness , even expectation that there will be failure along the way . 

247
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:19,930
Because if you are going to really move forward , not just incrementally , but in big steps , maybe you even leaps that you , you are going to fill one way onto his extraordinary , absolutely. 

248
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,440
Just like as a venture capitalist , if you show up and say , hey , i've got a way to get to ten percent on your mind . 

249
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,321
They're not interested . 

250
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:35,932
They can go to the banker somewhere and get that what they want to see is , how do I tend for my money ? 

251
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:48,900
Same idea with dark , but when you're doing things like that , if it was that easy , everybody be doing it so that you have to be taking risk , you have to be pushing for things that you don't haven't been done . 

252
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,140
And you know , a hundred percent of taking amy. 

253
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,109
Okay , also , we're getting toward the end of our time here , but for some reason , feeling little mean . 

254
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:06,970
and so a german wouldn't ask you , since we just been talking about the value of failure , if you've got to feel your story to share with 我要。

255
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:18,440
Turns out I probably have several , but user one , because it exists back to an old , dark project that this was when we were imagined earlier on the shock process . 

256
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:36,220
We had a billion apparatus with a lot of , if you will think of it as a bunch of little cans , and or maybe sixteen of them all on a big rack that we loaded into the , and any idea was we would shoot this often and try to do the timing right to make a shock wave . 

257
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:47,080
And we loaded in the water , and we hit the button , and we got the first shot , and we thought that was , and I speak bubble in water , and then we hit the thing again . 

258
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:57,070
Well , we did not have a sunny singing another time after a few times , we finally decided that it's not working and swiss to get it to bring the crane up . 

259
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,100
He pulled it up there . 

260
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:06,840
I think maybe one wire still dangling from the end of it , and we had bonuses and complete the smell of rings . 

261
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:16,440
And I think it took divers about two weeks to go find all the parts that we sprung all over the bottom of this query that we were testing . 

262
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,260
And that was not a completely typical day of. 

263
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,270
How can I go sometimes ? 

264
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,540
Okay , but you learn some lesson . 

265
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,110
We did . 

266
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:31,570
We changed the way we ran up for sure , thereby was a kind of just another day in technology directly . 

267
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,250
So jimmy , it's been a pleasure to spoken with you here for at least half hour . 

268
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:42,070
So I learned a lot , and I know that our listeners have as well . 

269
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,600
So thanks for sharing this time with. 

270
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,240
My pleasure and really enjoy this , thanks a lot. 

271
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,520
And thank you . 

272
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,430
Listeners also for joining us .
