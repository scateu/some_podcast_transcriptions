00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:32,600
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand on tonight's operation technology has a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war dirt , the defence advanced research projects has been a driver of technology . 

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,260
Welcome to Voices from dark , a window under darkness . 

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,700
Core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:49,710
My name is iphone a motel and arm your dark host today , I am pleased to be talking with christian michael baggage since twenty seventeen . 

5
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,260
In the agencies , biological technology office would be to you as much as anyone here are doubt . 

6
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:18,950
He embraces biology from its foundations in molecules that are boom cells , like , plus the interactions of these components , which are decidedly full of life , all of the way to like pinnacle manifestations , perception , learning and other categories of christian came to daughter from the european colorado boarder , where he was a research assistant professor in the department of molecular and developmental biology . 

7
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:31,730
His academic studies focused on the molecular mechanisms associated with the way drugs of abuse , toxins and neural developmental disorders protect complex biological systems , such as bodies and minds . 

8
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:43,163
Prior to his faculty appointment at the university of colorado , christian was a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatric at the yale university school medicine and an aluminous of the yale . 

9
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:47,740
Neither narrow property on the center , neither sense for nationalised to the drug abuse . 

10
00:01:48,270 --> 00:02:06,890
Christian received his daughter philosophy degree in integrative physiology and graduate certificate in behavioral genetics from the university of not on his official , the arab obey or two areas of applied biology that christian has developed the neck for one is home bureaucracy in which specializes in less familiar . 

11
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,852
Bruce , including one called his other DIY approach to apply biology . 

12
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:13,923
Sounds delicious . 

13
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:14,995
He loves to cook . 

14
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:29,340
He tells me , particularly classic , southwestern and northern mexican dishes like current meters intro lotters shi li RUIYANANGpork , green , shirley and purpose fruits with tomato just simply call baggage . 

15
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,690
Thanks for joining me today . 

16
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,350
But a different matter was pleasured with you . 

17
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,990
Well , so a humble in some of your chilly rain sounds , but that will help you wait . 

18
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,010
I am sure I will get an invitation at some point , right , absolutely right now . 

19
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:56,200
I want to learn about your extensive port for your programs and their assistant goals among the restoring memory law associated to traumatic brain injury . 

20
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:04,750
And as I have heard , you put it cold , slowing down to save life in cases of severe battlefield injuries . 

21
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,260
But first , trust them want to get some sense of the origins of your embrace of science in general and biology , in particular . 

22
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,840
In an earlier email exchange , you told me that by the age of seven , you wanted to study biology . 

23
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,710
So give me the origin story of of your interesting size. 

24
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:31,110
As many things in your early childhood development , you can draw up a pretty straight line towards printer influence both . 

25
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,760
And my parents are PHDscience . 

26
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,662
The chalk growing up was not , you know what you want to be when you grow up , but rather , what kind of doctor do you want to be when you grow up ? 

27
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:47,590
And so my mother has heard peace and educational psychology , my dad in electrical engineering . 

28
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,842
And so it's actually kind of funny . 

29
00:03:49,842 --> 00:04:02,390
If you know , one or the drug , you know , of line of continuing through , you know , the quantitative sciences as someone's life with you , you know , had a psychologist and engineer , end up with the biologists approaching me . 

30
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:18,240
And so he , yeah , when I was relatively young , and I had my first experience with the actual quantitative assessment of the functions of living things of , you know that this was the first experiment . 

31
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:31,856
You know , you do as it as a child in , in science class in school , with , you know , growing plans and monitoring their transition through different faces of development , ultimately leading to the the production of employment of fruit . 

32
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:45,250
I found that entire process absolutely fascinating , because it's spoke to the ability with which systems living systems pursue this sort of self organizing potential . 

33
00:04:45,630 --> 00:05:11,890
And ultimately , you know , propaganda and you know , contribute to this , or never ending continuum of existence , and the fact that it is all primary rise , and you know , produced as a result , measurable , quantifiable chemical reactions gives us the opportunity to understand that system in a manner that also allows us to intervene system . 

34
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:25,300
So if we can establish your functional and consequential relationships between you are what happens to a living system when it starts itself organizing and self repairing potential . 

35
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
What can we do to to bring it back? 

36
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:35,643
Okay , and and we're working against some of that when we developing more deeply into some of your programs like biostatistics , we're very excited to talk about . 

37
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:45,070
But I want sure that we give a shout out to a teacher abuse whenever there's an opportunity to give praise back and give our teachers a part of a back . 

38
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,610
I like that happen to know from an emailed . 

39
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,640
Strange that there are , you had an important high school teacher that was , you know , kind of catalyze some of. 

40
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,943
Oh , absolutely , so that it gives me great pleasure . 

41
00:05:56,943 --> 00:06:08,280
Haven't talked to him in the decades , but I assumed to mr tim henson , and I watch a high school , and I watch colorado , which is of the smallest town in between bolder and london . 

42
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:18,880
When I took his course in college preparatory biology at the age fifteen , that was my first real introduction into cloud . 

43
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:29,158
Shall we say the more fundamental molecular nature of life learning about you are the crime cycle about the rules underlying media and genetic scenes . 

44
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:35,810
You know , here , the ability of treats all that came from from college prep biology in mr henson's class . 

45
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,440
I also was fortunate enough that you are . 

46
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:49,730
He recognized , and I was probably forceful enough with my interest in the subject that , you know , the school curriculum didn't have live science really much beyond that . 

47
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,012
You know , this sort of the junior level science classrooms in chemistry and settlement . 

48
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:59,076
So he sponsored me to do two years of independent study . 

49
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:21,583
So I was the belong independent study biology students who was basically given the opportunity in the access to freely pursue a scientific of lives of topics that I find interesting , so as a consequences that spend the semester recording various features of of global wires around the third of colorado for a branch . 

50
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:29,690
Looking at neutrals of accident content , ph levels in settlement , various positions along rivers in the reporting that information to the court. 

51
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,940
The last question . 

52
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,190
So I went as before , we get into the programs is how your dark eventually began . 

53
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,090
I typically do ask program managers who sit with me for these conversations about you . 

54
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,310
How did they get to dark a story ? 

55
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,300
And so tell me that story and brief. 

56
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,900
So I came to doubt from the academic side . 

57
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,330
I , it was a performer on a dark program . 

58
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,180
The program was called RTAfor rapid threat assessment . 

59
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:12,040
It was the brain child of an XBTOPM, and in various quarter , who had the vision of saying , well , is there are chemical , biological threatens out that we have never seen before , cannot carry the right . 

60
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:26,310
How would we know how to respond appropriately with containment , with medical countermeasure design all that kind of stuff , what we need is a description of the mechanism of action of the threatened . 

61
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,460
What is this thing doing in a complex biological system ? 

62
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,810
It is not enough to just describe the chemical structure , the agenda . 

63
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,020
So we have to know what did it do and why . 

64
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,300
And so that was the challenge in the RTAproblem . 

65
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:59,120
It was now taking an unknown chemical entity , perceiving a biological model system with it , and then interrogating the responses to that production to determine what happened and why . 

66
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:18,020
And that was essentially a program that was , you know , almost taylor made for scientists with my type of of background , I cannot devoted my academic too , explaining the molecular mechanisms underlying yellow chemical prohibitions to biological systems. 

67
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,650
right ? 

68
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,660
And what years were you working on that program? 

69
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:29,050
So I went on that program from twenty thirteen to the end , thirteen early , twenty fourteen until I came to territory. 

70
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,320
Twenty seventeen , oh , I see . 

71
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,030
So there's a really a cut newly from you . 

72
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:40,770
You working as a performer that is a researcher on narrative program , and then coming in to the biological technology office as a program manager . 

73
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:46,050
That's a very sort of aggressively secret from performer to the program manager . 

74
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,550
And so let's move there . 

75
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:47,764
now . 

76
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:53,122
I mean , when you came in , you may know , for five years later , you got a real handful of programs . 

77
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,836
Some of the murray inherited . 

78
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:57,622
We'll get to those , I think toward the end . 

79
00:09:57,622 --> 00:10:01,980
Then you got three others that will talk about wisdom is a taste of all of this . 

80
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:12,380
If we can the first one to start with this program that you devised and which launched a blame twenty eighteen , is called the bio states program . 

81
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,220
And this has some really fascinating aspects with amazing organisms called territories and then wood frogs . 

82
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,200
But I let you sort of leave that into . 

83
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,560
You're narrowed to hear of what the buyer says is all about . 

84
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,840
And what is. 

85
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:33,490
Okay , so violates this is really a virus to the attempts , and outside it , it would be about trying to buy time . 

86
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:53,500
It is literally attempting to intervene with a complex biological system in a manner that preserves its functionality for a period of time , under which otherwise it would be stronger press , it would start to decay , and we would lose functional capacity and the system . 

87
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:16,910
This has rather direct removals for a number of applications within the department of defense , going all the way from logistical concerns , such as how do we stabilize and protect variable religious things like vaccines , medical countermeasures of settlement that ordinary would require a huge degree of infrastructure support in the form of inner temperature control set up. 

88
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,580
Known as the cold chain , right , there is something that we've been talking about with the interviews. 

89
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,208
Yes , get that perfect example . 

90
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:34,140
And then also the fact that , you know , there are issues around coaching , even even for molecules that are , you know , well , stable under certain temperatures are not stable indefinitely . 

91
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:42,940
And so you have the issue with , you know , the important resources that , you know , do no fault of their own , just lose activity over time . 

92
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:59,920
And from that all the way up to what are some areas of medical information that have not really been explored yet , largely for no reasons of the fact that the chemical to actually protect the system in that way , just simply doesn't exist . 

93
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:13,510
We don't have molecules in hand that can act as your broad spectrum stabilizers , reversible stabilizers , often complex , the biological machinery , which is not going to have . 

94
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:29,449
So what I wanted to do with file status was basically look at , you know , elements from the natural world where we see this type of functional , actually taking place , learn from those systems . 

95
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:42,680
Or what are the sort of your core guiding principles responsible for that capability , and then translate the more , you know , either logistically minded or human physiology minded application. 

96
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:52,746
Right , and so just tell listeners a little treat with descriptions of two of the primary biological systems to listen I heard about , so that's the wood frog . 

97
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:55,908
And it was amazingly writing free , silent for a long time . 

98
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,821
Come out , and it in the target grades , which are just that , you know , insanely interesting . 

99
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,290
I almost impossible creatures. 

100
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:14,573
Sure , so I mean , for example , that the work would target rates that was originally done by thomas goods be assigned to sell the university , north carolina , chapel hill , who was wondering performers on biostatistics as america . 

101
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:24,873
He sounds mutual , numerously violent , but he did a lot of work , actually describing what are the biochemical mechanisms by which is the small , you know , small arthur parts . 

102
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:34,505
Can we stand such extraordinary environmental stresses and entire grades , when they're legislature appropriately prepared , they can freeze , they can describe . 

103
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:36,694
They can be almost completely dry out . 

104
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:48,823
And in that state , providing excellent temperature extremes , extreme radiation of accumulated space , and in a white flower , to example that there are other organisms that can also do this . 

105
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:53,803
They enter a state that is not hibernation asian , and it's not torpedo either . 

106
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:55,285
It is in gas clothes . 

107
00:13:55,285 --> 00:14:03,684
We can come to crucial BIOS , which is a sort of terminate to find all , you know , the outward appearance of the absence of life . 

108
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:12,075
And yet life can persist and can resume its normal function when , in variety of conditions , we have more conducive return . 

109
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:32,422
And so what will I draw a lot of inspiration for by a status from really looking at the , you know , the molecular mechanisms and of the biology that is , that is responsible in these organisms , and then figuring out what is it all having common , and what can we use from that to help design , you know , our sort of novel . 

110
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,300
They are beautiful interventions and then tested . 

111
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:53,784
And so when it comes down to a target risk of our fascinating creatures , because we were , first of all , one of the things that they do is they actually increase the production of a certain class of proteins in their sales when they start experiencing , you know , the changing environment , that's basically a signal that you know what . 

112
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:57,997
What is is leaving , and we need to prepare for a period of pain . 

113
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:05,389
Try and so what they'll do is reduction of these users with class of proteins that the thomas name TDPSwere totally great . 

114
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:18,859
Disordered proteins were a biochemical perspective of their fascinating , because they're at least , you know , so like long spin , intrinsically disordered proteins , the doctor is spontaneously falled into a three dimensional shape . 

115
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:27,338
There is a sort of fraud and what they can do is they actually act inside the soul is almost like a chemical ship they packed in there . 

116
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:33,370
There are produced a great numbers of the assault of fuel of the gaps in spaces in between the south . 

117
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,242
Machinery can like packing peanuts . 

118
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:39,339
You understand keeping , not keeping everything where it is , you know . 

119
00:15:39,339 --> 00:16:00,692
And then they wrap around , they can actually stabilizing and constrain the inflexibility of social components , and that that appears to be really important for the ability that thousands of experience in the loss of all this work , you know , animals are , but you know , huge domestic reaction of an animals we are , and that goes away . 

120
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:05,773
The tendency is for the biological molecules to lose function as a result . 

121
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:09,698
In a day they did nature , they fall apart when the water goes away . 

122
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:14,429
But if the sale is protected appropriately , well , then it can actually survive . 

123
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:21,614
It can maintain its disturbed structural functionality , while we know that the change in hydration has taken place . 

124
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,720
And then when the rehydrated , while it can sort of resume the wrong process . 

125
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,120
And so. 

126
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,740
Absolutely brilliant at the right , and it sort of keeps the sales in the overall structure . 

127
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:41,734
Former needs to win when the water comes back , maybe , maybe months , and maybe even years later , I think a good way to give listeners a sense of really where you want to go with . 

128
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,683
This is in some ways to imagine a battlefield situation . 

129
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:51,320
So what fighter is injured , whether you have some of the tools that you have in visioning and our infector performers are beginning to. 

130
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,425
Real what would happen , allowing it , it , we will depend on the nature of the injury , the blue sky concept of operations . 

131
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:11,920
There is a two hundred something that can be administered at a reasonably large volume into the system in order to basically slow down its rate of collapse right after there is a unique life for an injury . 

132
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,823
There is a huge shock of that system in manifest in many different ways . 

133
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:28,569
Simultaneously , the analogy would be something it came to lucy a ball , and I love lucy on the chocolate bump on the same way , whether just they're down so quickly and so many different directions . 

134
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,615
And she , just , you know , two hands just cannot keep pace with that . 

135
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:57,149
There are too many things happening at the same time , such that , you know , targeted interventions , right , you know , one hand grab in one band band , not a graphic is , it's not going to automatically result in the kind of your control over that , you know , catastrophic runaway system that you would want the appropriate thing to do is to slow the about that if you had that capability , you could reduce the rate at which , in all the events are taking place . 

136
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:02,070
Wouldn't then you have more an opportunity to intervene , and actually , you know. 

137
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,973
Care of the system , right , and this . 

138
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:22,510
So this gets back to sort of weighing and introduction when I threw that kind of very teasing lineup , which is slowing life to save , you know , so that's the idea the beneficial situation is that goes an hour right when there's a severe injury you really need to get that word fighter to sophisticated in a medical intervention . 

139
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,770
And this is the way that maybe help more injured board fighters survive. 

140
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:32,330
That is the hope , and it basically boils down to and into radically oversimplify . 

141
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:54,819
You know , that the process of life is the living systems from the cell all the way up to in the blue whale are ultimately all they're all supported by giant sets of parallel and interconnected chemical reactions by a chemical , one of the defining features of most biochemical reactions that they do not occur spontaneously . 

142
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,470
They have to be capitalized . 

143
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,773
They need help to take place their energetically disfavor . 

144
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:03,147
And so what are responsible for those catholic events ? 

145
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,406
Are , you know , any of them ? 

146
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:11,540
They're proteins , they're the large bio molecules that , you know , make up a huge portion of , you know , the contents of ourselves . 

147
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,641
Well , those things all have rates . 

148
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:26,060
And if you introduce something that slows the rate down , and it's relatively universal will not only have you , you know , slow down that rate , but potentially you slow down the rated , which the system is action . 

149
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,860
That's the high professors , right ? 

150
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:40,054
So we can do that to degree right with , with things I call temperature in other reason that there is a cold chain is because called slows things down is slows chemical regions down . 

151
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,611
We go back to , you know , everybody's gentlemen class . 

152
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:46,219
We all learn the original situation . 

153
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,720
You know , the temperature is a of that equation . 

154
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:59,460
So as you refrigerate food , you are slowing down both competition from my growth rights as their metabolic rate is slowed . 

155
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:10,089
So who doesn't spoil his father due to , you know , the growth of modern victory on the food , and then the , you know , food itself is , you know , in transit copies is worth of saying or integrity . 

156
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:15,435
You know why your careers could wrinkle them and fall apart from that , that is also sold when it is cold . 

157
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:16,358
So that's fine . 

158
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:33,370
But what we want to do is use a more chemical biology solution because of another component in the iranian education is responsible for governing the rate of chemical , and that is the frequency of collisions between the reactions in the appropriate geometric . 

159
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:43,607
You know , how well does that key fit into the walk that then allows the chemical reaction to take place to take , and in a biological systems , and so many of these things are catalyzed by proteins . 

160
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:54,700
If we can control the geometry of the protein , control its three dimensional confirmation of flexibility , we can exert some degree of rate of reactions that it is capitalism . 

161
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:03,068
And if we were able to do that in a very broad spectrum , sort of promiscuous special , you can effectively and act something like warm , freezing . 

162
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:06,520
You know , it is a small room temperature reduction in activity. 

163
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,100
Ha , ha , nice report . 

164
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,960
Yeah , I could talk to you forever and buy a status right now , and we are just scratching the surface . 

165
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:24,630
I don't want to deprive listeners of getting at least a taste of some of your other programs when you move on from here , tracing out what i'd like to do is talk you about a pair of your programs once called panel's . 

166
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:39,377
Yet here you challenging performers that will be called researchers working on programs that develop to mind the vast reporter , proteins , human bodies , for which dragon adventures , you know , might help or fighters , and the neighbourhood is called focused farmers . 

167
00:21:39,377 --> 00:21:55,650
The other goal there in interesting leaders is to develop drug companies for neuropsychiatric conditions among the depression and post substance abuse , but that work with unprecedented specificity and receptor proteins on cells . 

168
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:05,300
The idea is it gets several beauty effects with fewer or no side effects is one tank goal costs in medicinal chemistry and information to go science and medicine . 

169
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,670
But talk about those two. 

170
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:24,790
If you want , I can , we can even bring by your spaces , and because they're actually kind of all in a continual , you could basically oil by a , this is done to say , i'm looking for chemicals for which there are reversible and favorable interactions with as many proteins in the service possible . 

171
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:32,530
So looking forward to the views and promise you was drugs that you can imagine where the target for the drug is every protein . 

172
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,220
Then in panacea , it's sort of in the middle . 

173
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:45,496
One thing , whereas identify clusters of proteins , clusters of drug targets that we want to interact with with a single molecule , and then all the way in the other end , is focused . 

174
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:51,852
Farmer , we're not only in mind after one specific protein , but i'm after one specific , eagerly impacts way that it impacts . 

175
00:22:51,852 --> 00:22:57,890
So we're literally running from the dirty of drugs in the world into the cleaner strikes in the world across. 

176
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:18,600
Whether the interesting thing about panacea is that it sort of does bucket a paradigm of the medicinal chemistry in an industry of farmers who call this career approach , which has to try to malaysia summer lacker intervention that focuses on a single in a protein target might be a receptor might be something else . 

177
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:34,950
But what you're bringing in yourself , acknowledgement of the complexity of the system and say , well , it really might be better to have ten protein targets out there that can give you a better therapeutic responsibility is some way of getting at panacea , right? 

178
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,460
Yeah , that's correct . 

179
00:23:36,460 --> 00:24:05,920
So I mean , if you really think about a conception in another one of those who are famous , scientists pull early under the bus , but he , in a politics is a claim assigned to the end of many decades ago who had this notion of the magic bullet being the thing that were going to be the most successful drugs that if you can identify the one thing that was wrong in the system that was responsible for this function , you could change that one proteins function with a drug that only targeted that one protein . 

180
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:24,586
Then you would end up , you know , fixing the problem , and you would have a very little taxi girl , you know , our undesired side effect in the problem with that while thinking is that , in many cases , most manifestations of disease , or in a following injury , they're not due to a single disappointment system . 

181
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:27,850
You know , most disorders are motive , patrol and nature . 

182
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:43,551
And so , as you say , yes , we need to accept that there are certain complexities in the system , certain redundancies and certain diverse manifestations , of course , that will otherwise present with something that is connecting very similar . 

183
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:59,103
And so what we need to do is really increase the diversity of our chemical interventions that we have access to this , so that we can do a better job actually plugging into the system that wrapped assortment of promotions in order to get it back on track . 

184
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:13,609
And in many cases , actually in existing , we know the farmer computer , you know , the collection of all the drugs that we have that have , you know , distributions in many cases that drugs that are the most effective act on multiple components of a male functioning system . 

185
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:37,030
They have targets that produce a , you know , either an attitude or a synergistic affected manifest , as , you know , a greater therapeutic index being in the concentration of the drug that is effective before becomes , or a great reminder to the affecting on how much relief do you get from the symptoms associated with this condition when you take this drug that has insert cluster of targets to suppose the other drivers are . 

186
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:51,132
The problem is that in many cases , the identification of , you know , those multi target , I can draw some record on palestinian political activities in mobile phones is that it happens very difficult . 

187
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:51,995
Is it just luck ? 

188
00:25:51,995 --> 00:26:01,670
You know , we ended up being in a position where we were looking at the effects and variable to sort march backwards through the targets that could be identified . 

189
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:15,327
And then by applying the appropriate study of physiology , we could say , oh , well , the reason that you know , this drug has a longer lasting effect on this condition is because , well , it turns out that one of its off target effects , something that is was actually beneficial . 

190
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:19,148
Now , will that unlocks now a whole new area of study were reconciliable . 

191
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:29,631
What other you know , contributions are these particular targets making to the manifestation this disease , or rather than leave that kind of discovery , you know , up to chance for the penalty . 

192
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:47,360
I thought , why would we take a more systems biology systems from a college approach to it and actually do political ecology by design in order to do that , what we have to have , there is a very good representation of the malaysian nature of the condition we are trying to improve . 

193
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:56,060
And so in pennsylvania , that's why we're really focusing on the designer my colleagues are getting getting down for one more with you , with multiple targets. 

194
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,300
Sounds challenging and wonderful . 

195
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:07,106
May you succeed that , and I want to make sure that we , in touch on one more program that called the targeted neuroplasticity training program , or TNT . 

196
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:10,355
Yeah , this was going up from the molecular scale executive . 

197
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:18,420
Incredibly interesting idea of stimulating the preference of system in order to enhance learning and absolutely amazing idea . 

198
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,530
Can you give this new success of it ? 

199
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,490
What the goal , that program meals and what is its status? 

200
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:39,420
Yeah , so TNT was originally devised as a throne applied nor engineering program to leverage preferences simulation and promoting in our state that is receptive to burning memory . 

201
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,160
And the notion really came from the observation that we are nervous . 

202
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,310
System in private . 

203
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:55,603
Define has young , two components , the CNSessential and the PS, the performing resistant CNSis your brain , spinal cord , and then PNSis basically everything else . 

204
00:27:55,603 --> 00:28:14,524
This system they talk to return , and since nerves are electrically inside myself , you can deliver electrical stimulation to , you know , accessible branches of the profile , nervous system , and you can see that stimulation result in changes in central nervous system function . 

205
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:17,604
You can appreciate basically what you done is activated . 

206
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:21,542
An african projection , you know , from a disclosure penetration . 

207
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:59,980
Whatever the translates that the electrical imports into a chemical signal in the central nervous system , some pioneering work in the space had been done in empire to the inception of the program , largely in the areas of rehabilitation following a so it was observed that if you paired electrical stimulation of in a large fiber volume of the vaccino , which is known as these big poor phone nerves and sort of wonders down from the brain through the neck , and then ultimately intervals that the visual workers they called the vegas , because it is the vague about nerve , a kind of wonders all over it . 

208
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,106
You'd deliver an electrical stimulation to the vegetarian . 

209
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:14,010
You can impact the degree of synaptic plasticity in circumstances , and synthetic plasticity will destroy broadly defined as the phenomenon by region . 

210
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:23,469
Neural activity changes in reaction to various importance in it , one of the , the core physiological components , you know of learning memory . 

211
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:49,448
And so TNT was really looking at , what can we leverage that kind of interface , you know , from an electrical stimulation to approval nerve in order to produce a window of potentially improved synaptic plasticity in order to accelerate the encoding of professional stimuli that would ultimately result in an improved rate of learning that program has ended . 

212
00:29:49,448 --> 00:30:23,421
When I think about him , it's not necessarily that , you know , your generating a state that is somehow you augmented in , you know , relation to a statement of the brain could normally achieve , is just changing the likelihood and the temporal dynamics of that state , one of the mechanisms have really came out of the nature has been important for its impact on sanitary questions has largely to do with the phenomenon that delivering electrical stimulation to perform those results in a state that is sort of a generally reminiscent of century arousal . 

213
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,490
He said , uh in the brain of novel. 

214
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:36,612
So in general , your sort of dying up , the learning entertainment probability , the fact is kind of a general dilling up means that it might work for whatever , if you try to learn a new language . 

215
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:41,170
If you are trying to mathematics , are trying to learn how to use a new weapons is whatever. 

216
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,150
That's the hope . 

217
00:30:42,150 --> 00:31:05,257
I think it's important to point out the internet and other thing that we determine is that the timing and the presentation of the nurse to the century input and the , the reaction to the century input is also extremely important that when you are training someone and you deliver a focus performer information to the biggest nerve , and it is temporarily paired with a correct response . 

218
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:08,492
Then the subsequent responses are more likely to be correct . 

219
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:39,110
You essentially the system saturday , you know , there , they were focused on me what the context of century input was at the time that they responded correctly , that increased the likelihood in a subsequent response is , if you pay the stimulus with either rendering or with an incorrect response , you're actually more likely to buyers the system in the opposite direction , so it can be crucially important what the timing and the context in which the training is taking place . 

220
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,730
How are you delivering performance nation? 

221
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,242
Just finished up on the TNT program . 

222
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:54,790
Have any lessons come out of that , researching from the performers that have been working on that program that are close to being applied in a trading or learning situation. 

223
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,981
Also , we have a number of things that they came out on the the basic science side . 

224
00:31:58,981 --> 00:32:24,059
I would say that a number of the lessons learned how to do with nerve target engagement , and they need for very specific and atomic interfaces that , you know , for the most part , the physiology that is really responsible for the observable effects of large manufacturers in the program really depends efficient activation of deep branches of the various nerves . 

225
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:34,100
So that is to say that the large fiber volume , nerve that is your couple cinema is bubble the skin , and that try to deliver electricity , you know , through the skin . 

226
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,681
Sophistication is bad . 

227
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:36,133
muscle . 

228
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:36,811
Is sarah . 

229
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:39,523
All that stuff is really great insulator . 

230
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:48,110
And so you actually don't end up driving the deep targets of the nerve if you are going to provide electrical stimulation through this . 

231
00:32:48,110 --> 00:33:01,816
And so one of the teams are until the university was causing medicine that has had some success in their response of a small company around a proud of political , the inject and injectable lecturers . 

232
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:06,745
So is there is a novel composite polymer that can be introduced . 

233
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:24,690
Nonsensically been a thriller needle to basically provide a direct electrical can do it from the to those these branches of the nurse that you , you know , don't have to go through , you know , but the national invasive , you know , coffee and play a procedure , and you can circumvent that problem . 

234
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,050
We're trying to get your reliable , objective activation to a deep branch of the nerve . 

235
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:34,583
That's one of the things that never calling a reasonable success from the problem . 

236
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:51,482
And then the only thing that we learned it was really important is , again , this terms of timing and context , that , in order to , in a really achieve a considerable benefit when it comes to optimizing your , you know , sort of state of arousal . 

237
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:52,600
It is important . 

238
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,980
There is a zone in which you want the students to be in order to achieve efficient processing and discrimination . 

239
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:19,242
Incoming century information , whether is , you know , the sound of new words that are being used , or whether it's the presentation of , you know , new objects that the trying to learn how to you will want a specific degree of general riots or present , because two year too little arousal , and they're not an attention too much . 

240
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:21,040
A russell under napping . 

241
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:47,910
And so we have an ongoing study in collaboration with a research laboratory at air , foreign and university of maryland that are working right now with the air force , foreign language , defence , languages to that monetary california , and they are basically applying the innocent of best practices that we generated from the program to see an ecologically valid in a circumstances . 

242
00:34:47,910 --> 00:35:02,560
Right , you're dealing with bilateral foreign language winners does hiring , you know , the sort of a finally control performance stimulation of the new language does that in the , in fact , improve their occupy formats . 

243
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,280
So that experience is. 

244
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,467
Now , I wanted to return just briefly to focus for me , because one thing we did get out . 

245
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:22,276
There was one of the more fascinating aspects of , and this has to do with investigating how valuable drugs like alice d and suicide , and those that are in a famous for their hallucinogenic and capabilities . 

246
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:39,270
Just , what can I also do in clinical settings for conditions like depression and post dramatic stress and anxiety , these sorts of there is a new research feel that really has been emerging and building momentum of investigating these . 

247
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:47,990
Talking me little bit about how focused farmer is looking at these kinds of agents for the kinds of neuropsychiatric issues that the war fighters often. 

248
00:35:48,750 --> 00:36:03,351
Basically , focus farmer is an effort to introduce some more chemical diversity and magnetic novelty into the space of north psychiatric medication in a , regardless of target . 

249
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:27,414
The effect of the matter is that a psychiatric drug development has , has really suffered over in over decades from large scale investment that there are your classes of drugs are generally prescribed that are generally safe , new of things like selected search on and reality and evidence in my prosecutors all up to sarah , that do produce , you know , measurable effects for us for a number of people not in anyway . 

250
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:44,310
You have to crying the existence of those compounds , but it is also well appreciated that , for you know , the broad swaths of the population who suffering from anxiety , depression , postman distress at zero , there are a lot of the existing molecules that we have to treat those conditions . 

251
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:50,147
They suffer from a circumstances where they produce a fact that are what it may be statistically significant . 

252
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:52,677
They are what we are politically insignificant . 

253
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:59,980
You can administer because at the individual depression , they will get measurably less depressed , but it doesn't move the needle out of the category . 

254
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:09,087
Being depressed right there is still the pressure just left the press , the phenomenology to know , you know what a lot of pioneering work are by rolling briefs at the chance . 

255
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:13,631
Hawkins , as well as a robin carter heroes , a formally of university college one day . 

256
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,250
He just useless . 

257
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:32,340
They really started doing some experiments with the cute doses of innocent classical psychiatric drug , a source event paired with therapy for treatment resistant depression , as well as anxiety and depression associated with end of life and cancer patients . 

258
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:54,047
And one of the things that they found with those experiments with the fact that they could get that in clinical manifestation that affects size , that moved the patient out of being depressed into now , no wonder the press , and then a similar effect size was seen with the sort of large scale , the mass travel and the amazing system cycle therapy for postman express . 

259
00:37:54,047 --> 00:38:06,226
That was a multi senator trial that that recently published their their final result showing the dynasty method and fundamental drug , also commonly known as excessive , not a classical psychiatric , by any means . 

260
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:10,000
That mechanism is very different than so asylum , but it's still one of these . 

261
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:33,070
Instead , we call it more brownie modulators of the syrian original transmission that went again , paired with therapy and the amazing society that he could produce giant effect sizes and otherwise treatment , resisting cases of cosmetic stress to the extent that they were no wonder meeting diagnostic criteria for health and cosmological stress . 

262
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:44,937
And , moreover , that that remission was long lasting that it would persist months or more , as opposed to hanging a drug like , you know , personal resolve that you will take every day as part of your regimen , right ? 

263
00:38:44,937 --> 00:39:20,640
So having that kind of phenomenal logical evidence , and it really sort of spoke to , okay , there are , in fact , some physiological similarities here that we should be integrated with the eye towards the first fine , the range of their activities are available that may keep on some shared aspects of this physiology , right , because the other truth of the matter is that , you know , classical psychology not spent appropriate therapy with option for a lot of people if we were to live at the criteria for the clinical trials done with so seven . 

264
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:32,810
And you know , you couldn't take it if you had a family history of my poor , if , you know , you know , you know how any family history of your skills africa is that there were a huge exclusion criteria. 

265
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:46,800
You may say , if you could decouple , those are often times difficult manifestations of the use of these substances from the clinical aspects are targeted to say , four depression for a postgraduate stress that that would open up new evidence. 

266
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,840
Well , it's more than I am interested in asking the question , right ? 

267
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,490
Because first of all , we want with the chemical matter just doesn't exist , right , we don't have in our hands yet . 

268
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:14,010
Molecules that have the same kind of target engaged as the classical psychiatrists , but for which the signaling processes that they , the they stimulate are isolated , most travel , classical psychiatric tend to act as indiscriminate activators of downstream signal . 

269
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:18,810
Sarah , tony receptors , when , in fact , there are multiple downstream signaling pathways . 

270
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,810
We need the chemical matter can to selectively activate those different downstream . 

271
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:48,140
Second part is , in order to answer the question , can we , in fact , in due responses that allow us to see whether or not the theoretical facts can , in fact , be uncoupled from the more defused , hallucinatory psychiatric effects , we just the factors we don't have the material in hand to even answer the question , let alone pursue it as a therapy of option . 

272
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:59,980
But it is also fair to say that deserves to be done , because we all do you know that there is a substantial proportion of the population who cannot currently benefit from the psychological? 

273
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,508
Psychotherapy , fantastic . 

274
00:41:01,508 --> 00:41:31,556
Well , so again , now I wish you a great success with this aspect of focus for my biggest inner could potentially open up in a really new , important or mathematical categorically open up a lot of people we have covered a lot of ground truth in a new bin , blowing my mind all away from the molecular dance going on inside of sales and how you might be older in some ways to spend up to extend a goal now , or in case I , because I am injured in some terrible way , may that not happen . 

275
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:37,173
You're all the way up now to waste of using the powerful nerve system to enhance learning . 

276
00:41:37,173 --> 00:41:44,550
And now is we just discuss with focus former new furniture categories for treating psychiatric issues . 

277
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:52,369
Just one more question , before I give you the rest of your day back here , you know , there , anything that did not come up in discussion about your scientific journey . 

278
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:59,980
You're journey as a program manager , a doctor that you think listeners of this package would find interesting. 

279
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:15,770
Yeah , I think in general , how are you going to be expensive that listeners are going to be interested in the end of the culture of darkness and the perception of the culture of dark program managers exist in a approval space . 

280
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,510
Right , we are . 

281
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:28,474
We are given a lot of freedom with which to make decisions with which to resource efforts in order to produce research projects that are very nearly due to us . 

282
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:37,260
There is a lot of I, Iwould dare to say that in a program , managers are very personally invested in the programs that they are . 

283
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:48,968
So we know we have a , we have a tendency to take things personally , because there , there is that degree of relationship that exists between the ideas the problems are trying to solve . 

284
00:42:48,968 --> 00:42:53,240
The reasons why we're trying to solve , and ultimately how the researchers done . 

285
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:30,454
And I would say they , despite that emphasis on the program manager as the sort with the entity responsible for all of this fantastic research and pushing out near the boundaries of what is incorrectly possible , or I would also say that it has been part of my experience that this is a profoundly collaborative agency that I spent a substantial amount of time in very productive discussions with my colleagues hear the agency getting very different respective on a number of fundamental issues and questions . 

286
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:54,700
And as well as the collaborations that I have both with the other governmental agency , the end users who is ultimately going to take the thing that I try to invent and turn it some real enabling capability for university , for natural security , for meaningful rehabilitation , for treatment , for restoration in a very population. 

287
00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:15,122
我们这边的话就是说我们现在已经开始做这个事情了，themselves that part of the job of a dark a program manager is not just coming up with clever ideas and setting things in motion , but also continuing to work and pay to know what the researchers producing . 

288
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:24,712
What does it tell you about your initial hypothesis and any assumptions that you made in which of those things are ultimately going to be rejected ? 

289
00:44:24,712 --> 00:44:28,732
You know , we all learn as much from successes we do from failure . 

290
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:44,100
And so sometimes you just have to be mindful and do your best to establish the appropriate balance between things that are practically impossible for a reason versus things that are practically impossible , just due to electronic. 

291
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,010
right ? 

292
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,650
Well , thanks . 

293
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:45,820
I have . 

294
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:53,227
I always love the agencies embrace of failure as a equally informative and instructive as successes . 

295
00:44:53,227 --> 00:45:15,023
So christian , you've taken me on just a fantastic tour of your mind of your programs of where I , you think about science , where you want to take a pilot science until new capabilities , technologies , just achievement as I just have you and your research performers succeed in all of these natural defense mission , for sure , is allowed to gain from these efforts . 

296
00:45:15,023 --> 00:45:20,213
But these are the source of ones that also could spill over , you know , just a bit for for everybody . 

297
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:22,210
So thanks so much for joining in the. 

298
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,410
Oh , you very welcome and thank you . 

299
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,070
Thank you very much for for all the well wishes . 

300
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:34,680
I certainly hope that history and results will educate favourably for the intentions of the efforts that I started working. 

301
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:47,380
Indeed , indeed , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from garbage , thanks also to TOM shortage for his partnership in producing this program . 

302
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:59,423
For more information about christian michael bakery , the program is he and his colleagues in the biological technology is opposed to run in the many other breakthrough technologies .
