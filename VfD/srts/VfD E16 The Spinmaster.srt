1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,760
Step of technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand , are totally missed. 

2
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:31,860
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defense advanced research projects has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:40,750
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,710
My name is ivan a motto . 

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,740
And I am you double host today . 

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:51,690
I am pleased with me in the studio , rosa , a hundred workers known as alive by her friends and colleagues . 

7
00:00:51,830 --> 00:01:14,269
Alan has been a program manager since early twenty seventeen in darkness , defense science office , where program managers take some of the deepest types in the fundamental in search of new foundations for novel technologies , relevant to national security allies , deep dive into fundamental science goes all of the way to electrons in some of the more unusual they can organize and behaviour and certain materials . 

8
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:29,347
And how might be useful to engineer those electronic organizations into new microelectrodes and micromagnetic devices for applications in memory , logic , energy conversion and sensors prior to arriving a dark early was a professor of physics at the college . 

9
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:37,030
William and marine williams burger in before that , she was a member of the physics faculty at the university of the little in ohio . 

10
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:57,880
And yet earlier in her career , she was a research scientist at the argentine national atomic CNEAin venezuela's argentina after finishing her early college training at the university , witnesses ali earned her doctorate in physics from wayne state university and retried michigan , and she completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the university of michigan and albert , I like . 

11
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,720
Thanks for joining me in the today. 

12
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm happy to be here . 

13
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,180
Thank you. 

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,210
So let's start out by talking about how you became interested in science and general . 

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,540
And then in particularly in physics , and the empty of electrons. 

16
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:28,300
When I guess that , you know me , I started being interested because my father would read to me articles that he was interested in in a magazine that he was getting delivered at home at the time in one of the sidelines , he was getting , some of which was a french man getting involved later . 

17
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,060
Discoveries and developments . 

18
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,460
And he was reading this to me when I was like seven or eight years old , so I mean , it was a very early start . 

19
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,390
So that was the beginning . 

20
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:45,560
And then , well , clearly , a minimum science has always been a billion to me , and we were getting additional languages inside home . 

21
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,970
You know , that I was very obviously . 

22
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:56,070
I remember reading once about shredding globalization , and even though I was like they really live in the top , and I didn't know what you mean . 

23
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,360
I knew how. 

24
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:05,580
The shrinks , the question you were , you were reading all about the deeper , because parts of economic economics of uncertainty makes me think that your parents were signed , strange and so. 

25
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:12,105
Father was a doctor in engineering , so but yeah , clearly , I mean , I was reading in this magazine . 

26
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:23,700
I said in a minute , didn't understand what it question men I was staying , but I still was able to write it , you know , to draw it if you wish , I was able to draw a disagree with a paper . 

27
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,620
And to this day , I remembered it from that day , I was very fascinated by decent , clearly , well , given us a stand went by . 

28
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,160
I was greeted my head that I was going to go for a career in science . 

29
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,550
I didn't know exactly what I speak to science shortly . 

30
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:48,900
But surely , you know , myanmar began very , very interested in the electronic properties of materials and trust went from their own words right now. 

31
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,350
right ? 

32
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,200
So the first part of your career you ended up going in an academic direction . 

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,510
You became a professor at william and mary . 

34
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,220
So talk me a little bit about the experience as a professor . 

35
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,810
And I wanna hear you are , how did you get to dark story ? 

36
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,120
So start with the university. 

37
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:18,037
Okay , so I mean , I have been fascinated by the fact that , you know , me is not about what we are doing is like , you know , where's the spaces , we have to realize that our part resides on the fact that we transfer our knowledge is not . 

38
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:22,782
Our individual knowledge is in knowledge from every generation before us . 

39
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:28,452
Any disabled duty in my mind to buy this along to the next generation , where part of right ? 

40
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:51,217
Correct , correct , so i've been always interested in in being a professional for that same reason , because I wanted to to be able to identify and students that internet , that capacity they've tried to go for scientific research and to try to amend them and help them be the best they could be so that they can , you know , that is no lesson that particular area ever more . 

41
00:04:51,217 --> 00:05:04,063
So that's why I went for the candy , of course , you know , when you're going to get the email , one of the things that you need to do in order to be able to to carry out this mother left trying to train grade students , you have to get funding . 

42
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:08,769
And so clearly , I mean , I had to explore all the fountain agencies among them . 

43
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,550
I export our bye and gotten funding from the orbit . 

44
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,210
And eventually you want to cannot learn . 

45
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,610
Okay , what does it take the other side right to understand ? 

46
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,790
How do you know , select the best people to do best ? 

47
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,228
How is this process being proceeds from the viewpoint of the funding agency ? 

48
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:36,660
So it was particularly intrigued by dark , but because I say , said it was happening by funded by the park in the beginning . 

49
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:44,060
This model of trying to find basic science that has a goal and ultimate goal was really very appealing to me. 

50
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:53,522
Can I just ask your question of that dark in particular , because of as someone in academia , you might have gone to nationalistic to support , you might have gone to national science foundation . 

51
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,460
What about that world? 

52
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,602
They're doing there . 

53
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:58,837
There are several parts to this particular question of me . 

54
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:14,501
On the one hand , you know , as a senior american , not by birth , but by choice , you know , I have a deep love for this country , the evaluation for this country , in , and a sense of duty regarding , you know , trying to help this country to continue be what it is right now . 

55
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:24,680
And the best way my opinion is to try to see , okay , what are the needs of the people that are they far from difficult from difficulties that will be defended , the armed forces in general , right ? 

56
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:37,932
Is it what is that is going to make that difference in terms of university and technology of analysis and research that can help this dismission , and clearly the advice at the first front of all of these funding agencies and that particular direction . 

57
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:45,550
So I was very , very intrigued and cute years and interested in the impact of this particular organization for that reason. 

58
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,190
So did you reach out only two ? 

59
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,690
Darpa , was there somebody here that knew about you ? 

60
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,430
What was the ? 

61
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,150
Those were the final steps that got you onto the ruster programme managers? 

62
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,839
I had the collaboration with store wolf , who was at a time when I was a william and murray . 

63
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:07,572
He was at the university of a junior , and he was leading the newspaper in the newspaper . 

64
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:14,010
And and and I took it up on myself to actually introduce my research to him to try to study collaborative effort . 

65
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,930
And index did happen , and we actually got a couple of british is going . 

66
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,100
And so eventually , what , of course , I knew that he had been a doubtful manager in the past . 

67
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:34,780
So I mentioned him that that I was interested in , like , you know , seeing the others side of the fourth is so he actually told me what we don't give me your CV, and I will buy it alone . 

68
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,970
And particularly he told me that he was going to show it the symphony dominance , which was set up down the director of the. 

69
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,424
And there are some meaning defense , like software . 

70
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,670
Six , a technical officers are. 

71
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,448
Correct and the russian history of english . 

72
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:53,300
I guess that she got my CV, and she contacted me to see if I was interested in pursuing a career. 

73
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:02,091
So you mentioned to wolf , and that gives me a little bit of an excuse to maybe dive into your entry press , because it has still worked . 

74
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:07,527
He's a big name in the area of spain , chronics and miss gifts to electronics and materials . 

75
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:14,010
Okay , talk to me just even a little more generally , emotions as the physicists that you are about this arena of that. 

76
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,189
So so grab you . 

77
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:18,020
So basically , my , my career in physics here . 

78
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:26,750
And this country has been focused in particularly on spin dependent phenomenon , particular magnetic materials and magnetic phenomena. 

79
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,170
And by spin dependent , you mean , depended on the spans of political lecturers , right? 

80
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,421
Pretty particularly electrons . 

81
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:34,644
Yes , that is correct . 

82
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:54,720
The electronics being so turns out that would you read the proper manager here , though , super stewart actually was the father of spain journey in the scene that he realized that there were some discoveries that were happening at a time when we were talking like late nine days are , in particular , the giant metal assistance effect , which was particularly driving . 

83
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:02,580
He falls for the explosion in a hard driving city and stories in japan that we have experienced the last twenty years. 

84
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:03,515
Just wanted to accept you . 

85
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:09,605
For many , I realized we kind of just passed by this idea of spin , dependently spin of electrons . 

86
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:16,880
But there's a difference spin of electron , which is little less familiar , as opposed to the charge of electric and the negative charge , which could most people do know about . 

87
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:24,610
So , talking about those different aspects of the electronic and where spin dependence is in the coming into the group. 

88
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:34,515
Great , so the electronics beneath the very difficult quantity to define legal citizens that quantify the electronic world of mechanical effects . 

89
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:44,400
So instead of trying to define what spin is , one is whether or settled by defining what is that being does in general , what you find the election . 

90
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:57,078
Yeah , if you , if you think of it as like a little error pointing in any given direction , what happens is that the accurate spins like to eat a barrel to each other and a bullet to each other , and indicates a magnetic materials . 

91
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:07,005
What happens is that the electrons items in particular areas of the different attempts , they all like each other that , you know , very much attractive to one another , pointing in the same direction . 

92
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:10,602
And and with that gives you some opportunity to give the meaning to this . 

93
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:23,990
And so , for example , you can say , okay , if I have a group of things spins that they are all aligned and given direction , I can associate , that would say , number one , and if they are pointed in the opposite direction , then I can associate this with the numbers . 

94
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:36,272
And then you have the banner language , and you can combine the vitalities language and more complex languages that lead to what we using confutations these days , similar ones in zero of our digital age . 

95
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:54,350
Correct , correct , so spin allows to do this in the advantages of spin in in , are , are that , well , you can actually have these composition of spins to be made really small , which means that you can actually back a lot of these beats of once in zero in space . 

96
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:05,790
Ukraine hands the area , then CDthat you can store the ones and zero they happen to be done by the nature of the materials are protected against radiation , damaging . 

97
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:20,080
And in one of the holy grades , as I was being to try to find out what is that limit , how small can you make the leader amount of spins to store a once in series in a stable manner , so? 

98
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:37,010
And they were sentenced by focusing on spin of the electoral , rather than charge of the electron that you can actually have a smaller area of a piece of semiconductor with all these electrons are , are living that the smaller piece of that that some economics will host a one of our zero is. 

99
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:51,020
It's not just a question of the size , but it is also of the energetic , I mean , you know me , one of the things that matters to use do not to see how , how much power you've gonna be needed in order to have these , these consideration of this and one . 

100
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,667
So in general , you know , this is what what we found . 

101
00:11:53,667 --> 00:12:19,680
There were several effects associated with these activity of the elections of the involved and dialogue , that code technologies that will enhance the incident without increasing the demands of powerful and making this very stable ceremony , and also on the location , so that makes the entire in a collection of a property that are very , very attractive , not just for storage density . 

102
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:28,370
So car drives , but also for memory , but , and that's basically one of the goods that this benjamin program had the program that stored actually started to be. 

103
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,500
Right , let me bring you back now too . 

104
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Another big , multi celebrate crazy that you use earlier , which was giant magnetic resistance . 

105
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:48,320
We simply bring that up is because that phenomenon and the technology that it LED to became part of our everyday lives in our hard drive , right in the red heads of the hard drive . 

106
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,670
It tells a little bit about that technology , evolution . 

107
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,310
And where does it? 

108
00:12:51,610 --> 00:13:03,943
So what happened was that what it was found , and this was what letter , the novel of brights in nineteen ninety eight was that when you have layer systems in which you two magnetic layers separated by one layer , that is not magnetic . 

109
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:13,960
And if your best current through this particular contraction , the resistance of this contraction will be different when the spines of parallel with respect when they are under violent . 

110
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:25,158
So that gives you a mechanism to read what is going on in terms of the biggest parallel , and they're valid , because you have now resistance to enable that , that the domination , and that's how you sense . 

111
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,380
What is in the hardware. 

112
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,810
So you are reading the spends , what are your parallel ? 

113
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,000
And I do paralyse , but you are. 

114
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,175
Correct , so that is a big power of this . 

115
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:37,450
So that was discovered nineteen ninety eight . 

116
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:52,196
And then later it was discovered , was that if you replaced the intermediate layer , the magnetic layer that goes metallic was done by an insulator layer and insulate , then you have an effective civilization , which means that you have an amazon sensitivity . 

117
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:53,145
What you're doing . 

118
00:13:53,145 --> 00:14:05,440
That was this being dependent on the natural systems being done , a independent natural assistance , and that LED to the explosion in , usually in england , that we have a magnetic , random access memory is great . 

119
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,680
Yes , I always forget that in a photos of hazardous and the field , this is like everyday language , right? 

120
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,870
I have been in some ways and understanding science , and emma is understanding acronyms that some of the battle. 

121
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,750
He beginning , the government has been in the end of the country is very single day. 

122
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:29,062
So let's then segregate into your wife's appropriate material and exactly doing this for less than a year . 

123
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:35,963
So you have a kind of perspective of an early program manager , which I think it would be quite interesting . 

124
00:14:35,963 --> 00:14:38,472
You already have two programs under your wing . 

125
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:46,220
One of them pause , which stands for a program in ultra fast laser science and engineering , is a program that you inherited . 

126
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:58,123
And the other one , the top logical executions in electronics , or t that's a program that you pitched to the agency leadership and got the green lights of congratulation on that . 

127
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:58,742
Thank you . 

128
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:10,400
Let's start talking post , which seems to be about a new sort of taking our ability to generate and manipulate electoral magnetic graduation in ways that have been . 

129
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,860
so . 

130
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,960
Tell me what your tickets are important , but you hope to achieve. 

131
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,329
Both adjusted , it is a program that I inherited it . 

132
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:27,878
The BCtenant of the program is that it was to use again , some discoveries that have been increased outside by the the community , which is related to the frequency gone . 

133
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:31,114
The frequency gone is something that takes up in . 

134
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:38,990
It can like a separate , specific frequencies and brother ration frequent and use that for a variety of application. 

135
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:46,489
COM comes from right , because if you think of each frequency as a tie of account and rely on them all up , you get something that somebody looks like to come . 

136
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:47,700
You usually brush your hair. 

137
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,480
Correct , and so you can select secretary at the end of this reconsidering men . 

138
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:15,420
And so there have been worked that I was particularly interested in because it dies in with the programs that I am going , that I developed , people have been able to user technology , for example , to get a kind of extra behavior that the kind of behavior that you get with a single drum facility , which is a big , large facility and a table dropped type of configuration . 

139
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:31,690
So there has been fascinating to me , people have been able to to achieve these by using frequency comes in the other extreme of it was also that people have been able to probe things in the time domain , and we'd add a second position that is. 

140
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,890
Really short duration , right , right ? 

141
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,700
I mean , adult second is turned to the minus eighteen seconds . 

142
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:47,390
So if you think of another second , which is tends to the nine seconds , which is one billions of a second , then an adult second is one billion of one billion. 

143
00:16:47,470 --> 00:17:08,366
A one second is really , really fast , so that they think about this is that it is going to enable us to actually look at the dynamic dynamics of electrons , because those are the only entities that are going , but not the only , but at the mainland , it is that are going to be moving in that regime . 

144
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,970
So that is what you are going to be using this kind. 

145
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:24,500
So in some ways , it is almost like you are trying to create a movie camera that is mapped onto the way electrons live in the speed they live at , which is so much faster , and a minor human. 

146
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,710
And not only the human , but are even the things that we have been doing doing so far . 

147
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:38,460
Because I mean , you look at the various ranges in which we got to have been looking at things , yes , we move at some speed , you know , as humans , but then it is , molecules also have a weird moving day . 

148
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,310
They translate . 

149
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:46,700
They rotate their vibrate and then seeing those , because those movements are not at the , at the second , they are much slower than that . 

150
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,447
So we have been able to see some of those things already , some in your getting the capabilities that we enable us to see . 

151
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:57,222
As I said , in the realm of electrons , which are so much more than the same and move so much faster . 

152
00:17:57,222 --> 00:18:02,710
So this is a new capability that would be a good achieved by this programming is due to the album . 

153
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,720
This does not exist today. 

154
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,680
So let's stand this one for a second before you move over to your tea program . 

155
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,310
So this , this sounds like very fundamental science . 

156
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,960
And of course , that's why it was in DSof defence science . 

157
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,550
His office among the six second glove this year , but on the other hand , we are also in dark up . 

158
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:27,900
And so tell me a little bit about not only sort of where this might push the undeveloped in fundamental science , but how that might actually be of relevance to national security. 

159
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:50,990
But some of the things that , for example , these technologies were enabled and happening , talking to the performance system , for example , provide methodology , for example , for the masks in the battling that have been done a dynamic level for microscopes that are used in the middle makeup of a number of driving systems from each other . 

160
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:59,980
You need microprocessors and micro electronics in a number of of instruments and things that are used by the armed forces that are used by . 

161
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:22,697
So when you reduce the footprint , there are a number of things that can , without the minimum addition to lower weight , obviously reduced the smaller you make a tables so fast , faster , which also enables , you know , faster , read information , but you also may enable lower power consumption , which also enables the acceptability of having this institute . 

162
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:32,230
This is given this cheap to work with less badly , needs so badly also have their own weight and footprint on the soldier's backs . 

163
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:46,940
And in all of this is going into the same direction to try to the possibilities for safe for the soldiers to be more efficient when you have right now , but less bulky and less power hungry . 

164
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:53,410
So the methodology that disconnect will enable gosh in an indirect question , but it goes into that particular. 

165
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:59,795
And by micro logic , we mean some of new ways of measuring films as click case , very , very small claims . 

166
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:08,920
And as you are speaking , it also makes me think that this does perhaps play into the future of progress and micro electronics . 

167
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:19,980
And that is always this , this business concern for many minutes at at some point , we're not gonna , be able to use the techniques we use now to make the next smallest transistor we can actually need very new ideas . 

168
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:30,280
Perhaps here that coming out of posts that will open doors for yet another era of of ministration or not , many transition , increasing capability and. 

169
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:38,040
Of the trip , but at least , you know , more with the same , right , more sensitivity for less powerful beneficiaries are the same size . 

170
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,040
So isn't that the addition in each way that you are there , there is a very broad , but I made our space that you have to consider when looking at. 

171
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,668
All right , so a lot of opportunity . 

172
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:53,181
There are members , fundamental science and potentially applying an interview to the highest of technologies . 

173
00:20:53,181 --> 00:21:00,423
So let them move over to your baby that we can call that your top logical executives in electronics program . 

174
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:09,314
And I know this gets a little bit hurry , because we're using words like top logical , or where you can take our imaginations down to the electronic level . 

175
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:14,680
Talk to me as obama in undergraduate physics , and your introducing some of these ideas for first time. 

176
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,050
I tried in the meaning . 

177
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:48,334
One of the things that I mentioned earlier was that one of the holidays that we have had for the obligation of in , say , a storage renewable is , how small can you make this collection of space so that they can keep the information as all aligned meaning and one or all align meaning we've been disturbed by preparations , because in the end of southwestern energetic consideration , if your temperature fluctuations are more than energy than the energy that is contained in this group of a of electrons , then they're not gonna win , and then you lose . 

178
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:56,292
Information is like , I like the day my students , you take your left up to my yummy , and that goes all the information that you started , that would be fun . 

179
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,233
So you need something better than that . 

180
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:16,025
And so I have been following the jenny turns out , you know , that we have a new door , our , our disposal for , for blogging , new partnerships , and is what the college brings , which is again , something that has to do with the , they are all the intentional configuration of things. 

181
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:20,520
But not just as a technology comes out of really the deal wrong. 

182
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,442
Of geometry , right in a way , yes , like in , in a way . 

183
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,340
Yes , it has to do with something that has to do with a special configure . 

184
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:40,850
So in this particular case , that we go to the heart of the method , I mean , I told you that spins like to be barrel and dialogue , but he doesn't say that this is an attempt of the possibility that scientists have discovered . 

185
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,532
And he said , they are engineer for them to be candidates that is making some angle between them . 

186
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:55,360
Now , you lock them into discounting , and you try to put them on a surface , you realize , and now they had to arrange themselves in such a fashion that they can accommodate the academic . 

187
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,930
And when you try to do this exercises , if you take like , do little , be , do little doing . 

188
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:10,300
And then you went about several of them on a surface , you see that they had to be arranging kind of award exercise , kind of little things to the political experience of regulators are right . 

189
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,060
Okay , something like that . 

190
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,960
You can put them there right on the surface . 

191
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,974
And that is what we got screamings , right . 

192
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:17,581
And why are these interesting ? 

193
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:26,690
Well , because now , because they are counted , if you want to switch them off , pointing in one direction to pointing the opposite direction , now you have to do this with the entire , the entire lot. 

194
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:37,620
And just just for clarity , when you say the word canteen with you , likely these spines are candid , means that they're not parallel or anti parallel , but are actually a certain kind of angle , almost like. 

195
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,420
Correct , correct . 

196
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:57,230
And so now , because they are locked into this by some mechanism , right , you just cannot switch one without switching the other , so you have to switch the entire thing because you have to switch the entire that caused you more energy than it will be doing just the individual players , right , so that makes an introduction more. 

197
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:04,070
A little doubt of thermal energy , he is not , is not enough to football correct , so they become stable , correct. 

198
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:19,710
That is what the topology offers you a production , so that if you can like , engineer this in a suitable way , such that we can create a region of spins in this configure multiplication smaller than what we have right now for collecting the ones and diseases . 

199
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:26,750
Then you are in the next generation of media that would be based upon this type of material , and that would push it . 

200
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,540
I mean , and there are some metrics that tell us , where can we go ? 

201
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,510
What would we achieve me doing that ? 

202
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:39,990
And it is not just size , as I said , that really so , so question about energetics , how much energy you really need to do do this ? 

203
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:52,220
Can you move them around , and you actually do things with them so you can open up several paradigms to use these entities for memory , logic or sensitive applications beyond what we can do with materials , right? 

204
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:59,300
Okay , and this still fall within the tradition of spain , china , accidents and still worth , or is this beyond , is this in some other? 

205
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,070
Related , so it will be spiritual in in spirit , right ? 

206
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,560
But it is . 

207
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,890
It has this added thing , which is the topological protection . 

208
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,320
This is top box in double logical spintronics , right , right ? 

209
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,170
So that is a new thing . 

210
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,960
And that is. 

211
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,560
What is gonna ? 

212
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,460
Take us ? 

213
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,120
Let's talk about where your program is in sort of the general lifecycle of a program . 

214
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,670
Here is dark . 

215
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,090
So you came , and here you came up with this wonderful idea . 

216
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:31,270
You went through the hiring experience of bringing it to its called tech council , where leadership in your coal program management . 

217
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,160
Others are there vetting it ? 

218
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,670
So you made it passed all of those obstacles. 

219
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,870
我。

220
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,500
Now , what's the status of the purpose ? 

221
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,370
So right now , we have passed . 

222
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:48,700
Source selections show a broader announcement was placed for the people and university proposals . 

223
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:57,020
The proposals were evaluated by teams of experts , and then decisions were made in terms of what the most. 

224
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:05,630
Qualified and teach me that by source , select action is that those who can make a past , these obstacles become a source as a where we tell them for. 

225
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:08,802
Correct correct , so right now , that is the states . 

226
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:26,598
And so what we are going on right now will be , you know , the contracting part of , so is that when the money is actually being delivered to the performance , and so we think that we would have the kick of meeting sometime early during the eighteen , and shortly after we'll be reviewed time , right ? 

227
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:30,140
I mean , they have to perform between the art by another agency as well . 

228
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,880
Is that there are very strong metrics that have to be satisfied in order to continue with. 

229
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,220
Progress , although I certainly miss you , this , you know , this reminds me a little bit of some of the early days here . 

230
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:52,210
I doubt about where , for example , there was a funding of something called the inter disciplinary laboratories , and at least became kind of the , the seeds , but later became known as material science and engineering . 

231
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,000
So starbucks had a role . 

232
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,610
They are next to the united . 

233
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,220
Kind of it is nurturing . 

234
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:13,340
What had was honest way to becoming a new material science is this is this kind of a sense of that kind of possibility where , because you have an idea that organizing groups , these potential performers , do you think this is going to be important for starting a new field? 

235
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:23,587
In fact , it is particularly important to concentrate the efforts of experts that are maybe working on various other areas that may not be related to one another . 

236
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:34,980
But to then focus them under a specific problem with the specific metrics , and that may lead to advances in this particular territory in which we are not even brief , because we don't know what they are going to discover . 

237
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,580
I mean , we are thinking that one application would be . 

238
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:58,042
This new generation may modify that we all are needing and wanted to happen , but it so happens in the suspect experience that , you know , prior people in , including school , has mentioned this to me that often thinks what happens is that the performance discovers things that you need and anticipate , and the program can go in a different direction rate and start the new program . 

239
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,870
You just don't know what they can take you . 

240
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:13,150
So that's basically what my hope is that because this is basic science , that is all of the best ability of the groups , groups of people to discover something completely non undissipated that would blow our minds away . 

241
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,420
We would like , well. 

242
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,013
We'll make that happen , as that sounds really like an exciting possibility . 

243
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:39,100
And in some ways , I wonder if I wondered if at a place like dark , or whether such a diversity of skill set , whether there is even more of an opportunity to recognize when really surprising things happens like a sleep , maybe if everything promises , no question , here is another to hear you kind of air dropped in from academy . 

244
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,300
You're in the defence science office . 

245
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:53,130
Have you met other program managers or wanted other programs that that , in a sense of blow your mind , and that are , you are now beginning to think of how they relate to your own. 

246
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,780
interests . 

247
00:28:53,780 --> 00:29:15,520
I'm definitely looking into this , particularly for the m do the manufacturing technological life is the microscope that is correct , because these are the guys that would be perhaps the ones that may take on whatever developments come from the issue , because they are the ones that are going to try to make actual devices out of this if they turn out to be , do living up to the promise that we are hoping . 

248
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,170
So yes. 

249
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:22,889
So it looks like an interesting synergy there where you might be on the really fundamental side of things . 

250
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:23,513
And telled . 

251
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:37,460
My system technology officer , even though still fundamentally in engineering site , could take it further the next step toward what ultimately would be the finish line , and , of course , of the way dark it works that would probably be out in industry or some a part of some other lab . 

252
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,140
And in the military services. 

253
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:47,750
But there is so easy and expected , because in the sensor technology , you don't know , this may take you to some biology related sensors that we are not even thinking on right now . 

254
00:29:47,750 --> 00:30:02,920
And it has happened a lot of in , in particularly in recent times , that a lot of the discoveries have been done , like , for example , taking the indeed of nanotechnology , and in people who are working with analytics for a number of physical application and then and then the biology started thinking . 

255
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,330
How about using them as markers for biological , you know. 

256
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:14,757
Rights and by and by nanoparticles were kind of talking about things , viruses , so things that much smaller than sales , more , even smaller than some organisms . 

257
00:30:14,757 --> 00:30:16,570
But the suitable one that virus. 

258
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:23,149
Correct , so there are , there are opportunities so that that we just don't know , and we will have the , you know , we will see the performance . 

259
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:23,880
Get there there . 

260
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:30,740
And then , you know , if there is certainly an opportunity , we will really , really explore it in and make the people from between. 

261
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:39,400
Aware of this , so , and BTor game was an excuse to mention that another one of the officers said that the biological technology is correct. 

262

Correct , correct , and so that's that's from the indian , who knows ? 

263

265
00:30:48,800 --> 00:31:03,160

266
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:13,590
Right , and again , as tears are going through the entire reporter here , the entire set of others , that strategic technologies of us that could be only when we did mention so far as the technical technologies are not just . 

267
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,255

Take that . 

272
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,780
I mean , that is the beauty of working for the issue that you are there for front of science . 

273
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,550
We are there by science . 

274
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:33,440
Starbucks , in that regard , you know , that we are working with things that we don't know where they are going to take us . 

275
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,050
That is not a specific goal . 

276
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:41,560
We have some idea where we want to go , but we don't know if there are going to be new opportunities arising from them.
