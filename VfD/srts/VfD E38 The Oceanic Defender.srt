00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:31,710
Stuff technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand on the most operation , and technology is a driver of our times since its founding a one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , the defence advanced research projects has been a driver of technology . 

2
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:40,270
Welcome to Voices from darker a window on the dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible. 

3
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,307
My name is ivan , a motto on your dark post today . 

4
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:59,980
I'm pleased to be talking with mister john waterson , a program manager , sends twenty seventeen in the agency's strategic technology . 

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,010
We are recording our conversation from our respective homes as we do our parts to slow the spread of covered nineteen , and because we are not in a recording studio , you might hear ambient sounds like traffic , planes and birds prior to arrive in a darker . 

6
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:31,285
John was a senior program manager in SRIinternational advanced technology and systems division over a number of years there , he LED defence research programs in cyber arctic sensing unmanned vehicles , among other technical areas , with his pipeline from SRITEDERBAR. 

7
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:38,450
John brings with him interest in maritime autonomy under distributed sensing and non traditional communications . 

8
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:49,140
John surely developed some of those interested in his twelve years in the navy doing what she lived on three different submarines and learned how to operate in nuclear actor . 

9
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,625
He continues his military service as a commander in the USneighbourhoods . 

10
00:01:53,625 --> 00:02:04,470
John received the bachelor signs to read electrical engineering from the us naval academy and a master science degree trickle engineering from stanford university , earning that agree in two thousand and one . 

11
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,110
John watson , thanks for. 

12
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,790
For joining me in this conversation , thank you . 

13
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,520
I mean , this is a great opportunity to talk today. 

14
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,673
So interesting bit will arrive into some of the programs you are overseeing . 

15
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:23,422
One of these seems like they're hoping to install a century and nervous system into the planet's oceans . 

16
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:31,120
Another one has to do with developing a back up to GPS in case that must have system or two suddenly become unavailable . 

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,980
Another is about creating a GPS like system networks under water bowl . 

18
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,470
Them hugely ambitious . 

19
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:49,110
But before we hear more about those programs , i'd like to know something about the influences and experiences in your life that turned you toward electrical engineering and a career . 

20
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,900
At least the first period of the. 

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,410
One of things has always dreamed . 

22
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,370
I wanted to figure out how things work and kind of work at a fundamental level . 

23
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:11,899
And so when I was thinking about going to school , electrical engineering allowed me to understand how computers , phones and all the digital communications are today was working . 

24
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:16,060
So that's kind of what attracted me to electrical engineering is . 

25
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:25,030
I want to lose people who is it satisfied with their son , black box and wanted to get down into the northern boats work with the navy . 

26
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:40,503
I thought it would be a great , great opportunity to see the world and a big believer in making decisions as you move through life to maximize your opportunity while growing up in high school , I was involved with the scott , so I always had kind of a big service component . 

27
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:40,889
My life . 

28
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't have a military family , although my grandfather served in the navy and two , I went to the neighborhood academic , not knowing what I wanted to do . 

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:01,660
I feel like , maybe I don't know what I want to be when I grow up , I probably still want to be when I grow up , and maybe there has been a place where I can explore many areas that interests me and show success . 

30
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,070
The navy trains everyone to do a very important national mission . 

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,210
And so again , I pick submarines , and I think I learned a few things along the way , and it's been very helpful. 

32
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:20,329
You brought up the idea of the black box , and particularly in our electronic realities , we have so many these black boxes in our lives . 

33
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:39,560
And yeah , that's why I have actually always admire the electrical engineer , because that is a profession that some sense of just almost everything about those black boxes , they transistors and other devices that are incredibly manipulating them , how they all look together , how software is interacting with them , how directly creating the capabilities . 

34
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:47,456
So I think you so as well , if you want to know how things work these days , you probably couldn't have done better than an EEtraining . 

35
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:52,860
And I also want to just follow up on your survive experience in the navy and working on submarines . 

36
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,680
And if you know , one of the smoke so population out there that actually knows how to brand a nuclear reactor . 

37
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:09,940
But wonder if any of the that experience , and any of those skills that you developed is that setting is helping you in your new role since twenty seventeen , as a program manager. 

38
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,648
Well , it still feels new . 

39
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,588
That's another thing about life . 

40
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:17,683
A dark book goes by super fast , but getting back to a life on a summary . 

41
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:21,994
Everyone on a submarine is responsible for everyone else , right ? 

42
00:05:21,994 --> 00:06:00,650
You have to be an expert in your life job , because the ocean is cool , and chips really shouldn't be able to submerge below the surface of the ocean and survive the basic thing that is taught every summer winner is , you are responsible , and you have to become an expert within your area of influence and know everything about the ship that you are living on so well , it on the summary , and I was more focused on mechanical systems , hydraulic water , the nuclear reactor , and less on the black box is computing . 

43
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:18,420
I still use those tools every day to do in an important mission , and that's what really attracted me to summarize in the first place was , I felt like they always were at the tip of during the coolest missions around the world , and I wanted to work with people who have volunteered to do that . 

44
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,960
While I played out my activity. 

45
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:29,500
Okay , because you're one of the few people I know who , who has lived on summaries under water palace for extended periods of time . 

46
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,650
Now I know you are in various machines that you just can talk to me about . 

47
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,740
You can talk your kids , can talk your wife . 

48
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,000
But my guess is that there are some pretty crazy things that probably happened . 

49
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,970
Very fascinating , interesting things down there is something that just surprise you , that you actually can tell us about. 

50
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:53,900
There is a lot of great stories on board summary , and my first dive to tested up on the USSto meet carter . 

51
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:05,151
My job was to to check to see if a hatch was going to work at death in the thing is , as I climbed up in this hatch , and I knew the pressure the ocean was pushing down . 

52
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:21,207
There is no way was going to open , but I had to move the mechanical linkages to make sure that it wasn't binding under the extreme pressure in opening towards fully open position and all the scientific knowledge and words , as others , thousands of PSIpressure on the outside of this . 

53
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:29,170
But here you go , you're opening it to the maximum position on the entire , you know , unlocking that wet , and just to make sure it would work . 

54
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,650
And boy , that was one of those who got to believe in everything that's like that . 

55
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:42,520
There are similar things like crawling down the end of a torpedo too , but things like that , a very unique experience is that you just want to find in other navy. 

56
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,570
Shapes , thank you for give me some sense of some of the moments on the summary . 

57
00:07:47,570 --> 00:08:12,510
And so just want to keep moving forward here in your career before we get into talking about your programs and suggest before coming to DARPA , you're at a serious international for number of years , as ryan has had a bunch of touch points with the agency uniform actually decades , including some , historically nowhere , the project scenarios in a library , computer technology about excused machine interface is things that sort of . 

58
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,680
But i'm just wondering about you are how you got to starbucks story . 

59
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,320
How did you go for mystery to dark? 

60
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,270
It's true as a ride . 

61
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,100
I mean , I first was introduced as a right in graduate school in parallel . 

62
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:34,170
And when I decided to get out of the active duty navy , I went back to as a ride to connect fuel my intellectual curiosity . 

63
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,663
And when they're in melbourne park , you see the first mouse . 

64
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:44,741
You see the cocktail napkin where the internet was kind of sketched out you . 

65
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:49,090
We meet the researchers who built and interfaces like that . 

66
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,430
Okay , and all of which have dark connections . 

67
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,320
exactly . 

68
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:10,740
And so I was given the charter to build a marathon portfolio that has arrived based on my naval and ended up winning two dark contracts , started performing on those contracts and interacting with the people in the dark of the buildings . 

69
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:23,010
And I realized that I could move from , you know , industry into the government and continue along the strategy of kind of making really interesting solutions for a lot of my neighbor. 

70
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:33,650
Yeah , so you're bringing it also that additional kind of special experience has been a former performer , which has started speak for a researcher on contract , on on a particular program . 

71
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,710
And I imagine that is really serving you well . 

72
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:42,090
Now , on the other side of the program manager who is giving contracts out others to work on your programs. 

73
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:51,165
You understand some of the dynamics around what is the business case for this , or what might management be needing from the principle investigator ? 

74
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:59,980
So you understand how this negotiation works between government and industry , and is where all trying to create these interesting technologies. 

75
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,950
Now , let's dive in to your programs . 

76
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:11,130
And for the first one , I guess it's more like we're floating into the program , because there isn't a floating sensors are going to be a key component of it . 

77
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,911
I'm talking about your ocean of things program . 

78
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:14,312
We join . 

79
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:17,314
I love you to tell me and listeners about this program . 

80
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,716
What's the need you are trying to meet with it . 

81
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:20,516
And what have you ? 

82
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:27,240
And the researchers , the performers you're contracted to work with on the project to c you'd so far. 

83
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,810
Ocean of things was born of my understanding of the ocean . 

84
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:49,910
Is it in in this realization that it is so amends in recovering seventy percent of the earth's surface , and even with all of the ships , all the aircraft , all the satellites and all the existing centers , we are severely under sampling this environment . 

85
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,710
It's a dessert of data , and we need to come up with a new way to sample it . 

86
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,100
And then with those new sensors , lisa is things , floats . 

87
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:12,180
What can we do with this new high resolution data to serve existing academic , commercial and military users in the maritime environment . 

88
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:41,200
And and all I seem pretty brought , but to be honest with all the investment that has been done in the commercial space with things like cell phones and microcontrollers , you're able to get very low power , low cost processors that are able to now make decisions while flowing out the ocean in the communicate what those floats found back to cloud storage so that our performers can do data analysis on this . 

89
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,850
And that's a game changing. 

90
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:49,596
Paradigm I want listener sexually having their minds , just some sense of cool and vast and motivated . 

91
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:55,172
The system is that during a regional hero , in fact , we are well under way to bring into a realization . 

92
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,826
So we'll be good if you could focus on , on on the main component . 

93
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:03,699
So I wanted to do talk a little bit and be described it about those floats . 

94
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:14,910
You talked about how their communicating to a system of satellites , and what is going to happen with the data that the floats are really those satellites to other analytic systems on the ground. 

95
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:22,680
One of our technical areas , and that's how we break down our programs that dark is really delivering this flow hardware in face . 

96
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,230
One was we just completed . 

97
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:36,130
We had three performers who are building kind of environmentally friendly flooding sensors , and the sensors were not just traditional maritime scientific measurement devices . 

98
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:50,567
There were more like three year old cell phones , and because they were three old cell phones , they all had the same things you do on your cell phone , you have a microphone and cell campus GPS , and limit the overall causes rises . 

99
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:53,365
We actually had mission centres as well . 

100
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:57,436
Things like higher phones , cameras and suffered fine radios . 

101
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:09,700
And so we're trying to do is in those sensors in to a platform that was lost in the harsh ocean environment , and that is a challenge . 

102
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:18,620
That's really difficult because the ocean marine can look at it so harsh , and these floats are trying to be so low cost . 

103
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:26,820
So we're previously pushing at a dissidents because traditional boys and ocean going platforms are very expensive . 

104
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,557
We don't build lots of them . 

105
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,063
So we put really exquisite sensors on to abstract the most data . 

106
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:41,870
This is solving the exact opposite corner of the spectrum where we're trying to build lots of sensors , where that are commercial quality , and then put them into the ocean environment . 

107
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:53,604
And my thesis is , if you have hundreds of these lower quality sensors , you can and argument existing sensors and filling the gaps in ocean understanding . 

108
00:13:53,604 --> 00:14:05,145
And one of the news things we didn't face , one was really look at the materials and one performer used vacco to cardboard to be environmentally friendly . 

109
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:21,330
One performer used glass , as in capitalism , can be more like another traditional japanese fishing floats , and one performer was more traditional innocence of they used aluminum , but used the word to provide the bonuses . 

110
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:41,140
So these floats are designed to operate for month on their own , often solar powered , and since the environment of their own , and then the only thing is , since they have processes , they can realize when there's a change to that environment and report that change back to me and our servers in santiago . 

111
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,220
So right now , we have floats in the pacific , the golf of mexico and even the mediterranean sea . 

112
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:55,420
And we do that the original satellite , so really is more of a medium altitude satellite . 

113
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,200
What were using is their small birds . 

114
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,730
Data service are floats , sweet . 

115
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:14,410
In essence , three hundred and forty bite messages every fifteen minutes back to our servers , where we can check their status , see what they are and generate a bunch of interesting data products for user community. 

116
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:29,136
I love that the trading energy , because I mean it is pretty good , right , because the original idea of twitter was , you know , it sort of like , what are you doing now , or what you , but you've observing now , when so now we should talk to you better having all of these floats . 

117
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:33,080
You tell me , tens of thousands of thousands of floats throughout the asia. 

118
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:43,270
So this year alone were building over five thousand floats of a design that smaller , lower impact and has more sensors on it . 

119
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:50,580
So we're increasing both in the number domain and in the canada impact , or moderates of something that we can achieve . 

120
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:59,390
So with thousands , now we're going to start to have really tested the thesis that I present a deal where number might be more important. 

121
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:17,345
Right now , it also excites me so much about the ocean of things is the way it actually can be a value to , you know , many of society sectors , of course , we're at dark others at the beginning of DARPA defense advanced research projects agency . 

122
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:24,017
So surely things like situation , awareness and surveillance are part of what you have in mind , what dark hasn't mind . 

123
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:36,870
What do you want to have in mind with the ocean of things , but you also how valuable it can be kind of as a new century system in the ocean for fundamental science and just for monitoring the condition of years. 

124
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,957
You've got that exactly right ? 

125
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:52,770
So when we did a survey of the existing censors that are out there in the ocean , we find out that , well , if you're in our whole ocean graphic institute , you build yourself a sensor , great collection data is out there . 

126
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:06,230
You know , some of the new ones are saying , after for four years , at times are great , but it's very similar to the same sense that the neighborhood oceanographic coming and could deploy , or a naval surface ship could deploy to get the situation . 

127
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,010
Awareness community member would employ . 

128
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:24,160
And so instead of each of these individual entities pulling up their own stove types of information , I realized , why would we figure out how to build a common platform that generates utility for multiple people ? 

129
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:37,670
It's the same fundamental data , and like you said , doubt with its defense , head on is very interested in understanding the situation that all of its forces will be operating around the world . 

130
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:52,200
The thing is , this is while tracks and figuring out where all the activity is kind of important in that , you still have to build the foundation of the environment to which those activities can be built upon . 

131
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:09,350
So a better understanding of the ocean currents , temperatures , the waves , the atmospheric conditions on the surface , the ocean , all of those things impact the activity layer , and therefore the operations of the military in a specific area of interest. 

132
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:26,090
It's a reasonable thing to to think that you will succeed this , and that we will end time have the vast distributed century system in the ocean when you have your happiest moment about that success , you think about the greatest good that might bring us what comes to mind. 

133
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:33,110
It's weird to say , but improved weather forecasts can have a huge impact around the world . 

134
00:18:33,110 --> 00:19:10,400
I know that just recently we had hundreds of floats in the tour of hurting salary in the gulf of mexico , and what we are able to do is we realize that there is a warm core eddy that had kind of broken off from the golf loop current that connects the formation of the ghost stream and was sitting south of mississippi and the ocean models of the current variety being used in geographic and neurological research had this idea in a slightly different location in the last twenty four hours of being assured , sally intensified . 

135
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:19,880
And all of you remember , she has been like category a one hurricane to a category three kind of rapidly right before getting to land . 

136
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:41,070
We think that that intensification was due to the location of this warm set of water , and it's on a scale that wasn't able to be resolved in canada , existing models that are used by researchers today or used by those forecasters today are drifter by drifting on the surface of the ocean . 

137
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,420
Their velocities were able to correct them model , and we kind of had an internal thing . 

138
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,690
So what we hope to do is a similar flow data into those models . 

139
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:05,544
And the next thing is , mythology is starting to fully couple the ocean with the air , and now understanding , like where it's raining in the ocean , kind of a question that we've never even tried to ask before . 

140
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:15,290
I think we'll be in reach of the sensors , and then we will affect that huge heat transfer between in the water , and similarly from the water to the sky . 

141
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:21,920
In the case of hurricane , other psychological storms control , dressed with value in improving weather forecast . 

142
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,270
And that matters the military. 

143
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:33,970
I guess the key here is the granularity of the data , which I think , maybe , perhaps unprecedented for feeding into these large scale ocean at mister type of models. 

144
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,830
Exactly , and you've seen it happen on the tourist , real weather forecasting . 

145
00:20:39,830 --> 00:21:01,187
Everyone can put a weather station in their back yard connected to the insights like whether underground , whether that comes to using this a harvest data feed to improve their forecast , it doesn't get rid of the national weather service instruments at the airport and a key strategy , music occasions . 

146
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:21,240
And i'm sending whether balloons up into the strategy , but what it does is allows them to make really fine grain forecast of its raining here in vienna versus raining an organ turn right , something four to five miles away , bringing that kind of understanding to the ocean is unprecedented . 

147
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,590
There is no way to do that . 

148
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:51,850
So that's at the environmental , what i'm excited in the activity layer , though , is understanding where homering mammals , something again today in twenty twenty , we know where whales live by putting people out in a small boat and looking at them with binoculars , and we record those sensors and kind of get a sense of where they're feeding , where they're migrating and how they interact with , and in their daily life . 

149
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,470
And so ocean of things can help automatic and understand where those marine mammals are . 

150
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:04,273
We can have less impact to the those populations , plus , we can also in a formal commerce aspect . 

151
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:10,120
We all have to unnecessarily slow down ships , or we can slow down shapes when we need to protect this . 

152
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:22,580
Remember , so there's a great example of a activity scenario where this ubiquity , distributed sensing can really help improve overall state of the ocean awareness. 

153
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,036
We're gonna move to another program and just the second , but just two further questions here . 

154
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:35,910
And once following what you just said , so there were two things that come to my mind when I think about thousands and thousands of floaters , I do think about impacts with out there. 

155
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:40,547
这个时候我们就可以看到这样的一种方式了。

156
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:48,347
在此之前，也许会有更多的问题，或者是说我们可以通过这样的一个方式来进行分析。

157
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,697
Which means that they will be remaining in the ocean environment 。

158
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:57,980
And so just talking me a little bit about those aspects of the programme and the environmental. 

159
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,020
Yeah , so we've , he has been very sensitive to that trade . 

160
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,500
Right , there is no such thing . 

161
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,250
As for free , you participate in the environment . 

162
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:14,610
What we have done is spent a lot of time minimizing the amount of plastics that are in each one floats . 

163
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:21,216
We do want to prevent them from interacting with humans and other marine mammals . 

164
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:21,816
They do . 

165
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:33,273
Scott , also , they don't end up on beach or in the morning for technologies where they have kept out fences from those and undersea national parks and international equivalents . 

166
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:43,550
But the thing that i'm trying to do is derive value from the data , they , so that the return that we get from these floats is much , much greater than any environmental impact . 

167
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:56,691
And I think once we have a distributed set of the sensors that is able to be used by many different people in the community , where academic , commercial or military , we all have much , much more value from that . 

168
00:23:56,691 --> 00:24:00,300
I look forward to seeing if my thesis holds true . 

169
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,860
And as we scale , this have a lot of people involved. 

170
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,670
Wet and while it's under your wing , and you still adopt a program manager , as we know program managers , they just a number of years are not travel . 

171
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,750
What is still to happen in the program until we. 

172
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,462
So it's really the scaling out . 

173
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:21,280
We obviously have a manufacturers working to build five thousand of these here in the second place . 

174
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,210
We're also then trying to build more advanced detection and anonymously thinks , so . 

175
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,640
Can we put a classifier ? 

176
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,007
Can we put something that detects the health of GPS ? 

177
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:49,380
All of these things have really important uses for downstream users and delivering those to military customer and deploying it for their use is something I want to exceed on before we are complete with the program. 

178
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,454
Okay , well , thanks for the description of the ocean of things project are . 

179
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:55,835
May you succeed with that ? 

180
00:24:55,835 --> 00:25:02,670
Because I think in all of us will benefit from having better and understanding of what's happening in the ocean . 

181
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,531
And now I want to move to another one of your programs . 

182
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:23,420
This one , I think you inherited this one is called the special temporal and orientation information and contested environments program , or known for short as still like this one results with a one garbage tradition of pushing precision clark technology forward into new levels of performance . 

183
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:36,436
And the thing about stocks that gets me is that it kind of driven by a fairly alarming question when I think about it , which is what if the global positioning system GPS were to go down and tell me about , so it , what you do have to achieve with it . 

184
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:37,180
And what is it? 

185
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,690
Status , yeah , GPS is a victim of its own success . 

186
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,770
Right , right ? 

187
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:52,127
Because we now have you picked this positioning on the earth's surface in , and with that positioning , we have very accurate coming from the satellite . 

188
00:25:52,127 --> 00:26:03,422
We know , while people use GPS for positioning , many computers today , use GPS for their timing in the relationship between positioning and timing is so tightly coupled . 

189
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:09,126
So when I got this program , I had actually interacted with it in its earlier state at us . 

190
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:09,811
All right . 

191
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:13,233
So I wasn't ignorant of what it was trying to do . 

192
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:31,250
I kinda , I handed it where this idea came from was , are there are of radio frequency sources that are available , kind of in the atmosphere today that can be used for positioning and the signal that stolen , started working from was lightning boats . 

193
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,970
And , you know , before I was out of that , how can you use lightning boats around the world ? 

194
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,780
We're cheaper aircraft is . 

195
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:48,580
And so the earlier program , which was called , as ben , really worked to try to make a positioning system just from these lightning sources around. 

196
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:56,770
Just to give listeners that said is , if the very low frequency signals that are coming from those lighting bosses and therefore travel great distances that you're looking at . 

197
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,110
There was some other part of lenie. 

198
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,800
No , it is either they very low frequency signal that occurs is that discharged from the lightning ball . 

199
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,660
Weather is cloudy , cloudy or cloud to ground occurs in that travels were tens of thousands of . 

200
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:15,240
And there is a great network of lightning detection systems were wide . 

201
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,720
Happens to be that over the amazon rainforest . 

202
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,680
There is almost continually lightning storms . 

203
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,290
You would know that until you , canada are investigating this , and this wasn't interesting source . 

204
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:33,520
Still , it continued down that path and look for generalized , violent sources to do this localization . 

205
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,710
And that was one area . 

206
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,310
The other area is building really precise clocks . 

207
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:44,450
So just like we have at the neighbor observatory , which is the master clock for the united states . 

208
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:56,760
How can you transfer time from that clock and have a contained ownership of summary , a plane , and so therefore were always synchronized . 

209
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,780
And so the idea for a very precise clocks that will won't drift in time . 

210
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:09,880
I know this is parts per billion types of precision that the class have to maintain was the second kind of main effort here . 

211
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,670
And when we ended up looking at laser based clocks and how those would support this precise timing in the stock. 

212
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:24,613
Program , right , and then , ultimately , the idea that this would provide a GPS like capability , even if the GPS system went down . 

213
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:31,140
So this means that the various military assets would have that capability , even in the event , again , that GPS went down . 

214
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,520
This means that the us rebellion carry out its military missions , regardless. 

215
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:45,304
Exactly , and so this was the kind of a different program in the sense that we were working on the fundamental services that a military platform needs . 

216
00:28:45,304 --> 00:29:05,926
You need to know where you are and what time it is , and you want to build in as many diverse position sources , whether that's in our selection , navigation in the , from ships of all to the story of the story of the elephant navigation to g PS , or things like magnetic navigation , are in other modulates , right ? 

217
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:14,630
That's the overall goal of wear that localization , part of a positive navigation and timing goes the other parties . 

218
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:22,680
Now , if you know , where you are , knowing what time it is , allows you to synchronize operations across the battle space . 

219
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,760
So how does the plane above no one to talk when compared to a ship below ? 

220
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,520
How do we know when various activities have to occur in the battlespace ? 

221
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,300
And how do we know when I sent something ? 

222
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:41,610
It was of this exact event , and so we can all be a moving forward , not a key military capability. 

223
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:49,220
In the context of a life cycle of a double project , where is strike , strike is. 

224
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:59,980
Almost done , we're excited about the results in which transition the capabilities and technology to the navy , so they can put it in on their ships and aircraft . 

225
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,270
So this is an exciting thing to see these concepts coming through maturity and dark by those investments showing benefit and then transitioning over to the fly. 

226
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,010
You just mentioned it really , what four dark is kind of the finish line that were transitioning . 

227
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:22,334
New youths could stop once doing , investigate all the kinds of technologies that are possible , and that would serve the cause of national offence . 

228
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:29,960
But if it goes , no , where else , then doesn't really do as much as if you hand off to an unusual like , in this case , it could be in the navy. 

229
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,460
Yeah , it's exactly in that feedback they get from that informing . 

230
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,900
The development is so valuable , both the dark and to the navy , so they know what's possible . 

231
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,070
So really , it is informing both sides of the interaction . 

232
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:51,080
It's a win win whenever we get a chance to experiment and go interact with the various military users. 

233
00:30:51,320 --> 00:31:15,384
Okay , and since we're on the subject of GPS , I just want to briefly touch on one more of your programs is called president for the positioning system for deep ocean navigation , which essentially sounds like to meet a GPS system for places were used to be like referring to summary , so for summaries and autonomous undersea vehicles GPS for the underwater world . 

234
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:18,054
Tell me a little bit about that programming . 

235
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:18,670
We're that. 

236
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,442
That's the exact purpose . 

237
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:24,747
So I went when you underneath the water , GPS isn't available . 

238
00:31:24,747 --> 00:31:27,817
So by definition , GPyes , isn't there . 

239
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:40,011
And so traditionally summarized have operated with very precise navigators on board so that they don't need to put a parachute above and come above the surface of the way . 

240
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:54,248
So what it was built , a set of active transparency that would operate an area of interest that would provide a GPS like signal to a summary or a man under water vehicle . 

241
00:31:54,248 --> 00:32:06,173
Again , positioning is one of these key enablers for operations in the undersea , and the by providing that as a service like GPS , does everyone on land , it would be very , very valuable . 

242
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:14,010
So we transition this hardware to the navy , and they're working at implementing it into operational systems today it. 

243
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:24,170
To me to hear this from a historical point of view , because the original step toward systems like UPS was , I believe the transit system , which is a navy system . 

244
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:37,100
And the whole point of that was at least one major point , was to reduce the time the nuclear submarines in our defence platform would have to actually surface to get a reading from a satellite and an idea with the minimize . 

245
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,120
That's handsome . 

246
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,284
The transit system , which was more sort of a double based system , which LED to GPS . 

247
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:54,260
And now you are talking about president , which actually sounds like they choose what was maybe sort of , ultimately , in the minds of the people develop , translate , which is being able to get position under water without actually having a surface. 

248
00:32:54,540 --> 00:33:02,065
That's right , and it provides that infrastructure they rely on to understand , stand where you are at all time . 

249
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:09,640
And so if completely implemented , a summary , we've never needed to go about the surface , the ocean to figure out. 

250
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,870
Right , and not only to figure out yourself , but this is the reason why I would not want to do . 

251
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,920
That is because it comes vulnerable to detection. 

252
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,750
By embrace is exactly the most vulnerable , right . 

253
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:27,480
And that is , the summer is advantages itself , and so limiting any opportunity to be detected is a win for a summary mission. 

254
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,380
That was quite a worldwide . 

255
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,080
John , those three programs . 

256
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,040
Still , it president and ocean of things you really do have your hands full . 

257
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,760
Have to say . 

258
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:48,210
Now , if someone who has been on the ground in the military or injury case , boots under water , and who also has been in the business of technology development , something of your work at us all . 

259
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,920
How would you characterize dark this place in the innovation ecosystem? 

260
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,215
So what you don't meant about my background , ivan is , I was a management consultant . 

261
00:33:58,215 --> 00:34:00,680
So I had a state postcard back to duty . 

262
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:06,110
Well , I was focused on businesses , improving their overall operations . 

263
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:12,160
And so I feel what we do at dark is being a venture capital fund . 

264
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,390
right ? 

265
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:19,700
We are a place where you can bring ideas and measure them so that they have the most impact going forward . 

266
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,372
So I don't , we don't have excessive bureaucracy . 

267
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:24,835
We're able to move fast . 

268
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:31,175
We get this advantage that everyone's motivated to succeed in good ideas that have the most impact . 

269
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:36,480
And that's what makes me excited every day that I , it makes every day different . 

270
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,830
And those two things kind of keep me pushing in an alpha , almost four. 

271
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:56,600
Yeah , and just following on that a little bit , me , one of the things now that i've been a topic for a while that becomes to my mind , how is it that humanity all can go after some of the incredibly ambitious technology vision is , there are just a part in parcelled dark . 

272
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:08,650
But when you think about a lot of private industry , the risk with dark is doing in the programs like you're running and other PMrunning is to take the risk down right enough . 

273
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,310
So ultimately you can get to that transition . 

274
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:25,035
Where is not in the , on the part of we know another part of the military in another military service , like the neighbourhood or even commercial analyst companies , jackson takes the time and take the technology to the finish line . 

275
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:28,140
So is that sense of dew risking technology , I find interesting. 

276
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,140
Exactly , and you know , I am not judged on success of my progress . 

277
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,670
I am very comfortable operating with a lot of risk . 

278
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,900
I've had a lot of failures along the way as APM, Adouble get riddle programs . 

279
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,230
Things didn't succeed . 

280
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,009
They didn't , what they did to say . 

281
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:57,082
What did we learn from it , and how do we make the next interaction of what we do better so often said to feel fast , and we take those losses , and we turn them into something valuable . 

282
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:58,890
And that that what makes dark of? 

283
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:05,074
Special place nicely said , that sort of winning role of what's on some levels might be considered failure . 

284
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:18,040
But really , what that is is a form of data and understanding that helps you move forward in the end so nicely by one of the question , which is not even a trick question , but it's , what are you a pause that I did ask you? 

285
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:24,330
I always like to tell people that dark doesn't have a secret laboratory in the basement . 

286
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,850
We are a business operation . 

287
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:31,560
We're trying to get money out in the hands of researchers every day . 

288
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,210
And so I think a lot of people are either afraid to come talk to program managers , bring their ideas to us . 

289
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,680
I think most people , what were busy . 

290
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,570
We're in the business of ideas . 

291
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,070
And if you have an idea in a new way of doing something. 

292
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:54,750
Always interesting talking to jonathan , you know , program managers are at the open for just to find a number of beers could be three for five years . 

293
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:12,380
Sometimes they actually go , come back for a second tour of duty , but you know , you know , therefore , ever so wondering , you know , if you think about the end phase and transitioning out of dark at some point , you imagine in your role in the reserves may be going back into a submarine for another nine deaths . 

294
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,240
And are you finished with that sort of service and will think about things? 

295
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:26,190
Once you've been away from submarines from , I think over two years , you have to be require , and they want to take someone and as little like me . 

296
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:38,820
So I proud you never get back on summer inds , i'll stay working hard and reserves and get to figure out what to do when I grow up , whether it's good industry , start my own company or help others continue to innovate . 

297
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:45,160
These are things that are going to nearly deal with my heart , although i'm so busy these days , I don't have time to often think with the next. 

298
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:53,330
Remember , I suspect that you can have a lot of options given all of the experience that you are pattern , what you continue now to acquire a dark . 

299
00:37:53,330 --> 00:38:09,070
But when you certainly give it me and also a listeners a lot to think about the imagine with respect to the new ways that we might stand the ocean and what goes on in that vast portion of the planet , which you actually have seen also from within , that is to say , underwater . 

300
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,420
And where amazes me to think about that . 

301
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:32,537
Also , we learned about incredibly cool technologies like very low frequency signaling from a lightning and an amazing article , clarks , that can help provide GPS where it is that actually reminds me to resolve the mixed match game of different technological systems , which has been a theme of dolphins innovation style . 

302
00:38:32,537 --> 00:38:37,076
So , so called here , about the ways you are putting out of systems of systems together . 

303
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:44,440
And this is a long way i've seen john , and thanks for sharing this time with me and telling such engaging tales of life as a dirty programming. 

304
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:50,700
Thanks , I wanna encourage everyone out in the audience to engage with dark going forward . 

305
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,470
Check out the data from my floats . 

306
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:59,930
They are available at the dark website that ocean of things that darker , that meal there is can be more to see in the future . 

307
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,680
Look forward to hearing people's thoughts and ideas moving forward. 

308
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,240
Okay , you heard it from john listeners get in touch with us , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us . 

309
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:20,530
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from garbage , thanks also to bend selection for his partnership in producing this programme . 

310
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:32,604
