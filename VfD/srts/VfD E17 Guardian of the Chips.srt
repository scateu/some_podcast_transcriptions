<b>13</b>

177
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,875
<b>Allowed us to simultaneously access the same data</b>

178
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,916
<b>And send it to</b>

179
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,166
<b>Different locations</b>

180
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,208
<b>At the same time</b>

181
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,500
<b>And</b>

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,083
<b>It it found its way into a lot of very high performance</b>

183
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,083
<b>Which computer application</b>

184
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,375
<b>If I was to this day</b>

185
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,958
<b>And went when did you make this development and get this </b>

186
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,833
<b>Early my career is one of one of my first one said sometime </b>

187
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,083
<b>Yes, late 80s.</b>

188
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:40,500

189
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,000
<b>is the mechanism by which you ended up getting here</b>

00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:49,708
<b>So some .. a program manager and office director at a </b>

<b>I reach out</b>

193
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,666
<b>How how did you actually end up here</b>

194
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,250
<b>So without going Kiki on you</b>

195
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,291
<b>Over the 30 years that I was at IBM</b>

196
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,875
<b>This this happened about seven years ago</b>

197
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,416
<b>About 7 years ago</b>

198
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,208
<b>There was a</b>

199
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,291
<b>I was involved of course in the design and</b>

200
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,583
<b>Fabrication</b>

201
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,625

<b>computing elements</b>

203
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,166
<b>And</b>

204
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,250
<b>Became apparent there was a class of</b>

205
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,000
<b>Defects</b>

206
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,291
<b>The class of failures</b>

207
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,541
<b>That were</b>

208
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,083
<b>Exquisitely difficult</b>

209
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:27,875
<b>to</b>

210
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:28,875
<b>diagnosis</b>

211
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,958
<b>And  very difficult to image</b>

212
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:33,750
<b>Or to </b>

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,791
<b>Try to Define</b>

214
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,333
<b>But none the less they impacted the yield </b>

215
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,375
<b>Performance</b>

216
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,375
<b>And in some cases</b>

217
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,416
<b>Even had the ability to change</b>

218
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,208
<b>What the</b>

219
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,750
<b>Computer chip was supposed to do</b>

220
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:48,333
<b> so you're talking about defects that really go all the way </b>
<b>down to sort of the</b>

221
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,666
<b>Micron scale the transistor level element level</b>

222
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:58,083
<b>Scale of of these chips right?</b>
<b>- You're exactly right and I am not smart enough to be a </b>
<b>high-level </b>

223
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,333
<b>achitect I was very much</b>

224
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,125
<b>A hardware engineer</b>

225
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,708
<b>Very much about the hardware the physical design</b>

226
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:10,083
<b>And fabrication of the actually</b>
<b>- [..] and again to give the listeners vision of this I </b>
<b>believe we're probably talking</b>

227
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:14,958
<b>about defects that could be the size of like individual </b>
<b>biological cells 50 microns across</b>

228
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,000
<b>Even smaller</b>

229
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,750
<b>Indeed</b>

230
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,333
<b>Indeed and as technology scale</b>

231
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,625
<b>The size of the defects that were vulnerable to also</b>

232
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:23,416
<b>Continue</b>

233
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,166
<b>to shrink so </b>

234
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,208
<b>It's essentially</b>

235
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:25,958
<b>to keep</b>

236
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,750
<b>A very very clean environment</b>

237
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,041
<b>So</b>

238
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,125
<b>It became clear to me that there was a class of defects</b>

239
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,833
<b>That we were vulnerable to</b>

240
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,458
<b>Not just from a yield or functional point of view</b>

241
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,500
<b>But that potentially someone malicious</b>

242
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,083
<b>Could intentionally assert upon a process</b>

243
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,125
<b>Or a pond design</b>

<b>The component or its function or its reliability its </b>

248
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,875
<b>Make a long story short I</b>

249
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,166
<b>Became a</b>

250
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:55,916
<b>Contractor</b>

<b>Consultant to DARPA</b>

252
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,791
<b>And</b>
<b>- and with this consulting era</b>

253
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:06,166
<b>Or phase of your intersection with DARPA was that begin to </b>

<b>That you ultimately would end up</b>

256
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,875
<b>With the aim of addressing the concerns that you learned </b>

<b>- indeed initially it was</b>

257
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,666
<b>To consult an existing program</b>

258
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:17,958
<b>And</b>

259
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:18,708
<b>I</b>

260
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,541
<b>Became involved in actually doing things</b>

<b>To computer chips</b>

262
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,083
<b>And then</b>

263
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,916
<b>The DARPA program would hire</b>

264
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,208
<b>Reverse Engineers to try to find</b>

265
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,500
<b>What was done</b>

266

<b>And</b>

267
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,833
<b>We continue to make progress</b>

268
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,083

<b>you come to DARPA</b>

276
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,208
<b>So I retired from IBM at that point</b>

<b>some referring to Trusted Integrated Circuits which is known</b>

<b>Integrity and Reliability of Integrated Circuits known as </b>

<b>And I'm wondering if you can actually sort of talked about </b>

<b>Collectively</b>

293
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,041
<b>And of course diving into each one as you might</b>

<b>God bless our warfighters</b>

<b>Has indeed become global</b>

327

378

<b>SHIELD is a taggant </b>

00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,625
<b>As well as ASIC(专用芯片)</b>

531
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,916
<b>The output of that program</b>

532
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,208
<b>Is installed in a number of agencies</b>

533
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,750
<b>All over the country</b>

534
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,541
<b>And still being [...]</b>

535
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:52,666
<b>Ready when you mentioned ASIC,  field programmable gate </b>
<b>array (FPGA), those are just names for</b>

536
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,958
<b>other kinds of categories of integrated circuits</b>

537
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,750
<b>That have different capabilities</b>

538
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,375
<b>But all of which are used today and all of which we really </b>
<b>need to feel very confident about</b>
<b>- that is correct</b>

539
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,416
<b>So that's TRUST and that completed</b>

540
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,000
<b>A year or two ago when did that ... </b>
<b>- yes, it included</b>

541
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:07,750
<b>About</b>

542
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,875
<b>18 month ago</b>

543
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,416
<b>So obviously there's parts of the spirit of that program </b>
<b>that are part of SHIELD</b>

544
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:18,250
<b>And the other program I just wanted to say a little bit </b>
<b>about this one continues</b>

545
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,875
<b>Today and that's the integrity and reliability of integrated</b>
<b> circuits program or IRIS</b>

546
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,708
<b>The question that Iris answered was</b>

547
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,250
<b>If indeed we know that this component</b>

548
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,333
<b>Has not been compromised</b>

549
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,333
<b>In its function</b>

550
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,416
<b>Can we still be assured that it has not been compromised</b>

551
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,416
<b>And its integrity</b>

552
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,500
<b>How do we make sure with</b>

553
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,291
<b>With a low sample size</b>

554
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,333
<b>That this component indeed fulfills</b>

555
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,625
<b>Its lifetime spec</b>

556
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,916
<b>Its reliability</b>

557
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,458
<b>That it is up to the task</b>

558
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,750
<b>A performing</b>

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,041
<b>For $20,000 an hour</b>

560
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,083
<b>Or 100000 power in hours</b>

561
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,625
<b>Or whatever the spec is</b>

562
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,416

<b>That it's installed in</b>

597

<b>I want to move to a couple of other questions before we we </b>

00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:14,750
<b>One of them is really I want you to reflect a little bit </b>
<b>about micro electronics</b>

599
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,541
<b>As a technology in your</b>

600

<b>Pushing that technology forward and doing whatever you can </b>
<b>to ensure the integrity and safety of it</b>

<b>And you know with some programs even moving forward thinking</b>
<b> about</b>

<b>Next generations of micro-electronic devices even in the </b>
<b>nanoscale area</b>

604
