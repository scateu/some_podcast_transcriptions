00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
The internet

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Palm of your hand

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:16,896
Autonomous

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,016
Technology is a driver of our times

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,856
Since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
DARPA

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,696
The defense Advanced research projects agency

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Has been a driver

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Technology

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,560
Welcome to Voices from DARPA

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,632
A window onto DARPA score of program managers

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,168
Their job

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
To redefine

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
What is possible

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
My name is Ivan Amato and I am your docker host

17
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
And I'm pleased to have with me in the studio today

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,152
Troy Olson

19
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,760
A program manager since 2014 in DARPA's Microsystems technology

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,576
Troy earned a pair of Bachelors

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
Degrees 1 in electrical engineering in one in computer engineering

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,208
From West Virginia University

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,072
And a master's and doctoral degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan

24
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,376
Four-decade prior to coming to DARPA

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
Troy founded and led a series of programs within the Micro electromechanical Systems Technology

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,128
Department of Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque New

27
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
Rextroy for joining me in the studio today

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
It's a pleasure to be here

29
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,808
So I'd like to start out or discussion with some

30
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,112
Background about you I'd like you to tell me about

31
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,208
Your education if they were teachers that were important to you as you were

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,560
Growing up in that led you in the kinds of engineering direction that you have take

33
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,424
Yeah sure so I grew up in a small town in West Virginia Weston West Virginia to be

34
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Exact

35
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
When I was in high school

36
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
Had exhausted

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
At the math classes that were

38
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
Available at my local high school so I ended up going part-time to West Virginia Wesleyan College and they said have kind of a class for men

39
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
Any students from my high school

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
Go do that especially

41
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
Placer High School

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Students at the local

43
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
College

44
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
And

45
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,440
For that always been good at math but I didn't ever really knew how to apply it

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
I figured I would go into medicine or something of that nature and it's part of that special class they set up for us

47
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
The first half hour

48
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
Professor McBride would come in

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,472
And he was an engineering physicist

50
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,056
And he would come in and relate all of the calculus we were learning

51
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
To physics problem

52
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
And I just found that fascinate

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
That was a junior in high school and from that point forward

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
I wanted to

55
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
So I'd like to hear a little bit about the base of your career where you really worked a lot on memes and again that's dance for me

56
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
Microelectromechanical systems

57
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,304
I know you did that even before going to asendia to talk a little bit about that whole love memes

58
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,704
In graduate school at the University of Michigan I work for Professor Ken wise who's one of the founders

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Love memes

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
There I worked on

61
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
Analog interfaces for neural recording

62
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,664
So I was developing integrated circuits to be able to

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Record

64
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
Neural Action potentials from the brain

65
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
For doing things like

66
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Restoring function

67
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
People who have

68
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Nervous system disa

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Sleep paralysis

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
The things in the stimulation sense

71
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Like blindness or

72
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Hearing loss

73
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:21,472
I didn't went to Sandia National Laboratories where I switch things a little bit of Michigan I was designing circuit interfaces for Mims

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
And

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,056
At Sandia I started actually designing the mems

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Components myself

77
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
I let a team of people designing and

78
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
Implementing those primarily

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
We were working on small a

80
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Acoustic devices

81
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
You may not know that in your

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,464
Phone and RF signal is immediately converted into an acoustic signal biography

83
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,864
I mean radio frequency the radio frequency signal which has a really long wavelength is

84
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,984
Converted into a acoustic signal which is a very small wavelength which allows you to

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
Filter it in a small form factor before it's

86
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Creed turn back into an electric

87
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
Comment so I was working on technologies that

88
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
Do that function but more for Department of

89
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Defense Apple

90
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Locations rather than

91
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Cellular phones

92
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
Also worked on other things that really at the interface

93
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
Vibrational systems and acoustic systems analyst

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
Brighten and what was the pathway from Sandia

95
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
To DARPA

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,191
I was a performer doing a lot of the research on those small acoustic Wireless components

97
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,799
Bill Chappell the current director of the Microsystems technology office

98
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
Was my program manager and so when he was promoted to you

99
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,223
Called me out of the blue one day I think that was in March of

100
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
2014 and said

101
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
Hey Troy this is Bill Chappell

102
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
How would you like to come the DARPA to be a program manager I think you'd be great at it

103
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Heading to I shared an office

104
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
For somebody so that was

105
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,791
Strange conversation

106
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Yeah that the

107
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
That sounds like a great opportunity can I call you back in a few minutes

108
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
And is that that's all it took for you just a few minutes and then you knew what your decision would be after that

109
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
I mean anybody who gets an opportunity to come in

110
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
The DARPA

111
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Fantastic

112
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Opportunity of course I had to come

113
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
Interview and put together

114
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,111
I tok that outline the programs I would start I had to come in

115
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
Have you with the office director but how it all started was from a phone

116
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,863
Speaking about those programs we're going to dive into talking about a number of those you have a very large portfolio larger than most

117
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
Program manager that will only talk about a few but they're too

118
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:33,567
Questions I want to ask you before we do that one has to do with your name Troy I call you Troy

119
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,175
But your official name is Roy and I'm just wondering if you could tell us

120
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
The story of your name

121
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
Nasso my official name is Roy Harold Olson

122
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
The 3rd

123
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Turns out my dad really wanted me to

124
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
To be named after him he's

125
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Harold Olson

126
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,767
My mom wasn't the biggest fan of the name Roy so they made a deal

127
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,631
I could be named Roy Harold Olson the third and everyone would call me Troy

128
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
And apparently I

129
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Reinforce this

130
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
When I was a small child

131
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,639
As Legend has it I would sit in my high chair and if people called me Roy I would throw green beans at them

132
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
Impound on the high chair

133
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
Nothing like negative reinforcement

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
What's a move on to just some of your program

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,207
Associate with one another we can talk about them together go by the short names of Icarus and Vapor

136
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,559
Speaker stands for inbound controlled air releasable

137
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Unrecoverable systems

138
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
And Vapor stands for Vanishing

139
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Programmable resources

140
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
I know the vapor paint before Icarus

141
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
So up

142
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,359
Why don't you tell us a little bit about the vapor Icarus story I which is an ongoing one

143
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Yasso

144
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,735
In the Department of Defense a lot of times we have problems with electronic leave behind

145
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
We don't want to leave things on the battlefield where other people might collect them

146
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
So

147
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
We came up with the vapor program which is a Vanishing micro-electronics program it's designed to be able to

148
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
To make micro Electronics

149
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
That have reliability and

150
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Performance

151
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
Commiserate with

152
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,959
Was commercial off-the-shelf electronic components that don't vanish

153
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
But that

154
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
When we want them to can rapidly

155
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Vanish

156
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
A&B invisible to the name

157
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,967
Okay and you meet when you say vanish in the most people just think of

158
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
It's gone

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
Talk to me a little bit about the kind of technical Pathways some of your performers which is to say the research groups who have been worth

160
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,511
Working on this the kinds of Pathways they're taking to try to realize this idea vanish ability of

161
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
Yes it is really two approaches that have been really prominent in the vapor program I one was developed by the pallet

162
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
All the research center Park

163
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
And it is

164
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,079
Vanishing glass substrate that basically turns into dust

165
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Like particles

166
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,967
And that glass can be bonded to integrated circuits and other things and causing and tires

167
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
To vanish

168
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
Mumbai dust like particles the particles are on

169
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,159
Order size of 100 microns which is about the width

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
So those ones

171
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,535
Vanish to the naked eye but the material itself

172
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Physically

173
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Completely vanish

174
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
We did develop a material that

175
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
That does that there was work done there at

176
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
At the University of

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
Illinois and Georgia

178
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
Protec and Cornell

179
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
Many of those materials

180
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
Working a way where there

181
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,503
Thermally unstable at room temperature they like to be a monomer or bepis

182
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Gas

183
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,879
Actually make them at very cold temperatures they like - 50 degrees C

184
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
Annie's Casey's Banshee materials are polymers

185
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
I would like to make a really long polymer chain to get high middle

186
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Molecular weight

187
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Makes the polymer really tough

188
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
And then we link it in a certain way at the very cold temperatures so that we will raise it up and temperature it remains

189
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
Then in that material will embed

190
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Something that

191
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,223
It's called either a photo acid generator or a thermal acid generator and that works just like you might expect

192
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
It does when you put a trigger

193
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
When you expose it to a certain wavelength of light

194
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Tell photoacid generator

195
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
Creates an acid

196
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
If you take the thermal as a generator and exceed a certain temperature it also creates an acid that acid can break

197
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,655
One of the bonds between the polymer chains

198
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
And at that point

199
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,055
Then it becomes thermally unstable at room temperature again and the rest of it

200
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Just vanishes

201
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
And by vanishes it take

202
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Turns from a solid

203
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
Directly into a gas

204
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Mentally disadvantaged right

205
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Before your eyes

206
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
The first time you see it it's

207
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Truly amazed

208
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:34,975
Is actually the second time you see it a truly amazing at everything is amazing and clever

209
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
Chemistry to bring into the capability of

210
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Advanced Materials

211
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,911
And this step the program was successful enough in your eyes that you created a follow-on program

212
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
That's correct so

213
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
We were brainstorming one day

214
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
What else Beyond microelectronic

215
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Could we do with these material

216
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
We were thinking where else could we push this materials

217
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
What else would

218
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,831
Lead the new fundamental Discovery and developments and could be also at the same time useful

219
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
Department of Defense and we came up with the idea of Vanishing Edge

220
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
For being able to deliver things

221
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,839
In a very precise way into difficult-to-reach locations

222
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
And then not having a leave behind

223
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
That could either

224
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Destroy the environment

225
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Or

226
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Or

227
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Lead II detection

228
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Of the deliverer

229
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
And so the Icarus

230
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Was born

231
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,479
And that program is currently in Phase 1

232
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
And

233
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
And is developing

234
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Vanishing

235
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Are delivery Platt

236
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
Right and I didn't want to be exciting and potential

237
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Locations for lease

238
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Kinds of

239
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Vehicles would be

240
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
In sort of Public Health

241
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
Disasters disease outbreaks

242
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Tell us a little bit about those kinds of humanitarian

243
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Applications of your

244
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,823
Absolutely so one of the first things when we started brainstorming about the idea Matt Hepburn who's a program manager

245
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
Started interacting with me introducing me to

246
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
The idea of being able to deliver Medical

247
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Pool supplies used

248
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Exciting

249
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
Thinking about things where there's been a humanitarian disaster

250
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
And the runways are

251
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
How destroyed

252
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Roads are impassable

253
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
How can I get

254
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
Really critical supplies

255
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Vaccines

256
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
Blood medications

257
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Water

258
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
Two locations that need it

259
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
Work needs to be precisely delivered

260
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,823
And do that in kind of in some cases a massive response

261
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
Without having to worry about

262
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Going and collecting all of these

263
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Is air delivery

264
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
How do I get

265
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,367
Not only the thing to biodegrade and disappear back into the environment but how do I make the cost low enough

266
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
That you can basically have a glider

267
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
But you don't care if

268
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
If you ever go

269
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
This is an exciting time in the life cycle of

270
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
The program right because I know that in the coming months you're going to move

271
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Outside

272
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
The glimmer of the eye in front of a laboratory work

273
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Battered vehicle

274
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,591
That's correct so we have two things that are going to be coming up that way

275
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
Will conclude phase one of the program

276
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
A1 is a flight test

277
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Launching from 35000 Ft

278
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:11,391
Showing a range of 150 km and Landing with 10 m of accuracy

279
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,719
And doing that with a material surrogate

280
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,279
So the glider is made out of a material that has

281
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
As exact as possible the same material properties as the vanishing material and the same

282
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Factoring process

283
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
These were trying to test out

284
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
Can we actually meet

285
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
These flight profiles

286
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Using something within the constraints

287
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Some of the material properties in manufacturing

288
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Ava Vanishing with

289
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,111
At the same time we are also building a non flying

290
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Demonstration

291
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Of the vanishing

292
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,559
Material for example we might build not instead of a full airplane

293
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Just the wing of an air

294
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,471
Build that out of the vanishing material and show that we can actually construct a

295
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,543
A complex structure from the vanishing materials

296
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,383
And then one year after those flight test we will do

297
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,199
A flight test of the actual Vanishing

298
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Air delivery

299
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
Alright well I will be excited to

300
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,599
Keep track of that and we'll applaud with you when we

301
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,415
We see our first vehicle do a job and then

302
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,535
I want to move to another program this one goes by the

303
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
Name in

304
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
0 which

305
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:29,471
Connection with the hour Evermore sensor Layton world and so tell us a little bit about end

306
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,567
Yes on0 is a program that

307
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Designed

308
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,687
To basically take the internet of things and move it right

309
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
To the tactic

310
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
So today when we think about the Internet of Things

311
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
It can't be what we will really want

312
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
We can think about applying it to our refrigerator or

313
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
Toaster maybe our car

314
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
But we're really limited the things that either can be

315
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Plugged into the wall

316
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
Or that a human can take in

317
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Plug in the device

318
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,239
Go everyday or every couple days to recharge

319
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
And that's because

320
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,895
The Energy Efficiency of our Electronics operating off of small cheap batteries

321
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Today is not high enough

322
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,015
To sit there and monitor the environment all the

323
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
All the time

324
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,855
Report back things that it's

325
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,951
So what we're trying to do in in zero is take out of a new paradigm

326
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
Where we actually look

327
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,375
Very low power levels are near zero power to me means less than 10 nanowatts

328
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
And I chose that value because that's

329
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
The leakage of a

330
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Small coin cell battery

331
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
What we want to do is be able to sit there

332
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
Continuously monitor the environment

333
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
Looking for an event

334
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
That weird

335
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
AR

336
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,551
Specifically tuned to the doesn't happen very often but can't be missed

337
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,135
And then be able to wake up these higher power consumption

338
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
Consuming Electronics

339
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
When we see

340
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,023
So you can imagine what kind of events could those be

341
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Those could be like

342
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
Augmenting Bridges and infrastructure with these types of sensors

343
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
Looking for

344
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Specific failure modes

345
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Earthquakes

346
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:14,175
You could imagine putting these throughout the environment we're thinking about augmenting vehicles to be able to look

347
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
4 and find engine failures earlier

348
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,599
How you could imagine dispersing the environment and detecting things like

349
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
Forest fires

350
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Chemical leak

351
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
Or other things of that nature we were whole class of these types

352
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
The censors looking for

353
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,655
Acoustic vibrational infrared

354
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Chemical

355
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
And RF

356
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
All being developed

357
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,079
All that can sense these very specific profiles

358
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,919
Reject background interference and consume less than 10 nano

359
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
They basically sit there

360
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Always active always listening

361
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
But consume basically stand by type

362
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Fascinating to think about

363
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
The world becoming an innervated with all kinds

364
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Our bodies are

365
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,839
I want to move on now to just one more

366
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,423
Program this goes by the name amoeba that spelled a.m.

367
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
EBA

368
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
And the one form of that is a mechanically

369
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Based

370
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,663
Antenna and I'm particularly interested in this because I think it reveals sort of the way you

371
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
Apply your engineers mine too

372
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
This invisible world of

373
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Of radio frequency signals

374
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,111
That's all around us

375
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Talk to us a little bit about

376
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Okay sure so

377
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,303
Amoeba kind of comes from my love of looking at problems and

378
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,447
Thinking about the ways we solve them today and how those are insufficient and if we could just do it this other way

379
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,055
It would be so much better but we have some technology that standing in our way

380
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,175
That's what we're trying to do is be able to communicate from really difficult in fire

381
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,759
Do you like underground or underwater

382
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
Pour over very long distances

383
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
Without some type of

384
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Repeater network

385
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,207
And finish your point out right through ground and through

386
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Water

387
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Radio signals do not

388
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Travel very well for those media

389
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
I would say

390
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,143
High frequency radio signals don't travel very wealthy

391
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Apus media

392
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
And

393
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
The key then it stopped right at low frequency

394
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
And that presents

395
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
A very significant challenges that the wavelength

396
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
At low frequencies is extremely long

397
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
And in fact that's the reason that they propagate well through

398
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Water and ground is because the

399
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Very long and

400
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,927
That allows the signal because of the physics to be able

401
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Propagate

402
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
Through those media over much larger dementia

403
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
So the way we build antennas today

404
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
We basically push current through wires

405
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
Either kind of straight wires

406
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
How to build things like Alexa

407
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
Dipole antenna is or

408
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
Do coils and other things

409
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
And

410
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
It's very very difficult to

411
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
The produce a significant amount

412
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
Dove in our case magnetic field

413
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,551
When the antenna is very electrically small that means small was

414
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
To the wavelength using those techniques

415
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Fabulous at higher frequencies

416
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
But when you get the very low frequencies

417
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Where you want to make something then in our case

418
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Would be man-portable

419
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
It just

420
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
Seems nearly impossible to make an antenna with any type of

421
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Efficiency

422
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,799
At those size scale with the military does have some antenna systems

423
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
That can operate in these

424
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
Low frequencies but they're in Normal

425
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
Yes lyrics either

426
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,831
The size of Hawaii Islands or counties or sometimes they Traverse States

427
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,159
How to communicate these bands in other cases you might

428
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
You really a very long wire that's a kilometer in length out of an airplane to communicated these free

429
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Frequencies button

430
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,423
In any case the dimensions are very very large

431
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
So it's going to be

432
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
Take a lot of interesting physics

433
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
To go from

434
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Something of that size

435
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Like to a man

436
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Technology that will

437
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
The same

438
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
One-way flight

439
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,759
That's correct and so our Insight was that

440
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
When we pushing those

441
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,111
Current through those wires what we're doing is work

442
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Creating electric and magnetic

443
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
And we're expending energy to create

444
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
I'm in and of course we do that at specific rate

445
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
To determine the freak

446
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,471
And what we did was we looked and said well what if we just started with something that actually had a high amount of stored magnetic

447
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,519
Wakefield for example like a permanent magnet

448
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
And instead of

449
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
Then using our power

450
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
2

451
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Create that magnetic

452
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,455
Mayfield we would take advantage of what Nature has given us

453
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Which is this

454
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Permanent magnet

455
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
We've created it and and

456
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
And machine data but it's a

457
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Natural

458
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Material phenomenon

459
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,999
And instead we created the RF frequency by movie

460
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
And then we also had the Insight that

461
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,399
Moving things mechanically becomes very efficient

462
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
The lowering

463
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,751
You go so while I mechanical base Nintendo made

464
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Be completely inappropriate

465
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
Where your iPhone operates at gigahertz

466
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Hertz frequency

467
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
In fact

468
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,759
A very appropriate at a kilohertz type frequency to

469
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Take a magnet

470
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
And spinach

471
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
Or mechanically move it

472
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
To create an oscillating Magna

473
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,743
Medic field course magnets aren't the only things that were looking at their other types of

474
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Materials that

475
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Store

476
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
All these types of permanent Fields Electric

477
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Store

478
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,935
Electric dipoles and there are there types of

479
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
Materials that are will be looking at in

480
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
The program as well

481
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,311
Another Insight that we had

482
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,663
Was that if we just took one really big thing and tried to move it

483
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,271
That the amount of stored mechanical energy there would be very high and that also would be

484
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
We do a lot of inefficiency

485
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,159
So one of the really key ideas of the amoeba program is can we break that

486
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
Large thing up into a number of

487
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Small synchronize things

488
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
That lowers the total stored energy

489
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
And lowers

490
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
The power can

491
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
And the risk

492
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
That we're trying to mitigate is

493
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,519
Howell smaller pieces can we break it into butt

494
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
Before the interactions between the pieces batik

495
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Kaley the magnetic intellect

496
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Interactions

497
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Queen

498
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Started

499
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Dominate

500
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
The overall system

501
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
You can imagine two magnets that are closed

502
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,111
Together have a lot of force between them they interact with one another

503
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
The trying to manage and control those interact

504
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
The risky part

505
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
The program that

506
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,352
Okay if you get utopian and you imagine this program being a

507
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
How successful do you want to be

508
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,728
Give us a sense of what additional Communications capabilities

509
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
It would offer up

510
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,872
Yeah so this is a low frequency transmitter so you're thinking about things like Voice and text

511
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,968
So at these types of frequencies is not really possible to do things like

512
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Video

513
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:47,136
But it would give you a new capability safe from underground if you were a minor

514
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
To be able to

515
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
Text or do voice to somebody above ground

516
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Something like a mining accident

517
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,376
How you can tell somebody where you are at and you would have that

518
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Type of communication

519
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
Similarly from underwater Maybe

520
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
50 to 100 m under water

521
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
One could communicate

522
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
Text from underwater to the surface

523
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
Or to something even flying

524
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
What's today is

525
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Is it just not

526
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
And there's one other applications

527
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
It's quite interesting to me and that's

528
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,672
The way these low frequencies can travel through the atmos

529
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
You're an unusual way so that

530
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Potentially could

531
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Enable

532
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
A very long distance communication

533
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
In between two points

534
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
That's correct so

535
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
At a slightly higher frequency say around ten kilohertz

536
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,520
There's a waveguide this form between the ion has

537
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Sphere in the surface of the Earth

538
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,384
We often use that waveguide to bounce

539
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Signals off of

540
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
In What's called the high freq

541
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Booty band

542
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,784
So things like ham radios

543
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
Work based on that

544
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
But you have to know the

545
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,232
Location of the receiver to know how to bounce it down to

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
For sale if you don't know that you'd much rather

547
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Feel that wave God

548
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
With the RF and that's what happens at say

549
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Lake Tenkiller

550
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,728
Trying to build something that can actually

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Couple

552
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
2

553
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,384
That waveguide and once you couple of that waveguide the propagation physics

554
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,968
Or the loss of the RF as it travels over distance

555
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
Is very favorable compared to

556
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,832
Things that don't propagate

557
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:26,720
And so that's what would enable you to reach these really long range communication

558
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,072
Thinking things again like Voice and text over hundreds of kilometers

559
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,120
From something that you can really hold in the

560
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
In the palm of your hand

561
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,704
Just not possible today using other

562
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
Technology

563
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
We've talked about four different programs and when I think about all the

564
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
The different technical

565
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Components

566
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
It's rather amazing so

567
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,296
This makes me you don't realize that your engineer's mind really covers a lot of territory

568
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:56,160
I think we once had a discussion where you telling me that in some ways you think the

569
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
Cast of the engineer is quite a creative one

570
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
I really kind of a

571
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Connection

572
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Math problem solving engine

573
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,376
And the creativity that we might even see an artist

574
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,448
I'm just wondering if you got some thoughts about that

575
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
And how you might comparing

576
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
Ways of

577
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Exercising our minds

578
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,688
Yeah so that's actually an idea that I have borrowed from my thesis advisor can wise who

579
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
At the University of Michigan

580
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
On their North Campus they have centrally located

581
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,160
Art music engineering and I believe architecture

582
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
And his point was all day

583
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
Basically stuck all of the creative fields

584
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
Together this is

585
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,096
Some people might not think that

586
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,704
Music and Engineering would go together but he think that was his Insight that

587
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
Becoming an engineer and being an engineer require quite a bit of creativity

588
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:50,944
I think particularly if you want to make anything more than an incremental Improvement

589
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
To the way things are done today

590
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
It really requires the type of creativity to look at the way that they're done understand the limitations of the

591
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
And then come up with some

592
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
Completely new approach

593
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,584
That would allow you to get Beyond those limitations and make

594
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
You're the 10x 100x

595
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Jumps in performance

596
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
We're all seeking particularly here at DARPA

597
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
Creativity

598
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Huge part of

599
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,944
Being able to found new programs particularly in areas that are not obvious

600
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,016
Apps that aren't leading like from one program to another

601
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,088
How do I get off this certain trajectory

602
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
And get myself on a different trajectory which

603
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Is the one I want

604
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
And I think it's really the creativity

605
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
That allows you to make

606
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
That kind of

607
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
Before we close tribe

608
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,912
Just wondering if there is a science fiction

609
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Technologies

610
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,264
The technology that you might have learned about when you were kids you might have read a great science

611
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Fiction book you saw something in the movie You Came

612
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
Up with the sides of yourself

613
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,920
I bet does not exist now but that you really think or two

614
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
Well absolutely

615
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
I think

616
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Both come from Back to the Future

617
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,344
So I am

618
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,160
Actually optimistic that one day I might get a hover

619
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Car

620
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
And I would love to be able to do time travel

621
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,096
Self I'm not too optimistic about that one

622
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
But

623
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
You never know

624
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,728
Well it's so if you could do time travel would you be more interested in going back

625
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,824
Or forward I would definitely be more interested in going forward in time is

626
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
I knew you were going to say that

627
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
This has been absolutely amazing we've gone from Vanishing materials and Vanishing vehicles to sensor

628
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Words that use almost

629
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,368
No energy at all but are paying attention to the environment

630
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Are we talked about

631
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,488
Hover vehicle so at this is just been an amazing conversation

632
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Information

633
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
