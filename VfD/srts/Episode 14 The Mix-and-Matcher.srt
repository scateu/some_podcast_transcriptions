Active duty as a nuclear trained surface Warfare off

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
In the US Navy

Following active duty he join the naval reserves

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,344

Jim galambos

51
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
It's so good to have you

52
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
It's my pleasure to be here

53
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,048
Let's start by talking about your background

54
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
Bachelor's degree in physics when US Naval Academy and that's

55
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Suggest to me

56
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
That you arrived at the Academy with some interest in science and the Navy

57
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
So where did those interest

58
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,664
Well I think my interest in science and engineering really came from

59
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,528
My father I was raised in a family that had a lot of engineer so that was

60
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
It's kind of an expected thing and

61
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
And I did pretty well in those subjects

62
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:40,256
Although I didn't really know what that meant like most students but I was kind of good at it and

63
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
One thing about the Naval Academy

64
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,912
80% of everybody was an engineer in those days so it wasn't a hard choice

65
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
And I would guess that your interest in plasma physics so that's what you

66
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
You studied in your graduate

67
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,920
Which is Central to the process of nuclear fusion somehow emerge from your time serving on a nucleus

68
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Submarine which relies on nuclear fission for its

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Propulsion

70
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
I think you said to me one time that day

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
When you did a lot of boiling of water

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,392
Tell me about asserted that that connection you have with both fission and fusion

73
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Yeah well it was

74
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
I was an interest of mine

75
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,792
Just as I got into engineering the whole

76
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:19,424
Nuclear industry and and using fission to to make power and of course being in the Navy

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,496
The opportunity go on a submarine and

78
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
And serve

79
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,592
Was really the attraction that's what got me into it

80
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
The diffusion piece

81
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,944
Actually came about from

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
Experience I had at the Los Alamos in the summertime

83
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
I'm and I have to confess

84
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,928
I did that solely to get out of spending a hot summer in Maryland

85
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Yelling at

86
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Freshman

87
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,608
I look for ways to get out of that and one of the options was to do a research assistantship at

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
At Los Alamos National Lab

89
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472
And I ended up working with a group in

90
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
Plasma physics

91
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Doing Fusion work

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
And the key piece that was

93
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
Just breakthrough for me is

94
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,784
It was the first time that I was in a laboratory and we are trying to do something where we didn't know how it was going to turn out

95
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,928
Previous to that in classrooms Laboratories or those science fairs in high school

96
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
You were usually just trying to make something work

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
But you knew the answer it was just could you make it

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Happen

99
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
And it was at Los Alamos where I finally

100
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Saw

101
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
We were doing experiments and I realized he's really bright people

102
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,639
They hope they knew it was happening but the reality was we did experiments to find out and then we adjusted

103
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,735
And that was very exciting to me was to see this whole idea of

104
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Really doing research

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
To explore as opposed to just

106
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
Just get something right so you could get a grade on a

107
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Hyatt Estero

108
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
A lab report

109
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
So it was sort of

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Excitement about

111
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Discovery release

112
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,583
This morning about nature totally changed my

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,167
My whole View and that's what led to me choosing to do that for grads

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
It's cool I when I got out of the Navy

115
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,847
And then after your service and education you went off into the defense industry for a while you work on

116
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Such things as

117
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
Underwater shocks

118
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
System

119
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Energy weapons

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Encounter rocket armor

121
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
And laser-based instrumentation

122
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
I also The Fantasticks

123
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Phenomena and Technologies

124
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
And then you went into a more academic.

125
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Still defense

126
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Centric setting a

127
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Penn State

128
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
And then somewhere along the way you intersect

129
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
With DARPA so can you

130
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
Intersection haven't actually my intersection happened when I left grad school and I joined the

131
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
The small company called Advanced power Technologies

132
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
In industry

133
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,783
Which was the small company where you mentioned some of those projects in undersea shock programs

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
For listening

135
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
Who don't. Know what that means how would you describe that

136
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
It's by the way I've had more fun than anybody should as far as the kind of range of projects we get to do

137
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,863
What we were looking at was the whole idea of cannae

138
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,983
Create an undersea Shockwave which means basically light off an explosive underwater

139
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,567
But do it in a way that we could shape those shockwaves

140
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
All pile up on top of each other

141
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
And smash something like

142
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Am I

143
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
So we're actually looking at mine clearance doing that

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Attend

145
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
That was an idea that we we sold to DARPA as something that they would be interested in seeing it

146
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
If we could make it work

147
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
And that became my introduction to DARPA

148
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,631
So what I'm reading from that thing is that you were what in darkness because you were performers

149
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:35,263
Yes and performers are those who end up getting research contracts working on some program

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
So you were a performer work on that particular project and then

151
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
I presume that

152
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,967
You met other program managers may be enough director and that led to a discussion

153
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,831
Yeah we we actually did a number of programs

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,439
I probably had three or four DARPA programs as a performer during those years

155
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,071
Then when I transition to the applied research lab at Penn State we picked up a couple of more

156
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:04,191
So I had had an ongoing relationship actually through multiple organizations

157
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,007
Of being a performer doing DARPA program

158
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,615
And exactly as you described is actually a

159
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
A former pm and then at the time Deputy office director kind lot

160
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,343
Kind of pulled me aside and wanted to see hey what I be interested in actually

161
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
Coming to this side of the table and

162
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
Conceiving ideas and being a program manager at DARPA

163
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
Okay and you quite evident evidently did come over here if I just go deep to your program manager patient

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
The website to vim at work

165
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Talk to you more directly I learned that you have

166
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Three programs on

167
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
Two of them the blue wolf

168
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
Program in the hunter program they both have to do with

169
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
Unmanned underwater systems

170
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
And then there's one very multisyllabic

171
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Program

172
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
The cross domain

173
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
Maritime surveillance

174
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
And targeting program

175
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Or known in short

176
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
As City mask

177
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
And that's really a program which

178
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
Zeroes in on that systems of systems idea

179
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,423
Of course which the other two programs kind of feed into is

180
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Component systems of those systems of systems

181
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
So maybe we can talk about

182
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
City Mastin this whole idea of

183
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Systems of systems which really is a

184
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Phim

185
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Throughout

186
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
DARPA you'll see that

187
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
Kind of category is defining

188
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Many programs throughout the

189
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
VI technical office

190
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
So tell me

191
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
What rhymes with

192
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
This concept

193
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,351
Absolutely in a exactly in fact and this is what kind of need about DARPA this is what I talked

194
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
Dakine about as she was talking about bringing me in

195
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
What's to look at

196
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
We have this initiative

197
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,615
To do system of systems we want to look at a maritime version would you do that

198
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Well

199
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
First you gotta understand what do we mean by System of systems and

200
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
It's really this idea that

201
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,903
As our defense has matured over the last few decades

202
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
And we make more and more capable platform

203
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,815
Set a good example would be saying airplane or a submarine

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
These are becoming very sophisticated platforms

205
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Very capable

206
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
But they're also occur

207
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Expensive

208
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
They also take a long time to make

209
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
And what we're finding is

210
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
To make them even better

211
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
Cost a lot of money

212
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,831
And time and you don't necessarily get that much more capability than you had

213
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,671
If you will it's kind of creating like an ass and topaz

214
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,743
You put more effort into it it's getting incrementally better

215
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
And the horse seems to be a limit of how much yeah yeah that it's it's tipping over

216
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
And so

217
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
The whole idea that is

218
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,639
Is there a better way to look at things to say if I really want to do with DARPA supposed to do which is

219
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
Major

220
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Capability games and big straw

221
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Is there a different way to look at

222
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
And one of the ideas is

223
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
Well how about if we distribute

224
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
Some of the functions that are on this planet

225
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,023
Farm so if you think about a platform

226
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
What does it have to do

227
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
It has two cents

228
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
It has to defend itself

229
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,543
If I platform you might be like that craft aircraft or a submarine

230
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Exactly

231
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:28,735
So it has these functions I needs to sense it needs to communicate it needs to defend itself

232
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
It needs to do data processing

233
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,415
And if I put that all there it's great I concentrate it but now

234
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
As I said it's this

235
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,559
Incremental games and each time I make a change it affects the other stuff

236
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
What if I

237
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:48,959
Do the term we call where we disaggregate I take these functions say the sensing

238
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
And I

239
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,103
I put it on a lower-cost platform say like an unmanned system

240
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
That I can put

241
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
Farther away

242
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,783
So now I get an even greater sensing because instead of being stuck on my platform

243
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
It's now

244
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Farther away and in broader and maybe I multiple

245
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,999
Or even up in the air so high up in the air exactly so I get high to buy advantages

246
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,839
The key pieces is I still have I have to be able to communicate

247
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
But if I can do that and

248
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,751
And handle the networking part to make all these things work together

249
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,847
Well now I'm really, using my adversary a difficulty

250
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
Instead of doing what they're doing now which is

251
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,735
Wearing lots of money into being able to go after these

252
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
Single platforms that are high value

253
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Now they have to decide she do I go after this sensor thing well if I get that censor well if there's two others or three

254
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
3 more

255
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,375
Okay you got a little bit of my sensing but I'm still going and oh by the way the main

256
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
Aircraft or ship is still going

257
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
And so it forces them to now

258
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
Spread their forces

259
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
To cover more things

260
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
And this whole idea is

261
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
Try to do this in a way that

262
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
My total cost is less than what I would for

263
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
For just a single platform

264
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
But my capability is much

265
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Priest

266
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
And the problems I caused for the other side or much

267
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
It sounds to me that it also add syrup to things like

268
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
Versatility and resilience

269
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Answer the versatility now you can

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
Mix and match all kinds of different things into these systems of system

271
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
At the same time

272
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
One thing is taken out of the other you still have the

273
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Brazilian swear

274
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,175
You're not thinking of him you're mad absolutely now you've right on because

275
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,783
That whole idea of you know I'll talk about it is adaptability

276
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
Maybe I want to change my mix

277
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
In real-time which means hey we know what the mission is and we need some better let's say jamming caper

278
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Ability or something

279
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
I can put that in the mix

280
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Much easier than

281
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,215
Change it out on the whole platform you kind of get what you get

282
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
Well now these are interchangeable parts

283
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
And you hit it on the head with resiliency

284
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
It means

285
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,967
They have more things to deal with and so if they take care of one or two of them

286
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,599
You know we like to use the term we degrade gracefully as opposed to either I'm all good

287
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Or I'm done I'm done

288
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
And the other way it's adaptable is overtime

289
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
In the sense of

290
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
Hey technology is changing

291
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
That's one of the biggest fact

292
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Actors for this

293
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Is

294
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,543
We see it in our commercial world all the time and new iPhones are coming out new capabilities Udo

295
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
Web filming a movie I do all this stuff

296
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,967
I want my military systems to be able to adapt on those time scales

297
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
As opposed to

298
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,599
Going to be five years before we can build the next airplane

299
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
If I'm more discreet and disaggregated

300
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
It's easier to change those parts out

301
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
So both over long scale and and Realty

302
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
That's another thing I've been hearing about you a tarp another

303
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Replaces the technology Cycles or just

304
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
Speeding up so much and so there is a century

305
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Person getting much more

306
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
Agile in turning that psycho

307
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Faster without

308
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Expensive amount of time

309
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Has taken in the past

310
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Do that to go from version 1 to 2

311
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Before so

312
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
I guess this is in the maritime domain

313
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
Can you be absolutely it affects all the domains and one of the issues there is you'll hear us use the term

314
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Yeah one of the challenges

315
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Disney faces

316
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Composability

317
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
How can I get better

318
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Quickly

319
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
Pulling these things in

320
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,911
And making them so that they go to vit gather

321
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,775
Easily and I don't have to do lots and lots of engineering and testing

322
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
To put these two things together

323
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
And that's part of the system of systems

324
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
Challenges is getting good at being able to rapidly compose

325
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Pulley system

326
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,087
Okay so for some reason as you were talking about the desegregation I was I was thinking about a human body

327
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
Do you know which is a system of system

328
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
System of the liver

329
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
That's the system of cells

330
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
And if that were desegregated actually weeds

331
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
And it would still be a living body would then be just an amazing

332
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Task

333
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
Command and communication and integration

334
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Kind of a weird metaphor perhaps

335
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,591
But it seems to pretend you're so if you're taking apart what has been an integral

336
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
System like a carrier

337
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,687
And you're now disaggregating this into all kinds of pieces

338
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
What about that integration

339
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
That sounds like

340
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:23,647
The hard problem absolutely in and you've done two things and I like the body example because the easiest thing to think of

341
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,487
About is you know your eyes are primary sensor in our nose

342
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
How much better could you surveil

343
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
If you had a set of eyes that were

344
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Udo

345
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,519
50 yards in front of you and you had an extra nose that you could put out there that's what we're trying to do

346
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
But now you hit it on the head is

347
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Well

348
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
It works good my body because those nerve endings

349
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
You know they only have to go from my brain down to my nose or my eyes that's not too far now I'm putting it out there

350
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
So it puts a premium

351
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
On being able to set up

352
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,559
Effective communication paths that are reliable

353
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
Because otherwise

354
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
What good is that knows it's just sitting out there that could smell everything but if it can't get it back to the brain

355
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Its of no value

356
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
And so you

357
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,151
Tide in when we talk about the system of systems programs

358
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
Sometimes people a squirrel

359
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,831
You're not really developing a lot of new technology you're kind of using existing stuff and they're exactly right

360
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
The DARPA hard part that

361
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Challenges

362
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Yeah but I've got to do this now

363
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
And make these reliable

364
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
Communications

365
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
And networking

366
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,703
And and functions you know now I've got instead of two eyes I've got four

367
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,287
Well I've got to have a brain now that can handle that which means

368
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,895
How do I sequence things and do things because I'm getting more information

369
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,503
It's a good analogy to see what we're trying to do with the system assist

370
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Right and again

371
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
We talked about.

372
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Eberhard

373
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,415
We're talkin about systems of systems when you are

374
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Entertaining very ambitious

375
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Ideas like this

376
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Word connect

377
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
We trying to make them so

378
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,375
What all so then comes in here or issues then of communications

379
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
Security I mean

380
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,007
I might want to try to spoof the system or I might want to try to

381
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Jam it and so suddenly

382
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
These kinds of considerations

383
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Become part of your overall

384
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
Oh absolutely

385
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Becomes a huge

386
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Because

387
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
I can't afford to have somebody Co-op

388
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
You know

389
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,111
My forward eyeballs and

390
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
Turn them to look to the wrong Direct

391
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Now they're no good to me

392
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
And so

393
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
It's a good example of Technology were taking advantage of things but you always have to then look at what's the counter-move

394
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
And

395
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
And and do this traitor

396
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,775
And by the way this is why we're doing this at DARPA it's not a hundred percent certain

397
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
But this is the way to fight in the future

398
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,967
It's our hypothesis and there's a lot of evidence suggests if you can do it it's a great way

399
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,295
But that's a big if and that's why we're doing the research

400
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
To see can we really make the

401
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
This work NBC

402
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Secure

403
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
And reliable and all these things that

404
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Rice cereal

405
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Probing what is possible in an in

406
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
If it is past

407
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Even if it is

408
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Desirable in the Rye

409
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,983
When you do get together with other program managers hear other other profession

410
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Hope you're at DARPA

411
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
How to talk about systems of cyst

412
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
Who are you talking with what other what are some of the other I guess

413
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Programs that you think of

414
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,711
When the systems of systems category

415
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:33,087
Yeah and it's fine there's kind of two variants that I do so when I talk to other

416
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
What I would call

417
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:40,511
True systems assistance PM's another program managers who are doing other system assistance program

418
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
You know

419
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
In the defense Sciences office

420
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
John paskewitz

421
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
He's really looking at

422
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
Hey can I come up with mathematical constructs

423
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
To help me do that composition instead of

424
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,687
Hey I think this looks good let's try it and now let's go from there

425
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
So we talked a lot about

426
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:06,111
Hey how can I have machine learning and intelligence help meme

427
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
Pull this stuff together

428
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,999
An interesting Lee we almost always end up with

429
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Logistic

430
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
Because one of the issues is

431
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Now I've got more things Fredo

432
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Park

433
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,799
How do I get them there and how do I sustain them you know the body works well the eyeballs come with the head

434
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
And it's a nice package

435
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
Now I've got these two extra eyeballs out there

436
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,015
Who's going to hold on to those and keep them care and fed etcetera

437
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,599
The other way though that I talked to PM's about programs

438
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Is

439
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
How does there

440
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,999
Particular technology so maybe they're making a better unmanned aircraft

441
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Or

442
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
A better sonar

443
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
Where does that fit into the system assist the weird of those systems fitting where do they fit in and that's where we

444
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,031
We've had really fun dialogue because

445
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
Often that's one of the big problems for technology

446
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,503
Somebody can come up with a great idea for a better sonar and they'll work on that and they'll develop it

447
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
But then it kind of ends up on the

448
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
Porch of the Pentagon with

449
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
We have this great sonar but

450
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:18,303
Where do I put it and how should I employ it in an in do I buy 10 of them or do you know

451
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,911
What's interesting in system of systems you're starting to think about the whole

452
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
And it helps

453
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,287
Guide some things to say you know what we really need that sonar to do

454
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Is

455
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Be able to look wider not necessarily farther

456
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Or

457
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,503
Different things that might help direct their work but at the same time

458
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
We're giving them a great story to say

459
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Here's where it fits in and my gosh

460
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Does it make it

461
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Write something interesting dialect

462
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
You're putting out

463
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
Potential Technologies

464
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Capabilities

465
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
But then you're getting back information

466
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
From the field

467
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
The Commanders

468
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
The Wharf I right

469
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,679
Who actually giving you feedback and saying this is what we

470
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
Really need her this is what we've experienced than then

471
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Aviator perhaps in that dynamic

472
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
You come up with something

473
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
It really does

474
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Further

475
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
Absolutely and what's unique in this program that I've done that I've never done in my research

476
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
Career before

477
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,367
We actually spent a lot of time working with the Navy and organizations to

478
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
To create

479
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
A very sophisticated

480
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
Warfighting scenario

481
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
Very realistic based on

482
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Excerpts from war plans

483
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
To guide our research and that's not

484
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,960
Normally done we usually kind of think

485
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:34,848
Okay I'll look at an engagement and this would help me defeat this aircraft if they came against me

486
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
Very rare to look at it in terms of hey what would I do to win the war and that's the phrase We like to eat

487
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,368
Hey this is great and that's a nice technology but does it help me win the war

488
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,440
And that's not usually a question that we ask

489
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
You know usually just say doesn't make me

490
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
Faster stronger better

491
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Yasso

492
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Bring in some language in here

493
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
There's there's another phrase that I've heard

494
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Round DARPA and I think it must

495
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
Relate to this mess

496
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
Mosaic

497
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,408
Warfare how does that relate to systems of systems

498
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah Mosaic Warfare is it in some sense it's

499
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:18,368
It is a different name for system a system certainly

500
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Sister Sister

501
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Fits into it

502
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
But it's this whole idea of

503
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Bringing lots of pieces together

504
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
And no individual piece

505
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,656
Does everything or tells the story but collectively

506
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
You now

507
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Get

508
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
The picture

509
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
And what's interesting is

510
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
You can afford to lose a few pieces

511
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
And you still get the

512
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
The picture

513
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
And that's this idea of being able to

514
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
To compose

515
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272
To make your mosaic

516
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
Tell a different message or in our case

517
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,904
Do a different function

518
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
For the military

519
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
And be able to

520
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
Put that together make it do that

521
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
Rearrange the pieces now.

522
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,680
Does something different tells a different story so to speak

523
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,288
And it can withstand the fact that like I said if a few pieces get knocked out

524
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
You're not done

525
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,128
So it's really that same idea but

526
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,944
What I like with the Mosaic is when you talk about this

527
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
The imagery of

528
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Hey I can rearrange this tell difference

529
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
Stories to me that means

530
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
I can recompose and do a

531
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Permission

532
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
Right now in a sense that's been

533
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
Going on for a long time I will we have

534
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,560
Different military services they different capabilities they working

535
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
Any kind of different domains and so you can almost think

536
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,216
You're from from a general point of view there there there has been this kind of mosaic

537
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
Thinking but

538
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Here we're also

539
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Bring that downward

540
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Absolutely and there's a little bit

541
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Udoka

542
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,760
Nothing's new but we're trying to take it to a greater limit

543
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:55,136
And and one of the biggest differences there is is we're really trying to bring in

544
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
Unmanned systems with mancis

545
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,792
And and again create this much more

546
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Rapid adaptive

547
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Because yes

548
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
Things have changed but usually it would take

549
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
Decades to say oh we're going to

550
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,056
Fight this way differently and I'm going to use it

551
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,432
This kind of system differently and in many years it'll come out and we'll put it together

552
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
And so you get

553
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,504
Very static

554
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Kind of in how you operate

555
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
This is to be much more fluid

556
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,208
So it it's your right it's an extension but really trying to take it to that limit

557
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
You have had the

558
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Experience in

559
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Akadema

560
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
I'm a student side of things

561
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
You had industry experience

562
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Your

563
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Now working in a government setting

564
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
In particular therapist I'm just wondering now

565
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
How you view

566
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
DARPA

567
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
And the way it operates

568
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
In the overall Innovation ecosystem

569
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,808
I'm aware where does it fit you know we have the services that have more traditional hey we've got

570
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:02,208
These products and we need to get better so we'll do kind of product Improvement if you will as opposed to

571
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Darp is hay

572
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
I'm going to

573
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,096
Create a whole new line of product in terms of

574
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
A whole new capability

575
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,448
And so it's the defense department Venture House

576
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,496
And really that's the way we operate

577
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,824
Fairly quickly pull ideas together

578
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,176
You then have an opportunity to make your case you need to baby due

579
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,248
A small project to get some data to

580
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
To backup your supposition

581
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
But then you go forward

582
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
And you meet with the tech Council and in a very

583
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Short

584
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Time

585
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,072
You'll get an answer that says yes let's go forward and now you're Off to the Races

586
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
To really make this happen

587
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,264
Bytech cancel you're referring to what I understand here for program managers are sometimes very harrowing experiences

588
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Where you have to go in front of

589
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:55,456
Leadership and really make the case for why the research is worthy why it could have benefit to taxpayers and Nash

590
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,528
Social Security and I think one of the things I was hearing when you use this

591
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
VCR venture-capital kind of

592
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,880
Analogy is that they're all so I think it's

593
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Unusual willingness

594
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Even expectation

595
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
That there will be failure along the way

596
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
Because if you're going to really move

597
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Forward

598
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
Not just incrementally

599
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,728
Big step maybe even leaps that you're going to fail along the way

600
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Tortoise had absolutely

601
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
Just like as a venture capitalist

602
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,432
If you show up and say hey I've got a way to get you 10% on your money

603
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
They're not interest

604
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
They can go to the bank or somewhere and get that what they want to see is

605
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
How do I ten-fold my money

606
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
Same idea with DARPA

607
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,976
But when you're doing things like that

608
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,120
Hey if it was that easy everybody be doing it so that you have to be taking risk you have to be

609
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,472
Pushing for things that you know haven't been done and you're not sure

610
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
100% if they can be

611
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
Okay well so weird

612
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,152
Getting toward the end of our time here but for some reason I'm feeling a little mean

613
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,760
And so at gym I'm going to ask you since we've just been talking about the value of

614
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
If you've got a failure story to share with us

615
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,768
Well it turns out I probably have several but I'll use one because it actually ties back to an old DARPA

616
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,864
Project this was when we were I mentioned earlier some of that underwater shock

617
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,424
Process we had

618
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Hilton apparatus

619
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
With a lot of if you will think of it is

620
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
A bunch of little cannons

621
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,384
You know maybe sixteen of them all on a big rack

622
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
That we lowered into the water

623
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
And then the idea was we would

624
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,784
Shoot these off and and try to do the timing right

625
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Right to make a shock

626
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
And

627
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,696
We lured it in the water and we hit the button then we got the first shot and we thought that way

628
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
That was great

629
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Nice big bubble in the water

630
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
And then we hit the thing again and

631
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
Well we didn't notice anything and

632
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
Another time and

633
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,520
After a few times you finally decide to guess it's not working and so we asked the guy to

634
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
Bring the crane up in

635
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
He pulled it up and there was

636
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:06,016
I think maybe one wire still dangling from the end of it and we had blown this thing completely this

637
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Smithereens

638
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:12,160
And I think it took divers about 2 weeks to go find all the parts that we had

639
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,512
Sprung all over the bottom of this cory that we were testing in and

640
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
That was not a

641
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
Completely atypical day of

642
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
How test go sometime

643
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
Okay but you learn some lessons we did we change the way we

644
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,360
Just another day in technology development

645
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:37,760
So Jim it's been a pleasure to have spoken with you here for the last half hour or so

646
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,576
