1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,760
Stealth technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand on this operation. 

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:31,170
Technology is a driver of our times since the funding in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defensive as research projects agency has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:39,230
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window , and the dark is core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,041
My name is , i've been a matter when i'm your daughter host today . 

5
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:53,430
I am pleased to be talking with doctor , witnessing a program manager since twenty seventeen in the agencies microsystems technology , obvious to give you a clue about her focus at the agency . 

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:14,000
Let me say for the moments that if I had a question about , say , in for it based technology , I would go to her first , just a context note , we are recording our conversation from our respective locations as we do our parts to slow the spread of copyright team , because we are not in recording studio , you might hear ambient sounds that make it into our microphone . 

7
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,046
So now , let me get back to witnesses and tell you a little bit about her . 

8
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:26,090
She brings to dark for her interests and expertise in imaging sensors and making those senses see and do more . 

9
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:44,084
She's currently on detail from the night vision and electronic sensors directorate , which is part of the army communications , electronics research , development and engineering center , or at four billboards , virginia , at that directorate witnesses , most recent job was director of the science and technology division . 

10
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:50,862
In this capacity , she entered and engineers and had their sights on next generation article , materials and designs . 

11
00:01:50,862 --> 00:02:01,278
Devices such as focal plane , raise advanced circuitry for converting war imaging signals into useful information and image processing techniques , among other topics . 

12
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:24,510
Her division delivered the technology that underlines the army is most advanced infrastructural and explosive hazard detection technologies , and take some education to get witnesses earned her bachelor of science degree in physics from george town university , and followed that with APHDin physics from the university of oklahoma witnessing , thanks for joining me in this Voices from garbage . 

13
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,693
It's great to be here . 

14
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:26,284
Thank you . 

15
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:30,031
So let's get a little bit at the origins of your interest , right ? 

16
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:37,130
So you got hooked on physics , at least in college , and then you got hooked on objects and infrastructure and technology , among other . 

17
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,780
So , what are the origins of these interests ? 

18
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,970
And if it goes all away back to your childhood , go. 

19
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,312
I have always said that scientists are born not made when I was started my childhood . 

20
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:53,931
I was constantly asking why , why is the sky blue , why is concrete hard ? 

21
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,257
Why is electricity so expensive ? 

22
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:56,723
right ? 

23
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,351
Just curious about things . 

24
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:07,740
And I was fortunate to to have people that would indulge me and help me get resources to try to answer those questions . 

25
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:18,600
You know , I just like science in general , but what suddenly on physics , I think that it's just the root of most of the sciences that we explore today . 

26
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,360
But the cool thing about , imagine if you think about it , it's a little bit of everything . 

27
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,820
So there is material science . 

28
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:34,060
There's electronics , there's image processing and those biology , right , because all of us , all animals , in fact , have eyes of one form or another. 

29
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,570
right ? 

30
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:43,567
And before we leave , that biology point is amazing to think that there even are inferred sensors in the biology world and thinking of things like those pilot organs and snakes . 

31
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,090
And there are those other animals and have that ability. 

32
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,040
Yeah , that's absolutely true . 

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:58,790
And you know , you can take a lot of inspiration from the way animals of all kinds seek to inspire the work that we do here in other places . 

34
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,930
Let's move. 

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,490
Two sort of a question that I asked me to every program manager said , how did you get to dark a story ? 

36
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:15,510
And so you started in twenty seven teen , and just before that , you have been running one of the directors at third deck against the army communications , electronic research , development and engineering center . 

37
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,270
So what was the change of our best to catalyze your leap into what is really kind of an extensive , detailed into four years , just about here , it dropped. 

38
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,390
I have really been fortunate during my time at the army to have a lot of different things position . 

39
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:38,210
So every four to five years , I have been offered opportunities to do another job , and I was just coming to the end . 

40
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,430
About five years is the director of the science technology . 

41
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,050
I am jealous , who is done . 

42
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,510
The deputy director for microsoft and technology office , called and said , would you consider a tour at dark ? 

43
00:04:51,510 --> 00:05:04,770
And of course , I had been fortunate in my career to work very closely with DARPA transition in some of the technologies to us , and no was just an opportunity that was too big to pass up . 

44
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,400
And I will say it is , by far , I have a very fun jobs , but this is the funniest. 

45
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:19,652
Okay , and of course , that is one of the characteristics of darkness that anybody comes in there pretty much as a cell by day on the day they come in and you're coming in on detail . 

46
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,220
So how long? 

47
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,350
So right now , my expiration date is november of this year. 

48
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,690
All right , well , so I am . 

49
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:33,400
So please to be speaking with you now before that day arrives , and you go back to third , I presume , examination in pursuit . 

50
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,960
Where are you going ? 

51
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,940
I, Idon't know . 

52
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:48,030
Okay , which is also another characteristic of DARPA web , where people are willing to take some lips and risk without necessarily knowing what's on the other side of that cell by day , but nearly do the job itself is open and off to take such a risk . 

53
00:05:48,030 --> 00:06:07,498
So let's still move into your programs and mean , when I look at the portfolio programs , strong themes of updates and infrared radiation come through , that might even broaden when we get to maybe one of the last programs will talk about at the end of the conversation before we do take brief tours of the programs . 

54
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:12,431
Tell me a little bit generally about , you know , the world from the infrared perspective . 

55
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:22,420
And why should the departure defence wheels , and for that matter , the rest of us , the rest of the same point , billions of us on planter of , why should we care about that information? 

56
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:32,869
就是back to the ，to the animal analogy , you know , any more eyes involved to be the way they are because they are specific tasks . 

57
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:48,790
So you reference the picnic lines in steaks they developed those because they needed to see their pray , of course , humans to be able to see in the visible wavelength , because that is where most of our light comes from . 

58
00:06:49,130 --> 00:07:02,390
But you know , people in the deal , do you need to see other than just the day rights of social needs to see at night , or see through dust , or find homemade explosives , or find things really far away , or track thinks. 

59
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:12,116
Right , and witnesses before you continue on that thought of records , the most listeners might not know , sort of what the pit organs are doing biologically for the snake . 

60
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:23,145
And so I will just say very briefly , they're essentially like these , these article centres , but in the infrastructure helps them pick out , say , a moving , a warm , a moving mouse out there . 

61
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:31,450
In addition , if they have the visual contact or not , but the pilot organ will give them that moving heat source , and so it will help them hurt . 

62
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,280
Just want to get that little detail in case listeners did no . 

63
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,900
And now I wanted to pick up where you. 

64
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,330
Thank you . 

65
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:45,490
Until you are a great point , right , because everything emits heat of one source or another . 

66
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,470
So , just like any more eyes have evolved to be task dependent . 

67
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:59,766
There is a lot of capability in the infrastructure and a lot of capability in imaging sensors to be able to evolve those sensors to suit soldiers . 

68
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:10,610
So to see all the time , right dynamics says everything in its heat is an important characteristic for a soldier , particularly if he can only carry . 

69
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,250
So thermal sensor is create ubiquitous image. 

70
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,390
Okay , so despite , let's actually move into your portfolio , programs will step to most of them . 

71
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:39,370
So let's serve you more mature programs once that had their thoughts with program manager , the proceeds of june , and whose research performers and by that , I mean , those who are on contract to do work on the programs that you're not shepherding toward delivering real technology capabilities , one of those programs goes by the figuring . 

72
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:51,740
Imagine or reimagine , tell me in our listeners about the article technology that you hope to deliver with this program and how it would empower war fighters , and perhaps in time civilians. 

73
00:08:52,070 --> 00:09:09,300
So if you don't mind , i'm gonna , give you a small tutorial on how infrared images zoo first , there is an absorber material in the visible world that silicon and say , the million foreign that could be a material like indian technique . 

74
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,805
This is the material that what color if you will of radiation ? 

75
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:20,702
You were central williams , or in infrastructures , there is also what is called a read out in the greatest circuit . 

76
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:26,384
The absorber material observes the four times and turns those four towns in electrons . 

77
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:31,457
They read out in a greater circuit , collects those electrons and read them out . 

78
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:43,890
And that's what goes into your display or a computer , and both the absorber and the riddle of circuit are pixilated , and that you , for instance , the pixels in your TV, so you put these two things together . 

79
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,280
And then you have an infrared football. 

80
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,690
Where and I should say , just as you listen to that description of sense , very much . 

81
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh , right now . 

82
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,817
Yeah , we do have young rights and conservatives sanctions , and that gets translated into accountable . 

83
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:59,980
Read out in the form of a normal language , right that is. 

84
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,352
That is an excellent point . 

85
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:16,010
So we imagine is really about working on the riddle , integrated circuits , technology and probably forever rhythm in the greatest circuits have been pretty boring . 

86
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,440
really . 

87
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:37,070
They have had a storage device that collects the turns out into a current and in recent autumn , and the difference between the currents between one pixel and another pizza is what creates the contrast , and it's as basic as that we and you need a computer then to make sense out of this information . 

88
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,650
And they only do one day , right . 

89
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,760
So they only absorbed the electrons , or they could count the electronics . 

90
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,380
You have sensors that can do what timing analysis only will do one . 

91
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:56,530
What we imagine does is it as the capability first to do more than one thing at one time . 

92
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:04,547
So framework greatest as fast as the your television refreshes , writer as fast as your camera refreshes . 

93
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:12,260
And a traditional occupant rate will frame at one frame rate , typically , sixty , hurts using reimagine . 

94
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:34,750
You can frame with different frame rates across different portions of the foreign rate at the same time , or you can change your special resolution so that you have pixels in one area , then you do in another , or you can actually put some math in there so you can turn the information into signals . 

95
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,750
And because it has this computer of capability , it can also plug in algorithms . 

96
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,510
You can program this to do algorithm . 

97
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,040
So the sensor can be more autonomously . 

98
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,316
It doesn't require a user to change the way the focal pilot behaves . 

99
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:54,181
You can use the embedded algorithms to change the way this behaves . 

100
00:11:54,181 --> 00:12:01,948
And so this is going to create an enormous amount of opportunity where a lot of platform farms need to do multiple jobs . 

101
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:05,195
And right now , they would have to have multiple sensors . 

102
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:15,480
Now you can just put one to do all of those functions , and it's very much like your brain works , right , your eyebrow combination , where our brain decides we need to fulfill the aid in a place . 

103
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,230
So we need to look around broadly , this focal point rate is the start of being able to do that in a system. 

104
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,139
Okay , let's just get a bit concrete of weekend . 

105
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:36,425
You know , let's say , we have this versatility to be able to just on the fly , change the framework , as you are referring to work , you know , maybe different parts of the sensor can have higher resolution than the other . 

106
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:36,620
what? 

107
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:45,070
Well , so think about what you would do if you went into a crowd , and you were looking for a specific person , right ? 

108
00:12:45,350 --> 00:13:18,250
You would first scan the entire brown looking for something , and then you , I would focus on something that you would focus on something , and you would bring all of your attention into a specific area so that you could identify by a specific person right now that requires two different kinds of sensors to do that , but using reimagine , I can do this simultaneously , and what I can actually keep my attention on the rest of the room while I am trying to determine if it's the person that I am looking for . 

109
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:24,100
So you don't have to lose your situation awareness while you're trying to focus on one specific area of the city. 

110
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,890
So well , websites are really between a lot more versatility and into what these kinds of sensors . 

111
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,967
Let's move to your program called wild , and that's short for if we're a detector's program . 

112
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:48,974
This one is interesting to me , and that is focusing on the way dramatic cost reduction , you know , as much as a dramatic technology innovation can be what really brings game changing , new capabilities , practical being . 

113
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:53,487
So maybe you can tell me in our listeners what you're hoping that we will do . 

114
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:57,570
And what are the capability gaps are that the programs designed to fill? 

115
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:17,100
If you take a little bit for into the explanation that I gave before on how infrared detectors are made , you take a europe's observer layer , and you make different dye where I die would be the size of your phone around on one waiver when you process that into pixels . 

116
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,290
And then you go probably to a different founder , and you make your read up in a greeted circuit . 

117
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,580
And you has many die on it as well . 

118
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,276
Can you guys up each of these layers separately ? 

119
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:36,170
So you have individual sovereignty and individual world , then you could do what we call hybrid decision . 

120
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,940
So you put indian bombs , which are just thinking of this as glue on each of the pixels . 

121
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,320
And you put these two layers together , and you see them . 

122
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:55,473
The biggest yield hit in focal point rate is actually , when you're taking these , these small focal panel raise are lessen the cinema on the side . 

123
00:14:55,473 --> 00:15:02,374
traditionally , they're very small things when you integrate these 的人，and we lose a lot through this process . 

124
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:04,036
Plus , it is a long process . 

125
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:16,910
You have to paradise each of these , in turn , contrast that with the way we make visible sensors , SONY takes away from , and they put into their foundry , and they make it hundreds of the eye on the waiter , and they cut up . 

126
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,550
And then there is your camera you're done . 

127
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:28,671
So what wire does is it says , kennedy leverage the thinking of commercial scale and skip the hypothesis . 

128
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:30,481
So we take away for robots . 

129
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:33,326
We put our absorber material on it . 

130
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:37,981
We create pixels , and then we die them up , and our camera is there . 

131
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:41,350
So we're taking advantage of commercial processes . 

132
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:55,600
Commercial architecture is commercial flight processes , which has only once before been done in the world world , and that is on good detectors that you can actually buy right , right now . 

133
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,220
And french teams put it on yourself. 

134
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,600
Okay , so I talked to me just a little bit about difference between couldn't uncalled detectors in the infrared technology. 

135
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,543
Context , sure , so cool detectors are going to talk about the absolute material season . 

136
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:23,740
Sovereign materials are in the mathematician and the entire ride , or it was exciting materials that most of us don't think about on a given day , because very , very few people actually make this . 

137
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:34,410
So not only is the process expensive , but the cost of use is expensive , and they are based on a very exclusive material quality . 

138
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,530
And what is called the photo electoral effect . 

139
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:45,650
So I am four towns , and that turns into a current image is very dependent on what the full tones are . 

140
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:50,210
So the band gap of the material sets the wavelength. 

141
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,578
The device , right ? 

142
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:55,820
So I banned capital of tunes into what infrared frequencies it will be sensitive to. 

143
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,990
That is exactly right . 

144
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,880
You can take up this as red , blue , green , right in your physical camera that is done with filters . 

145
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,010
This is done from a material perspective . 

146
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,480
Uncle detectors are based on micro bloomy or so . 

147
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:17,817
A bolometer is just something that changes it's resistance as a function of the temperature that isn't pinching on it . 

148
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:30,220
So in this case , I am just detecting heat , so you absorb the interrogation , decorate the current , and you read it out , and it's a very simple device you can be made right now . 

149
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,200
It's made in commercial foundations . 

150
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,970
It's made a wafer scale . 

151
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,010
So you take the read out , and you put this material on . 

152
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,328
So it's a low cost . 

153
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:45,663
And I have to say it's kind of medium performance , but that's enough for a lot of low cost applications like on your phone . 

154
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:48,900
You don't need the most exquisite of performance and. 

155
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:57,660
And so what , though , will say , wired deliver to the department of defense , which is interested in enhanced capability , say , for war fighters. 

156
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:10,000
Right now , midwife detectors , are you used a lot in water strategy , you know , on the water , saying navy applications , because it sees very well through hubble environments . 

157
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,320
And right now , these sensors are very , very expensive to manufacturer by going to a low cost material or a low cost process . 

158
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:29,620
This is going to enable more of the sensors to be proliferated across , you know , say , ships or planes or forms that operate in. 

159
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:44,320
Human environments , so it falls into the sort of agreement that most people would don't know that we , in our context , we do the swap sea idea , right where , if you can reduce the size , you can reduce the way , reduce the amount of power inquiries , and in this case , reduced the cost . 

160
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:54,840
And maybe some of those other things that in itself brings out more capability , because we can afford to investigate as using other areas where previously , you might not even thought. 

161
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:07,877
That is correct , and I, Ilikely should have mentioned before the primary difference between a high performance infrastructure and an uncle tensor is clearly that an uncle chancellor . 

162
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:18,530
Operating room temperature and high performance sensitively operates at weaker nitrogen temperatures that seven thousand kilometers are about minus two hundred degrees. 

163
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:24,880
Sounds easy and not alone at a world of technical challenges to keep things that . 

164
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:35,980
So it seems like the wild program follows from a previous and now completed manufacturing century programme that was called the low cost symbol imaging manufacturing program . 

165
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,520
But in this is a dynamic that happens a lot at dark , or where lessons are learned . 

166
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,690
And earlier program applied in the design of a following program . 

167
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,820
Some just wondering what lessons from the earlier program or helping with various programs. 

168
00:19:50,330 --> 00:20:03,278
So I think there is two things for civilities against leveraging that commercial idea and the commercial processes , looking at manager of commercial scale processes . 

169
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:10,432
The other thing is that you have to set your performance criteria correctly , right ? 

170
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:29,100
So uncle detectors are typically medium format , and it's okay because you are leveraging other things right to swap , save energy , the low cost packaging of these transition in that into a wild , in particular , the other thing we focused on was the , of course , packaging . 

171
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:40,590
So trying to make this work more like an uncle package operating very close to real temperature , but not expecting the very highest performance television. 

172
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,211
Witnessed , you know , I agree with you enough , but not quite because I want to talk briefly about your news program . 

173
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:50,310
And i'm referring here to your program called fence . 

174
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,270
That's the agreement for fast event based neurologic camera and electronics . 

175
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,680
Just want to congratulate you . 

176
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:07,721
First of all , for getting the problem , the victim process , it is hiring and difficult to do that , and you've gone to a place in the lifecycle of the programmer . 

177
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:11,810
You've now identify the research groups who will be working on . 

178
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,140
So i'm hoping that you can tell us a little bit about what you hope to achieve with the program and about status. 

179
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,870
Sure , so I think that this is the forest . 

180
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,180
We have gone . 

181
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:31,170
The imagine community has gone towards approaching the way the eye brain works . 

182
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,490
There is a classic sensors called event based sensors . 

183
00:21:34,740 --> 00:22:11,320
It appears that the essential is only provides information when something changes , though , if you were looking at a static scene and nothing changed , then you will get no information and the sensors right now operate the visible , and they work just beautifully when there is not a lot of change in this thing , there are some pretty cool videos that you can find on mind of rockets taking off using these sensors , or looking at stars , tracking stars , because not a lot of the background scene is changing and advantages . 

184
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:22,870
They can be very , and they can be extraordinary , low power , but you know , the world is not changing scenes , rather than a lot of information going on all the time . 

185
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:33,920
And so what fence springs is using that event based mentality , but bringing processing to it very much like your eye does . 

186
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:45,000
So we have the equivalent of about one hundred and thirty million pixels in our eye , but your brain only processes about one percent of that information at a time . 

187
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,610
There is a lot of preprocessing that goes on actually , in your right . 

188
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:58,100
We always used to think of the camera as the eye and the processor as the brain , but it's a much larger spectrum than that . 

189
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,850
Weather is a lot of it processing going on at the front end . 

190
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:19,860
And if you can do that processing in the front end , then you can maintain this very high speed allegations and very low power by putting processing right behind the foreign primary , in fact , right into the pizza so that you are what I can specify the information in real time . 

191
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:29,790
So to that analogy that I said , right , where are you going to a role in your scanning around for people , your brain automatically ignores chairs and. 

192
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,300
The floor is the sea link . 

193
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,740
Now you're. 

194
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,500
Foot feels in your show all of these things , exactly right . 

195
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,421
You are focused on the information that is important to you . 

196
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,650
That's exactly what these cameras are going to be . 

197
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:55,157
People to do is boil down the same content into information that is relevant to the job ahead and be very low power and very quickly . 

198
00:23:55,157 --> 00:24:04,013
So we've just been through source elections when we have selected , the performers were not yet under contract . 

199
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:12,340
I think we will be under contract this summer , and I just couldn't be more excited to get started. 

200
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:19,340
It's gonna be amazing , as you were describing that , and I think it , actually , my related to some work in your other programs . 

201
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:29,060
And in some ways you are striving to do is to , and the capacity of sensor is a kind of pay attention , just the way we do . 

202
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,200
It is a kind of amazing that we actually have to ignore . 

203
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,506
Ninety nine point nine percent of what is actually available to our own senses in order to really operate in the world . 

204
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:41,824
Because if we pay attention to everything , we would be paralyzed . 

205
00:24:41,824 --> 00:25:01,220
You going to a supermarket , and you find that box of syria , which you interested in , you look for the queues of that , and you consider when I undergo that behavior , whereas if you could not distinguish between the ten thousand items in a supermarket , you be lost when it sends you are trying to bring the ability to pay attention to in my contract . 

206
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,440
That is exactly it . 

207
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:13,990
So take me out into a kind of setting out there on the world with the kinds of sensors you've developing an imagine football , even a civilian version of this beyond the bye . 

208
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,540
What is fun for you to think about being able to do with those? 

209
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:23,680
Here is so one of the examples that I use think about going out on the boat . 

210
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:30,720
And if you're out on the water , particularly you are out on the ocean right , there is a lot of stuff going on . 

211
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:36,690
There is a sunglass of the waves , right , they can play . 

212
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,120
There can be boats moving around . 

213
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,300
There can be just use . 

214
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,820
Moving around . 

215
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,890
There could be birds flying around right ? 

216
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:59,780
There is all of this content , but all they think you really want to do is make sure that you don't hit in body , right , and a typical focal point rate , you would have to take in on that information , and eventually your sensor would be able to say it will stop another critical samples . 

217
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,120
Is self driving cars right ? 

218
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,483
There is released critical information that you need to know . 

219
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:06,911
You don't need to know that the grass is green . 

220
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:19,510
You don't need to know that their stores on the side of you , but you shall be better be able to say that the pedestrian is getting ready to walk across your field of view , or that there is a bicycle , but approaching . 

221
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:35,260
And if we do these sensors , right , eventually , we're going to be able to honeymoon things right where you can start thinking about intent and thinking the way we do great , think about driving along the road . 

222
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:42,590
And you see somebody in their working over their shoulder , and you know , the speakers are going across the road right recently doesn't know that recently has no idea . 

223
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:53,710
But if you can start focusing on the things that are important , you can start to learn about , how do these things work and become more likely? 

224
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,680
Our ignorant combination works right . 

225
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:02,810
So it sounds like in the back end , at least for some of the applications who have in mind artificial intelligence techniques will be part of it. 

226
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:11,420
I think that this enables those artificial intelligence techniques to be so much more powerful , absolutely , because you're doing the processing at the beginning . 

227
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,340
Take good , rid of information that confuses for the computer. 

228
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:28,954
So when you said earlier that you have had many jobs , and you are adopted as a program manager , just wondering if you can tell me a little bit about what sort of different about this experience you're having as a program manager . 

229
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:34,100
And how do you view it is fitting into the overall innovation ecosystem , isn't it? 

230
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:48,740
Great question , the thing that I think is the most amazing and the most impactful parts about dark is that I get to throw the dirt really hard , right ? 

231
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,810
I get to say , i've done some research . 

232
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:57,390
I thought people , I think it's good work , but it might not write feeling fast . 

233
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,930
Use an option if you learn something else . 

234
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,450
So you really get to explore the space of what might be impactful . 

235
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:15,320
Ten years from now , twenty years from now , thirty years from now , I supposed to having to make sure that it works , which is I was a valuable job , but my technology doesn't have to work it in two years . 

236
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,960
It doesn have to go on attack in two years . 

237
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,210
It can be way out there and far reaching , and I can change the world. 

238
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:37,200
Right , and this reminds me of just one of the most wonderful aspects of the dark at my opinion in which is this tolerance of failure , and actually not looking at failure in the way many people do , which is sort of like a lost cars . 

239
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,980
Instead , failure is valuable , right ? 

240
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:47,150
And that you learn lessons from it , and those lessons often do become the basis of programs down the lights. 

241
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,834
That is absolutely true . 

242
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:59,730
There are so many programs in the imaging world and other places that took a lessons learned from a previous program recognized the technology . 

243
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,930
But she has advanced and brings that new technology to bear on an old problem to solve its challenges . 

244
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,270
So it's much like all of science we are building on the. 

245
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,143
You've been very generous with your time . 

246
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:21,370
I just want to give you an opportunity to bring up any other question that you think I should have brought up in the conversation that didn't come up with any other topics that you think just would be interest. 

247
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:37,000
To listeners , they do actually have one other programming is really cool , telling full cycle arranges for curved infrared images , and another place leverages the whole biological scenario . 

248
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:46,453
What you find right now is that infrared cameras can be very small fields , say on the order of twenty degrees . 

249
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:51,380
You can think about that maybe is about a quarter of our future view . 

250
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,337
And they're exquisite and they're wonderful . 

251
00:29:54,337 --> 00:30:01,490
But when you try to extend the field of you to , well , we see right , which is on the order of one hundred degree field of view . 

252
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:14,384
Then the performance of the cameras around the edges degrees , and it degrades from a resolution , and it degrades from a sensitivity perspective . 

253
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:22,437
There is a concept in objects which is sort of the ideal focuses called the peaceful surface , and it resides on a curve . 

254
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:35,410
And if you curve a foreign minority allows you to have a white field of view in a compact package , you can solve the performance degradation by putting in more and more objects . 

255
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,500
But there is a limit to that . 

256
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,290
Of course , this makes it very heavy . 

257
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:51,000
It is , in fact , the reason that our eyeball is curved because we have to fit our wide field of view , high resolution into a very small package . 

258
00:30:51,110 --> 00:31:04,450
And so football guy is approaching that trying to get focal point rates into a very small package to have up to him a spiritual right half of the circle to make the very smallest. 

259
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,910
Vital review . 

260
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,330
So very ago , again , just bought me stealing from biology and evolution's brilliance. 

261
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,262
Yeah , well , we all see right . 

262
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:19,020
Nature has evolved over thousands of years , and we're trying to evolve much quicker. 

263
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:28,067
And so tell me that the challenge of them bring you what typically is in technology has been kind of flat focal planner can have a rate into these curved formats . 

264
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:31,248
What are some of the technical challenges underneath ? 

265
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:31,930
That is that? 

266
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,880
Let me tell you what I did when I was thinking about this program . 

267
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,010
Take a piece of paper . 

268
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,182
And if you hold it on those things dancing , you've folded up in one dimension . 

269
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:42,648
Writers , perfectly smooth . 

270
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:46,208
So you have an innovative solution that is perfectly smooth . 

271
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,465
There is no tears . 

272
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:49,350
There is no anything , anything . 

273
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:57,620
Now take that same piece of paper and try to make it into a circle , and it rigorous rate , or it breaks . 

274
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:07,005
And max obviously know what you in this focal planner rate and focal planter is right to the underlying materialists silicon , which is hard . 

275
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,172
It's fun , but it's hard . 

276
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:21,970
So you have to deal with the physics of the material , the current risks of the material to try to reduce the string that is involved in the eastern , where approaching is in the forecast program in two different ways . 

277
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:38,700
In one sense , we say , take a large piece of silicon about four cinemas on the side and folded up to be about a quarter of a circle , but half a himself with no wrinkles and no overlap and no breaking in the other case , were saying to people . 

278
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,320
You can have strange relief in there . 

279
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,560
You can make cuts , or you can do a say , a soccer ball and fooled it into a shape . 

280
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:55,020
There are particularly in order to get an actual through him is fear , just like our eye , graduates of culture . 

281
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:04,750
The new thing about dark programs , I think , is when you can find farmers that are all approaching the same problem in fundamentally different ways . 

282
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,710
So they choose to explore the physics of the problem . 

283
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:13,960
And I always say rising tide raises or ships the lessons that you are . 

284
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,880
Those efforts are changes the way you can do. 

285
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:24,850
Right in your leveraging the creativity of many minds this way , instead of specifying this is the way to go about it . 

286
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,020
We certainly limits the creative imagination. 

287
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,760
The engineering imagination , that's right . 

288
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,600
The neighborhood is when somebody comes to you with an idea. 

289
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:42,620
That just makes it so much better , and I could see how that would make a program manager's date when it has been a really fun conversation . 

290
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:47,550
And I just wanna thank you for making this time to be with me in the share with our listeners . 

291
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,880
Thank you very much . 

292
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,710
This was , and thanks witnesses for sharing this time with us . 

293
00:33:52,710 --> 00:34:01,710
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from double thanks also to ban selection for his partnership in producing this program .
