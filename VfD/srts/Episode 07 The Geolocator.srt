The internet GPS in the palm of your hand

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,016
Technology is a driver of our times

4
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,856
Since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War

5
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,952
DARPA the defense Advanced research projects agency has been a driver

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,280
Welcome to Voices from DARPA

7
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
A window Into Darkness

Program manager

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,144
Their job

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
To redefine what is pasa

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,312
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host and today I'm pleased to have

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,456
With me in the studio linhoss a program manager since 2012 in DARPA's strategic technology

14
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,784
With a background in physics engineering and management

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,416
We spent a lot of time at the art of thinking about a world without the global positioning system

16
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,280
Assistant which is all about physics engineering and the management of complex systems

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
And he thinks about bringing GPS functions

18
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
Undersea and two other places where GPS signals cannot now

19
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Ensure

20
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,824
When has become one of the agency's go2guys in a technical area known as

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
TNT

22
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
Which stands for positioning

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
Navigation

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
And timing

25
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
Thanks for spending time with me today

26
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
Well thank you for inviting me

27
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,112
Before we talk about some of your efforts to develop

28
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,464
Plan B for when GPS might not be available or to create

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,816
Undersea version of GPS I just interested you I want to find out a little bit

30
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:44,192
About you your background and maybe something about how that background explains

31
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
How you ended up here at DARPA in 2012

32
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
Well when I was growing up

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
I never

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Thought about

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,152
My grow up I want to be a navigation engineer

36
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,504
That was not something that was at the front of my mind

37
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
However when I

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Came out of grad school

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
My first

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Job

41
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,928
Was a navigation flight controller

42
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
For space shuttle operation

43
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,328
And I fell in love with the Art and Science of navigation

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
And it's been a Common Thread in my career ever sets exciting entry I mean to be working on the space shuttle

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Graham just a little bit more about the

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,848
But I was working on the space shuttle program that was before

47
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
We had ups and so the navigation

48
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
System.of of the

49
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Are the space shuttle used

50
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
A variety of sensors

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
To determine where that

52
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
Vehicle was in space

53
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,232
So we are the navigation system was primarily critical on the

54
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
Entry portion

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Admission that is when it returns from space

56
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
To The Landing

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,472
Field but also a scent and on orbit operation

58
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
And what did you study in grad school

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Physics

60
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
And then I I quickly learned that

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Theoretical physics was not

62
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
My forte

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,112
But I still love physics so I my graduate degree was in engineering physics

64
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,000
And there's one other thing about your biography of sense that I'm interested in is your name because I believe your

65
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Full first name is

66
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
Franklin Co you go buy at Lynn the second syllable for short winners most people who have the name Franklin

67
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,776
We'll go with that for civil Frank so what's up with Lynn

68
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,640
I like to think that my mother has a sense of humor I am a junior

69
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
And she did not want to Frank's running around the house

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
So my father goes by Frank

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
I go by

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,904
It's so that indicates to me that there was a big dose of

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,768
Pragmatism in your home address that spilled over into other way you would he work

74
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,376
What's Noah talk about some of your programs I think we'll start with the

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,216
Adaptable navigation systems program

76
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,848
As do all programs at DARPA this one goes by an acronym in this case ANS

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
What intrigues me about this one but I want you to say more about it is that you are

78
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
Trying to tap into a huge diversity of signals hear things like signals and cell towers are TV signals that are

79
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
Already out there kind of in the constructed environment

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
But also other kinds of signals in the natural environment the one that does really sticks out for me

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Is lightning

82
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Let me stop there and just asked you to tell me in the listener is a little bit about the adaptable navigation

83
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Systems program

84
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,919
Okay ins is actually a portfolio of

85
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Multiple programs

86
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
One of those programs on Uranus

87
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,855
It's called Aspen Aspen with short for all source

88
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Positioning in navigate

89
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
And IT addresses the topic you you

90
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,535
Reference to we like to think of it as

91
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
A developing a navigation

92
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Architecture

93
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,959
An algorithm that can process what we call sensors

94
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,311
Of opportunity that is any sensor that has spatial

95
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Or temporal information

96
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
So

97
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Consider an aircraft

98
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Primarily aircraft today

99
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Use GPS

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
End

101
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
Either Standalone mode or they will

102
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Integrate

103
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,975
A GPS receiver with what's called and inertial measurement u

104
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,279
Basically a dead reckoning device

105
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,607
Has sensors in it for work that senses accelerations

106
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,679
And will sense rotational rates and from that you can dead reckon

107
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
So the two

108
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,799
GPS and inertial measurement unit combined form a very robust

109
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
Solution but

110
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
GPS sometimes is not available

111
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
And then that system will rely primarily on the IMU

112
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
Are the situation under which GPS might be

113
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Become unavailable

114
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,975
Foreground users GPS can become unavailable when

115
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,047
You are in what we call Urban Canyons that is

116
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Idents

117
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,911
Ordinary skyscrapers you think of downtown Chicago

118
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Or downtown

119
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
Manhattan where the buildings are at

120
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Obstructing the

121
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
Especially in this is all in the context of maintaining very accurate now

122
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Aircraft

123
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,039
Especially military aircraft when they roll over turn upside down now the GPS antenna is pointing to

124
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Is ground

125
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Signals aren't coming from the ground

126
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
Okay so we rely on the inertial measurement unit

127
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Do dead reckon until the GPS

128
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Leicester City versus expose

129
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
And

130
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
Because the GPS signal is so weak

131
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
Eye by Design

132
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
That it is very easy to

133
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Interfere with

134
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
A receivers reception of that City

135
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
Okay so actually kind of sets up the problem for us and that Melanie

136
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
Get you back to what you were talking about sandwiches

137
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
To use some sensors of opportunity out there to

138
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,063
Makeup for whatever what we recognized was that many platforms we have

139
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
Have sensors on them

140
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
Better providing spatial information

141
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
But they're not being used by the navigation system

142
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
So the question we asked ourselves

143
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Was

144
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Can we come up with

145
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
An algorithm

146
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
And an architecture that can be rapidly reconfigure

147
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,311
To use sensors that are already on board

148
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Are platforms to navigate

149
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
When GPS is not available

150
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,063
Just as importantly to provide redundancy and hence additional Integrity to the Jeep

151
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
PS signals themselves

152
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:28,255
Cocaine to work through a couple of examples of a kind of sensing signals okay so they might use your want one that we have

153
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
Used very successfully

154
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Is imagery

155
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
Okay consider aircraft with a camera

156
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Looking at the ground

157
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
The Advent of satellite imagery

158
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Think of Google Earth

159
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
Are all all those pixels and a Google Earth image

160
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
Have an Associated latitude and longitude

161
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
And if we can correlate the image

162
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
That is

163
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,111
Being observed by the camera on the airplane with

164
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,463
That satellite that what we call a Geo registered satellite image

165
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Frabill to determine

166
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Where that aircraft is

167
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
That's part of the

168
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,399
Problem the other part of the problem is not how do I get that into my navigation system

169
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Such that I can continually navigate

170
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
And that's what

171
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
The Aspen

172
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
A program that's where then you you need

173
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,919
That inertial measurement unit in a sense of timing combined with that

174
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
Imagery on the ground and you can then start

175
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
To keep track of

176
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
That where you are now and where you going until

177
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Interesting yet

178
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Button

179
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
Foreground users

180
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,207
For example we are being bombarded with radio frequency signals

181
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Where we are sitting right now

182
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,607
But we're not using them for navigation but they have special information in them whether they be

183
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
BTV

184
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Signals

185
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,215
Radio signals or if we are outside we would be

186
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Receiving many signals from satellites

187
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,407
And so we call those signals of opportunity and we've shown that you can navigate

188
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
Very well with those signal

189
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
Drilling a little bit on one of those signals of opportunity

190
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Lightning

191
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
How does that fit in a picture that was a very fun signal for us

192
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
When lightning strikes

193
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
It essentially lights up

194
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
The entire

195
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,143
Electromagnetic spectrum from DC to Daylight and Beyond research

196
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Have shown that they're even

197
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
X-rays and potentially even gamma rays

198
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Is coming out of a lie

199
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Tremendous amount of energy

200
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
For a very short period of time

201
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
We're talkin one to several milliseconds

202
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Of duration and time

203
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
So

204
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Huge burst of energy

205
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
The energy that is in

206
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,487
The spectrum that we call the very low frequency band vlf which is

207
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
The Tenkiller region

208
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
10 to 20 kilohertz in general

209
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
That

210
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
Portion of the energy can travel around the world

211
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,103
There's almost like a waveguide right now between the Earth and the ionosphere and then those signals

212
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
That is what writer

213
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
That is the reason that the waveguide is because

214
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
10 kilohertz

215
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Your wavelength

216
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
Is now kilometers

217
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
1012 15 km

218
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Depending on what exact

219
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
The exact freak

220
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Because that there's only a few wavelengths

221
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Between the Earth and the

222
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631
Bottom of the ionosphere which is depending on the time of day around 80

223
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
And you get a wave.

224
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Affect which has

225
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
Very low signal attenuation

226
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Cancel the signal

227
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
Can be received at very high

228
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Signal

229
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
And so the question was

230
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
Can we

231
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Navigate with the

232
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
So we went outside and put a vlf receiver

233
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
On the street or even in in the building you would be picking up

234
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
Pens

235
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,535
Of signals per second the the vlf portion of a lightning strike is called a sphere

236
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:47,935
Short for an atmospheric that's a fairly old term that that's what we call it so you would be receiving

237
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Dozens of spherics

238
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Per second

239
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
Answer questions can you navigate

240
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,407
This is amazing to think about that navigating by lightning strikes

241
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
You have to know where those lightning strikes are in order for this to to work correct that is absolutely correct and that is

242
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
In my opinion one of the hardest

243
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,207
Parts of a lightning navigation system if you will

244
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
To detect those

245
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
We use a

246
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Einetwork

247
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
What we called monitoring station to reference stations

248
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Located around the world

249
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
That would

250
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
Geo locate those lightning

251
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
Yes right and we both seen these on on weather reports where they're showing the lightning strikes from the sky minion minion

252
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Versys have

253
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Lightning detection Network

254
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
In place there are commercial products

255
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
For getting that information as well yes

256
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,231
Absolutely fascinates let's Segway to another program you're working on which was related to this one

257
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,327
This one is known mercifully in short form as stoic

258
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
Sto I see but that actually short

259
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
For the long form

260
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
Name of the program which is spatial-temporal and orientation information in contested environment

261
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
But let's go with store cuz it's easier to say

262
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
And this too as a deliverable of a backup UPS of sorts

263
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,111
And it involves a number of interesting sounding components that I hope we can talk about briefly

264
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
Two that I mentioned are very low frequency signals which we actually did touch upon already when we were talking about lightning

265
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
But another component here

266
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
Has the development of optical clocks which rely on quantum mechanical behaviors in atoms

267
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
To keep by super

268
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,615
Accurate time and then the clocks are always a part of these kinds of navigation system

269
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,199
We can't go deeply into the Weeds on on these things but

270
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,039
Let's let's try to talk about him a little bit give us a flavor of what Stokes

271
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
It's about and what technology we're hoping to develop to make it work

272
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Okay let's talk about the the vlf component

273
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
It's interesting to note

274
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
That the

275
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
First global positioning system was not called

276
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
GPS

277
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,655
It was called Omega

278
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
It operated back in the from the early 70s

279
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
Through the early 90s

280
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,847
And it was a vlf

281
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Broadcast system

282
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
And provided Global coverage

283
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
With only eight

284
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Transmitters

285
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Located around the world

286
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
However it was not accurate

287
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
That system generally provided one

288
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
To wish

289
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,511
Kilometer levels of positioning accuracy

290
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
Whereas GPS is generally below five

291
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
So the older Mega System is clearly not accurate for what we now

292
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Depend on today

293
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
I from GPS so the primary challenge we have

294
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
In-store

295
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
For the vlf component

296
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Is

297
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
Developing new models

298
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Back can

299
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
Accurately replicate

300
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
How that vlf signal

301
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Propagates

302
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
From a transmitter

303
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
To a receiver

304
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
I such that we can get our accuracies

305
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
To GPS level

306
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,655
In NY the vlf2 very low very good component of the full

307
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
Spectrum about it many many choices of frequency bands to use

308
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
So you mentioned the waveguide effect

309
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
I'm in and we talked about the fact that

310
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Waveguide effect

311
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,991
Has significantly less signal attenuation such that the signal can be received

312
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
At longer distances

313
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
So in the context of providing a

314
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
Backup system to GPS

315
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Oh that has Global range

316
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
Clearly we don't want to put a position Beacon if you will

317
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
Every few miles around the Earth

318
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,007
So the ability to provide a positioning system with only a few let's say less than

319
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
10

320
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
The electrons meters

321
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Is very appealing

322
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,431
Especially when the signals can be received at very high levels

323
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,831
Right in this there's probably pragmatic and cost issues I believe vlf transmitter is rough and very big

324
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
So they are

325
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,951
Not only are they very big but they're also very old it's in general

326
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
They're using

327
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
1950s 1960s technology

328
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
And so using

329
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,959
New technology we're looking at ways of making them much smaller

330
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
More affordable

331
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,287
And more portable okay and then

332
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
Let's talk about the

333
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
Clock aspect here in this case Optical clocks

334
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
Before we actually talked about this specific

335
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
2 quantum mechanical based

336
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,575
Clock technology that you're you're a nurturing here

337
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,439
Just for those who don't know talk a little bit about the role that accurate clock

338
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Play

339
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,303
In systems like GPS another geolocation and navigation

340
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,631
So there is a common phrase used

341
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
On the navigation community

342
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
Which is thymus position and position is time

343
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
That date

344
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
All the way back to the

345
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,687
16 hundreds if not sooner in the maritime days when

346
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
We navigated

347
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
Off of the Sun

348
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
When you left the port

349
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Weatherby

350
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
And say when you left the port at London

351
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
IU wood

352
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Set your clock

353
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
At noon

354
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
And then as you sailed across

355
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
The Atlantic Ocean

356
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
You determine how many degrees

357
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
Longitude you had traveled

358
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
By looking at

359
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
The time on your watch on your clock

360
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
At the point at which the sun was

361
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Directly overhead and that would you

362
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Correlate

363
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
The number of

364
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
The hours off of noon your watch that

365
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
Watch what your chronometer

366
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
Versus

367
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Nunaat

368
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
The pat London where you left

369
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
So the more accurate Euro and we're confident you could be of your position and determination in the rice acronym

370
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,119
Today's it was very true time as position position is time

371
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
With GPS

372
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
The same is also true so the key

373
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
The GPS

374
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
Is indeed the clocks

375
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
You're getting a ranging signal off at the GPS satellite

376
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Can you receiver determines rain

377
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,223
You don't measure distance what you are actually measuring is time

378
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
How long did it take that signal to travel

379
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
From the satellite

380
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,903
To your receiver so the satellite tells you

381
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,231
This signal left my antenna at

382
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Time Warner

383
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
You look at your receiver clock

384
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
When that signal was received

385
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
At time

386
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
And time 2 minus time 1 is

387
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
The time of travel

388
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
Time of travel

389
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
Times the speed of light

390
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Gifts test

391
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,175
Netflix that's where the rain comes runs but it all goes back to the

392
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
Read speed of light which we know and is constant that sort of

393
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
The key here right

394
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
O'Brien

395
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Without that

396
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
You wouldn't be able to just from a measurement of time

397
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Know what the range

398
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
That it that is cracking there are a lot of other things your GPS receiver has to do as well but that's primarily like

399
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,959
It is remarkably complex on sort of every level by any metric you can you can imagine applying to it

400
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,615
So let's move now to 1/3 program this will be the last one I think we talked about this one is known as Poseidon

401
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,199
And that stands for positioning system for deep

402
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Ocean

403
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,831
Navigation so it sounds like you're going for an underwater GPS system

404
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Yes

405
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
Bottom Line GPS does not work underwater

406
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
Actually you can receive it at very

407
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
Shallow depths inches

408
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
I'm people have shown that

409
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
But that's not relevant to

410
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
Where we actually operate we went to

411
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
We want to be able to navigate

412
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
At much deeper level

413
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,919
Poseidon is about bringing a GPS like positioning capability

414
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
2

415
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Submerged user

416
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
So when I think about the submerged users

417
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
I don't think about

418
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,975
Radio operation there though I know that there's some other real interesting working trying to bring

419
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
Radio with with vlf and ultra-low frequency

420
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:47,679
So down into into underwater operations but I left I think immediately of acoustic types of signal

421
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,495
So I presume that that's part of why you were correct

422
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,895
The climate research Community has been using low-frequency acoustic signals for several decades

423
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Now

424
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
How to monitor the temperature

425
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Of the ocean

426
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
As a function

427
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
And

428
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
By using low frequency signals if you know again

429
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,951
The analogy of just gave earlier

430
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Time is Key here

431
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
If you know when the signal left a

432
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Transmitter

433
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Compare that

434
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
2

435
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
The time you received it at another location you can get the time of

436
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Flight of that signal

437
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
Now for underwater

438
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
So you mentioned

439
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
For GPS the speed of light is is is constant

440
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
That's not quite the case

441
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
For underwater the speed of sound

442
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,063
Underwater is a function of many things

443
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Primarily temperature

444
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
But also I doubt

445
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,231
And salinity and some other terms as well

446
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
So

447
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
We have developed models

448
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
That

449
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Account fraud

450
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
In addition to that the

451
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,959
Acoustic signals underwater

452
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,311
I don't travel in a single line between the transmitter and receiver

453
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
Which radio frequencies

454
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
Typical acoustic signals will take

455
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
Many paths

456
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
On the way from the source

457
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
To a receiver

458
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
Because the signal was getting re

459
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Refracted

460
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,391
Due to temperature profiles in the ocean

461
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Pressure profiles

462
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,767
Things like that's when you hear a signal low-frequency signal at a receiver

463
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
That was admitted far away you actually hear

464
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Multiple instances

465
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Like an echo

466
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
I'm in the car for a week all that multi

467
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,543
There are multiple paths that a signal will take

468
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
So it sounds like

469
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Eyewitness multipath

470
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
Phenomenon going on that one of the big

471
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
Issues here is going to be sort of

472
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,039
How do you deconvolve all of those

473
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:45,439
Signals coming in and so that sounds like algorithms it sounds like computational issues

474
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,999
So I just to make sense of what otherwise would be just a morass of

475
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
You are correct

476
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
And that is exactly what we are focused on in the program

477
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Initially

478
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
What is

479
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Can we

480
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
Improve

481
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,335
Current models develop new models that can accurately count

482
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,431
For all of those paths that a signal take such that we can extract

483
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,527
An accurate time of flight and hence an accurate distance

484
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
Once we get the distance

485
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
I from that signal the navigation part

486
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
Is is fairly

487
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
The hard part

488
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Is the signal

489
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Measurement model

490
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
And

491
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
Justice GPS depends upon constellations of

492
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
Satellites and forgetting the exact number now but

493
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
What is a couple of days

494
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Do you know the exact number

495
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
What's around 3130 would Poseidon in an undersea GPS system also rely

496
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,992
Ayana constellation of acoustic beacons so distributed through the oceans yes but hopefully not 30

497
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Forgiving Arrow

498
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,672
Also the ocean is there a phenomenon like the one we talked about for very low frequency radio signals

499
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Minnesota

500
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,816
Skirting the Earth through the Earth in the ionosphere and that sort of long-wave guard guide effect

501
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,704
Acoustic sound can travel tremendous distances in the ocean right there where I'm thinking here of how

502
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Whales communicate over greatest

503
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
That is correct and within that is the exact

504
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
The fact that we were exploding

505
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,640
There is what's called a sound channel

506
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
The death of a sound channel

507
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
Is in general a function of

508
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
Of temperature

509
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,088
But in general in deep oceans it's about a kilometer

510
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Deep

511
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
And so

512
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
Low frequency

513
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Acoustics

514
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,512
Will travel for very long distances that there was a Seminole

515
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
Study in the 90s that showed

516
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Low frequency signals

517
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
Could be received in the sound channel

518
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,032
Many thousands of kilometres I believe it was almost 9000 km

519
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Persuade Absol

520
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Who is down.

521
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,968
And it also just brings another question to mine I don't know much about how these beacons work and what their characteristics are

522
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,832
Are there issues of concern for animals living in the ocean

523
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
Who are these signals on will be

524
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
Propagating absolutely

525
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
A key tenet of the program is

526
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
We have to develop a system

527
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
That complies with all the Federal

528
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Regulation

529
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Protecting

530
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
A marine mammal

531
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,240
When I take it one of the things that drives you

532
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,312
Is the concern that we have become utterly dependent

533
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
On GPS just the way we were utterly dependent upon the electric

534
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Grid

535
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,504
We all know when the electrical grid goes down that we become frantic even 5 minutes

536
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,808
Power out we are going nuts

537
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
ISO

538
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
GPS has a similar vulnerabilities tell me about

539
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,024
That aspect of how you think about technology and security

540
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,864
Yeah so there was a phrase that some people use you have

541
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
Fail-Safe

542
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
And fail operational

543
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Cayo

544
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
Your primary system fails

545
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
And he's the fail to a

546
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,176
Safe mode use or fail first two you're still operational and then if it fails again you're still safe

547
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,576
Okay so you have that built-in redundancy same into the power grid when the power goes out the building the diesel generators come on

548
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
If you need

549
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
Continuous levels of power in that building

550
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
The same thing as is happening

551
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
In the in the navigation

552
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Considera autonomous

553
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Vehicles

554
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
Witcher on the horizon

555
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
Clearly they can't

556
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
Solely depend on GPS

557
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
To tell the car where it is located

558
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Because of

559
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,824
Some of the things we talked about earlier such as

560
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
The urban Canyon they can't pick up the

561
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
GPS signal

562
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
So you're already sing

563
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,016
Driverless cars being more dependent on other sensors for

564
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Fighting positioning a

565
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Information weather

566
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Lidar laser radar

567
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Or or imagery

568
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
For example

569
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Or even the

570
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
The Doppler sensor

571
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
High on The View

572
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,840
So you're already seeing redundancy starting to be built into

573
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Systems that are going to be

574
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Depended on navigation

575
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,800
So when we think of the three programs that we just talked about the ANS stoic and Poseidon

576
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,408
And I should point out that you just handed off stewardship this program to a colleague in the Strategic

577
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Technology

578
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,528
Can you give us a sense in each case of what the status of the v20

579
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
So ans is wrapping up

580
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Anuses

581
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Is is transitioning

582
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,488
To the end users to the services in various ways

583
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
And that's a good thing

584
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Stoic

585
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Is

586
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
Almost halfway

587
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Through a

588
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
3-phase program so weird

589
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
We are in Phase 2

590
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
Are the Start program so we've demonstrated

591
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Feasibility

592
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Came up with an initial approach

593
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Generated evidence to support

594
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Support

595
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
That approach

596
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
And in face to wear now

597
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
Implementing that approach

598
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
And and

599
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Doing higher fidelity

600
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Data collection

601
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
Besides just getting started we are

602
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,000
In the middle of what we call Phase 1 of Poseidon

603
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
Just one more question before you lend

604
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
I'm and that's

605
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
What question do you really wish

606
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
I

607
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
What about you that I didn't

608
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
And if

609
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,800
Such a question comes to mind you can ask

610
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Skip now and answer

611
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
So you mentioned Optical clock

612
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,504
Thanks for reminding me I should have pushed you didn't answer that question earlier

613
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
So an optical clock

614
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,880
Is it's an atomic clock and we have atomic clocks today

615
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
Such as a rubidium clock

616
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Or a cesium

617
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,816
Does if there were cesium beam has been around since

618
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
The 50s

619
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
Just a winter mean for a second

620
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,544
Simple way of thinking about these things and then why atoms can be clocks is because there are

621
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,944
Vibrations oscillations associated with the nuclei but rather than the the kinds of isolation

622
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,344
Did you think about it and I are kind of old-fashioned clock with a pendulum I mean something to some ways that's what's going on but it's going on at billions

623
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,440
And trillions of oscillations in what we consider duration of reckon

624
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,048
So in the atomic clocks of today we are exploiting signals

625
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
Emitted by atoms

626
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,888
Hot in the microwave reach

627
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Gigahertz

628
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Level six

629
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
Gigahertz is

630
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
Billion x

631
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Per second

632
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
An optical clock

633
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Is exploiting

634
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,224
Atomic energy level transitions

635
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,272
That have frequencies

636
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
Over 400

637
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Terahertz

638
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Another

639
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Five orders of magnitude

640
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
So that that clock is Optical clock ticks five orders a magnet

641
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Faster

642
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Then

643
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Atomic clocks

644
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
Today

645
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,424
And by virtue that that's more precise time and

646
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
We get

647
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Much improved stability

648
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
Out of that

649
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
Optical clocks today in general

650
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,944
Are about the size of a small laboratory universities have these Optical clocks

651
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Nest

652
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,088
The National Institute of Standards and technology has the world's most stable

653
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Optical clock

654
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
DARPA in the past had a program

655
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,024
That showed by making some trades and size weight and Power

656
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,840
And performance you could reduce the size of that off

657
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Clock down to the size of

658
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
A shoebox

659
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
From a laboratory size download shoebox

660
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,520
Yes but that clock is still ticking

661
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
At Optical frequency

662
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
Another DARPA program

663
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
I showed how

664
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
You could

665
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
Make a very small

666
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
And robust

667
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,576
Device called a frequency comb that acts like a set of gears

668
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
And transfers that very stable

669
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,464
Optical tick in the 400 terahertz

670
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Region

671
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
Down to RF

672
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Radio frequency radio

673
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,656
Then you can generate a timing signal that is used to

674
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Systems of day type 1 pulse

675
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
Per second in megahertz

676
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
100

677
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
So the store Kroger

678
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Is

679
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Integrating

680
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
Those separate technologies that DARPA developed

681
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
Into a single unit

682
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
Such that

683
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,880
I like to say we want to pull out the cesium being clock and plug in the stove top

684
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,904
Clock-in

685
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Your

686
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
Time stability has improved by

687
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
At least in order

688
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
So imagine a clock that is able to keep

689
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
GPS level time accuracy

690
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
For over a year

691
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
With no GPS route

692
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Fastenal

693
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
Thanks for 4

694
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
Give me the flavor of what an optical clock is I know that its complexities go off the charts but I think you gave us his

695
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
Sense of what you up to there so thanks a lot

696
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,880
Nice understand that in in the not-so-distant future you're going to be leaving. You got here in 20

697
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
12 will be leaving this year you've got this amazing sort of skill set in mindset particular fifties navigation

698
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Technologies

699
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,120
The clocks assertive whole range of

700
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
Of

701
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
Of abilities and skills in different areas

702
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,056
Do you imagine that you're going to keep applying that particular set of Interest

703
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,640
In your post. Professional

704
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Absolutely

705
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Positioning in timing

706
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
Are built into so many system

707
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
We have today

708
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
And it's

709
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Because of the success

710
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Of

711
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
GPS

712
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,744
Other nations are building their own

713
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Satellite navigation systems

714
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
As well

715
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
And GPS is in bed in so many

716
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Thanks thanks

717
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
You don't you wouldn't even think about

718
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Are the ATM to get cash from

719
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
GPS is in there

720
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
Electronic trading on the stock market

721
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:11,968
GPS is in there disappointed in that case it's mostly the timing function right cuz you need to know

722
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
When those transactions happen

723
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,040
Agriculture

724
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
Precision agriculture

725
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,112
GPS is in

726
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Power distribution

727
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
City Electric

728
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
GPS

729
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
GPS is

730
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Pervasive

731
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
I want to continue

732
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
To enable

733
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
Systems today too

734
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,704
Provide that same level of positioning and timing

735
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,032
With with capabilities that are redundant to GPS

736
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
Provide the integrity

737
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
Other also going Beyond

738
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Level of position and timing

739
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Florence we get today with g

740
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,784
UPS such that we can enable new capabilities that we can't even imagine

741
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Today if we had

742
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
That much more I can

743
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Time in Memphis

744
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
So sounds like

745
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Exciting

746
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,304
Frontiers out there and I'm sure you'll have no problem pushing on those Frontier

747
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,656
