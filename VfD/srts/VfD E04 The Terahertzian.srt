<b>finding out a little bit about you and</b>

22
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,375

<b>Well, like every red-blooded American</b>

26
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,458
<b>teenage boy I started playing electric</b>

27
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:24,541
<b>guitar back then you played through an</b>

28
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,625
<b>amplifier that used vacuum tubes and</b>

29
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,666
<b>there was some cachet (威望) with the soft glow</b>

30
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,875
<b>of the vacuum tubes and the warm sound</b>

31
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,125
<b>that you get when you play your guitar through them</b>

32
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,208
<b>but being naturally curious</b>

33
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,666
<b>I started to wonder how they worked and</b>

34
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,875
<b>how does the guitar take the motion of</b>

35
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,541
<b>the strings and turn it into an electric</b>

36
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:48,791
<b>signal that led me into studying electro-magnetics</b>

37
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:53,583
<b>ended up pursuing engineering Electrical Engineering as a </b>
<b>career </b>

38
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:57,666
<b>and started working as a government program manager for the </b>
<b>Army Research Office</b>

39
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:01,166
<b>about 15 years ago until I ended up here</b>

40
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,750
<b>let's talk a little bit about some of</b>

41
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,125
<b>the programs then since 2012 that you</b>

42
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,708
<b>have been overseeing and I'm thinking</b>

43
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,666
<b>perhaps we can start with the Terahertz (太赫兹, 10的12次方)</b>

<b>electronics program</b>

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,458
<b>and I'm gonna sort of steal your thunder</b>

46
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,000
<b>slightly here by telling or listeners</b>

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
<b>that in 2014 it garnered(获得) a Guinness world record but I'm</b>
<b> gonna let you talk</b>

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,416
<b>about the program and and what that</b>

49
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,125
<b>superlative(最好的) moment was when you heard</b>

50
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,416
<b>about that record</b>

51
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,833
<b>Dev: That was a lot of fun indeed you can</b>

52
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,750
<b>think about transistors like you think</b>

53
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,833
<b>about guitar strings the low frequency</b>

54
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,875
<b>guitar strings can be heavy and loose</b>

55
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,166
<b>but as you move up in frequency the</b>

56
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,416
<b>strings get thinner and you have to wind</b>

57
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,666
<b>them tighter it's kind of the same with</b>

58
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,250
<b>transistors when you're working at low</b>

59
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,166
<b>frequencies you can get away with large</b>

60
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,291
<b>dimensions and as you move up in</b>

61
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,166
<b>frequency those dimensions have to</b>

62
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,750
<b>shrink(缩小) so in the Terahertz electronics</b>

63
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,583
<b>program we really took that to an</b>

64
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,041
<b>extreme it's like when you're putting</b>

65
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,458
<b>new strings on your guitar and you're</b>

66
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,083
<b>tuning it up and you're winding(绕) the strings(弦) </b>
<b>tighter(更紧) and tighter you think</b>

67
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,208
<b>they can't get any tighter and they're</b>

68
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,250
<b>about to break but you still keep</b>

69
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,083
<b>winding and finally you hit the note you</b>

70
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,416
<b>want it worked kind of the same way in</b>

71
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,416
<b>the Terahertz electronics progress... - so</b>

72
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,958
<b>let me just stop you a little bit before</b>

73
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,500
<b>you say more about the program because</b>

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,250
<b>I'm not sure all of our listeners would</b>

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,166
<b>have heard the term Terahertz and I know</b>

76
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,500
<b>the a) above middle C on a guitar</b>

77
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500

86
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,833
<b>achieve in an electronic circuit right</b>

87
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,583
<b>yes very hard in fact when the program</b>

88
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,291
<b>started none of the performers believed</b>

89
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,708
<b>it could be done and during the program</b>

90
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,541
<b>there were many instances when we were</b>

91
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,916
<b>thinking that maybe we should just</b>

92
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,000
<b>circle the wagons and try to make the</b>

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,125
<b>electronics weren't work better at a</b>

94
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,375
<b>lower frequency but one of my colleagues</b>

95
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,958
<b>Bruce Wallace said that</b>

96
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,375
<b>Chuck Yeager didn't get famous for</b>

97
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,375
<b>flying 85% of the speed of sound so if</b>

98
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,458
<b>we were gonna have a terrorist</b>

99
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,791
<b>electronics program we were gonna have</b>

100
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,041
<b>electronics at work that one terahertz</b>

101
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,416
<b>so everybody found a new knobs to twist</b>

102
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,708
<b>and kept working on it and finally we</b>

103
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,291
<b>did hit that mark. right okay and and at</b>

104
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,416
<b>that time that what and perhaps it is</b>

105
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,166
<b>now you can let me know what the status</b>

106
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,291
<b>is but it actually was the fastest</b>

107
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,791
<b>switching electronic circuit on the planet</b>

108
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,708
<b>it's the fastest linear amplifier on the</b>

109
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,500
<b>planet at the time and still is and I</b>

110
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,333
<b>imagine it will be for some time to come</b>

111
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,041
<b>okay so it took you you know you had to</b>

112
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,791
<b>inspire your performers those groups</b>

113
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,833
<b>that worked on this to to actually</b>

114
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,750
<b>achieve this you went through great</b>

115
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,791
<b>pains to do this why what what do you</b>

116
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,333
<b>get by having a terahertz switch </b>

117
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,166
<b>Dev: There's two things you get from moving</b>

118
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,125
<b>transistor performance up in frequency</b>

119
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,416
<b>1. is you access much wider bandwidths</b>

120
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,708
<b>which is like having a bigger pipe to</b>

121
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,833
<b>push your data through in a</b>

122
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,500
<b>communication system and the other is if</b>

123
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,041
<b>you work on a transistor enough to to</b>

124
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,083
<b>make it capable of working at a</b>

125
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,541
<b>terahertz you have to eliminate(消除) all the</b>

126
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,041
<b>parasitic capacitances(寄生电容) resistances(电阻)</b>

127
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,291
<b>inductances(电感) that limit its performance</b>

128
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,833
<b>and then when you take that same</b>

129
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,541
<b>transistor and operate down at lower</b>

130
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,208
<b>frequencies say in the millimeter wave</b>

131
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,583
<b>the performance of the transistor is</b>

132
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,458
<b>much better you get lower noise better</b>

133
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,000
<b>linearity(线性度) better dynamic range(动态范围) and maybe</b>

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,291
<b>most importantly better power efficiency</b>

135
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,750
<b>interesting so you get this circuitry(电路系统)</b>

136
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,333
<b>that that can switch it a terahertz that</b>

137
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,916
<b>then has additional benefits</b>

138
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,333
<b>just because you've pushed the</b>

139
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,875
<b>technology for it and you can apply it</b>

140
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,416
<b>elsewhere in the electronic space</b>

141
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,041
<b>exactly right so let's let's move to</b>

142
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,375
<b>another program that I guess really gets</b>

143
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,750
<b>back to what we were talking about</b>

144
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,875
<b>before which is vacuum electronics this</b>

145
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,666
<b>one is called INVEST and that stands for</b>

<b>innovative vacuum electronics science</b>

147
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,916
<b>and technology program so I'd love you</b>

148
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,541
<b>to tell us a little bit about the origin</b>

149
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,208
<b>of that program what problems and or</b>

150
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,875
<b>what technologies is it</b>

<b>is designed to create and what its</b>

152
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,500
<b>status is at the moment</b>

153

<b>terahertz electronics program pushed solid-state</b>

154

<b>electronics up to an extremely high</b>

155
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,750
<b>frequency but if you're trying to get</b>

156
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,791
<b>extremely high frequency and extremely</b>

157
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,916
<b>high power at the same time vacuum tubes(真空管)</b>

158
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,375
<b>are pretty much our only option the</b>

159
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,208
<b>problem is that vacuum tubes scale with</b>

160
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,000
<b>operating frequency the dimensions get</b>

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,875
<b>smaller and smaller as you go up in</b>

162
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,625
<b>frequency and so at some point you just</b>

163
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,166
<b>can't build them so the INVEST program</b>

164
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:10,625
<b>is exploring several different areas one</b>

165
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,000
<b>is advanced manufacturing for example</b>

<b>using 3d printing additive manufacturing</b>

167
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,791

00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,625
<b>cavities(腔/孔) in which sort of the the the</b>

175
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,875
<b>frequency generation is occurring really</b>

176
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,875
<b>small smaller than ever before for the</b>

177
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,458
<b>frequencies are interested in the area</b>

178
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,125
<b>the cavity(腔体) dimensions get smaller and</b>

179
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,750
<b>the alignment(对准) requirements get more</b>

180
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,500
<b>critical so if you could build the whole</b>

181
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,208
<b>tube at once you'd have the dimensions</b>

182
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,041
<b>and the alignment in one shot there's</b>

183
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,750
<b>another thrust(推力) in the program that's</b>

184
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,791
<b>looking at modeling because as you move</b>

185
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,625
<b>up in frequency, small variations in the</b>

186
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,791
<b>manufacturing process can produce large</b>

187
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,958
<b>variations in device performance and</b>

188
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,750
<b>you'd like to be able to know which of</b>

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,375
<b>the dimensional parameters is most</b>

190
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,958
<b>important so you need a modeling program</b>

191
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,083
<b>to do that then there are other</b>

192
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,250
<b>components of the tube the cathode(阴极) and</b>

193
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,083
<b>the beam(波束) wave interaction structure (波束相互作用结构)</b>

194
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,625
<b>where we just went out looking for new</b>

195
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,541
<b>and interesting ideas maybe that would</b>

196
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,916
<b>just blow away the current way of</b>

197
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,625
<b>building tubes and eliminate the problem</b>

198
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,125
<b>with manufacturing altogether okay so</b>

199
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,500
<b>let's say the program ends up being</b>

200
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
<b>successful and why shouldn't we think</b>

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,500
<b>otherwise</b>

202
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,750
<b>so you end up having a new kind of</b>

203
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,958
<b>family of technologies where you've got</b>

204
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,541

<b>that are in the millimeter wave region</b>

212

235
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,125

239
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,916
<b>yes that's exactly alright so I feel</b>

00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,041
<b>like I've accomplished something</b>

241
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,166
<b>okay well the primary goal of the</b>

242
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,375
<b>program is to be able to hit a great</b>

243
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,166
<b>magnetic materials with the</b>

<b>knows it loves today if you dive a</b>

<b>little deeper into it we've achieved an</b>

00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,166
<b>incredible degree of integration of</b>

248
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,125
<b>electronic components like resistors (电阻)</b>

249
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,833
<b>transistors (晶体管) and capacitors (电容) largely</b>

250
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,750
<b>because you have a large pallet(托盘) of</b>

251
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,708
<b>materials to work with that have</b>

252
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,000
<b>properties that are relevant to</b>

253

<b>electronic components with magnetic</b>

254
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,208
<b>components there are only three elements</b>

255
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,208
<b>that have intrinsic(固有的) magnetic properties</b>

256
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,541
<b>so it's been very difficulty to find a</b>

<b>way to integrate those with</b>

258
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,416
<b>semiconductor processes</b>

259
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,500
<b>what we're trying to do with the program</b>

260
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,750
<b>is leverage some work that's been</b>

261
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,625

<b>an electronic circuit in a very compact</b>

<b>form factor so let me ask you this</b>

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,958
<b>because I'm already amazed by the chips</b>

269
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,583
<b>in our lives right they can do so many</b>

270
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,416
<b>things they have there's part of so many</b>

271
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,375
<b>technologies what more are you gonna get</b>

272
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,625
<b>by taking small magnetic components now</b>

273
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,375
<b>and integrating them into those those</b>

<b>ubiquitous chips from the user point of</b>

275
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,416
<b>view you probably won't see anything</b>

276
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,250
<b>much different but from the</b>

<b>technologists point of view lower</b>

278
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,708
<b>frequency systems use magnetic</b>

<b>components all the time but they're</b>

280
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,583
<b>large and heavy and tend to be difficult</b>

281
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,625
<b>to integrate so you kind of push that</b>

00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,625
<b>functionality out to the edges of the</b>

283
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,625
<b>circuits and use it in a non-ideal way</b>

284
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,625
<b>so give me an example or two though of a</b>

<b>magnetic components we're talking about</b>

00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,541
<b>well picture a walkie-talkie for example</b>

294
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,791
<b>you've got a transmitter and a receiver</b>

295
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,875
<b>but you've only got one antenna there's</b>

296
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,833
<b>a magnetic component that isolates the</b>

297
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,416
<b>transmitter from the receiver and</b>

298
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,708
<b>connects both of them through the</b>

<b>antenna at the same time if you didn't</b>

300
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,791
<b>have that you'd have to have two</b>

00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,583
<b>antennas now I put higher frequencies</b>

302
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,583
<b>you can still do that but the</b>

303
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,125
<b>performance of the components drops off</b>

304

<b>substantially because they're separate</b>

<b>from the electronics what we're hoping</b>

306
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:52,250

<b>power supplies at higher frequencies</b>

351

<b>to select out the frequencies you want</b>

353
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,958
<b>and the frequencies you don't want.</b>

354
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,208
<b>Ivan: so thanks you know for talking about all of</b>

355
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,583
<b>those programs there are others that you</b>

356
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,500
<b>are also overseeing but we're not going</b>

357
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,958
<b>to talk about all of them now but what I</b>

358
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,416
<b>would like to talk about is these</b>

359
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,958
<b>programs and you as a program manager in</b>

360
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,333
<b>a place like DARPA and what I'm getting</b>

361
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,958
<b>at here is you know DARPA is just part</b>

362
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,666
<b>of the overall innovation ecosystem</b>

363
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,000
<b>you've been here since 2012 you you've</b>

364
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,791
<b>got these programs we've talked about so</b>

365
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,750
<b>you know what is it like to be here and</b>

366
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,500
<b>and how do you think DARPA is unique in</b>

367
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,958
<b>the innovation ecosystem coming to DARPA</b>

368
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,875
<b>is like grabbing the nose cone(鼻锥) of a</b>

369
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,000
<b>rocket and holding on for dear life it's</b>

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,541
<b>a fast moving place that has a</b>

371
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,291
<b>significant impact on the trajectory(轨迹) of</b>

372
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,708
<b>technology for the nation and being part</b>

373
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,458
<b>of that is an incredible thrill(兴奋, 名词)</b>

374
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,208
<b>the idea that you can</b>

375
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,916
<b>come up with a technical idea that's interesting to you</b>

376
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,625
<b>and create a community to pursue that ideas</b>

377
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,625
<b>is an experience you won't get anywhere else</b>

378
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,958
<b>you can take flyer bets on crazy</b>

379
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,666
<b>things like integrating magnetics with</b>

380
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,458
<b>semiconductors and people will actually</b>

381
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,833
<b>soldier up (挺身而出) and tell you how they're</b>

382
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,083
<b>gonna do it right so what you just said</b>

383
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,500
<b>about creating communities is just</b>

384
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,583
<b>something that that you know I guess</b>

385
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,041
<b>I've observed here too and in the short</b>

386
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,166
<b>time I've been here and I think maybe</b>

387
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,583
<b>perhaps one of the most valuable things</b>

388
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,666
<b>that happens here at DARPA which is is</b>

389
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,208
<b>is that you the program managers do</b>

390
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,166
<b>bring together handfuls of research</b>

391
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,125
<b>groups that otherwise probably would not</b>

392
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,083
<b>have gotten together but in getting</b>

393
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,625
<b>together now create and bring bring</b>

394

<b>together mindsets skill sets tool sets</b>

395
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,375
<b>ways of doing ways of thinking that are</b>

396
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,250
<b>unique and and therefore can push into</b>

397
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,125
<b>new technological territory did I</b>

398
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,041
<b>overstate(夸大) things or is that about kind</b>

<b>of right no that's about right it's very</b>

400

<b>commute weekly between DARPA and my home</b>

<b>teleportation(瞬间移动) of course but I don't</b>
