Does company even though it does sound like

37
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,392
Where he served as the Executive Vice President for Global operations

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,720
He also held positions in a slew of commercial space companies

39
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:41,120
Among them SpaceX and orbital Sciences has been in on the design and management of an amazing portfolio

40
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,216

Is initial training for all of the

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
Just came in the form of a master science degree

48
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
Inner Space Engineering from the University of

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672

From Purdue University

53
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,936
That's why I say wow let me say to you Paul Rusty Thomas welcome to the Voices from DARPA

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
Studio thinks Islands great to be here today

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Thanks for having me

56
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,336
Before we get started on your life Adventure on the Forefront of

57
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
Space technology I want

58
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
To let listeners in on something that will not come through in your voice

59
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Sir words

60
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,832
At 6 ft 8 in tall you are among the tallest

61
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,160
People at DARPA though remarkably not even the tallest

62
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,048
It does make me wonder though how you manage to fit into those thin shells when you were on the Purdue crew team

63
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,144
And if your fuel cost when you fly your own Piper Dakota plane

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,264
Higher than they would be if a 5-foot 8-inch guy like me where the pilot

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,104
Well yeah so it does cause me a lot of pain on airplanes

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
These days that is that is true but I'll tell you

67
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
I'll be in tall was great I grew up in Indiana and

68
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
I learned to play basketball and for some reason.

69
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
Because of that song

70
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
BBS x-rays a good thing overall

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
And and I'll take it

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Alright well one of the things I always want to hear

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Programmatic

74
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Who are with me in the studio is

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Where they got their start

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
Send their where their interest

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Just came from

78
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
In going to science

79
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Engineering and Tech

80
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Technology so what to put that question

81
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:27,104
Into you okay yeah great I will I'm aerospace engineers you said and I'd like a lot of aerospace engineers

82
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Growing up in the 70s and early 80s

83
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
Really saw what NASA was doing

84
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
My grade school had a special readers

85
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,832
Where you could go in and see the history of what NASA. Even back in the 60

86
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
And I remember pulling over those in great detail

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
When I was a kid

88
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
The real kick for me became a

89
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,584
A career day that my schools have an eighth grade where they actually pulled my father in

90
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,704
And I realize that my dad a mechanical engineer and his grandpa is my grandfather his father

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,336
A civil engineer I've been doing some pretty interesting things their entire career and they were staying on The Cutting Edge

92
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
Of what was going on my dad work for General Electric

93
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Taking the Plastics industry

94
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
When I was getting big in the 60s and 70s

95
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
Am I grandfathered work for Northwest

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
And putting all your fields

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Never do any Orient

98
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Cathay pacific routes

99
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Through the through the forties and fifties

100
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
He also helped design the the guardian of the airport

101
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
So how'd it had

102
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,887
Two generations of of of engineering behind me and at that career day

103
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
I actually have my my dad was one of the people presenting and he walked through the different types of engineering and

104
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
At the bottom of this was Aerosmith

105
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
I did not know that was an option

106
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
And all the sudden it clicked for me

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
Aerospace engineering

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,575
It's something I could do and I can focus on it and continue on and do what I tell my dad do

109
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Enter the really Innovative idea

110
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
New Concepts

111
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,815
So with that I was in state for for Indiana and Purdue is a great School

112
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
So I can

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Got jumped at the opportunity.

114
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
They're so while at Purdue we had

115
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
Quite a few amazing professors

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
I want of them professor andrisani

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
I would give us talks about

118
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
How

119
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
You could do no better in your career as an engineer especially

120
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,247
If you stay on The Cutting Edge in an advanced technology advanced what Humanity can do

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
The back of my head. Those words and run with me for the last 25 years if I

122
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Kept moving to where is the most advanced technology

123
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
How can I

124
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Help the most

125
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:23,071
Well those sound like two great lines of influence I mean you know what Dad and a teacher like that

126
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,447
And wow have you run with it so one of the things I would like you to do here is to take

127
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
Our listeners on a kind of

128
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
Whirlwind tours you can't really

129
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,383
Dwell too much on any one thing you've done I'm in your CV

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
Is just one of the most amazing documents I've ever read

131
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,295
But if you can take us for a whirlwind Tour on your

132
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Experiencing in the commercials

133
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
Commercial space absolutely so

134
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:53,791
I didn't internship at a small Engineering Services Company and we've got to I got to work on NASA and with with a space shuttle

135
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Back and lay.

136
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
But what really got me going the commercial side was right after grad school

137
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
I got the option to go to Motorola

138
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,031
We're firing up the Iridium low earth orbit constellation

139
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
Proliferated low earth orbit satellites at work cross-linked and providing Global conductivity than our planet

140
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,319
Constellation very large 66 satellites + Bears fill the goal was to build

141
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
1 satellite per week

142
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,463
And launch the entire constellation of of fuel 70-80 satellites including spares

143
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
In one year

144
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,583
Never been done before and to do that we would use a large number of launch vehicles

145
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
And a Motorola

146
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
I never

147
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Design space

148
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
So

149
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
They put all that together and and Batman and 1890s was happening the Motorola had a really good plan

150
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
And they pulled in a lot of experts say pulled in sub subcontractors like

151
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
Rockies radio on Hoover expert

152
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Masseria

153
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Put together the team

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
And we ended up building at a rate of 1

155
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Spacecraft

156
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Every 4.3 days

157
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
We launched

158
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
3 continents are in just over

159
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
In 8 days

160
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,839
14 satellites were launched off all the side like somebody 2 months

161
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,423
And actually before you move on to some more of your commercial

162
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Space

163
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,031
Experience I remember just talking with you at another time when

164
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Impress I think

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
It was on this project the Iridium project

166
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Took you around the world

167
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
To some of the other

168
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,759
Space cultures out there like in China and an in Russia

169
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
So I'm just wondering if

170
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
You can compare and contrast a little

171
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
Better be kind of space cultures

172
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
That's that you have experience being part of the

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Hours here and then witnessing

174
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,839
Are those elsewhere when you get to any other

175
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
Country any other location that's doing

176
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Rocketry or

177
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Spacecraft design

178
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
You really grow in the closet

179
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
Type of engineer

180
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
That

181
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
You can relate to earlier

182
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
The people that do that or the are very similar no matter what culture they come from

183
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
I was very amazed how quickly you can make friends with

184
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
The Russians are the Chinese anybody who was

185
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
Who actually watches we're launching on the proton rocket 7 at a time on the on the

186
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Iridium

187
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
Ever launched into at a time when the Chinese

188
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
I-5 a Time on Delta 2 is out

189
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Atwood remain launcher

190
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
How to Vandiver

191
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
I rotate between the launch bases in California

192
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
Baikonur Kazakhstan where the proton rocket was launched

193
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
Also go to Moscow for Innovation meetings

194
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,615
Over to Beijing for the Chinese immigration meetings in Taiwan

195
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Launch bases are

196
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,967
We was very interesting program and really I found it

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
The Russians and the Chinese

198
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Well the Russians invented

199
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
Roxy as we know it just the same time we did China was coming up to curb they were getting faster at an incredible rate they were getting better

200
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,535
Had an incredible race and I found it both Russia and China

201
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
Their cultures were

202
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Unless analytically an American Heroes

203
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
They were very much driven by

204
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,007
Build test build test cycles and I found it really in the commercial

205
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Space here in the US

206
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
We're so pretty well we do those

207
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Will you move out of the Analytics

208
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,455
Don't spend a year or two trying to figure out exactly how to optimize a problem

209
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,855
The build something that maybe a sub-optimal test it and then use that result to go to the next phase

210
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
Of modeling and use that model activate is that the one thing really really really good

211
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,095
Who died in the u.s. is very good computers and a very good computer algorithms

212
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Analytically

213
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
Predict what it what a rock it would do under structural load

214
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
Or under guidance navigation control algorithms which is great

215
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
But it doesn't really tell you

216
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Everything that could possibly happen during a flight

217
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
Rise of flight actually does tell you that

218
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,551
Before we move off of this little a block where you're describing an international framework

219
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Forgetting so many satellite

220
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,695
Share with our listeners kind of funny experience

221
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
But you had with the Russian team when

222
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
They were trying to figure out what they should act

223
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Actually call you

224
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
I'm so

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,447
When I started working at Motorola we would have

226
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
Every other month we have

227
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,311
Betacular Chase meeting with either the Russian launch Team or the Chinese launched

228
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
So you have one each month

229
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
When the Russians were

230
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
What kind of town or when we go to Moscow

231
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
I will have the stereotypical long table

232
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
What's with all the Russian someone sign all of us on your side in the trance

233
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
When they

234
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Ask

235
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Eminem produced everybody

236
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
They got to me and I said my name is Rusty Thomas

237
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
They stopped the meeting

238
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,071
Will briefly and MSR talking to translators and it came back and said

239
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
Is that your real name and I said well pause my real name

240
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Osborne Paul Thomas

241
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
I need my grandfather's but

242
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
Not since the second or third day been around

243
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
She's been a nickname

244
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,103
At and they and they went back and talked about and they said okay we get it

245
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
Paul Pavel that's a good name we're going to call you Paul

246
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
And I am

247
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,295
What's find some people to call Paul bit most people your Motorola nomias Rusty

248
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
And and they'd end up coming back and saying

249
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,279
Well we're going to call you Paul and the reason is we've discussed it and and we don't have the nickname Rusty here in in Russia

250
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
And we don't feel comfortable with

251
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Calling teddy bear

252
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:51,519
So they decided not to call me corrosion and I was Paul from there at I've been up all on and off

253
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
Since since that time

254
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,431
Smooth working team I want to take you back to that whirlwind

255
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
A tour of your experience in commercial space that I wanted you to do but I took you in a diversion so let's get back to that you said you talked a lot

256
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,511
Then I moved up to Seattle following where is the most advanced technology

257
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Happening

258
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
Seattle in the late 90s was was really happening place

259
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Molottery

260
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
They'd also a new company that was founded

261
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Coachella desert

262
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
Had some money coming in from built Bill Gates

263
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Craig McCaw

264
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
Titans in them

265
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Communication then

266
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Computer Industries

267
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,783
And they wanted to build a global low earth orbit satellite constellation to do broadband

268
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Station call Telugu

269
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
We

270
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Got pretty far into that design

271
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,279
But the technology the time was wasn't quite there miniaturization that as we know it today really wasn't there

272
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,863
And the.com crash of 2000-2001

273
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,935
Made it really hard for us to get that financing so we ended up

274
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
I'm not going forward to that program

275
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,103
I even though we had gotten FCC license for a lot of spectrum and I and it had a really good chance of

276
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Major success

277
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
And it was at its base

278
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
I'm a very compelling architect

279
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,783
I moved from there and did Engineering Services

280
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
In San Diego

281
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
I had a really good time at some of the

282
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Early days of uavs

283
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Predator and Global Hawk

284
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,279
Not to be insulting down there for the early UAV designs

285
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
And then move to

286
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
Orbital Sciences where I got into the governor

287
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
And then after

288
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Keeping a commercial side going

289
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
After the orbital Sciences

290
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
The curb

291
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
I went to space X

292
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
Savage in 2011

293
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
And I worked as the

294
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Senior director for Dragon production

295
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
I building a capsule to go to the space

296
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
So it's been 5 years there

297
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
And I had just an amazing amazing run

298
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Putting

299
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Putting almost

300
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Those capsules up also

301
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
I got to work on the landing legs

302
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
And CNN

303
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Play a good part in the

304
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Historic Landing

305
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Most of those first

306
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Right and just weeks really before this

307
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Discussion we're having now

308
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
Eight dragon

309
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
Captured it arrived at the internet

310
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
For May

311
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Resupply mission

312
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
When you see that we had it how do you

313
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Feel knowing

314
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,039
Intense Pride absolutely that's that was it a turning point in How We Do

315
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,623
How we do space missions how NASA contract

316
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,719
Four four things how NASA moves forward to technology gets

317
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
The Cutting Edge

318
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Develops at

319
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
I didn't can move that technology

320
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Two companies like the SpaceX

321
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Pictures of the world

322
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Who can use that to build a commercial

323
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
And then allowing NASA to move on to the next

324
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
When I was at SpaceX

325
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
We went from doing one rocket a year

326
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
One Dragon every year to

327
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
2

328
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Dl456

329
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Dragons for year

330
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
And and now SpaceX is ramping up to

331
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
2030 +

332
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Launches in a given year

333
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
It's really been an incredible time to see

334
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
That

335
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
Approach to how you do commercial space

336
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,303
Turn on and become a reality and then become a success and it

337
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
I'm really a major

338
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Okay so you served

339
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,263
Told the story already here if you kind of growing up professionally along with

340
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
The commercial

341
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Space sector which

342
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,103
Which is just kind of an amazing thing to think about

343
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
But you then

344
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
Made a decision

345
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,271
How to say yes it when when the offer came through to become a program manager here

346
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,831
I'd like to hear that the sequence of events that

347
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,439
LED you in this stage of your career from that the end of the commercial activities you've been in

348
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
And now here as a

349
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
First European

350
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,655
By chance I happened to an early 2000s be talking to some friends of herbal science

351
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
And they said there was an

352
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Very interesting program

353
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
What's it called Mike

354
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,847
I didn't know much about it it was a DARPA program

355
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,175
It was classified with the experiments were but it was it was

356
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Real I don't know that existed

357
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
The time it was just a DARPA experimental program to do a demo

358
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
Of this technology

359
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,183
And a little was looking for people who had my type of background little bit of commercial

360
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
But also have the right to

361
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Ticket so I could do the work

362
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
And and they brought me out for a three-month stint and I was just going to help do some analysis for that space

363
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
I did some analysis

364
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
And after 3 months

365
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,383
It looks like dark was going to continue the program orbital wanted to keep expanding so they asked me if I would stay on as the Mets

366
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
Manager for the for the design that so I got to

367
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
I got to run the design of the

368
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Of the spacecraft

369
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,599
And so I stayed in an oral for not three months I end up

370
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Upstand for body

371
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
And during that time frame we work through the my text

372
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
The bass trap I got to

373
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Do the design and build

374
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
We actually

375
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,167
How to get through immigration launched it and I went out to Schriever Air Force Base

376
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
As a vehicle engineer

377
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
And got to be on Console flight for

378
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,151
So it was a really good experience I wasn't commercial commercial it was government taking

379
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
Commercial approach is orbital is very was if there's a commercial company

380
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
And and this was experimental process that wasn't

381
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Grit

382
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,647
Performance driven program it was there to prove some key technology that

383
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
We could use in space

384
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
It was it was successful

385
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
And

386
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Is very proud of it

387
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
The results there

388
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
That kind of got me into what

389
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
DARPA

390
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
DARPA

391
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
Step into an area work

392
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Where there might not be a

393
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
Set nyora set

394
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Set a requirements or asset

395
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Funding line

396
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
And say

397
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
This is technology that would really help

398
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
The Warfighter help

399
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
The country

400
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
An insignificant ways

401
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
And and

402
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
And say we're going to prove it

403
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Is it possible that

404
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
The proof

405
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
Is here if we can actually spend two or three years and some money

406
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Actually get a demonstration of a run

407
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,535
Not open my eyes to what you can really do outside of the commercial world

408
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
But still using commercial approaches as much

409
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
I'm so follows on from there and and

410
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
Become a deputy pm at on the G7

411
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
Gsapp program you mentioned earlier

412
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
A geostationary space situational awareness program

413
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,455
Is Air Force program of record now that is doing very well

414
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
It's up in Geo and

415
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
It's acknowledged but

416
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,159
If it'd be very very good capability and and it's doing a lot of good feedback

417
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
From the people use it

418
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
So the GSAT program

419
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Very successful

420
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
And after

421
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,679
Got to the critical design review I happen to have the opportunity to

422
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,007
To go to SpaceX they were just firing up so I already talked about that

423
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
It was it was a wonderful five years

424
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
At the end of that

425
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
I was at

426
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Daiquiri

427
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Doing the operations job

428
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
I'm setting up the augmented reality Global operations manufacturing four-footed what's going to become a revolution

429
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
I'm my positronic realities can be a very

430
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Very big

431
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:38,047
And just a two-sentence description for listeners you might not know what you mean by augmented reality augmented reality is the

432
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
Ability put on glasses

433
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,679
Is that I will augment the information that you're seeing it real information with

434
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,239
With computer-generated 3D graph

435
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
Is that that actually will float in space

436
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
You can put tacks you can put Graphics you put anything you want

437
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
And it was good to be contextualized around

438
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Natural objects in space

439
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,271
Not virtual reality locks you out and you don't see anything

440
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
And augmented reality you actually have

441
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,391
Still see the people in the room you still see all the objects

442
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
But it's adding information and I have seen I think a multisyllabic

443
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
A phrase for this

444
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,607
Software to find holographic light controller that related to itch

445
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
It is in the most advanced versions of

446
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
Of augmented reality and Daiquiri had some of the most advanced

447
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
Holographic light control

448
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Technology

449
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,407
Okay so now I suspicion is

450
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
Confirm that you actually are are going to

451
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Developed is the starch

452
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
Enterprise at some point in your career getting back to how you actually

453
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
We got to do.

454
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
The final turn to get me back as a program manager

455
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Became win

456
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
The concept of the

457
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
The Blackjack constellation

458
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
I did not come up with you is already been formulated by

459
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
Experts here in a little bit more about that right after this great

460
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
Great salt darpet contacted me

461
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,615
I said we're going to go forward with that proliferated low earth orbit architecture

462
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Start to change How We Do

463
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,711
Space missions right now we do space missions with

464
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Very exquisite

465
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Very cape

466
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
Will satellites actually cost a lot of money

467
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
So therefore we can't build very many

468
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
And end up

469
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Low earth orbit proliferated

470
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Quotes that iridium

471
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
With the communications in in the 90s until odesza

472
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
I was trying to do

473
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
And and other companies have taken

474
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
Is a different approach to put

475
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Smaller

476
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Lower cost

477
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
And and something to someone

478
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
Expendable Expendable is low reliability

479
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
The key element is

480
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
Small and lower costs

481
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Satellites at bettering very low earth orbit

482
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
So you can cover the entire Earth with

483
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Coverage

484
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:41,183
And like we said earlier was it six or seven satellites will usually do it to give yourself constant coverage

485
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
And the end DARPA

486
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
Let me know if they were going to move forward

487
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
With the experiment

488
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
To try to move into Augmentin

489
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
What do use x

490
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
The satellites can do

491
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,239
With a Leo low earth orbit

492
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Proliferated

493
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Constellation

494
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,591
When that opportunity meant I came in

495
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
David tok

496
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
And I was a match made in heaven

497
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:07,295
It's not like there's ten thousand people in the world

498
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,695
I really do think in terms of matching terms of what does DARPA wants to do with the and in what these type of

499
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
Constellations can do

500
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:19,327
In the future in my background if it's a really good match I'm a very excited

501
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Be in this position

502
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
This time it's for

503
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,703
Let's talk about blackjack in a little bit more detailed

504
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
Tell me a little bit about

505
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,519
You're kind of the elements

506
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
Of that

507
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
Even before we start that can you tell

508
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Listeners and me

509
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Where the name comes

510
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Sure

511
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,575
The the concept of of the Blackjack is that instead of having

512
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Sensors

513
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
In space

514
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
That might

515
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Come out of one or two or three

516
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Points at the sky

517
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
You could potentially put smaller sensor

518
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Locations

519
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Give the

520
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
Destroyers are the

521
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Surface Action Group

522
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
Commanders of the world or the Army Commanders

523
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Or Airforce anybody

524
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,567
The ability to look over the horizon with a small number

525
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
Of of discrete sensors

526
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
That that actually

527
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
. the sky in some way

528
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
Well if you go to a casino

529
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
And you look up

530
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
You see on the ceiling

531
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
You see all the little domes

532
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,367
Those little dolls real tiny little sensors

533
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
And they're making sure that nothing bad's going on

534
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
So the concept of blackjack is to follow that

535
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Distributed sensor approached

536
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
You see in a casino at work

537
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
You don't have one or two large

538
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Systems making sure that everything's work

539
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
Okay and make sure that

540
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
There's no cheating going on today

541
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
Sit in the car and just just for the record for our listeners we do need to point out the garbage does not get all of its ID

542
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,016
Diaz from Las Vegas but probably more than we should maybe yes absolutely

543
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:47,392
So that the name came from that that someone playing Blackjack would have distributed sensor set around them

544
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
So it's kind of a tongue-in-cheek name but but it's a good name and it gets heavy across from that we give our talks

545
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
What we're doing

546
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,400
So Blackjack is this just as I said a low earth orbit

547
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
Constellation of sensors

548
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,288
That we're going to leverage in a key element of this is leveraging the commercials

549
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
How to talk my my career Independence

550
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
You can do things

551
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
Very quickly you can do things very efficiently

552
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,528
With a commercial approach now that's not to say the government approached

553
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
How we prepare things the past is always bad

554
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,904
But in some cases you don't get the optimal solution

555
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
And you could do things on a lower cost in it

556
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
At a faster

557
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Your schedule

558
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
If you tackle indifferent

559
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
Why so what did ideal Blackjack is it

560
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
Try a different approach

561
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Use

562
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
Low earth orbit

563
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Use proliferated

564
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
Commercial satellite

565
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Lights out

566
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
Especially the buses where we will marry

567
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,336
Military pay loads to those commercial buses

568
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,176
And then start flying a large number of them so you can give that

569
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,504
Proliferated Global constant custody constellation

570
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
Can I say constant custody that means

571
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
The commander wants to look at a given spot on the Earth

572
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,416
You can point the sensor to a spot immediately

573
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Because it is going to be a satellite overhead any given

574
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,536
Give you the word and in a way I hadn't heard before

575
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,352
Proliferated just want to make sure I understand what that means in this framework

576
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Proliferated means mulch

577
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
In the space

578
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
Spread out over the surface of your accept

579
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,848
Any person on the on the ground is going to be able to look up to see if Blackjack satellite

580
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
350 Campos constellations developed

581
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
In the sky at any given

582
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
And that's got into the reciprocal approach work

583
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
That is

584
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,088
If the Blackjack satellite is always going to be able to any point of the Earth

585
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
At any given time

586
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Right so there's there's some aspects of a sort of

587
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
GPS like system in the

588
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,560
But you got many satellites working in a clinic coordinator

589
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Fashion

590
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,144
Delivering amazing kinds of in a data that would

591
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Naughty

592
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,680
Impossible

593
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Otherwise

594
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
Qxt talking about a lot more than the several dozen writer GPS

595
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Talk just a little bit more about

596
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
The various kinds of challenges

597
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
That are

598
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Part of this project

599
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
One of them

600
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,856
Certainly is is producing almost Mass producing very rapidly a lot of satellites

601
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
So you had you talked about your ex

602
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,488
But there's also going to be coordination there going to be command and control

603
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
What are some of these other elements

604
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
But you can talk to

605
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,144
Absolutely so first of all yes you your analogy to GPS

606
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
100%. Is a full up

607
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Consolation

608
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,264
Add a medium or medium high altitude

609
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
With Blackjack window very low

610
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
500 km to 12in

611
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
Arrange that that's just above the Earth's atmosphere

612
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
For the satellites

613
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
And and the trick is going to be

614
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
Building since you're low enough you need more satellites than what I thought.

615
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
GPS constellation

616
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
So to do that you're going to need math

617
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
And do the

618
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
Look at the cost right you're going to need to build them

619
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,632
And I'm very short time scales with a minimal amount

620
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Of assembly integration and test

621
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
And to do that

622
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
We're going to

623
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
Bring it as much

624
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Commercial approaches

625
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
We've had an industry day

626
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
A very positive

627
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Response from

628
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944
From over a hundred thirty comfy

629
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
Signed up for intraday

630
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
And we had overturned 75

631
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
Folks who you wanted to come in and

632
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
And and listen to us

633
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
We believe that

634
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
That approach

635
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
Going with

636
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
Discrete

637
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
Low-cost nodes in space

638
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
Well I'll most Expendable Expendable but almost

639
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
It is going to be a terrible and we're going to use

640
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
That that commercial

641
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,800
And and commoditized both the buses and bring that to impedance match

642
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
The military payload

643
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Still going on

644
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
The other key element today

645
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,480
Yes and you and other two that a second ago

646
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
That we don't

647
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Launch

648
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Hundreds

649
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,136
Or or more thousands of of the satellite

650
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,744
We don't want to require teams of multiple people per satellite monitoring

651
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Right now the Expos

652
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Satellites

653
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Have X

654
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Excellent teams app

655
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
People on the ground who are making sure everything that.

656
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
What satellite does his monitor

657
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
Are you going to analytically predict

658
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Beforehand

659
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,800
What the response of any new strip the difference in.

660
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
What's going to happen

661
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
It's an excellent approach but

662
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,688
Really want to get autonomy into the blackjack

663
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
And when I say autonomy

664
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
I mean how does the mission control work

665
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
How does the resource planning work

666
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
How does the payload

667
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,416
In terms of what it seen working from

668
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Can you move

669
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
It's a raw data down to the people on the ground can you victra

670
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Verizon information

671
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
And contextualize it to what's important

672
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
Okay one of the other interesting things about

673
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Blackjack program to me is because

674
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,032
You're not putting in a multibillion-dollar jewels up there

675
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Large

676
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
Tremendously expensive

677
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Assets

678
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Need to stay over

679
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
There for years and years

680
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,992
Here you can do what I guess much more

681
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Frequent

682
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
Technology refresh

683
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,880
Ice prism some of that can be done through software

684
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
We were always upgrading our

685
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Are various applications on our computers

686
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,352
But this also does give you some opportunity to you know without breaking the bank

687
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Putting up

688
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
I actually new generations of

689
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Bellevue small satellite

690
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Lights and still having them work within the black

691
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
Yeah yeah yeah

692
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
And there's two areas there

693
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Better very important

694
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
And we're going to order Chase both of those

695
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Blackjack first is

696
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,992
If your individual nodes right lower Thor bit your life

697
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Is lower than going entire world

698
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Your

699
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,392
Weight is less and the cost of individual satellite

700
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
So we're aiming for

701
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,464
A non orbit cost of

702
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
6 million dollars

703
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
/ node / blackjack

704
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
That includes a logic

705
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,120
Which means that if you have

706
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,168
The problem with one of those satellites

707
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
It's you can launch another one to replace it

708
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
Slot huge amount of money

709
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
And in the second piece is

710
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Weather

711
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
Ability to do on an orbit over the air updates

712
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
The software

713
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
We're going to put large process

714
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
I called Pit Boss

715
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
Once again going with a blackjack

716
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
Approach right The Pit Bosses

717
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
Rains on each one of the other Blackjack notes

718
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
It's going to have

719
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Teraflop

720
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Class processor

721
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
On it or more

722
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
And

723
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
It's going to allow us to put a lot of algorithms

724
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,704
Sunspace and not only put a lot of algorithms in space to do the work up there with those Edge Computers

725
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
But it's also going to we're going to launch more process

726
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
Hey Billy that we need for the first generation

727
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
Because we

728
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,688
Expect to get better and better with her algorithms and now Grim's typically need more more process

729
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
So if you can

730
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
We talked about I work at SpaceX might

731
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,576
My boss they're also found another company

732
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Call Tesla

733
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,160
And one of the really goldkuhl models of Tesla

734
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,976
What is you have a car and you might come out

735
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,536
And in the morning and it's not an over the air update

736
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
And you have a better car the next day to use

737
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Did the prior day

738
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
Because they've updated alsop

739
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
So

740
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,472
I'm going to follow that type of approach putting a lot of extra

741
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Capacity

742
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,360
For the processor so that as though algorithms get better you get a better spacecraft essential

743
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Free Aloha por

744
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Alabama

745
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
In terms of launching satellites

746
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,552
And I imagine you also have to think about

747
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
End of service when you're talking about so many

748
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Discrete parts

749
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,512
Battery low earth orbit means it sounds like to me that these are going to deorbit in some way or another

750
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Have you given that

751
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,376
Absolutely given that thought in that goes back all the way to the Motorola

752
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,448
Iridium constellation every iridium satellite

753
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,568
Has the ability to deorbit itself at the end of its life it has a

754
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
A small amount of fuel reserves left

755
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,432
Those fuel reserves aren't used for anything else other than a d orbital

756
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,480
And it has enough redundancy and the elect

757
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
Sonic soundboard

758
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
So bad it's hard to have problems with his primary mission

759
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
You can still fire the thruster

760
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
And bring us

761
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
Top down so that approach

762
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,000
Has been proven successful with the with the iridium in the commercial constellation

763
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Are we going to follow

764
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,608
Same same approach with Blackjack and I believe

765
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
FCC filings for Mega constellations

766
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
Communication

767
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
Inside lights will be out there that'll launch

768
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
Even more satellites in blackjack

769
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
They're going to be good stewards I believe

770
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,944
Of of low earth orbit also in and put in the ability

771
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
So I decided light

772
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,296
Ends its operation like or gets replaced with a better

773
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,856
Tech refresh satellite it will immediately

774
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Turn on defroster

775
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
Usually over

776
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
The South Pacific

777
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
Or somewhere relatively benign

778
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,584
These small satellites don't make it back down they burn up in the atmosphere during reentry

779
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,888
I'll make a wonderful shooting stars You Outta nowhere

780
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
And there may be many of them is that you think about him this is amazing to think about just all the peace

781
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Dan Howard

782
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
The program it is

783
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,224
Are there one or two things about it that that stand out in your mind is

784
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
May be particularly

785
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
A reach even we're kind of DARPA program

786
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:23,232
Absolutely soba the biggest reach I believe is the amount of

787
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
Autonomy would like to put on the spacecraft

788
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
I've given a metric

789
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,168
If we lose the ground control that say we have a common problem or this some type of interference

790
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
And the satellites Orange

791
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:38,336
Talkin to the ground I want them to be able to operate at least for 24 hours as a consolation

792
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Talking to each other

793
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Do their systems

794
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
And and and

795
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,248
Managing their resources managed in the mission

796
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
Still providing whatever in defect

797
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
Oriental set of information

798
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
The Warfighter that

799
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
People downrange need

800
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
Without background image

801
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,280
So that's going to be interesting to say the metric is one day but

802
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
But really my stretch goal is

803
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
How to get the 30 days

804
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
Continuous operation

805
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
Without talking to the constellation while it's still performed

806
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Primary mission

807
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
To whoever needs to have that information.

808
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Generating

809
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,384
So putting that in the place is old as a significant Leap Forward

810
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
From the current operation

811
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,736
Since we have an operations control center on the ground

812
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
You sure the satellite health

813
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,832
A safety and emission is being managed properly

814
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
To one where you don't even have a human

815
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
In the loop

816
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
Removed a man

817
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
We go for a man

818
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
Man in the loop command on the loop

819
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Work that.

820
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
The people doing a management

821
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
Are there to make sure and watch

822
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
And adjust priorities is necessary Force

823
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,776
But they're not there to make second-by-second, minute-by-minute decisions I have

824
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Spacecraft

825
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
And what they do

826
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,920
Rats that's a really hard but fair amount of autonomy always with

827
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,760
Human beings there at Shepherds in an envelope in some way also

828
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Absolutely

829
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
So you're a first-year

830
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,136
Program manager typically program manager

831
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
We're here for

832
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,536
Adjust a set several years 3 to 5 I have had some people here in the studio who have

833
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Done several tours

834
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Duty as well so p

835
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Like it enough today

836
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
They come here they do one tour of Duty that go away then come back

837
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
I'm just wondering

838
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,264
If as a first-time program manager

839
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
You're with

840
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
A program of this

841
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Complexity and size

842
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:21,248
What do you think this one program is going to be enough for you to satisfy your your technology interest

843
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,088
And just because it's going to be so hard to do or are you already imagining

844
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
I taking on additional programs

845
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,024
I'm actually already imagine taking on additional programs that goes back to my theme of how to get to the most cutting-edge element

846
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Whatever you're doing your career

847
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,632
Blackjack has to be a major program ugliest NBA

848
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,704
A huge success and it's going to really lead

849
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
A pivot to low earth orbit

850
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
But once you start working in the low earth orbit

851
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,360
The regime and and once a DOD and DARPA starts working

852
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
And putting these systems in place

853
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
I can envision

854
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,248
Many other programs that will leverage this type of architect

855
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
Successful

856
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Come out of blackjack

857
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Once we build this

858
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
Global mesh Network

859
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
Match the internet in space a space arpanet

860
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,488
How can you use it to actually

861
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Benefit the people on the ground

862
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
And I think there's a lot of

863
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
I just want to point out to listeners

864
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
That even though Rusty's

865
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
Is talking about a program like that

866
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:18,336
It does not mean that it is automatically going to become what he's going to have to really jump through a lot of poops and cut its a lot

867
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
If people guessing if that's something worth doing

868
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,968
So this really is it essentially glimmer of the eye that may or may not

869
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
I come to become a

870
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
A program

871
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,904
So so that's what it sounded like you might even have more idea I got a fuse II

872
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,512
I've been spun up with a world of augmented reality on what you can do with light control

873
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:40,096
Holographic light control is an area of of high-end

874
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
Krista me I believe that we are

875
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
Approaching that point where

876
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,544
The Holodeck seller will not recontest things after appearing but the ability for

877
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,104
Systems to transmit holographic light

878
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,224
Phase control the light and projecting the way that you are immersed in reality that

879
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
That isn't real but it seems real because your eye

880
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Is getting

881
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,624
Baby getting fed the same information that would be

882
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
If the object

883
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Was actually there

884
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,000
I believe the type of light controller just around the corner

885
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,048
And there's a good chance it's going to

886
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Revolutionize

887
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
How We Do interact

888
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,168
Computer is an interaction with even people

889
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,496
It in the same way that the transistor revolutionized How We Do

890
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
And I think that's the coming the next five

891
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
10 years

892
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
And I really hope you get DARPA

893
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm moving into the Edgewood listing the potential applications of that

894
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,992
Training just popped into my eye

895
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,808
My name is a huge not just training but

896
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
If you are deployed

897
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
If you have military person deployed

898
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
And you can have a holographic

899
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
Surgery

900
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,328
Show how how to fix somebody in your ear deploy during her very mode area

901
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
You can actually train somebody

902
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
In real time to how to do something

903
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,984
Because I can see it in 3D fight in front of them as it's happening

904
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Wilder

905
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Rejuv Medical

906
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
Training for welders

907
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
Training for another industrial applications

908
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
Becomes

909
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Becomes much more advanced much more

910
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
That they've already done me

911
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
Study showing you can train somebody

912
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,368
Anywhere from 2 to 10 times fast

913
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,672
With augmented reality tools and he's all right

914
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
Light approaches

915
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
If you

916
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Because your brain is

917
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
Program to absorb information

918
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
3D contacts

919
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,168
Much faster than you are with someone talking to you or reading a book

920
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
So when you stop when you see it

921
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
You absorb it

922
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
I think

923
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Training is going to be an area that's going to Revolution

924
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
Another thing is

925
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
Came to my what is

926
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Ergonomic

927
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,200
Turn Discovery so you might have

928
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
The space you want to figure out the best way to

929
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
Arrange things in that

930
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Headspace

931
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
With this kind of

932
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Technology Building

933
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,648
The test out a thousand different ways very efficiently cheap

934
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
That's right one of my early early

935
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,536
Crip moves was that that internship where I got to work on

936
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
NASA projects in we were developing 3D cat

937
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,008
The time in 2D CAD was the standard computer aided design computer aided designer that three-dimensional KitKat

938
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,568
Austin allowed you to mock-up

939
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Engineering parts

940
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,896
God in Evan dufey check

941
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Virtual picture

942
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
Make sure the parts wouldn't interfere with each other

943
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,576
And that was a huge boom Ford it really changed how engineering design

944
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Mechanical

945
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
I believe the same thing will happen

946
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
We start doing this with interactive collaborative

947
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
Tools that allow everybody walk in and see

948
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
What's happening in 3D space

949
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
Without even needed

950
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Computer screen

951
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,680
There's one other kind of Technology project

952
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Does that

953
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
You work

954
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
This represents to me

955
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
How many thousands and thousands of

956
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Of Technology and Engineering issues

957
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Is there are when you're really

958
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
Thinking big

959
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,736
So you also were in on the design of

960
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,016
Crane operator

961
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
For mating

962
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Satellite

963
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Going into

964
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
Too kind of vehicles

965
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Spencer

966
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Components

967
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
Just one of the many many app

968
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,376
So this was an interesting invention we work as two or three of us at Motorola weird the problem we had

969
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,960
It was that Motorola was pitching the ship and shoot approaches base

970
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
Finish it on the production line

971
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
It went into a shipping container sat on the dock until

972
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,664
Where the Russian proton are the Long March rocket Chinese Long March

973
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Or the or the

974
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
McDonnell Douglas Delta

975
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
Another set

976
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Satellite

977
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,344
And that the launch campaigns were going

978
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
The Russians need seven.

979
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
And if that was the case we would

980
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Call

981
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:24,096
FedEx and FedEx to show up at the Sky Harbor airport and we would load two or three satellites at a time

982
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
It would fly into Russia would load them up

983
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:30,496
And would get him out to the launch base and we want to put them on a rocket within a day or two

984
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,568
And and that's obviously not help int

985
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,152
This done right now and it with the salad we were looking for very fast like a

986
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Sometimes very quick process

987
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,736
And to do that we needed to mate

988
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,296
70 satellites are very close to each other

989
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
Accurately and quickly

990
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
So we put together a

991
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
A crane

992
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
I think we called the swing and twist Eliminator

993
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,584
Workshop with mounted to the floor of the Russian immigration Hall in baikonur

994
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
And

995
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Wherever

996
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,936
Every satellite would be brought in vertical state

997
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,472
Attached to this and then

998
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
Russian crane

999
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,336
Normally would swing these around a little bit as it moved in Philly

1000
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
Didn't have any others

1001
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
Neighbors you never get a satellite what next

1002
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
But I'll need to Spencer

1003
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
I was seven

1004
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
Like wedges they were all very close to each

1005
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,296
She had to control the twist

1006
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
Swing

1007
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
We got the point we can meet three

1008
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
Of the satellites per day

1009
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
And have all the the entire dispenser

1010
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
Of seven satellites ready to go after 3 or 4 days

1011
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
A process in Allendale

1012
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
Fueled and be ready to lie

1013
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
Okay so on top of everything else

1014
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
Your crane guy

1015
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,544
So yeah you're working on things that many of us would

1016
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Considered to be kind

1017
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
Science

1018
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Fiction technology

1019
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Fiction though your go

1020
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
Real are there non space

1021
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Technologies

1022
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
That you

1023
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
Just go nuts

1024
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
Don space well I'm going to

1025
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
Day of the arrow

1026
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,464
Without the space let's go to arrow and I do believe

1027
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
That

1028
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
Transport of human beings list planets

1029
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
It's going to get

1030
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
When we're going to be able to move

1031
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,376
At the hypersonic

1032
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
A scale and in the knot

1033
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,984
It's not an area of research for myself

1034
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
But I'm I'm I'm exceptionally interesting I just curious

1035
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
On how we're going to get some of the new technology

1036
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
Tattoos becoming online worldwide

1037
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,016
To the commercial space and how we might start moving people from

1038
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
From from

1039
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
What's a New York

1040
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
Sydney

1041
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
In an hour's instead of the

1042
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
A 12 or 14

1043
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Plus hours

1044
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
I think the

1045
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Very high-speed transport

1046
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
I guess I died the Dozen

1047
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
Hit your mark because you

1048
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:39,008
Probably have to go into space a little bit during part of that flight but I still see some very high-speed flight supersonic

1049
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Hi Supersonics

1050
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
The flight is being an area

1051
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
Pinterest

1052
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
I'm up

1053
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Significant

1054
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Potential

1055
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
In the next 10 to 15 years

1056
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
I think there's some teams

1057
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Kraken

1058
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Fret not open

1059
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
Interserv ironically thinking big in this way to

1060
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
To make the world a little smaller

1061
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,184
Vicente Ginga from any point at any

1062
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,304
That's right Blackjack will give you the mesh Network and communicate it

1063
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
Red Broadband in

1064
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
You can actually move the people

1065
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Give me the next step

1066
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,704
Rusty you are a technology developer

1067
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
You been doing that your whole life but

1068
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
You also have taken time

1069
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
2

1070
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,640
Get into more of the mindset in the setting of The Warfighter

1071
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
The warfighters

1072
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Find a survey

1073
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
Bringing more

1074
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
Capability

1075
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,064
Can you just share a little bit with blisters back

1076
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,416
Absolutely so I've been a reservist

1077
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,464
United States Navy scents

1078
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
2004

1079
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
And as an intelligence officer or I was

1080
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Lucky enough

1081
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
To be selected

1082
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
To go to Nichols

1083
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
Special Warfare Intel School

1084
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,472
And actually went out during the surge

1085
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
Centcom areas

1086
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
Desert areas

1087
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
With the whistle

1088
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
To help do Target

1089
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
And a high-value

1090
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
High-value targeting

1091
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
And we didn't forget for the job we

1092
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
Move through

1093
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,064
Those areas and

1094
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,368
And picked up a quite a few of the al-Qaeda

1095
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
Mid-level operatives

1096
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
And I

1097
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Put put them away

1098
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
So

1099
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
4

1100
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,304
I still I still active I drill

1101
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
A town in a little creek

1102
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Library month

1103
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
Very very important part of my life

1104
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Although it's still as a reservist

1105
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,752
Secondary

1106
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,056
But I also Imagine

1107
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
That

1108
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,848
That booty

1109
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
It's on the ground experience now as

1110
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
The program matter

1111
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,688
Completes a kind of

1112
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
Luke for you that not all program manager

1113
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
I think it does help the area that I think it helps the most in is

1114
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
When you are down range with

1115
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
Special Forces operator

1116
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,744
The amount of bandwidth amount of sensing you can get

1117
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
This amount of communication you can do

1118
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Is very limited

1119
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,888
Are you you're typically moving data to a soda straw

1120
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
And what I'm trying to do with the program manager here

1121
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Christy give those type of.

1122
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Floyd

1123
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,800
Sailors soldiers Marines whatever they are

1124
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
The ability to move data

1125
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,407
At much higher bandwidth and to get data

1126
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,735
From sensors that over the rise I'm not in a sealed organic drone unit

1127
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
Immediately within second

1128
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,831
Back to where they're at without having to go through a ground for

1129
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
So seeing how it's operated

1130
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
When I've been down rain

1131
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
That is really helped shape hell

1132
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
I'm setting up a technology

1133
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
Detroit for the future with our

1134
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,983
What's the rest of you've taken me and listeners on on an amazing tour of you know someone who has been in the apps

1135
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,311
Thickest part of these last couple of decades music

1136
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Evolving

1137
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Space Tech

1138
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Call Jay so I want to

1139
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Thank you for doing that

1140
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
It's really been a pleasure

1141
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
No thank you it's it's been a bad that a great career I'm happy to be a DARPA and looking forward to the next door to get to break down and

1142
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
We're going to be going to cut it

1143
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,719
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us

1144
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,767
I hope you join us again for the next

1145
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Voices

For more information about Paul Rusty Thomas

1148
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,287
The programs he and his colleagues in the Tactical

1149
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Cool technology

1150
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,151
