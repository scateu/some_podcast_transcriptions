00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,740
Still , technology , the internet GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight with operation. 

2
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:26,240
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight , the midst of the cold war , doubt that offends . 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,230
Advance research projects has been a driver of technology . 

4
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,770
Welcome to Voices from darker . 

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,800
A window went to dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,990
My name is iphone a motto , and i'm your dark host . 

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,820
And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio for rebel , for rule , a program manager since twenty four , team in dollars , defence office . 

8
00:00:51,950 --> 00:01:24,096
Throughout her career , fruit has been working on mathematical innovations and applying them in areas ranging from spacecraft control , vibration control and structures , and even to the vaccine problem of quantifying uncertainty in the mathematical models that scientists use to study complex phenomenon like weather and biological process , and the engineers used to design , simulate , manufacturer and upgrade many of the complex technologies important in military and civilian and settings . 

9
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:27,850
Thanks for your first spending some time with me today and. 

10
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,130
Thank you . 

11
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,640
Ivan , good to be here. 

12
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,780
I'd love to start out freedom and learning a little bit about you about your background , education . 

13
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:44,100
Some of the important thing that happened throughout your area , that ultimately let you hear to dark . 

14
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,140
So tell us a little bit. 

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:59,810
Well , let me tell you a little bit about my background , and till you that the july my relationship , mathematics has been a developing one , and I have to say that over the years , it has really tipped . 

16
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:09,270
I was born and raised in iraq , which has a long tradition of excellent , rigorous mathematical and technical education . 

17
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,040
I received my bachelor degrees boarding , applied math and physics from user birthday . 

18
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,810
From then I went the beautiful campus of the university of his concern medicine . 

19
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:31,070
And then I went to brown to get my psd in applied mathematics after getting my PSD, Icame back to uh . 

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,060
Neighborhood is called the california to naval postgraduate monitoring , and spent several years as a professor in the department of . 

21
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,970
And while I was there , I was contacted by a colleague of mine was working in a very similar research . 

22
00:02:46,970 --> 00:03:17,240
She suggested whether I would consider getting a job as a program manager for computer israel mathematics that efforts of the scientific research is , for example , it is all intense , makes you feel basic on the same block as I was not even sure what that is , but having my colleague and friend in a position and watching her what she was able to to achieve was actually an inspiration . 

23
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,020
And that's when I said , yes. 

24
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,530
And how then was did you make a direct connection ? 

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,380
He was dark , I suppose to be APMelsewhere. 

26
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:32,370
The interesting thing was that about maybe couple years into my job with some program managers from top approach me . 

27
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:50,900
And they said , I interested in going in , coming to dark , and and I have to say , if I thought of getting a position there for a server , scary and kind of out of character , I thought the current job would be the scariest thing to do . 

28
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,360
I had become familiar with the research that being supported by dark and dark mission . 

29
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:09,770
And oh , I was having a hard time to see how supporting basic research and mathematics could be of any relevance to what darker was doing and making that a connection. 

30
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:18,120
You certainly have done that with programs which we will talk about it and a little while you really have a discover that it really is a connection between you . 

31
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:29,200
And the programs are adopted before we actually talk about those I wanted to pull back a little bit and find out how you and mathematics became like foreign partners . 

32
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:38,483
And I ask you this , because I can see true for me , i'm sure many listeners that your mathematics just want those bills that from so many of us is , is difficult . 

33
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:42,178
We , we kind of push it away that the earliest time that we can . 

34
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:45,411
And yet you really had this partnership threat . 

35
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,797
How did you develop this ? 

36
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:50,030
What I imagine as a kind of love for this discipline. 

37
00:04:50,560 --> 00:05:04,359
Some are interested in mathematics , so was not actually from the point of view of being interested in abstract , or just because this , this was the way my mind worked . 

38
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:15,080
I was always interested in problems solving , but it was also interested in gaining better understanding into the physical the world . 

39
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:29,960
so I didn't want to become an engineer , even though at the time , seemed like all the smart kids who , with strong mathematical villages would like to go to engineering , or they would go to mathematical 口。

40
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,410
But then I decided to know I wanted to try to become more of a scientist of thinking of physics . 

41
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:54,080
The only thing is that I started as a physics undergrad , but it only took me taking a semester long course in their scientific realized , I don't have a lot of talent that I realized initially come with a lot of pleasure and enjoy spending my time . 

42
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:15,270
So then I decided that actually , what really gives me a lot of pleasure and steady heart is what is actually the more medical aspect of the physics courses , and I found out that , oh , I can , I do very quickly become a double major in polite mathematics , a language physics . 

43
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,940
So that's how it started. 

44
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,307
So I wouldn't interest me about applied math . 

45
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:33,798
Is that in that way of engaging mathematics , you are looking at these symbols , working with these symbols that made many of us associated with math , and you are finding out how they related to the real world in pretty dramatic ways . 

46
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:40,890
One way of making this concrete in this conversation might be for you to tell us about how old you applied . 

47
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,530
A kind of mathematics is a kind of an innovation for which you now have some mathematical energy named after you . 

48
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:55,670
And how is that lead to operational changes with respect to the international space station ? 

49
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,110
So can you tell us that story about the new that math to space station connection? 

50
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:13,000
So the research that are doing during my patient afterwards , have to do with control and optimization of natural systems that. 

51
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,310
Model by a person offensively quiz , I bought the natural system. 

52
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:33,263
A sound waves , for example , control of electric magnetic waves structures or any combination of interaction of these are different physical phenomenon . 

53
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:39,517
So in the case of , for example of spacecraft control is that we are looking at the situation . 

54
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:43,020
Where are you looking at complex known near dynamics ? 

55
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,100
We're in this case. 

56
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,180
So that means little changes can lead to big results . 

57
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,740
possibly. 

58
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:56,060
Even even though the senior engineer system , right , this is not necessarily like climate that you would say , well , be necessary . 

59
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,270
Don't have any control over the initiative . 

60
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:07,490
Random is of the situation we talking about the engineering system that we would like to perform certain manufacturers in an optimal fashion . 

61
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,560
So you are expecting your system in the skype . 

62
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,050
He needs to perform certain manufacturers that would lead to minimize a certain objectives . 

63
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,850
So in this case , you are trying to do it . 

64
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:29,445
Sometimes it means you trying to do it with minimum energy , your minimum feelings of parents , you are depending. 

65
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:39,530
But so listeners can can understand why that's something to go for is prepared on a spacecraft can cost ten thousand dollars a pound pound . 

66
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,670
So you can minimize. 

67
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:54,300
And give that with the analysis , of course , but also cost of , like , in the case of the necessary station , the cost of refueling , it could be a millions of enough that the situation . 

68
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,900
So you really have to use everything in the most cost efficient . 

69
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,913
I love to OPPO manner . 

70
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:08,223
So in this case , for me , I should have to say that the whole success story here , I owe you . 

71
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:20,260
Basically , my colleagues were able to basically get the theory and the guidance that we developed and basically work really hard to to employment and. 

72
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,490
Space station , right ? 

73
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:46,560
And if we would just say simply what the result was , if my reading is correct is that you were able to come up with a way of using certain systems like giraffe scopes on the space station to achieve very dramatic changes like united returns hungry , native relocations without the use of propeller released , minimizing to a great degree , the need for. 

74
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,590
Right exactly ? 

75
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:59,610
And if this would not have happened , had been not come up with up an efficient and accurate way of implementing this arm. 

76
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:12,761
Right and , but , but the actual controls that went to those gallery scopes emerge from the mathematical framework that you are able to develop into this sort of drugs , that line all the way from this most abstract way of thinking is mathematics . 

77
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:13,350
All the way . 

78
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,782
Million dollar , multimillion dollars savings of how you operate the international space station . 

79
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:23,380
Let me assert a one of the miracles of math in this connection to the real world . 

80
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:32,360
So excellence , lets say the way to you in the upper and two programs that you are working on here . 

81
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:42,707
So one of them goes by the equipment here that stands for enabling quantification of uncertainty in physical systems . 

82
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:49,170
And the other one goes by the acronym model that stems models , dynamics and learning . 

83
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:56,800
So let's start with equips , and again , that stands for enabling quantification of uncertainty in physical systems . 

84
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,330
This sounds fascinating . 

85
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:08,520
The idea of quantifying a uncertainty tells about the program what the goals are and what the sadness is not the money. 

86
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:18,340
The goals of the program , after saying a sort of lofty fashion , which is not always my normal state of. 

87
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,640
We have a statement . 

88
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,400
We were just talking about the international space station , and that's pretty well. 

89
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:41,610
Yes , but I do have to say that I had very lofty goals for the program , and the way in my mind I was thinking of the program , and I still do it is to translate , change the way we go through our modeling and simulation . 

90
00:11:42,610 --> 00:12:03,218
Oh , what you are saying , physical world engineering system , we do have a long history , basically , almost all of scientific history of of modelling , physical systems and physical phenomenon , and using mathematics . 

91
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:33,610
And but what I am saying about changing the practice of modeling is , in some ways , taking into account how good or how bad we are as models as some was like bringing such certain level of honesty to our modelling innocence said , we have to consider the fact that it doesn't matter how good we think our models are at the end are just going to be an approximation . 

92
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,520
It just going to be sarah guide for the physical reality . 

93
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:59,445
The fact that in in the process , sometimes we are not quite clear about the , let's say , the description of which we are , what the output of our models are and what the physical world is , the it's going to create a lot of issues when we try to analyze the system as far as physical modeling goes . 

94
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:07,730
Probably one of the most successful stories is basically the navy soak secretion. 

95
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:18,380
So you might apply the number of stock succession , for example , if you want to try to describe how the queen , you point to your coffee goes into that fluid . 

96
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:30,140
And you see the beautiful swords , or it might be the way masses of air in the atmosphere are flowing and intermediately unsufferable that the range they were talking. 

97
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:45,106
Yes , exactly , yeah , so error , you know , basically flow a barrel where , you know , the airplane rings are is basically the fundamental love every space in china at the celebrity decreasing . 

98
00:13:45,106 --> 00:14:05,600
But the problem with it is that you , then you talk to those people who are looking at basically physical flows , fluid flows , and they do still scratch their head , and it still could say that we are talking in certain situation looks like in hypersonic , but it is not at all clear that this is the question . 

99
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Even how would you be talking about ? 

100
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:19,670
You were still talking about fluids , but it's at the scale , and so the physical condition that is not at all clear that this is the right equation to even try to simulate . 

101
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,210
Yes , we do have airplanes that fly . 

102
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,920
We do have any air space . 

103
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,420
The industry has been one of our more successful modern industry is not just twenty century . 

104
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:39,940
It will be even more in twenty years in the future century , but it makes a little worried that some of the work and mathematical work that is being done . 

105
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,360
It's based on certain assumptions that are and physical models that may actually not hold. 

106
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,798
Crack me from wrong , but as you speaking , i'm realizing , well , we have these technology wish lists . 

107
00:14:53,798 --> 00:15:02,653
We want high personnel vehicles and hypersonic technology things that celebrating festival speed of sound . 

108
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:13,490
Were you thinks we've got mathematical equations and traditions , and mathematically roughly in the economic phenomenon that are applicable in designing a hypersonic vehicle . 

109
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,145
But we actually don't know . 

110
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:18,870
We don't know if it's an accurate representation of of that. 

111
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:27,500
In a supersonic arena , this need for qualifying are answering to a lack of knowledge and all . 

112
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,627
So the kind of error and description set up between the mathematical models and physical reality . 

113
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:51,556
And our engineering system comes from engineers themselves , because one of the things is that they are looking right now in situations that the only way they can , that is a certify that is a design , or whatever they build is by using something right . 

114
00:15:51,556 --> 00:16:15,580
And in this case , they'd probably try to do it using well , in certain situation , you can test , and maybe you can , if you do taste some any kind of testing , maybe you can do it , maybe certain components of it , but full testing on the system for examples and play when I certainly have to be done on the entire one is , after you already built . 

115
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:23,890
That's a little too late in order to come up with ways of changing the design or changing the way it's being built , right . 

116
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:31,660
So it would like to be involved in that process as a mathematician and as an engineer little earlier into that . 

117
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:39,140
So the only way to do that , the testing is not going to help festival in certain situation is that it may be too expensive . 

118
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,130
It's too late and sometimes impossible to . 

119
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,877
It's using simulation . 

120
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:59,400
The whole thing of a simulation is based on having a mathematical model and having the simulation tools , like basically the numerical methods and all that , and the computational tools platform . 

121
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,000
So the computers that you can actually do this simulation . 

122
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:10,610
So this is when you see that maths comes in right there , and this is the only way that we can test . 

123
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,756
Doubt these . 

124
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:25,630
These new designs are new that are not a bit , but you have basically the elements of the design so you can at least tested out using the simulation before before you build. 

125
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,810
So I think I heard you once talk about this is almost like a mathematics of honesty . 

126
00:17:33,070 --> 00:18:01,060
Yeah , meaning it is which you and I love the phrase now that you talking about this word of simulation , which is based on mathematics and improves mathematical models operating in the form of computer models of the , but in there , in that kind of abstracted place and abstract , the operation , you're trying to develop a framework with the creeps that is kind of the reality in the man . 

127
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,790
exactly . 

128
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:11,190
And how well is this representing , ultimately , the real world technology that we want to emerge out of this mathematics and model? 

129
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,400
That yes , that's a very nice accusation . 

130
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:28,910
And what is so fascinating about this is that the fields goes very quickly from some may in the beginning , we think some philosophical ha , a rumination about what is reality . 

131
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,710
What is representation of reality ? 

132
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:57,150
What is the relationship of mathematics of physical world , very quickly , two , some beautiful theory , the interesting result that I expect from equips is to see whether it's possible to come up with some common frameworks and common rules that could deal with some of the major challenges within looking at very different application problems . 

133
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:15,697
This is , this is going to be an interesting approaches to to observe and see what results come out of it , because the performance at this point are looking at system as different as possible from each other , from airspace structures to integrated circuits and to chemical networks . 

134
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,830
So we'll see whether something a common love. 

135
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:25,580
Come out of the africa , but so maybe that's a nice queue to talk a little bit about model , the models dynamic. 

136
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:37,130
Program , so there is actually a very nice link between the programming creeps and model one issue that I need to emphasize about equips . 

137
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:50,062
Because right now , a funny talked about it , basically , as you mention , it's about trying to capture or make honesty as part of a modeling process . 

138
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:56,227
But I haven't really told you about the challenges that we have enough in our process . 

139
00:19:56,227 --> 00:20:03,110
And one of the biggest challenges is that the complex for all that we are looking at the complex system we are looking at. 

140
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,800
They are high dimensional when you say high dimension . 

141
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,550
What do you mean by the sounds like as many parts we have to think about. 

142
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:22,280
Right , uh exactly so , so , so a lot of times when we think of dimension , and you've heard that you're thinking about that , there are three physical , and then we have a dimension of time . 

143
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:41,080
So we think our physical world is basically like a four dimensional space time , but the way we are using dimension basically , here is what we think exactly , the degree of freedom are basically the number of vegetables that we need in order to build on model . 

144
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,250
What repent. 

145
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:49,950
Moreover , the robot with ten jones is that the world , I could think that very simply is a ten dimensional problem. 

146
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,910
exactly . 

147
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,330
so. 

148
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,510
But it could be a thousand. 

149
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,000
It could be very cleared out . 

150
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,060
Yeah , exactly . 

151
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:32,379
And the interesting part is that you look at the robot , and you look at the , okay , when I wanna write down , basically , when I am thinking about the , the number of variables or modes , whatever that I can express the physical variable that i'm interested , but at the same time , sometimes when I want to do any kind of approximation , right of each of these ten variables or ten dimension for each dimension , I am actually need additional dimensions in order to move approximately . 

152
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:37,295
So this is like at every step of a modeling here and an approximation . 

153
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,998
We are introducing more dimensions here . 

154
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:49,065
So starting a tendering attendant what we say , interventional system , and they've been , for example , for each dimension , I made another ten. 

155
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:52,225
Well , just it just a simple way of saying , hell . 

156
00:21:52,365 --> 00:22:03,700
Ten dimensions most applies in a robot case that each joint itself has has the three special dimensions and the temperatures of each one has four , so suddenly already. 

157
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:19,946
So sometimes there those dimensions have to do with the physical had relate to the physical representation , but somebody's sometimes dimension comes from a approximation and modeling and mathematical work that we need to do . 

158
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:20,180
so . 

159
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,516
It's , it's an extremely good question . 

160
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:41,830
And I slept what when we talk about high dimensionality , what you are saying , and this is what happens with the systems that we are looking at that representation of these physical systems require lots of dimensions , lots of vegetables , lots. 

161
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:50,100
Hi , dimension and and higher the dimensionality , the harder , the harder it is to compute to put into a computer next round simulation. 

162
00:22:50,140 --> 00:23:01,760
It goes back to how much computing can we do , and people say , well , right now , we do have extremely good , extremely fast and computing platforms . 

163
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,020
And that is true . 

164
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:18,980
And that's why , at this point , we can do computing physical system that twenty years ago was not possible , but the more you do , the higher demand of your analysis tools now about model . 

165
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:26,280
Uh , the model is a sort of an acronym for models , dynamics and learning . 

166
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:36,140
And I would say that the goal of the program is extracting mathematical models from dynamic data sets. 

167
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:45,690
The goal of a program I was so what you stopped when you say , dynamic data said something , a lot of data dynamics makes me think of motion or time that I get . 

168
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,690
That writer , would you want to? 

169
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:58,629
Absolutely what I mean by dynamic data set is a data set that you get from dynamical system , which our system , whose behavior changes respect the time for you for your dynamic system player . 

170
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:04,710
Absolutely , I mean it life is dynamic , is a great example of a dynamical system . 

171
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,670
One of the reasons that I wanted to have . 

172
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:23,570
This program was also against saying that existing tools that behalf of modeling cannot handle us on the complex dynamical systems that we need to analyze . 

173
00:24:23,570 --> 00:25:03,694
We are looking again , very similar , but we're looking , for example , the system , such as whether , you know , if you biological systems , even in general system , like communication networks , or , you know , human social networks , these are all the examples of dynamical systems , but we don't have very good analytical and mathematical models to to express the complex behavior of the systems that if you just look at the data set from something like turbulent floor , it's fascinating because you see these . 

174
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:09,405
These borders sees this horse , this , it is a beautiful pattern. 

175
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:12,858
Learning this is applicable in reverse , but it is also applicable . 

176
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:14,010
And gentleman , exactly. 

177
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:24,260
Exactly , that was so beautiful about these are all these different conflicts phenomena that can be expressed , that when you see it , some communality in there . 

178
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:37,682
And in this case , what we trying to learn is that what are the common patterns that can be learned and basically expressed dynamics of these systems in terms of evolution of these patterns ? 

179
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:39,045
Yeah , I suggest them . 

180
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:43,680
We don't have the mathematical tools yet to deal with the data . 

181
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,980
So people say , why , you know , look at us . 

182
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:55,350
We not only be a data , big data , we also the age of lake on machine learning and all these different ways that we can handle date of any size . 

183
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:05,500
But what i'm saying is that the existing techniques cannot handle the fact that data is dynamic and changes , which is expected time . 

184
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:20,910
And I actually not going back and say , look , go back to the beginning of the dynamical system theory and trying to develop different way of modeling , extracting these models from dynamic . 

185
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,430
It said. 

186
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,090
Give me one example of a phenomenon of a system of technology that cannot really be model . 

187
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:32,650
Well , now that if your model program is successful , will be modeled. 

188
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:42,810
A vast performance motorcycle to start with something that we think we have some grasps both and use the basic as a task case . 

189
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,790
I'm going back again to the classical problem of a basic , turbulent flow . 

190
00:26:47,030 --> 00:27:02,570
My hope is that they can apply the meteorologist mathematical methods that they develop two systems that are much , and the assistance , for example , is the data . 

191
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,160
Did you get , for example , from? 

192
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,880
Never science . 

193
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:15,340
So you're talking about things like how brain signals , propaganda , or how patterns of new relativity associate with the century stimuli , or the way we move. 

194
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:30,240
Absolutely , it could be a data that you can get even from a social networks and social systems , and basically two systems for which we really are reluctant , the proper mathematical. 

195
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:38,090
Modelling that strategies before time result here , I just want to one question about being employed . 

196
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:45,120
Mathematician at a place like dark one of the phrases here , a lot here is the innovation ecosystem . 

197
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:56,010
And what that means is it really is referring to come all the players and all the stakeholders that it takes another go from sort of an idea about the technology to technology that you have in hand . 

198
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,800
That's that's operational in the field . 

199
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,620
So as an applied mathematician , what do you think you can do here , you might not be able to do elsewhere. 

200
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:13,130
I say , darkness , probably the best place to be if you are and applied mathematician , in fact , I just say for your mathematician . 

201
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:26,370
And like to solve problems , one of the greatest thing about dark is that there is a wealth of information , wealth of problems that important . 

202
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:37,530
And I have to say that very , very cool , the coolness factor for problems to solve for a mathematician . 

203
00:28:37,790 --> 00:29:11,570
Here is enormous because you feel that not only your solving a problem that has importance , the second modern impact , as far as you know , you solving important problems and national security , but you also feel like the problems are that in some ways , there is , there is so much to contribute the richness of the problem are just as maybe the biggest driver , a motivating factor for anybody , certainly for a mathematician . 

204
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:47,990
And I just wanted to add that is that , and i've been saying that to my , my friends , to my colleagues , anybody who would listen that why mathematics actually very important to to an encouraging to come , future program managers is that when you are encountered by important problems , and you see that your ideas , the rule you have as a mathematician that not only you try to look at these particular problems , but you try to abstract out and coming with different representation . 

205
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,020
That would you better solution for these problems . 

206
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,640
So you basically see that your ideas are at work . 

207
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,750
I mean , what better satisfaction are they? 

208
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:15,150
Well , freedom , it's been a little like for me to talk to you about your love of mathematics is coming out here right now , and to get some sense of of how mathematics that is have that role in the umbrella innovation ecosystem in a particular here at the dark . 

209
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,370
So I just want to thank you for spending this time with us. 

210
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,380
Thank you ever . 

211
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,370
It's been pleasure. 

212
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:27,880
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with freedom , and I, Ihope you join us again for the next Voices from dark .
