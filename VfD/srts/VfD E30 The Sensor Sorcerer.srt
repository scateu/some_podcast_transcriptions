00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:22,154
Stop technology , the internet GPS in the column of your hand on the most operation , and technology is a driver of our times . 

2
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:30,990
Since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war in DARPA , the defensive ADS research projects has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:39,370
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window on the darkness , core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,429
My name is iphone amount on your dark a host today . 

5
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:59,779
I am pleased to be talking without your john book , a program manager since twenty seventeen in agencies microsystems technology , we are recording our conversations from our respective homes as we do our parts to slow the spread of covered nineteenth , the pandemic disease caused by the crowd of our source . 

6
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:04,060
Two , this is also why you might hear ambient sounds like trucks and sirens and birds . 

7
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:14,750
John brings his technology visions to dark up on detail from the air force research laboratory , space vehicles directorate , acquirement air force base in new mexico . 

8
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:27,160
There , he had a research team developing a tonight clocks , a ton of time transfer for secretion applications and ultra precision measurement techniques for use in the global positioning system , other space . 

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:43,560
His research interests include the development of next generation sensors for pushing the state of the identity , for example , remote detection and frequency synthesis methods to enable PN, PNTis *** , speak for positioning , navigation and timing . 

10
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,950
John earned this pitch in physics in the university , virtually. 

11
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,240
John , thanks for joining me . 

12
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,250
What are the bigger thanks for inviting me to do this? 

13
00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:04,246
Also , I know that one of your interest adopted is to reduce the complexity , costs and size of PNTand other techniques , and to make these usable outside of labour , tories settings , and we'll get to those when we speak about your programs . 

14
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:09,071
But first , I like to hear a little bit about where your interest in science comes from . 

15
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:13,510
If your parents were scientists , repair the amazing teacher , just what is about twenty two? 

16
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:21,843
I think it really started in the youth that , as I suppose it does for many people to sort of a natural curiosity in the world . 

17
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:25,930
And as I grew up and kind of discovered , I was pretty good at math . 

18
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,816
I think every person has a good or bad experience with this . 

19
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,965
Mine was positive . 

20
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:39,922
And one thing LED to another , and I went to college and a professor talking to taking physics one or one for a general education agreement . 

21
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:45,901
And I did really , really one thing like another in here I am , I can sort of call that that went . 

22
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,815
I will say one little thing along the way . 

23
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:55,310
It turned out that my , a great grandfather actually was a physics professor at the college that I went to know . 

24
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,690
I knew this a little bit going there , but I didn't really discover this until I was . 

25
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,170
So it turns out that of my great grandfather with a physicist name johnny . 

26
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,090
Here I am , this is his name and doing the same thing , which I was amazing circle there. 

27
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,085
It's the bird dynasty and physics , so that that's really a copy of history next to the school you went to . 

28
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:20,496
So you work at the air force research laboratory in current . 

29
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:25,425
And so my guess is that you knew about DARPA quite well even there . 

30
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,020
But how is it that you've got to die ? 

31
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,520
Booking manager has a how I got the dark story . 

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,180
So what's? 

33
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,210
When I was in graduate school , we were funded . 

34
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,230
I was found as a graduate student by daughter and said , that was my first exposure to it . 

35
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:48,714
The pressure was overwhelming to perform , but it was really rewarding to have some direction to go on and not to sort of float in the english world of questions you might ask . 

36
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:50,163
And physics are in science . 

37
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:55,920
And I saw that kind of when I get interested in being participant and sort of the dark of mission , get all that . 

38
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,870
I think that stake with me . 

39
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,313
Now I want to air force , as you said , and it doubt there are many folks government that helped double with more context for the problems that there have been . 

40
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:08,823
So then I helped not rule for quite a while before being asked , join the ranks . 

41
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,000
And I was very excited. 

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,382
Okay , and just wanna backtrack a little bit too , that earlier , I think you said the involvement is a graduate student . 

43
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:16,524
And we said , that's right . 

44
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,340
What was the program? 

45
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,350
It was called the guided , both einstein . 

46
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,080
Khan said in a foreign program , which is a mouthful , to be sure. 

47
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:38,870
And what really what we're talking about are tiny in a sort of fundamental particles like atoms that are put into a certain conditions so that they all are sort of like one micros topic want an object that you can manipulate this , that I get that kind of. 

48
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,012
That's pretty close to rate . 

49
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:50,920
It is a strange thing that it turns out that the eyes , diana and the physician both figured out that you , you could under certain conditions , would make this way . 

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:05:03,110
They need to be very cold if you can cool particles down to a certain temperature in parliament of box , they would insert a behaving like individual particles being into each , yeah , that they would add more like a super particular . 

51
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:11,220
We all can adapt together and call her fashion the most normal way of talking about this is , I was coming out to say , we are talking about . 

52
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,090
This is a comparison to the laser . 

53
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,350
You have a light bulb . 

54
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,830
You know how that works , and you have a laser pointer , and you , people have experience with those who implemented the capital or whatever . 

55
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,784
So that sort of the difference we're talking about yourself , normal particles , and I guess they've been in two children . 

56
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,470
I believe one kind of physics . 

57
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,180
And then if we do this BCconversation , they act more like a laser . 

58
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,830
So it's a whole different set of rules applies that level . 

59
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,120
We will reach glory at a time. 

60
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:47,440
The journal , we want to secure it in two , talking about your programs , two of which you inherited and two of which you are going to be rolling out . 

61
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,910
Or are , let's go to the inherited programs . 

62
00:05:50,910 --> 00:06:06,716
First one is called the atomic clocks with enhanced stability program or aces , and one is actually much more multi celebrate program known short as ambient , but a long form as atomic mechanism of her for biological imaging in earth's native to win . 

63
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:12,927
So let's talk about both programs , starting with asians and and so what's the technology goal basis ? 

64
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:16,190
And how would you describe the status of the program? 

65
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:25,462
So it is , is , is trying to make some of the world's best time clocks and to a package that is actually useful . 

66
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:36,517
And you know , this is a long history , actually darker , trying to do this as a program called suicide crystal , maybe fifteen years ago , trying to do the next four hours earlier . 

67
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:43,741
Thus , the chip scale tonight clock , so to a little more self event , it was trying to do that was really successful program . 

68
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:45,274
And I , you can buy sea sex . 

69
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:48,684
This typical time of collapse in a variety of thanks . 

70
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:58,285
Just mentioned a few of the users share , so automatically general , the main user of them is , is what synchronization visible . 

71
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:02,067
What is the synchronism things like GPS, GPS. 

72
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:07,119
The global positioning system is entirely funded on these atomic clocks . 

73
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,038
It went for them . 

74
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:09,646
They wouldn't work at all . 

75
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:26,450
There are also backup for a lot of information technology systems , things like financial markets , data , data centers are all these things when a lot of data is moving around requests in conversation , you find a tomato collapse in all those cancer. 

76
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:35,697
Right , okay and unseen to most of us is just just the role that autonomic clocks play as you change everything from GPS all the way to to the financial transactions . 

77
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:38,430
But so getting back to assist the asset program . 

78
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,580
Yeah , again , what's the technology goal ? 

79
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,450
And how do you describe the status of the. 

80
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,360
But so there's a whole solution of atomic clocks that are out there . 

81
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:56,875
Some are pretty expensive , and you will not see those except specialized circumstances , and some are very inexpensive , like the justice . 

82
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,536
Galaxy collectors is rotary and expensive . 

83
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:04,076
But the think you find it like finance networks and GPS systems . 

84
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:15,712
The question was , could we make something as good as that , but at a sizing costume and power low enough that you could actually start thinking about putting them more places . 

85
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:32,970
And so let's deal with the program to try to make an anthony collector you could still buy , but it will cost you seven thousand and fill up a good chunk of of your real statement and save up and develop a talk communications cannon and replaced . 

86
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:41,920
It was something that was more like the size of your fist or millions , and then you guys are putting them in radios , putting them in their planes , putting on a matter of places . 

87
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,897
So that's a gold program to to do that . 

88
00:08:44,897 --> 00:09:04,583
Is , it turns out every part of these best atom o'clocks that you could buy has to be managed to rise precise dramatically , and that will be enough , and we need to go to the laboratories , whereas some of the best atomic clocks are made and learned some new techniques . 

89
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,333
Leaders are calling being one of the english . 

90
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:13,490
Just participants are talking about cold , cold particles and and try to implement those . 

91
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:24,960
It also , it makes us small , so it's a pretty big system challenge of lots of pieces being made small where we are in the program , where we are actually towards into the problem . 

92
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:32,140
And I would like to tell you when I took the program over , it seemed like a very , very difficult challenge was had at the beyond us . 

93
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:46,442
I think it would be unlikely that we would have that for your programmer , so we would succeed at the level we have , but longer holds were about six months out to dinner the program , and we have program types , and they work . 

94
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:47,429
And it's amazing . 

95
00:09:47,429 --> 00:10:05,860
It is each little compounded , and there is a little bit of a of a dry story , but there are all kind of amazing when you think about them , vacuum pumps and special lasers , and just just all kinds of little pieces , this has been made to fit in there , but they work , and I think , pretty soon will have asian clocks that. 

96
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,610
It is , some people will be able to buy . 

97
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:18,322
Maybe you can just say a little bit about what this does mean when you can mean your choice and make more , more affordable technologies that have been too big or too expensive to use . 

98
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:26,300
And I am thinking of just even the way GPS became a military rise , and and is now in all of our fans , something the job also had a role . 

99
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,980
So what happens when we can take , you know , the time of clubs and put them into gadgets they. 

100
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,846
So I have not been able to go before . 

101
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:44,495
Well , let's start at the GPS system because that next part of the most important place to start the , you know , a lot of people maybe not realize how important GPS actually is . 

102
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:50,596
It's in practical , everything writers that would make your mobile phones really work as well as they do . 

103
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:53,760
It makes our electrical system work as as reliably . 

104
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,660
It's , you know , even to the point of right now . 

105
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,414
I don't have to realize this , but the best farming equipment , and actually most of our crops now are dependent on GPS . 

106
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:09,250
They actually recalled each one of the seats were exactly reduced to make a cinema. 

107
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,660
And so they can go back to that sea , gratefully into precision farming , precision fertilizer in position . 

108
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,670
Application of water were needed to be amazing. 

109
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:25,629
It's amazing , and so GPS is everywhere , but what you might not realize is that if something would happen to GPS , you know , it could be a mammy problem . 

110
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:40,480
There have been several instance of that new york books , basically in the system have been discovered to a natural system problem , some , some way of solar flares have been famously started about it . 

111
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:54,433
Spain very disrupted , and so what I have , and if we didn't have GPS was all those things that depend on , it will always certainly be flowing and not have that time or the location information , and it would be very bad , I think . 

112
00:11:54,433 --> 00:12:01,313
So over , for example , how would overwork , or you're right during work if there was no GPS for a day , wouldn't work at all . 

113
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:02,846
It's an important problem . 

114
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:21,218
So the main thing that absolutely the main thing that is that my affordably making a clock at this quality , those kinds of systems that leads those are truth , can put these o'clocks backup in there , and there are systems we know we're planning for on the bad days on day , but that they would be a little less bad . 

115
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:24,540
Now we could have some reasonably priced collapsed in. 

116
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,853
right ? 

117
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:28,771
And just because we are talking about dark here , which is part of the department of the fencing . 

118
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:38,912
And we should point out that , of course , one of the concerns and a driving concerns , and we leave GPS becomes available to the military services in the assets that we have to depend on them , right ? 

119
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:49,500
So this is one of the drivers were trying to come up with alternatives to GPS that can kick in their european factor in absolutely some of the recent GPS system becomes unavailable. 

120
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,430
That's right , organized asia's clocks . 

121
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,244
They are , first , of course , but if we can manage , that , does not think you are seeing in in commercial use all over the place too . 

122
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,980
I say one of the most important places you might see this . 

123
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,060
It is in our soil and infrastructure . 

124
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:10,490
So it is a reason all of our phones , if you actually prepare phone is about the opportunity , and it's all typed back to GPS through your cell phone to our own . 

125
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:20,960
So at the same thing , if we can make achieve enough that telecom companies wants me a bucket , putting AAreally nice time keeping unit in their base stations in the towers and so on . 

126
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:31,310
Now , awesome , you have a much moral based technology communication system in case of something happens , but also they can make the systems even better . 

127
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:41,260
Right , there's a problem , you know , past five g sixty , whatever is out past that might utilize the timing that these clocks gave the systems more . 

128
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:48,517
So , so , you know , really have a talk communications companies sort of argue outside , like leaning into the timing precision . 

129
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:50,588
They could buy a reasonable price . 

130
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,660
They could be really begin changing. 

131
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,930
That's because it would help them piece together many more packets of information coming in all different times , because I can time snap those so accurately. 

132
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,176
That's right , you're trying to spend very accurately , and it's really important for things like data hand off the festival , driving around . 

133
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:11,444
It's actually had amazing when you think about it , you can drive in your car now . 

134
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,190
And the most part , your call doesn't drop . 

135
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,477
Where are you going to eternally go into a bridge ? 

136
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:17,134
No problem . 

137
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:24,585
And yet that's why is that it was because of those data packs of things rounded between between different towers all the time . 

138
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:30,320
And it works similar into powerful techniques , synchronized and and just different , different. 

139
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,570
Detail activities . 

140
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,010
Now let's move to the second program that you inherited in this was from a former program manager , robert , like work . 

141
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:45,799
This one is called atomic magnetos matter for biological imaging in earth's native train or ambient for short . 

142
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,520
That's two eyes in there . 

143
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,240
What's that program about ? 

144
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,961
And where is it it in ? 

145
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,190
So in the end of. 

146
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,010
As a magazine , it's a management program . 

147
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:04,260
And so first question is asking for what is the magnitude , and it's simply a device that measures magnetic fields . 

148
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:16,300
And you might ask , why would we want to ever handle such a device , but it turns out that lots of things had a magnetic moment through them are like a permitted language . 

149
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,160
Does university of a strong one that can be used to find them . 

150
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,440
So you see this all the time . 

151
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:39,010
So , for example , you see people using a metal attackers to find , like jury on a beach as a classic example of someone using some of the negative properties of a device of the story of the object trying to find to find it , even though it would be difficult to. 

152
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,180
Otherwise , although usually the finding. 

153
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,690
Bottle cap misery is , so you have it an important problem , and manufacturers just already . 

154
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,670
So the magnetic field made by the object can be actually large enough to find . 

155
00:15:52,390 --> 00:16:12,960
The promise is so many things that have a magnetic associated imaginative field that they cannot collaborate each other up so it can be very easy to get lost in all the noise made biological objects that mention the earth has all magnetic field that is actually quite large and scale of any of these things were talking about yet to attract that off . 

156
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,660
And so let's hear that the program and earth need to rain . 

157
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:36,450
So the problem we're trying to solve here is , how can make a manufacturer that sort of automatically , you're intrinsically removes that background field and can separate out all the that you from different objects , so you can really hold in on one thing that you care about. 

158
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:54,027
One of the potential applications that has caught my attention is in using these new kinds of magnetic tools as measurement instruments for the brain took to sort of look at the magnetic fields that are associated with all of the kind of movement of electrical charges in the brain . 

159
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,300
What we can say about that. 

160
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,390
So that's right . 

161
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:09,600
The , it's not just permanent objects that he says anything that makes a current so that your brain does that you have nervous circuits in your brain that are constantly firing , trying to sort out the law around you . 

162
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,255
And those currents make many fields , and the many fields can be detected . 

163
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:17,872
They passed right through the score and to the outside world . 

164
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:33,630
Now you , you might imagine that you might , those currents are really , really small , so actually detecting the middle field associated with them is pretty challenging , especially if you get this big earth field trying to wash all of that out the indian program as well . 

165
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,080
The first things were trying to do this . 

166
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,090
It's just a really hard . 

167
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,960
Problem is a very small metic field argument in a number . 

168
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,150
It's a honest scale of about ten film to test. 

169
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,130
Samples that small , let's stand to remind the fifteen of something. 

170
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,665
Turn the minus fifteen of something . 

171
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:55,350
And to put that perspective , that is about so earth's magic feels about a hundred micro tesla . 

172
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,857
So we've got about the lesson . 

173
00:17:57,857 --> 00:17:59,184
What is the matter ? 

174
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:03,860
But twelve , because the manager , too , would get to keep the cultural in order to see this . 

175
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,510
That is a really , really hard problem . 

176
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,770
How do you measure something small on the face of something large ? 

177
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:23,279
So we were trying to legislate , measure these tiny manufacturers and the way we want to do that is , instead of measuring a many field itself , we will try to measure the gradient , automatic field . 

178
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,837
So instead of measuring the raphia direction , measuring the difference between two manufacturers to reckon . 

179
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:40,980
So the idea you put one manufacturer may be next , you're brain , but it has at your , your skill and the element , tomorrow's a lot of fuel inches away from that , which doesn't sound like a lot . 

180
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:51,830
But I insist in space enough to a sort of measure the separation between what your brains doing and what the earth is doing , and subtract us to and give you back a signal list , hopefully. 

181
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,086
What your brain is doing . 

182
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,637
I remember talking to rubber . 

183
00:18:54,637 --> 00:19:08,780
Let's work about some of the potential biomedical applications you are like , potentially helping to monitor what happening in the nervous system during medical procedures in the weather that some kind of neurosurgery , or , I think , really discussion you mention. 

184
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,810
Concussion monitoring , that's right . 

185
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:18,251
The brain is sort of famously difficult to understand and end make any kind of reasonable measurements of , especially in real time . 

186
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:20,844
And we have cats , gangs and things like this . 

187
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:26,500
But do you want to know something about an injury happening to the brain of real time ? 

188
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,340
That's very difficult to find . 

189
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,230
So let's the kind of thing we might try to go use this for is real time concussion monitoring . 

190
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:43,550
You actually , maybe we all see if the narrow activity your brain is changed from what it was the day before . 

191
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:50,007
So a football player might have a very fast ability to see if they've been concussed . 

192
00:19:50,007 --> 00:20:01,664
And if we make it more important than they could do it out in around the side of the field with the earth's field , constantly trying to wash out that there will be one of the we want to do is in the military . 

193
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,662
We want to do this too far for , say , soldiers . 

194
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,827
They were exposed to an explosion of some kinds . 

195
00:20:05,827 --> 00:20:06,992
It's sent to the same problem . 

196
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:09,490
How do you know if that soldiers okay , that could continue? 

197
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:28,693
Just in a more general sense , and just bring me briefly on the assembly , it pushes science whenever you can develop a sensor that just is more capabilities , more sensitive words , more accurate words , tapping into a signal out there on the world that other centuries have not been able to do you open up opportunities for more discovery , right ? 

198
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:35,480
And so I would think these kinds of mcdonald's coming out of ambient might also survivor us. 

199
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:48,990
That's right , it means it's a tool not just to explore magnetic fields or some particular problem , like concussions , but it's a means to see our world with a different sort of abilities . 

200
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,030
And we had before . 

201
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,510
And this is really fascinating thing . 

202
00:20:52,510 --> 00:21:02,028
So we , we are particular problem , and we were looking at , but the larger picture of of , how can you understand in the world around us ? 

203
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:18,177
And anytime we can expand our capability to do that , scientists everywhere and all kinds of applications , engineers , and so we'll find a way to make the best of that and discover new things that make new types of applications capabilities . 

204
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:28,780
So that's really , really exciting parties , figuring out how it happened to that page , then hearing accuracy and and sensitivity these , these kind of sensors can not. 

205
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,420
Can give us . 

206
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:37,530
So we've spoken about the two programs that you inherited assets and ambient , but you are in the process of rolling out to other. 

207
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:44,478
Programs sure , so the , the first program of it was briefly mentioned as the atomic photonic integration program . 

208
00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:51,250
He added , basically , the problem is for these really high and column sensors . 

209
00:21:52,310 --> 00:22:05,410
The existing labor tories , did you look at these things in someone's laboratory at university say you'll instant see this large force of optics and mirrors and lasers , and just all kinds of stuff . 

210
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:15,940
And it's amazing , scientists can do it for all that , but it takes a small army of graduate students to run all that in the symbolic and lot of money , money from taxpayers , mostly too to build . 

211
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:26,527
So the question I had was , could we figure out a way to fabricate the equivalent sort of device that does all that stuff ? 

212
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:40,717
And then we have a means to more quickly iterate on different design concepts to expand the state of the art and also a faster offering offered from a laboratory to a natural , practical advice . 

213
00:22:40,717 --> 00:22:45,317
So , for example , asean ambient would be examples of the kind of problem action . 

214
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:51,590
So could you just want to fabricated the standards you just making a more copies of it more quickly released ? 

215
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,039
No , so much such a word . 

216
00:22:53,039 --> 00:23:01,250
So you're combining fatalities and electronic and circuits , another kinds of devices into a quantum , trying to make it all at once . 

217
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,590
And so if we could do that , I will just imagine how much faster we could go if we could do that instead . 

218
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:17,424
So that's an automation , you know , for us in a deal deal , if we saw something that was really going to make a big impact to our national security , we can actually do something about that relatively quickly . 

219
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:18,830
So let's let's go to. 

220
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,780
Right , okay , thanks for showing that . 

221
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,870
And then there is the second program we rolling out to tell me little about. 

222
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,098
So quebec is another manufacturer program . 

223
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:29,555
It saw this , this , we were talking about . 

224
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:32,504
Environment is in the idea of tournament . 

225
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:32,750
and. 

226
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,800
And so I get them just before you go to the description for something like this. 

227
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,850
Quebec stands for the column imaging of vector electronic creation and emphasize victor , because that's what the key question is . 

228
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:59,980
So these manufacturers that we made in ambient , they are skilled amanda towners , so for for them , initiated with that means that the magnetic field , the authors of actor , you can see this field , but he looked at iron filings around , like a , like , a permanent mag . 

229
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,886
Maybe some pictures like that . 

230
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:12,260
Those are showing you the field lines that can occur around themselves since a little bit of a field , and imagine it is a little of an invisible field . 

231
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,720
And if you try to measure that the magnitude of that , any point you really get in part of the information . 

232
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:27,801
So instead , the question is , let's make a victor management , they can measure the three different or flag or components that magnetic field . 

233
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:32,125
Victor explains , they say , and they will make those into a smaller way . 

234
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:39,700
Imagine that religious , and then you can measure something called that you copy , and a magnetic field of actual beneficial . 

235
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,340
Did you copy in cancer , but to copy an answer , sir , is the mathematical or speaker . 

236
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:51,460
But it's a majority of three by three majors , or each component of the is a derivative of electrical component . 

237
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,047
Would respect to a different direction of component . 

238
00:24:55,047 --> 00:25:05,170
So , for example , the delivery of domestic field in the extraction was respect a translation in the white direction would be the middle component , say that magic. 

239
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,170
Okay , and so what i'm gonna actually have to ask you to do that is maybe translate that. 

240
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,460
If you succeed , what's the capability to do , so , what are we talking about this right ? 

241
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:44,061
So there is a magic , right once you have that tensor , you now have all of the relevant information about the magnetic , you'll do to say a premier nan , and with all the information now , this quarter and background field problem is no longer a physics lesson , any more to mathematical lesson is in question , what algorithm can I use on that methodological object to deduce information about the architect looking for ? 

242
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:53,920
And that's very , very powerful , because now you reduce the sensing problem into a computation problem , very easy computation promises to relate at three major magic is not very complicated . 

243
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:03,510
So with that , we hope we can make a very general manager that can see almost anything we have to really make a big impact on the ability of neglect . 

244
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,680
Tomatoes to build a final minute field with objects looking for , as I hope it is to the general plan for every name of tomorrow. 

245
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:18,601
Can you concrete is that either an innocent military technology , technology , space for civilian technology , space where that can make a difference ? 

246
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:19,200
Let's say. 

247
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,300
You are a civilian . 

248
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:36,304
What is decreased for the moment , and you , you , you have a well ahead that maybe you , your company built has been in the ground in half fifty years old , and you don't aware of this , you know , then a field , maybe , you know , if you've got that far , you get a map somewhere . 

249
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:41,432
You say , okay , that the well had I needed to attach to you to do something is somewhere in this . 

250
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:47,828
This , this handwritten field , as a very common scenario , I am a pipeline could be pipeline , something like this . 

251
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:50,930
Yeah , okay , I want to go find and have been covered with a long ago . 

252
00:26:51,330 --> 00:27:02,270
Now you have this unfortunate prompt , just like the person trying to find the hearing on the , on the beach , you have to get take a mangoes on the do you can try to find the involved . 

253
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,681
ironic . 

254
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:04,731
Pipe says , as a nice management field . 

255
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:13,234
But if the systematically , you know , a few inches over the ground may be surveyed the entire field , trying to find that welfare , but we've quarrel . 

256
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:16,261
Imagine how to do that if you are just in range . 

257
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:26,350
And so instead of pandas surveyed the whole field systematically and do a big analysis on the whole , management should take days , if not longer to find . 

258
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:35,340
Now you go out to the field of your kind of clothes if you measure your imaginative field , and it tells you there it is , and you go there find it . 

259
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,940
Now you're done . 

260
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,100
Could you actually put them on a drawing that actually is a good question ? 

261
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,550
That's exactly how they actually do it . 

262
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,520
They had dropped megacities from drones and do the surveying that way . 

263
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,990
But it does very long time . 

264
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,900
Nor did you do that. 

265
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,106
John , in an email exchange , you wrote something that really intrigued me , here's what you wrote . 

266
00:27:53,106 --> 00:28:04,789
I like to make the point that quantum sensors can observe electric , magnetic and inertial forces , or gravitation more accurately than anything else , at least in in laboratory laboratory skills . 

267
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:13,867
And then you said , when you really think about this in compasses , every part of our world , because all about human experience is governed by these forces . 

268
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,140
That's amazing to me . 

269
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,688
I love thinking about new circumstances . 

270
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:27,037
This way gives me some sense of why we go about it , but we've also been measuring electrical , magnetic inertial forces without some of the sensors you have in mind . 

271
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:31,210
So what are we gained by building one term sensor is like the ones who are pursuing. 

272
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,688
It's all about noising . 

273
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:35,151
Sensitivity may be an accuracy . 

274
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:44,644
You know , the original sort of sensors or devices or mechanical clocks , are just sort of a special cases where it is sort of the oldest right at pendulum clock . 

275
00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:49,380
You see that on the wall , and you know , kind of that number of accuracy is more of a display piece . 

276
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:57,040
Why is that all we replaced that mechanical device with an electrical one and logical component ? 

277
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,320
Where is that ? 

278
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,100
All , of course , will be a hospital in your rest watching , that's , let's wait better from an across point of view . 

279
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:20,060
And this is influenced true for , for , like , save a manufacturer , you can make a management with a permanent management on , like some kind attention , right and make an mechanical sort of negative , like a campus actual issue that says the first accomplishes the manufacturers of mechanical one . 

280
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,860
So that's all . 

281
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,140
That's great , but going to our logical systems . 

282
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:45,621
And finally , now to a quantum systems is really just about improving the accuracy and sensitivity of these kinds of so the wise , that , well as it's simply because that in the quantum world noise and it sort of errors are just the physical properties are driving . 

283
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:49,600
Those sorts of mechanisms are just a lot . 

284
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,240
So the and their noise properties are unable to to making the best advice , as we know how to make . 

285
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,610
So it in every field . 

286
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,930
Luca said , a luxury gravity of magnetic . 

287
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:07,226
We don't get a quantum of nuclear force measurement system yet , but I imagine what could make one in the future . 

288
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:17,955
But the royal economic analysis , because of this inherent accuracy that based on this industrial alone so long , maybe a story that trying to figure out why exactly that is . 

289
00:30:17,955 --> 00:30:23,280
But that's the fundamental reason is that the quantum devices , the noise properties that. 

290
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,251
Logical organic ones . 

291
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:28,350
So you can reiterating something , but feel free to elaborate us , free flame . 

292
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:48,100
And again , what's so exciting to me about , that is one of the , the new technological opportunities that these kinds of sensing devices would allow , but it also the takes away our otherwise might be a blindness to certain kinds of phenomenon that are out there , but we don't see them because we don't have the essentials that are good enough to detect. 

293
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,050
That's right . 

294
00:30:49,050 --> 00:31:01,085
I mean , if you , you know , take a little volume in space in your house , or you know , some world , anywhere else in the universe , the fundamental forces are playing a little violent . 

295
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:06,512
Meanwhile , there are what it feels there , the magnetic fields there , there is gravity . 

296
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:11,550
There are four times moving through that space that in a result or radio waves . 

297
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:24,081
It's all there , and our eyes are just special versions that are eyeballs of biological sensor measuring article fields to watch the special case and watching the field in a animals have named towners . 

298
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:31,767
Don't introduce them to take a navigate around the world that takes one time to figure out that even as possible . 

299
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:46,180
But this fundamental forces govern everything so for us to build a peer behind the current and satisfactory to see more and more of what's everywhere around us and understand that bill reproduce that we can all agree or were saying . 

300
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,490
That is , I think the ultimate sort of ability to see the. 

301
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,330
Well , that was great , fascinating way to think about you to move in the state of the art of sensor . 

302
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,830
So thanks for sharing out that now we are running at times . 

303
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,520
I wanna ask you one of the question , which is , what question do you wish ? 

304
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,490
I had asked that I did not ask in a very such a question . 

305
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,750
You should ask it. 

306
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:29,570
I have a question horizon , you know , the question is , why would climb devices be more accurate , and I say , accurate , because sensitivity in being out of the world that really a different question from knowing what you're seeing is truly what the world is gift showing you like that . 

307
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,960
We can agree on the same thing . 

308
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:42,140
And that to me , as I should even more powerful still , it's easy to maybe imagine making more sense of devices like you see more signal . 

309
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,440
I'll have less noise , but for you . 

310
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,200
And I did not agree with that . 

311
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:57,180
I have to do anything in advance that our devices see the same thing means that we can also build upon our mutual measurements and collaborate more easily . 

312
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:04,220
And that's really powerful to have , you know , accurate measurements of the world around us that we can all agree on . 

313
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:18,797
And so quantum devices are especially good if that there are more sensitive tools and that's useful , and whether also more accurate in the reason is because most of these things are based on adults , not all but those in every adam , exactly exactly the same . 

314
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:18,992
try . 

315
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:25,838
You can't manufacturer something to be exactly the same about how hard you drive is always manufacturing train challenges . 

316
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:34,513
These lines were using items , every single items , exactly the same issues has some hydrogen , and attack is the exact same hydrogen that I had in my tech . 

317
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,340
And so we can , it means for growing upon our measurements. 

318
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:46,830
It sort of like the ultimate reference by which we can all agree on what we're seeing , and what maybe the numbers from our instruments are telling us . 

319
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,820
May you succeed it . 

320
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,550
All of these , these efforts adopt , and then beyond that . 

321
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,640
So I just want to thank you john , this time with me. 

322
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,170
Well , there was a lot of fun . 

323
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:03,840
I hope it turns into something that people really can be kind of learn from it and see a little bit more about doing. 

324
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:18,050
Thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from darker thanks also to bend , celebrate in town shortage for their partnership in producing this program .
