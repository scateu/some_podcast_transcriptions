Technology is a driver of our time

Technology

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
Welcome to

Their job

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Redefined what

17
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
What is possible

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,216
My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your dork

19
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Host

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
And today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio Blake bextine

21
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
A new program manager in DARPA's biological

22
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
Technologies offer

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,248
He arrived in March of 2016 from the University of

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,528
Texas at Tyler

25
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:59,392
And he brings into DARPA particular love for the entomological kind Among Us

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
Insects that is

27
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,000
And he is betting that a combination of insects and genetics

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Techniques

29
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,352
Can open new Pathways to protecting the crops we depend on

30
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,912
From both natural and human perpetrated

31
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Threats

32
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,800
These are things like droughts and storms unintentional introduction of invasive species

33
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
Unintentional

34
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Release of plant harming biological warfare agent

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
He just rolled out his first project

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
I called insect allies

37
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
Which is challenging the research Community to develop

38
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
Plant protective viruses that insects

39
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Working at allies with us

40
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:37,792
Can deliver efficiently to threaten plants and bestow protection on them in a single season time frame

41
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
That can Stave off the

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
The thanks Blake

43
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
We're coming to the studio and spending some time with

44
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
That's great to be here thanks for having me

45
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,336
Before we talk about the insect allies program let's talk about you your background

46
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
And the

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
What brings you to

48
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
I came to DARPA because I saw a fantastic opportunity for my research

49
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Community

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
The DARPA mission is

51
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
Unlike things

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
That I have done in the past

53
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
Because the DARPA mission is to look at

54
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
High-risk high-reward

55
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
Projects that could benefit

56
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Humanity in

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
Acer that 2250 year time frame

58
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
And it also gives an opportunity to do D risk

59
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Some

60
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Programs and some projects

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
So that they can act

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
Play come to widen and

63
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
Sia

64
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
See you soon

65
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
So when the opportunity to come DARPA

66
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Presented itself

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
I thought it was just

68
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Awesome chants

69
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
Do some really great science and

70
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
I was encouraged because I was asked to think about things that

71
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Traditionally weren't funded very well

72
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,144
That I think the women just suck you for a second cuz you said went when the opportunity presented itself

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
Of course it didn't present itself somehow that

74
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
That happened

75
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,336
I knew somebody or you you heard about an opportunity in opening so how how did you

76
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
Actually yes sure so I was at a meeting and I had moved into an administrative role at the universe

77
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
First day of Texas at Tyler until we have an event

78
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,904
Every year we come to DC and we get to meet program managers and I actually talked

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Call Jeff Lang Who is the

80
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
Director of biologic

81
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
Call Technologies

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Set the time

83
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,096
And I wasn't sure that darker really had any interest in agriculture

84
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
So

85
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
But he was such an interest

86
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
The person I wanted meet talk to

87
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,776
So I talked to him after he gave his presentation

88
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
I said I don't know if we have any overlap and what were interest

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
And but I would love to work with you at some point you said well actually

90
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
We're looking to get into

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
You know

92
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,088
And that sort of started this journey of

93
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,160
Seeing if I fit with the kind of mindset that

94
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
We have a DARPA

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
Which is

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
You know these kind of difficult technologies that need to be developed

97
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
How that could benefit Humana

98
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
And so it was

99
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:53,472
It was good for Tyler you were a professor biology but you also need another hat on

100
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
Which was the assistant vice president for research

101
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Technology transfer

102
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
Right so

103
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
So those are the two things that that also go on a DARPA

104
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
There are similarities there's

105
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
You know the people that you work with

106
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
And you're directing a team to try to

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Achieve an objective

108
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,392
And so we're definitely doing that and working in agriculture

109
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
It has a

110
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
The professor

111
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,047
You spend a lot of time where you go out and you think about the technologies that are out there in the

112
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,631
You know genetic-based molecular base things that are happening

113
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
But you'll have to marry that with

114
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
The reality of situation

115
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799
That's when you go to Central America and you walk in a potato field

116
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
How you start to realize that

117
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
Technology is great

118
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
But how do you get that technology to the field

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
That's actually get it too

120
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
To the finish line

121
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,343
So we'll talk about that with the insect allies program in just a month but there's one more thing I have to ask

122
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
That's because

123
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,231
When you read your bio on on the dark web site Mill

124
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,583
The last line is very intriguing it says that you were

125
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
On the Discovery

126
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
Channel reality TV show called tethered in

127
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
2014 so I just I just have to hear this

128
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
How did that happen what did you do with and

129
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
We were insects

130
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
To start off I am interested in Science Education

131
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,295
And so I like the idea of putting a positive spin

132
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
In science not just the Bowtie wearing

133
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Geeky professor

134
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,719
You know type person as the

135
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
Scientist but instead somebody that

136
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
No kids could aspire to be a

137
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Good strong normal

138
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
Person and so there is an opportunity that came up to be

139
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,287
Yeah on a reality show and the idea was that

140
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,103
When you're in a survival situation

141
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
People that are alone don't do as well as people that are

142
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
Paired with somebody else or in a group

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:46,623
And so this took it to the next level where I was literally tethered with a 6-foot

144
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
I cord to another human being

145
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
And being that it's reality television

146
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
The promise was that I was the scientist

147
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
And I was actually paired with a shaman

148
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
And so we had very different ideas about how the world works

149
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,775
That's all through the episode we had to learn to

150
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
I work together and get together on something

151
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
We actually became very good friends we survived

152
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
Don't want to give the ending away

153
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,271
Have I'm sitting here today so I must have worked out okay everyday

154
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,111
But I'll tell you that that experience was 100% real

155
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,743
They don't give you food they don't give you water so we had to boil all of our water where to find the food that

156
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
Could sustain us

157
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
And we didn't do really well I was in Alaska

158
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,935
At the end of the summer so there just wasn't a lot of food around

159
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
And

160
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
We ended up

161
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,847
At one point that logical aspect of this we ended up

162
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,943
Finding a dead moose in the middle of a sandbar on a river

163
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
And

164
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
I decided that

165
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,599
I had to have that credibility as an entomologist so

166
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
We scooped them out of their cut them off and we ate

167
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,767
Carcass maggots out of out of a moose

168
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,863
Well okay that's actually might be a nice segue then to talk about

169
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,983
Are your new program insect allies those maggots where your allies out there helped you survive

170
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,591
Talk about the program here at DARPA what it is what's the program all about and what

171
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
So my broad interests

172
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
AR

173
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Sustaining agricultural

174
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Capabilities

175
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
So as we move forward

176
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,671
In the future when we're going to grow our population to 10 billion people in the neck

177
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Twenty two

178
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
50 years

179
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
How are we going to sustain the food so

180
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,887
7.3 billion now so were talking about in that period of time and I

181
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Free ride

182
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
And our traditional agricultural approach is great and does does a really good job of

183
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
Sustaining food supply right now but

184
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
Forward-thinking what are we going to do

185
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
And a future to innovate and and make things better

186
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,647
And so insect allies really comes out of that born out of that wear

187
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,999
We want to utilize insects to deliver genes in plants

188
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
That could benefit

189
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
The plant previously

190
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,631
Capabilities were only in tissue culture

191
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,007
And that meant that you had to grow up those plants after genetic modification

192
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
And then you only find out if the genes do what you wanted to do

193
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
After you've gone through this sort of long pants

194
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Process

195
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,551
In a world where drought and threats from insects and pathogens are always around

196
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,135
How can we actually protect our plants in the fields where they are

197
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,999
And so this mature plant transformation idea came about and then

198
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
At that presents a second problem

199
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,399
How do you actually get the genes into the plants where you want them delivered

200
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
And so that's where the insect allies come about

201
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Insects

202
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
Insect vectors in particular are very good at

203
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
Moving

204
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
These pieces of

205
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,919
Genetic material into plants

206
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
Very efficiently and effectively

207
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,039
Why couldn't we use that natural scenario

208
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
To actually move these genes in the plants

209
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Positive character

210
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
So that's what we want to do we want to use insects

211
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
To deliver genes in the plants that will benefit

212
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Right now

213
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
What are our up

214
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Options in case

215
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Crops are threatened somehow

216
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
By a pathogen

217
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Or some other threat

218
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
What would we do when an app

219
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Well currently what we do is we try to

220
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Contain the outbreak

221
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,967
And so what that usually means that we have to destroy the crops that are in fact

222
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
And

223
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
You know if you

224
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,367
Don't think too much about the situation that's just you burn some

225
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
Unicorn fields or Rogue some trees in an orchard

226
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,791
But the reality is if you

227
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
Ruin that seed source for the next year

228
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
You also impact the next year's for

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
And the next year

230
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,519
And so it's not a small problem to have one of these in basic problems come

231
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
And then go into a slash-and-burn mode

232
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
What to eat to get rid of the disease

233
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,711
So if we could actually recover those crops very quickly

234
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
And we could stop those eminent threats

235
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
Then we wouldn't lose production

236
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
I mean you almost sounds like a little bit

237
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
Like a medical model I mean if I go into 2

238
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Doctor's office

239
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
That's because I'm not feeling well

240
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Well I might have

241
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
I might get some antibiotics and

242
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
In a week I'm feeling better I mean in some ways

243
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
It sounds a little bit

244
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
Like that because your time frame here

245
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
Saw the threat to

246
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
How to make OVA plant

247
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
You know better within very short time is that

248
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,151
All right. That's exactly right and you know it a good example of

249
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
That's where this technology could really benefit would be

250
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
In a

251
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Tree

252
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Orchard type situation

253
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
Mission in Florida right now they're dealing with Citrus Greening

254
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
This is a bacterial pathogen that is transmitted by an insect and

255
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
Causes trees to decline rather quickly

256
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,607
And the answer is you need to remove the trees and if you find out brakes

257
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
The disease you need to get rid of the

258
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
And so entry crops

259
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Do you actually lose those trees

260
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
4

261
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Several years

262
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Because trees take awhile to

263
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,735
So those threats are are very bad so if you could actually

264
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
Turn on genes that allow them to

265
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Survive

266
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
How that would be

267
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
Okay because we are here at DARPA defense Advanced research

268
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
You're generally is a 1/3 of a national

269
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Security angle on

270
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Our project

271
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
EXO

272
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
What is that angle here for in technology

273
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
Well there is really too far

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
So the first idea is that we want to protect our domestic

275
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,431
So if there was a threat that came in Weatherby environmental something like drought or

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Flooding

277
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
Or if it was past that was

278
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Released

279
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
Accidentally or

280
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Or on purpose

281
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,743
Would want to be able to handle that challenge so that we don't destroy our food so

282
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,327
Because there's a lot of evidence that shows that

283
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Unstable Foods

284
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Supply

285
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
Leads to unstable

286
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
And we definitely don't want that

287
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
That kind of leads to the second part

288
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
Which is international

289
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Food safety

290
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
In

291
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
Unstable regions in the world

292
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Food stability water stability

293
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Are things that lead to

294
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Even less stable

295
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,831
So if we can have a hand at the beginning of that problem

296
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
And provide sustainable food

297
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
2

298
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
These population

299
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
I think that that

300
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
That definitely is a Nash

301
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Security concern and

302
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Not something that

303
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
We have the ability to

304
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Address now

305
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
Okay let's dive in just

306
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
For a little while

307
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
On

308
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Biotechnology

309
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
You're pushing me to several

310
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Components

311
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
2/8 week but we've got the insect allies

312
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
But they're they're going to be the ones that are going to deliver

313
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Innocence the

314
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
The threat reducing

315
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Agent

316
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
A virus that you're going to

317
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Baby talk

318
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
What about it

319
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
The end result

320
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Components of insect allies

321
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,791
How you're going to maybe move that the state-of-the-art

322
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,423
That's what's broken up into really three areas the virus so taking a virus at in

323
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,495
Why do people think of viruses only in a bad context

324
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
But in reality viruses

325
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
Can be benign they might move genetic

326
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Material around and

327
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Yunnan dangerous

328
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,247
Swayze and so what we want to do is run identify viruses that

329
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
I have very limited negative

330
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Facts on on any host

331
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
And then

332
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Remove any

333
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Possibility of naked

334
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
And use those hazard

335
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Shuttles to get genetic

336
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Material

337
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Placed into the

338
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
And so we're going to use insects which are

339
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Very good

340
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Movers of viruses

341
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,031
If you select the right virus and you select the right insect

342
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,359
I can be a very specific relationship so

343
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,711
I will have the opportunity to safeguard when you say specific

344
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
If if there's a certain

345
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Implant that is threatened

346
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
It will

347
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
Go to those plants specifically antifreeze

348
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
10:20 of the species around hopf

349
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
They would ignore

350
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:53,791
There are generalists that will feed from a lot of different house plants those aren't the insects that we would select in this

351
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
Are we want to select insects that

352
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Have a very specific relationship with

353
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Maybe a single species

354
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
So

355
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
If used in this way they're not going to go feed on everything that's out there

356
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
So it's a very specific

357
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,199
Okay maybe to make this concrete can you imagine a unit potential Center

358
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
A specific crop that has a specific threat

359
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Onnit

360
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
And

361
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Then what kind of virus you might

362
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
Devise to treat it how you would get that into an incel

363
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Mitigate

364
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
All I can think of a lot of ideas

365
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,959
That well but I think what we want to do is ask our our performer Community want to go out and ask the research

366
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Community

367
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
What are these major threats what specific relationships do they see that can be utilized in this way at 2

368
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,991
This is very open program and we're going to ask the research community academic

369
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,807
To come to us and tell us

370
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
What problems need to be addressed and what are the players

371
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
Okay so rather than specifying a

372
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
This point you want to keep this open and

373
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
Isn't that what you maximize art of the creative

374
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Full potential of your

375
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Performer Bass

376
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Face the research base

377
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Right eye I know so many people out there and Academia other that have great ideas I want to give them a chance to come

378
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Come in and tell us what they need

379
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,591
Need to address that way we can speak a little bit generally though about some of the molecular

380
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
Or tools cuz I think probably what

381
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
One of the things

382
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Gives you such strength in moving

383
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Forward with what really isn't ambitious

384
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
His program

385
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,063
Is because we really been seeing some new remarkable

386
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
What kinds of molecular

387
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
Atul maybe can just talk about one or two of those

388
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
But our listeners a sense

389
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,631
Sure they revolution in molecular biology has been based around the 2012 finding

390
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Crisper cast 9

391
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
A new utilization of that tool

392
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
And just briefly an odor that's a mouthful

393
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
One sentence or two of that what that

394
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Should have done

395
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
So crisper cast 9 is a molecular tool that allows you to edit the Genome of a host and it doesn't have it

396
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Specific way

397
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
So that

398
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Cuts in the genome

399
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Are based on a

400
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Couple of letters

401
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
That's very specific where it will go so

402
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,023
Traditionally when you've done genetic modification you end up

403
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
How to putting it into the genome

404
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
And hoping that it goes to the

405
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Right place

406
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,983
These new tools allow us to be very specific and and where it's play so it doesn't interrupt

407
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Change that

408
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
There are needed

409
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,871
Okay and so so that means that that there's all kinds of threats after

410
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
If we know something about the genetic basis of those

411
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
Then we can use a tool like crispr cast 9

412
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Going very specifically

413
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
And maybe do a kind of genetic fix

414
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
And that can happen in in in a single season

415
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
And thereby

416
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
A new way of

417
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Food supply

418
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,119
Write a lot of these Gene cassettes that we would use to solve

419
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
These problems are

420
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Already being looked

421
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
And a good example would be flood resistant rice

422
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
That's

423
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
That's out there a suite of genes is known Rida sweet of genes that would allow it to

424
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
Surviving difficult

425
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
Situations there's the same type of Technology that's being found

426
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
For high salinity

427
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
Drought resistant drought

428
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Tolerance

429
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,071
And so if we could actually figure out a way to put those jeans into the crops that were interested in

430
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
Then we could get through those bats

431
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Situations

432
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,727
Alright so this this sounds like a great idea we're going you know our population key

433
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
It's going up maybe we're going to reach 10 billion

434
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
We're going to want

435
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
Abundant and safe food supplies

436
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Thing to do

437
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,783
But this is just only one way you are interested in the human insect relationship

438
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,879
But you have some other ideas I think about how well our partnership with insects might

439
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
Expand me if you can

440
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,047
Yeah so I've also been interested in alternative protein sources

441
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
And so I have a

442
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Program

443
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
India sbir program

444
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,519
And that svr that.

445
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
We're actually looking at

446
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
Delivering high protein sources

447
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
From insects

448
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
But also

449
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,015
Using technology to improve our ability to do that so

450
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
One side of it might be too

451
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,415
Used technology to manage Pest and pathogen

452
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
Problems in insect Colony rearing

453
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,607
So could we shutdown viral infections in these colonies that usually cause inside

454
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Claps

455
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
So we talkin about the the bee collapse issue for Mor ryde and there's a whole host of

456
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
Viruses that cause that same problem in other insects

457
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Species and so

458
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
In

459
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,991
Crickets for example which are probably one of the most popular

460
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Edible insects

461
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Producers out there

462
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,231
There's a similar virus that causes collapsed their colonies so if you were one of the companies that was doing this

463
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,607
An invasion of the virus might cause a complete collapse of all of your

464
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Livestock

465
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
Small light socket

466
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:56,383
That's so and then we can go the other direction and actually utilize these insects to also deliver

467
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Anita

468
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,503
Nutrients like vitamin A vitamin C vitamin D

469
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
A whole host of

470
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,623
Five different ideas are there there's really no lack and ideas of what it could

471
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
The prettiest butt

472
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
We could actually develop insects

473
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
Edible insects into a

474
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Realm where not only can they feed an Asian but

475
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
They can also deliver

476
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Additional

477
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Resources

478
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,727
Now have you already practice what you seem to be preaching here which

479
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
To say that insects might be

480
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Comfort of the pantry

481
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,615
So have you eaten absolutely

482
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:33,759
And you know it's it's funny I realized that people have an aversion to this there's a new version of this in my own family

483
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
That's why I understand it very well

484
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
However 80% of the world

485
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
Eats insects as a stable protein source

486
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
And so

487
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,535
You know the Western World were kind of an oddity where we don't utilize the

488
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
This sad

489
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Opportunity so

490
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Again

491
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
You know there's great sources of protein right now

492
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,727
That everybody enjoys if you like steak

493
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Like if you like chicken

494
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
And if you like all these others

495
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,127
Thanks but again we get to a point where our population continues to rise

496
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,223
We're going to need to have alternative sources so we're really thinking into the future

497
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Remembering it

498
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
The early out of the conversation you did mention

499
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
I thought you found those when they were with maggots

500
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
Are maggots is in the moose

501
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,279
So among the various insects that you Pride somehow I imagine you try crickets

502
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:23,679
Where where do they stand with maggots great where they not as good as something else you know honestly the mag

503
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,031
I guess were relatively tasteless but I cooked them with a little bit of

504
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Different

505
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Locally sourced

506
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Alaskan Fireweed

507
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,735
So they were delicious they it actually took on the flavor of what you cook them with

508
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,367
Blake is there a question that I should have asked you that I didn't or just

509
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
That are you wish I hadn't if so

510
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
You can even mascot

511
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
We should have asked me

512
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
Why I'm interested in insects

513
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
And all of that question

514
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,679
And the answer is I haven't always been

515
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,287
I didn't grow up as a child wanting to be an entomologist I didn't have inside

516
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Collections

517
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Brother I was interested in the world in general

518
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
How things were

519
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,247
And so that Drew me to biology when I was a college student and

520
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,903
Through my college classes I was at the University of Northern Iowa I randomly took an entomology class

521
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,536
And it opened up this idea that we could ask these biological questions

522
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
And we could use insect

523
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
To answer that

524
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
And they're living organisms they are abundant

525
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
And I also realize that

526
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,288
Going into my career in as an academic

527
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
That we're always going to need to eat

528
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
And so funding for agriculture is

529
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
There's always going to be around

530
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,040
And so it was a good way to actually marry some of the ideas but I had

531
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
Asking questions about the world

532
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
And then also working in field that super important because

533
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
Food security is going to be a

534
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
A big problem going forward

535
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
So I ended up as an entomologist out of

536
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
Hey this is a great way to ask questions that I want to answer

537
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
It's the one of the things that fascinates me

538
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
This year at DARPA and having a

539
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Virginity to

540
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Get to know a lot of

541
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
Different Technologies in the making potential

542
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,992
These are technologies that have the potential

543
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
How to do a lot of good but they're there also

544
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
I'll bring in capability

545
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Is that could be used for nefarious

546
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,952
So the case you're of developing new kinds of

547
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
Ways of getting getting genetic

548
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Material into live

549
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Who sings this

550
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Plants

551
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
That sounds like a great thing when it comes to

552
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
To crop protection but it also sounds to me like

553
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
Like it could open doors to new kinds of

554
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
What's a biologic

555
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
What are your thoughts

556
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,360
Well I think that there are potential negatives that could

557
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
Come out of

558
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Technology being developed

559
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes but I think the overwhelming

560
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
Thought is that

561
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
This is a

562
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:54,208
There's much easier ways to cause a large agricultural damage and regions

563
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
That certainly wouldn't have to

564
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Tackle this

565
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Level of service

566
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
And so

567
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
That there's there's definitely much more Bennett

568
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Let them rest

569
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,776
Right I mean to sexually could have go down deep into the

570
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Killer machine

571
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,384
It is probably a lot harder than what

572
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,248
Just going in and spraying chemicals or something from chemicals or identifying viruses or pests

573
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,576
But you know aren't in the region that you could bring in and release

574
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
It's a really that's what we want to guard against

575
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,744
There is the potential that technology like this can be used for nefarious

576
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Purposes

577
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
You know that

578
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Positive

579
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,888
That can come out of this in the world changing

580
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,192
Abilities that we're going to gain is fizzing

581
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,776
I just want to thank you for like for this great conversation wanted to watch

582
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
And thanks for spending

583

Thanks for having me this is a very exciting

584
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,248
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us I hope you join us again for the next
