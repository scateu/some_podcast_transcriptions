00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,926
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand on tonight . 

2
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:39,560
Operation technologies , a driver of our times since its founding nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt that defense advanced research projects agency has been a driver of welcome to a Voices from dark , a window on the dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

3
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,300
My names are in the mutton on the middle of host . 

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,840
And today I pleased to have with me in the studio . 

5
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,490
US. 

6
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:45,730
army . 

7
00:00:45,730 --> 00:01:03,072
Curl might happen and active duty army physician , and since twenty thirteen , a program manager in terms biological technologies office kernel happen holds a bachelor science green by medical engineering and a doctor medicine , both from duke university , following all of that education . 

8
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:11,617
He completed an internal medicine residency in an infectious disease fellowship at book army medical center at fourth , sam houston in texas practice . 

9
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:30,010
Joining DARPA met , served as the director of medical preparedness on the white house , national security staff , and additional previous assignments included the chief medical officer at a level two medical facility in iraq , a clinical research director at the USarmy medical research institute for infectious diseases . 

10
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:43,356
And in exchange , officer to the united kingdom , among other positions , matt is one of the doctor's program managers who comes to work in his military tire , in his case , either is army for teeth or address uniform . 

11
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:56,340
Either way , he always wears the smile of someone who find himself in a place he just might be able to realize a dream , and he has said publicly that he wants to stop all infectious diseases from killing people . 

12
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,930
Maybe so cool that happens though I will call you mad from that one . 

13
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,730
It is my pleasure to have you in the study. 

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,840
It's fantastic to be here , and thank you . 

15
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,730
I went for inviting me to be on the pakistan to tell my story and tell you what I care so deeply. 

16
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,560
Yes , I have been greatly looking forward to question , so why do we get ready to it ? 

17
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:22,660
And so you're a medical professional who embraces clinical and field practice , as well as living as research ? 

18
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,850
What are the origins of those interests view? 

19
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,290
It started pretty young . 

20
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,850
I have the childhood memory of being asked at my school . 

21
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,820
A catholic score now is meeting with one of the prisoners of what you really want to do . 

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:49,470
And I said , I wanted to be a pediatrician , and I said , why , and I said , well , because this wanna take care of people , and I want to take care of children , and I do think it stems from my mom , visitors . 

23
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,070
And oh , I think let's so from the influence of being around someone in the medical profession . 

24
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,620
But more so just being around someone that cares are deeply about other people . 

25
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,930
Again , very early . 

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,412
I know it , but it's been , it's been sort of a consistent part of my life , and I think it really , aren't you mean I would manage . 

27
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:07,164
This is in fourth grade this whole life . 

28
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:09,074
Yet I wanted to be APDtreasure . 

29
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:37,403
This was , I was on this trajectory , and I didn't know , of course , what I was talking about , you know me , even you make this stations early in your life , but my parents and my family always had this incredibly strong ethic of service and very deeply in fundamentally , because I reflect on this often actually , is like , who am I and what am I supposed to be , and I think what I do is I serve others , and that's that I would find myself , maybe one of the greatest gifts from my parents was that my dad was an activity . 

30
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:42,191
Navy after the RTC and served as a nuclear engine here on a surface warfare ship . 

31
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,585
It was activity for five or six years . 

32
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:49,669
Stayed in the navy for another twenty plus retired as a navy captain in the reserves . 

33
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:57,066
You couple , my mom's passion for helping other people in the medical field with my dad's passion of serving our country . 

34
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:58,859
This was almost a girl I knew . 

35
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,230
And so that subject for his sort of guided me through all of my decisions and. 

36
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,320
Okay , what let's exactly talk a little bit about that , you know , before you can do that . 

37
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:22,050
We spend almost fifteen years in a variety of assignments that took you to , for example , for the military premier facility for infectious disease research , took you to korea to the UKas the republic of georgia as AB, A, J, I, A, N, A, iraq , thailand , other places . 

38
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,210
I'm sure what did you learn from all of that global experience? 

39
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:37,220
I would start by saying what a privilege to have those types of life experiences , all in the context of a game , feeling that i'm serving my country and making a difference . 

40
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:44,240
Some of the work that are most proud of , frankly , is what I did in the caucuses with georgiana's arbitration . 

41
00:04:44,240 --> 00:05:04,245
And the program was under the officer , was called the cooperative threat reduction program , but really , there was to engage their political communities and their medical research communities to establish the capability of the finding , infectious diseases , diagnosing them and ultimately treating them . 

42
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:14,010
And it was a capability that was those public health systems were all part of the soviet union , but when the soviet union fell , these countries were kind of left their own . 

43
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
We create a public health infrastructure . 

44
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:26,740
And so the privilege was to work with those experts in the whole country to say that we build that back up again , so that helicopters are now pretty going on . 

45
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,120
And then we can collectively work together to respond to that. 

46
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,375
But I inserted you bring in models like the descendants of disease control. 

47
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,405
We did is we did . 

48
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,045
We were closely with the embassy . 

49
00:05:37,045 --> 00:06:00,440
We were closely with the state department , closely with the cdc at the end of the day , it was my selfish of my duty colleagues on the ground near rolling or sleeves up , helping these countries develop the systems , developing laboratory capabilities , developing the ability to do clinical research to ethical standards that would be accepted all over the world , and to figure out how to do this . 

50
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:08,990
You know , again , I would bet what a privilege to be on the ground and at this tribe , fairly junior in my career , and to help an entire nation of. 

51
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,365
Improve their proper health . 

52
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,519
Yeah , now that that sounds like a great privilege . 

53
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:18,250
What is the sequences of a best that resulted in your current position here adopted as a program manager? 

54
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:27,970
Throughout my medical career , I had heard about up , and I had seen amazing technology that it come from doubt that were aimed at a dress . 

55
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,001
Manufacturers is easier threats . 

56
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:33,084
So I always admired from a far before I joined . 

57
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:37,268
Darby was over the white house , national security council staff . 

58
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:50,416
And in that row , my job was to identify what capabilities we do not have to respond to pandemics , and then how we can organize ourselves as a government , not just do d but as an entire government towards addressing the escape . 

59
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,280
So we're ready for the next one . 

60
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,820
And while I was there , I got tapped on the shoulder . 

61
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:03,010
And the concise phrase was , you're doing all of this policy , what we should do as a government . 

62
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:10,010
How would you then like to employment and actually make investments ? 

63
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,260
They're going to address this , get. 

64
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,460
So met , were you literally tapped on the shoulder ? 

65
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,280
This is the end of the world . 

66
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,340
Who was that the post? 

67
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,280
It was actual jeffrey , who was the deputy director of the so at time . 

68
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:45,520
And here we imagine , for coffee one morning , and he didn't literally actually put his hand on my shoulder , but figuratively , imagine a hand on my shoulder saying that , how would you like to try a darker to actually invest to make a difference for all those things that even talking about international policy words for the last few few years. 

69
00:07:45,690 --> 00:08:01,827
Well , and of course , he provided a model of authority because he really took control manners of rogers and prosthetics and other programs really helped the worldwide , one of them secret and into your life is a program manager hearing this tremendous follow you that you've developed . 

70
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:14,010
Which is , I think it would follow you that also reflects some account of all dishes point of view , as is , of course , reflected by that statement earlier that you want to take the lethal power out of infectious disease . 

71
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,634
So the names are fantastic . 

72
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:36,590
Some of them like promises in four dialysis , like their reputations in vivo nano platforms , and we'll probably talk more about one of them , particularly the pandemic prevention platform , when i'm hoping to do now is , is , if you could briefly take us for a tour of your programs , we can go in depth about any of them at this point , but take me a little bit of a toronto . 

73
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,550
And what was you hoping to see these programs , and there will focus on a little bit more on the open damage. 

74
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:47,871
Prevention platform , yeah , so the tour starts by saying , what , what problems are we trying to solve . 

75
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:56,805
And again , at the white house , national security council staff , I get a chance to say , look for these major outbreaks , pandemics or near pandemics . 

76
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,710
How have we done as a government ? 

77
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,980
Think about the issue ? 

78
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,640
Yeah , two thousand , nine , eight , one and one panda , I think about the west africa . 

79
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,860
He evolved a crack in each one , and one matters of each one and one influenza . 

80
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,350
Yeah , influenza , think about the west african buller crisis . 

81
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,010
Think about how we recently responded to zig at their common things throughout , and some of those common things are . 

82
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:34,819
We need to be much better at diagnosing if someone has an infection , and we need to go a step beyond that in , imagine that if we could figure out if someone is going to be sick or is going to be contagious , we can intervene and stop the upgrade and extract , and that's permissions . 

83
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:41,730
You know , that's the permitted program , but we also need to make vaccine scenes and treatments much faster than we currently can . 

84
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,430
And that is a one of the examples of the pandemic prevention platform . 

85
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:54,290
We need alternative ways of how we treat infections and using impossible dialysis , and to filter the blood and remove any type of passage is a good example. 

86
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:02,190
But but so just in that case , is that mean I might have been supposed to some kind of passage in the agent , and it's in my blind certain level . 

87
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:08,440
So with this kind of technology will move that before could take hold and actually look at music with exactly idea of that. 

88
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:17,540
Yes , and the idea would be again , especially for passengers , where we don't have a vaccine , where we don't have a treatment . 

89
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,900
Especially think about now with what we're seeing so much time . 

90
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,723
And I microbial resistant bacteria , imagine if we can use an apologies . 

91
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:44,908
So if we can filter your blood and remove that passage and what it does ultimately gives a leg up for your own immune response to ultimately make you , well , again , we like that technology , especially in those first days when we need to buy some time to develop a vaccine , and we need to develop new treatments . 

92
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:50,829
And so my point across the portfolio is , we have lots of investments and medical diagnostics . 

93
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:55,786
We're investing in , muddling to forecasts where infectious diseases are going to go . 

94
00:10:55,786 --> 00:11:00,400
We have investments and accelerating new treatments , but there are connected together . 

95
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,670
They are all linked . 

96
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,330
And let me give you an example with our promise . 

97
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,740
This program , predicting if someone is going to become contagious will awesome , right if we can do that . 

98
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:22,580
But once we predict and identify that person , we still have to treat them , and so organize treatments as fast as possible with our panda and prevention platform . 

99
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,735
And the beauty is that those treatments are probably gonna , be most effective when they're given as early as possible . 

100
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:43,180
So I think of our whole port volume is inner connected that we develop a lot of different specific projects to possibilities , but that they're ultimately going to inner twelve so that we stopped the outbreak and. 

101
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,153
Well , when I think of programs you'll drop , i'll have a kind of life cycle to them . 

102
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:47,515
right ? 

103
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:51,503
I mean , they started started a glimmer and the eye of someone like you might . 

104
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:58,496
Program manager , the superior of wedding and working with others here to relate particulate and formulate programmers . 

105
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:05,750
Best can be , so it can be most effective , and then kind of smoke signals go out to the world and seeking people who maybe think that they can pull off . 

106
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:13,070
Some of these are delicious tests that we will put out , because then the research is not , hopefully , in the end , you succeed or fully succeed . 

107
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,680
You learn from all the research that that's gonna . 

108
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,790
So what is the status in that life cycle of depend? 

109
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,570
Prevention platform , the payment democracy platform just launched . 

110
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,290
And so. 

111
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,890
And by lots of those who might not know what that means in the dark context said. 

112
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:39,990
That means that completing the contracting process so that are performers that was selected in a very rigorous process can now accomplish the goals of the program . 

113
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,904
So they are just starting in there for six months as part of the lifestyle . 

114
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:49,921
These are early , early days because the ultimate goal of that programmers so difficult . 

115
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:50,737
We have a lot . 

116
00:12:50,737 --> 00:13:11,944
It would , sometimes I feel like we have , we have a long way to go one of the the key points , though , of the petroleum prevention platform is that the goal is incredibly ambitious , but there is foundational scientific evidence that this can be done , and that foundation of scientific governance is derived from a previous starter program . 

117
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:14,260
And that previous star , corporate others. 

118
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,230
Prove the accounts at the debt that see a debt program . 

119
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:26,391
Because when I looked over the program , it's fascinating to me because it looks like which were trying to wrap up the whole brilliant molecular world of any bodies . 

120
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:28,793
And so I wanted to let you go through this . 

121
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:32,396
The secret incidents , beginning with this earlier program and depth . 

122
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:41,630
Yeah , but walkers through some of the steps , because when I look at anybody to among my favorite protein , when I look at it , just brilliant things , they just so selective . 

123
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,870
And I find the thing that we want our bodies . 

124
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,750
And I glom , anyway , you tell us I. 

125
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:53,580
The pieces of the program in the interior economy more , I think all of us that are fascinated by natural , dark arrival . 

126
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,810
right ? 

127
00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:01,521
That's why our common thing is , we are just amazed by the natural world and what the natural developed antibodies are . 

128
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:02,391
Great example . 

129
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:14,770
I mean , there are millions and millions of these different versions of antibody circulating through your body at all , and the mechanisms are so refined in intricate to select . 

130
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:22,810
Okay , which are the analysis that are most protective when you are exposed to infection , and your body goes through the process of the making . 

131
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,561
A lot of those in a short period of time . 

132
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:28,734
I think it's mine boggling how events that system is . 

133
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,120
We've learned so much about everybody in less fifty years . 

134
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,210
You're absolutely right . 

135
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:42,030
We want to leverage all of that information that we know how they work now , and we know how they , we know about their structure , we know how to make them and big vets . 

136
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,060
And why can we use that in your same incredible progress medicine where we are using ? 

137
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:56,979
Were you saying antibodies approved as products now for cancer treatment , for treating auto immune disease with the category biologics in the category of biological ? 

138
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,287
So massive explosion in that space ? 

139
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:05,473
And we want , we use all of that knowledge and that technology to solve infectious diseases problems . 

140
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:10,290
What we do at dark of those , the fun parties , we couple different fields together . 

141
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:16,505
As you've correctly pointed out , this extraordinary , powerful tool of antibiotic engineering . 

142
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:22,810
But can we couple that with the revolution that we seen in genetics , and that that started right ? 

143
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:38,650
It's taking two different areas , seeing if we can mix them together again , and anybody specials might not think about the opportunities with genetics to genetics , specials might not think , well , wonder verify can use my use genetic engineering to make an employee . 

144
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,140
You bring the two fields together in a more digital of bringing the disappoints together . 

145
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,390
We achieve that effect . 

146
00:15:46,470 --> 00:16:06,860
And so the proof of concept , which I find exhilarating and choose up and on my spine , is that we can give you a piece of DNA or piece of irony , and we can put that into your muscle cells and that your muscles cells say , okay , got it . 

147
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,710
I am going to make this . 

148
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,090
anybody that is so protective 我。

149
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,470
That someone's nationalists , and that's encoded by these nuclear cases . 

150
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,315
They are in the irony. 

151
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:23,495
He tells that muscle cell to muscle cells do , and what a muscle cell does , but one side arney gets inside that muscles cell , the muscle . 

152
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:30,220
I'm gonna , make a protective antibiotics can protect you from me , buller and do that in a very short period of time . 

153
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,270
And that idea would sound crazy . 

154
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,710
Ten years ago , too many obstacles can be done . 

155
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:49,480
The foundation of from DARPA prove that concept in many different animal models for many different infections , but because we're darker , we said , we prove the concept that wasn't good enough , wasn't good enough for me . 

156
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,640
It was in good enough for the dark , dark leadership said , okay , that's great . 

157
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,840
We need to burst the baby if we're going to take pandemics off the table . 

158
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,192
That's time here . 

159
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:20,710
We need to be able to put this together as a platform that can go , start to finish from once a passage , and is identified to making thousands of dollars of this miraculous antibody based on bottom based. 

160
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,360
An incredibly short period of time , right . 

161
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
And let's talk about the time skills for minutes . 

162
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,040
That's part of the , the big deal here , right ? 

163
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:37,030
What i've seen is within six days by identifying the the passenger agent and actually have these doses right in handling in a distributable form as a correct as correct . 

164
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,030
And it appears to what to do to what's the state of the year today today. 

165
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,875
The state of the architecture depends on infections , but let you some , some recent examples . 

166
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:56,700
We currently have some zeke of accents in clinical trials , but we've been working now for a , and we don't have a licensed digital vaccine . 

167
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,929
You think about our risk when we talk about gaps , you think about all of these recent outbreaks . 

168
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:09,923
And one of the fundamental licenses that we haven't had vaccines and treatments that are ready in time . 

169
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:18,340
And we came up that the sixty day go has been cultural asylum when we talk about our destiny . 

170
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:31,040
You know , I have professional colleagues who left me , and then i've been on panels where a white idea discuss the program , and the other panels joined with the audience laughing at me . 

171
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:42,600
So I knew we were in the the counter argument that I continued to make to the critics is its sixty days is dictated by what we need to respond to petroleum . 

172
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:59,756
So if you don't agree that our approaches the right way , then come up with creative , because we can't negotiate with mother nature and say , what would you like , another six months , if you don't mind , especially when you think about the catastrophic consequences accordingly . 

173
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,700
So we have to be , we have to do this with in sixty days . 

174
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,710
And I think , again , i'm profoundly excited , because I think we found a way to do it. 

175
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:15,893
So I want to try to make this concrete for a listeners which you've absolutely unfairly , well , just know what I thought of another way we might do this . 

176
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:20,219
And that's by combining in a kind of almost the gaming out of the future . 

177
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:29,180
Let's say you are , and may you be successful with this piece , reprogramming the pandemic prevention platform program . 

178
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:37,910
Let's say that you had that p three ability back in the nineteen eighteenth spanish floor , which i've seen different numbers . 

179
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:49,410
I put fifty million people died during that the pandemic , if this technology existed , back it in the early part of the last century , how would that have unfolded ? 

180
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:49,800
Do you think? 

181
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:59,930
Oh , my , is that fifty million people don't die that we , and again , part of this is , you detect that we have a new virus . 

182
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,730
There are a new version of influenza , and we detect very early on in the process when it's for starting out in a given country . 

183
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,670
That is that that is happening . 

184
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:19,880
We fought the switch , and we say , for that new virus , we need twenty thousand dollars that have to be ready within sixty days . 

185
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:34,340
And then we go to win that outbreak is we identify who sick we treat those people that are most likely to be contagious , and we stopped the outbreak and its tracks , if we added , we could establish the spanish . 

186
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:43,660
I think , even more importantly , right now today , you and I both know people who are getting very sick with influence , or seeing a severe season . 

187
00:20:43,970 --> 00:21:04,100
And we're seeing , unfortunately , children we're seeing , unfortunately , otherwise completely healthy people having nearby hospitalized and influence the doctor to us every year , we imagine a world where this platform could be used to take seasonal influence off the table as well. 

188
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,650
Well , and an amazing thought , because I mean this gets back to you to the several times . 

189
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:15,926
You said , what a privilege is to do what you're doing , because if you succeed , you will know , I know you wanna take this . 

190
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,133
It is not pumping you like personalities . 

191
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:33,420
It's more for what is doing for , you know , compulsory , but you will know you had a part of potentially saving millions of people's lives by cutting pandemic experiences off before they really get going and spread so quickly . 

192
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,490
Quite an amazing. 

193
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,230
And I would make two points . 

194
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,060
The first is that on dark , my , my part , my team does not do this alone . 

195
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,340
Darker does not do this alone . 

196
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:59,930
We , we work incredibly closely with our colleagues and health and human services with other experts and department of defence , US, government , as well as full enterprise , as well as the private sector , and as well as the global community . 

197
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,199
Ultimately , a global teamwork . 

198
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:06,841
That's going to take these infectious diseases off the table . 

199
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:14,660
But make no mistake , we can say it's unhardened ambitious , and it's crazy , but I challenge you to say , why not know why . 

200
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:25,180
Why are we as a society putting incredible even more effort into taking these infectious diseases of the table if we have the scientific know how to do so this is. 

201
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,010
Ownership focus is a moon shot , but why not go from moon? 

202
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:41,757
And when I go for a moonshot for against something that could kill another fifty million people , why not take a moon shot against infectious diseases like malaria and technologies ? 

203
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:45,536
I mean , we've seen , you know , there's , there's effort in there . 

204
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:47,190
There is global efforts . 

205
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,371
That's absolutely . 

206
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,080
But why not? 

207
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,910
So maybe just a little while going when I were kind of gushing about the molecular beauty in the biological beauty of anti bodies . 

208
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:10,690
And the specifications have to go out and find whatever the health threatening agent might be in kind of the world that plays in our own bodies , fight against the health , compromising exposure . 

209
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:21,810
So I guess I can't wanna ask you , do you have a favorite infectious disease in the sense that you admire what the bacteria was virus ? 

210
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,560
Thus , he has learned how to do with the course of evolution. 

211
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,962
So I answered in a slightly different way . 

212
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:37,220
I think it's a , when we say we want to take infectious diseases off the table . 

213
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:53,016
In some ways , it is ridiculous , because we're always gonna have , we're always going to have viruses and bacteria that are part of an actual and and we've always seen them as the enemy errors . 

214
00:23:53,016 --> 00:24:16,471
Passengers use one of the interesting ways to think about the problem is that a part of it is that there are a passage in a particular is how we respond and modulating , how our own body responds to passengers is a major theme of what we're trying to with the entire party has been one of many examples . 

215
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:27,297
And so you are one of the traditional attitudes of analytics , and about it has been wonderful , certainly preferring impactful in terms of our society as as we , as we come along . 

216
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:49,550
But we also discovered the unintended consequences of giving a broad spectrum and about it , conquering my and microbial resistance and things like that as well , so that the world that I imagine is that there is , I guess , like you said before , an appreciation of packages and appreciation of viruses and bacteria , understanding what they do and what they do not do , and what . 

217
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:59,930
And it's not always wiping them out , but more about rendering them harmless or figuring out ways to kind of call exist with them is where I would like our thinking to go on the twenty first century. 

218
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,146
It makes a lot of thanksgiving . 

219
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:08,371
I brought statistics about the number of malaysian cells in me , and the number of bacteria cells . 

220
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:13,617
And there were almost from just the numbers perspective , way more bacteria , mammalian we are . 

221
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:16,653
But there most of the china's , this is a symbol . 

222
00:25:16,653 --> 00:25:20,155
This is , this is a mutually beneficial relationship . 

223
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:28,860
And so it really , we should notice , we think about these , these microbes as things to to consider the management we shouldn't consider them. 

224
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:36,560
The trade and the other parties that we learn from them , you know , it's , it's their evolution that also kind of inspires us . 

225
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:45,614
And so it's uh in some ways , there are adversary , but in some ways , there are sort of that yellow in the super hero novels and things like that . 

226
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:57,780
This idea of the the balance between the hero in the william and sort of that strange relative relationships that often in develops between the two and influential appreciation , is that I think that's often petitioned. 

227
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:15,470
So mad , what we're coming towards the end of our time here , but i'm just wondering if there is something that didn't come up during our discussion that you think would be interested to our business , given , you know , your goal here of a privacy of reading us . 

228
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,890
Some of some of the concerns we have about the passages in our environment. 

229
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:39,600
One of our matches that doubles this idea of inspiring inspired creativity and new solutions to problems , and often times we say , by sort of recruiting and people who have not traditionally thought about our to help us with those solutions . 

230
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:48,861
And so you know , I would love for the listeners of this podcast to be more inspired to address the province and infectious diseases . 

231
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:54,022
And what I mean by that is , I would say , people like me have to be yellow . 

232
00:26:54,022 --> 00:27:00,481
We will invest our entire careers in our life , work into this , and we have deep knowledge , the subject . 

233
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:11,781
But I love the thought of people that have expertise in computer science and mathematics , and what we would say will maybe those fields are necessarily . 

234
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:16,214
Obviously , that's all I think that have worked in a solve the infection . 

235
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:18,846
This is the promise of the twenty first century . 

236
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,275
And so when I speak on this , it's almost part . 

237
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:22,490
It's one part recruiting . 

238
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:32,160
It's especially recruiting those that may not have all of the biases of the traditional experts in infectious disease to come up with a creative solution to solve it. 

239
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:48,600
So that makes me think of a terminal europe , or what here are doubt , you know , the innovation ecosystem , because you just mentioned a whole bunch of disciplines that , you know , maybe when you first think about effectiveness , you do not think some of those come together . 

240
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:59,920
So is there something about you and being here at DARPA that is conducive to shut the shaking up that innovation ecosystem in ways that could maybe move towards that you. 

241
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:06,500
The doctor enables me to do that , because , again , they are a program announcements . 

242
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,770
We say , okay , we set the requirements . 

243
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,520
Solve this problem , make us a treatment in sixty days . 

244
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,850
We know that they can do that alone , and it takes a more time to submitting a team . 

245
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:22,180
So if you want funding from dark , but you're going to have to work with people , you're going to have to recruit it . 

246
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,920
We designed it so that you will , and people that may not be the traditional subject matter experts . 

247
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:44,700
But furthermore , every time I get a chance to speak and to talk about this problem , like i'm a spider cast , you know , again , I see it as a recruiting is a recruiting tool to inspire those to help , such as season . 

248
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,880
Factories is threat. 

249
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:57,020
Well , when i'm realizing that was , I do not want to prevent you for another minute from going out there and realizing your goal of taking the layout of a passage in a disease . 

250
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,570
And we are out of time also . 

251
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,480
So I just wanted , thank you . 

252
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:12,120
This has been immensely fascinating for me , and I just wanna thank you for sharing stories about your life as a medical professional and how you are expressing your interests . 

253
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,610
And girls here at dark. 

254
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,020
Well , thank you very much for for allowing me to be parliament. 

255
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:23,300
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join it again for the next Voices from garbage . 

256
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,587
For more information about kernel might happen .
