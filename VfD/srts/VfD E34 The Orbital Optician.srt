00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,730
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand on tournament operation. 

2
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:30,510
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , the defense advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:42,200
Welcome to a Voices from dark , a window on the dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible to my name is iphone a motto on your dark host . 

4
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,470
And I am thrilled to have with me today . 

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,090
Doctor stayed c williams of program manager since twenty nineteen . 

6
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:59,599
In the agencies technology , we are recording our conversation from our respective homes as we do our parts to slow the spread of coffee nineteenth , because we are not in recording studio . 

7
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:03,551
You might ambient sounds like trucks and trains and birds and secretaries . 

8
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:16,585
The party coming to door , but they see work with the air force office of scientific , where she oversaw research in remote sensing for battlefield monitoring and in space situation , awareness , which will see , applies to her work here , adopt . 

9
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:36,790
Joseph worked on the space situation awareness challenge in mary , hawaii , as the technical adviser for space surveillance systems for the air force research directed energy director at early on thursday , sea chemistry was a thing , earning APHDin physical chemistry from the university of california , santa cruise in nineteen ninety three . 

10
00:01:36,790 --> 00:02:04,310
And later , during past breaking work in the world of metallic as a faculty member in the boston university physics department , she soon research leadership positions and guarantees with the entrepreneurial culture in a started company aiming to translate and transition basic RNDinto commercial before pivoting into her air force are in the work they see briefly stepped away from the lab to focus on improving moving science , technology , engineering and math education , stem education . 

11
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,759
That is especially in economically disadvantaged schools . 

12
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:18,233
For part of that time , she was a driving force in a gates foundation funded program to deliver innovative , non traditional teaching approaches for high poverty school populations . 

13
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:24,267
She also got directly into the trenches by teaching in the massachusetts department of education system . 

14
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,480
Stacy william , thanks for joining in this . 

15
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,571
Thanks for having me . 

16
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:28,663
I will appreciate it . 

17
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:38,488
First of all , congratulations on the placement of your new compact telescope demonstration project , getting into orbit just as passionate thirteenth , released from the international space station . 

18
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:42,630
So that is super exciting and will talk about that and other projects in just a bit . 

19
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:50,250
But first , I like to hear a bit about some of the influences in your wife that first thank you into a trajectory and protein science . 

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,560
But then more and two optical physics and then technology development directions. 

21
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,488
I've actually had a lot of people asked me that particularly people developing stamper claims , trying to target women or other under represented groups . 

22
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:20,160
And so I thought about that , I don't really have a hot moment , but I will say that I pad a lifelong love of photonics , even when I did know what photo that's her , that when I was a little girl in the southern my yard in the evening will be full of fireflies . 

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,650
And I just was so in troll with the bioluminescence , how something so small could make , you know , all that beautiful. 

24
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,083
I wanted to introduce framework for listening who might not actually understand what photonic says . 

25
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:39,210
Certainly , the firefly example is a gorgeous one photos coming from the little lanterns of the fireflies into your eyes . 

26
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,150
Photonics is sort of a full time analogue to electronics . 

27
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,496
right ? 

28
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:47,685
So you're just thinking about light in terms of its wave nature and also expected nature and full towns . 

29
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:53,220
And this , which is sort of understanding those phenomenon and had to manipulate them for a potentially technology. 

30
00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:05,218
Yes , but I guess bureaucrats are a little biological photonics , but I also checkers group of kids in my neighborhood to a local natural history museum . 

31
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:06,580
And we went in there . 

32
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,622
And you are looking at everything . 

33
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:20,360
I remember the , the mummy , because he doesn't remember their , but then they took us into this room , and there was budget rocks in a display case , and I was , they cannot get rocks in my backyard . 

34
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,770
You know , who cares about , look at rocks , but then they turn the light on , turn on a black light . 

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,810
And the room was just looked up with a racism and foster russians , and I just was just done by that as well . 

36
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,420
So I always love science . 

37
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,090
I always was very curious . 

38
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,180
I think I drove my teacher's crazy . 

39
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,204
So when I went to college and I took chemistry class , and I learned about what pluralism is really was what boss versions was . 

40
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:47,510
I just decided that what I wanted to do , I wanted to work with . 

41
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:59,980
I wanted to understand how I, Iwanted to work with lasers totally when I went to graduate school , I worked for a photo chemist , photo biologist , photo , photo physicists study in the universe . 

42
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,330
Directions will likely initiate process . 

43
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:20,210
So we use lasers to initiate biologically relevant molecule to understand how that molecule he took in a light and used to do some type of function , you know , for example , in our eyes , we have adopted in that is a lot of zoo being protein that i'm enables us to see the light in dark . 

44
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:32,790
And so in all of my RNDthat i've done since then , has always involved some type of light initiation , or being able to understand what's happening in the system . 

45
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,920
That's distant , like a satellite by using a light to. 

46
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:50,590
I entered data , okay , so smith , by light early on , even as I tried looking at the fireflies , and there's developing that that love in throat , your education and career even now at dark , but so cool you . 

47
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:57,680
So now , just before coming to DARPA , you had a similar research management role in the air force office , upside of research . 

48
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,020
AFOSare . 

49
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:08,390
So it was the course of events that resulted in your arriving at dark by headquarters here and have to go to start your tools of program manager in the technical technology. 

50
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,210
So when I was a day of australia , i'm not actually when I was in malaria for I like , interacted a lot with dark . 

51
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:27,551
Over the years , the technical technology of his TTOfred kennedy was the office structure he really wanted to be able to disrupt ISRsatellites , and by israel . 

52
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:31,863
Just previously , you don't know intelligence , surveillance and recognition . 

53
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:37,202
So those are satellites , typically in the low earth orbit that provide weather information . 

54
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:42,881
They take pictures of years , and they help us can understand , you know , what's going on with your space eye view . 

55
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:45,305
However , those systems are super expensive . 

56
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:49,142
You know , they can cause billions of dollars to put one of those up . 

57
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,556
There are very exclusive . 

58
00:06:50,556 --> 00:07:12,110
They give beautiful imagery , but they cost a lot of money group at harvard that was actually funded by d so the defense science is official dark to the australian program had developed a plane or length that could operate in the visible and with a romantic , so we could look at a wide range in a visible four hundred and seven hundred and seven hundred dish . 

59
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,746
And so thread really wanted to bring that technology to bear on defense needs . 

60
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:19,183
And so they were looking for a program manager . 

61
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:26,290
And so my colleagues , just in the magic , as I have a chemistry background , which not the materials , is very heavily chemistry. 

62
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,239
Based we'll explain many material system as well . 

63
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:29,450
yeah. 

64
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:35,806
Yes , and I also have an optic background and a telescope backgrounds , and you know , imaging background . 

65
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:39,710
And so I put together a patch , and that's how I ended up at all about. 

66
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:48,330
Now , what I wanna do is really get back to that on orbit project today alluded to earlier , and it's called damaging short for the formula . 

67
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,920
And it's right , as we speak right now . 

68
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:58,860
Roberta , i'm not quite sure where a few hundred miles above in the cube set about what looks to me like the size of of an old desk , top computer . 

69
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,142
And so I couldn't tell me about daming . 

70
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:04,713
And what capability gap is intended to fail . 

71
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:13,070
I think you started to talk about a little bit , the technology experiment that is now going on , and what you hope will come out of this working alone. 

72
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:21,446
We're pushing to get lower core systems , and when we have lower call system , typically we give up functionality . 

73
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:25,550
And so you know , cubes that are a lot are very expensive . 

74
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,170
We are relative to these being a large , single launch satellite systems . 

75
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,800
And so being able to do a proliferated system with that , you know , says a lot of money . 

76
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:45,440
But the problem is that you lose functionality , something that is that small doesn't really typically operate with something , you know , like the really large satellite system , like the size of a truck. 

77
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,480
And just when you say preliminary , did you mean like there would be many , many platforms out there with these small platforms? 

78
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,200
Right if you dealing with something that cost billions of dollars , you have a few of them to monitor . 

79
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:09,186
But if you wanted to really have wide access , the information over lots of areas , you need to have lots of these guys , and you can just put a million billion dollars systems , or it's just too expensive . 

80
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:12,861
And so we are looking for cheaper ways to be able to do that . 

81
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:16,370
And so but that means the formal mirrors , sixty cubes at . 

82
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,010
And so it's turned by twenty by thirty . 

83
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,830
Cinema is cute , and daming is demonstrating a micro electric mechanical system . 

84
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:32,760
So it means the formal bomber , the formidable mirrors were actually developed for the ground based telescope systems . 

85
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:42,950
So imagine objects and space from earth is challenging , because you have to go through the atmosphere , the atmosphere , comfortable degree to images. 

86
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,753
One confirmation of example of what adaptive optics is supposed to try to deal with . 

87
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,110
This is sort of like the twinkling star effect . 

88
00:09:50,110 --> 00:10:07,420
Right , you see a star coming through when the atmosphere is the doing things to the latest , it comes to the atmosphere , and that makes it hard to actually do good telescopic imaging , yes , but adoptive objects using , in your case , these kinds of the formal bomber , as there is amazing technology to compensate for. 

89
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:17,471
Exactly , so what happens is your imagine in your with your large air telescope , you'll see something that looks like a cotton ball , and it looks like a cotton ball . 

90
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,636
I guess you said , because the atmosphere is blowing out . 

91
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:25,500
And so the formal mirrors are mirrors that the shape could you have actual weathers underneath here ? 

92
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,960
And it measures what that blower is . 

93
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:35,080
We call it what the way from it is , and the mirror will deform to have that same , but exactly the opposite . 

94
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,800
And so you know , something that looks like a cotton ball , you turn on your reform of a mirror , a compensates for the buller you get. 

95
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,420
Image he is almost like two one to make a right. 

96
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:53,350
Exactly , she may ask , why do I need the form of a mirror and space when i'm not looking through the assessment for right ? 

97
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,460
What do we need to do that ? 

98
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:08,248
While the formal mirrors can improve other imperfections that from your optical system , so not not just for ambassador blair , but for examples in space , the temperature authorities , you know , dramatically . 

99
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:17,470
And every time that the temperature change material go try to get to equal librarian , so they change a little bit another extortions into your imagine as well . 

100
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:34,890
And so what the system damie will do is it will manager , what those discussions are in the optical system and a compensate for those so that will be able to see clear images will be able to have , for example , if you want to look at a small extra planet next to a broader planet . 

101
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:41,190
You need dynamic range to be able to differentiate those two and so that we will enable us to be able to do that. 

102
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,900
So just want to stop your dog . 

103
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,660
That's so cool . 

104
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,480
In excellent estimate is insane , interesting . 

105
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,588
And as far as I know , we haven't really directly imaged and actually planned yet . 

106
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:53,310
I might be wrong there . 

107
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,980
I know we detected them with very singularly methods with you are the form of a mirror in sort of distributed mode . 

108
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,190
Be able to create a telescopic technology to directly immediately point. 

109
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,224
Well , so that would be what the hope would be the people to do that with a smaller satellite . 

110
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm actually not on the strawberries . 

111
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,270
So my motivation is very different for that , but I can talk about that here. 

112
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,639
Right , but what you can say is , overall is ISR, which we talk intelligence . 

113
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,092
Surveillance recognizes its situation and awareness and space . 

114
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:25,280
So in generalists , like , what's going , what's there , what's happening . 

115
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,720
So that's where we're this false and. 

116
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:36,028
Right , so this is the first main system that the exactly working in space , and the students are in my tear , actually communicating with the satellite . 

117
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:41,806
Now they're going through the initialization , getting things started and its go , and actually really well . 

118
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,399
And this is a pound finder . 

119
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,377
So if this system works , this can help us with many different types of imaging applications . 

120
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:51,140
Maybe you could extend the range of the satellite . 

121
00:12:51,140 --> 00:13:01,546
That's imagine other satellites and space , or can you know , extend the range of , you know , objects demographic that we can see also as multiple communications . 

122
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:02,898
It could also improve that . 

123
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:08,890
So any time that you are transmitting and receiving light , this type of system will be able to improve the performance. 

124
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:18,270
Right , and just to give listeners a more sort of kenneth satellite of physical sense of the mean , how biggest it is that the size of my family alerts it , something like that . 

125
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,790
Yep , it's about the size of a dime , a size of a dime . 

126
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,590
And is that just a chat size ? 

127
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,639
What will you need to make larger reform of bombers for the systems ? 

128
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,280
univision? 

129
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:39,964
Well , it depends on what your application is right when you collect , lied and to any kind of telescope , you have areas where you focus the lights down on the smaller point , so you don't need to have a jacket . 

130
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:45,020
The formal bomber , you know , it's not the same size of the approach of your telescope and smaller . 

131
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,400
But at the football , mayors can all different sizes. 

132
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,907
When it comes to article systems like telescopes , lenses and focal length and other issues determine the overall size of the systems . 

133
00:13:55,907 --> 00:14:11,280
Other things , of course , is , I know you've been thinking about pushing the of play , the robotics and many of us have some exposure to this technology in the form of those flat magnifying sheets that can help you see small print on the page , but you have. 

134
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:22,990
Grandmother and my team , yes , well , so if you look at at objects in a reflective objects and look at telescopes made from a reflective objects , they are not that much different than the telescope . 

135
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,630
The gala developed . 

136
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:37,460
We've , we've made a lot of strides and in being able to tolerate weight , something particularly for a reflective types of telescopes , but we kind of platted out in the last couple of decades , we have made a significant . 

137
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:46,355
And the reason for that is because currently we rely on naturally curriculum materials to manipulate the light in naturally current materials . 

138
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:50,580
The index of perfection is not that there is not that much depressed . 

139
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,430
Twin air in glass materials . 

140
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:04,530
And so what we do to be able to manipulate the light as we had a lot of block , and we end up making optical systems , for example , when I working with the telescopes in melbourne , it would have room just fall above decks . 

141
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:12,540
You know , trying to manipulate the light that we collected the people too , you know , understand what we wanted to do about the many materials . 

142
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:27,530
So on the other hand , there are engineered materials and they can manipulate light in ways that you can do naturally , and even the focus of a lot of research investment , particularly had dark , and the fed scientists office , as well as it . 

143
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,880
Therefore , officers , scientific research and other places to mature in and develop. 

144
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,063
The stacy , before we move on , it is one for people who haven't heard the term engineered materials and services . 

145
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:46,230
You about surfaces that are made from parts , or have textures that are very deliberately designed and produced. 

146
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,749
Yes , so what we are doing is we , we have a surface , and we place a microphone vacated subway branch , struck shirts . 

147
00:15:53,749 --> 00:16:03,202
And what I mean by that is structures that are slightly smaller than the wavelength of life that is , we identify what functionality doing one from this object . 

148
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:10,207
And then I go in an engineer that and makes that object , that helps that functionality , that that's where we would like to be . 

149
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:21,624
And many materials have the potential to be tuneable , to be able to to change the structure in real times so that I can change what functionality that specific objects at that time . 

150
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:26,045
So that's , you know what I came to double to work on is to take that . 

151
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:34,879
So , so these beneficiaries have been for longer wavelength systems and for single wavelengths systems have matured significantly . 

152
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:46,370
If I wanted to do something and invisible , so like that , it , on the order for hundred and the structure should going to be smaller and to do something that sports band is more challenging too . 

153
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:55,718
Because now I need structures that interact not only with light that four hundred and nine meters , but it's five hundred , six hundred and seven hundred , so it becomes a much more complicated problem . 

154
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:59,980
So i've been collaborating with my DS, so colleagues that would be working on . 

155
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,329
And so we have several efforts that were working on together to try to be able to take these manufacturers that have been demonstrated at the millimeter of april suicide . 

156
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:23,140
So the articles of millimetre wide , but to take that and make that larger to make that so that I can have a telescope that doesn't have thirty objects that are ridiculously heavy , really dry . 

157
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,300
The cost of my ISRtype system , but they have something . 

158
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,410
Maybe the only has a few objects , and those objects are that the way to eat out of the magnifying tones in reference. 

159
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:43,640
Ha , it reminds me a little bit of innovative , dramatic size reduction that we know when history save computing , where you go from a window computer that takes up a room . 

160
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:53,770
And then we have in a again the size of some know something , you know , thousands of times more powerful than that to the same sort of capability , but in much more compact and practical forms . 

161
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,590
So let's in some ways , what you moving together. 

162
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,990
Yeah , so so yeah , so that we're all working on somewhere . 

163
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:09,740
As I said , my colleagues in the so were also working with some of the other user communities to investigate in a can we make these minimum lessons have large approach ? 

164
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,703
Can we make them such a theory of the function the way that we need to function , particularly in the space environment ? 

165
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,830
And the other thing , I think that's important to is this is a very challenging problem . 

166
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,409
But can I understand what the limits are of this ? 

167
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:27,981
Originally TTLwouldn't be able to make up a meter plus . 

168
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:32,942
I asked our types of light , but maybe , maybe we're not close to being there yet . 

169
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:38,170
Maybe we can make something though that tony summit , which would also still have a huge empire. 

170
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,750
That's a very darker . 

171
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,360
Asked question in a propart of darkness , mission of courses to sort of matter the landscape of what is possible . 

172
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:58,277
So you might learn from the performers that is to say , the researchers working with you on this project is , is just what are the limits of obsessing the end of the size and extension and complexity that , you know , you can create with these men of material . 

173
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:02,630
So it certainly is spot on with questions and answers . 

174
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,720
Starbucks is gone after . 

175
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,910
So before we went at a time , now I want to return to another part of your work life . 

176
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,387
And this is when working on the same education . 

177
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:20,425
Again , let's see , you know , science , technology , engineering , math , education , and especially in economically disadvantaged schools . 

178
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:26,150
I am just wondering where that that interest came from , and if this , you are continuing to work on. 

179
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:34,670
Yeah , so I could involve in stem education for many years , and it can have started when I was in in college in the chemistry partner . 

180
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,930
I was president of our student organization , and we had lots of parents that were calling onion tutors . 

181
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,140
And so you know , my fellow chemistry club members , we set up a free tutor . 

182
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:56,090
Senator , that where high school kids could come and and also college kids and move in the weekend , and my chemistry , and and I have to say , I love to working with the high school kid they were had so many questions . 

183
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,669
They were so eager to learn . 

184
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:03,100
So I adopted two girls when they were an school , and I wanted to have the same schedule with them . 

185
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:11,740
So I don't always thought about , you know , teaching high schools are , but I made that transition then , and I did that in boston , and I just love them . 

186
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:51,350
And and then I was offered a position at the dictionary college academy , and they know how to be the circular and director for the gates on the school that you mentioned it when I went to the school , it was , it wasn't a second year , and it was an amazing experience working there , the , the first year the folks had started the teachers and administrators and community is leaders that research , lots of different creative solutions for urban education , because at that time , and you know , probably still , we have a lot of children are graduating from high school that are on a great level that are really prepared for college or prepared for life . 

187
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:58,260
And the billion millions of information where to change them , so they find it several extremely schools across . 

188
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:05,197
And one was the data or the european economy , and the idea behind decades duckers sought for dinner ecology academy . 

189
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:38,560
These were first generation college students , the students , ninety five percent of them around for your reduced launch , nineteen five per cent of students were considered minorities to take these students secretary for college , until the model was , first of all , I was early college because a lot of students that graduate , particularly students from launch and families , they go to college , and they can , they don't tested to the the universal thirteen hundred college classes , so they are not taking these remedial classes , but they are paying their college tuitions . 

190
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,920
So they are a cruise large dead , but getting zero college and a lot of them get disappointed , and they dropped out . 

191
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:57,640
So this school has the students taking college , whether in high school , to get them ready for that , lots of the college classes were a media classes , but that still helped give them prepared for the college glasses . 

192
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,530
It's a very good model . 

193
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,710
The school is doing . 

194
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:12,420
We did realize early on that we really need to start young girl , so rather than starting at fourteen each year , the school is added a middle school grade , or elementary . 

195
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,827
Now they go k through twelve , but we also did a kind of a different way to approach learning . 

196
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:20,940
When you open up , you know , your classical chemistry textbook . 

197
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,999
The first chapter is on measurement , and that is the most worrying chapter in the entire book . 

198
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:30,586
And I don't know why they just limit text , like all of you enthusiasts about it . 

199
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:32,365
This class in this first week . 

200
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:52,860
So what we did was , we took the students on overnight counterpart , and we went to a king up that had a straight , and the students collected waters and balls , collected rock sailboats , leave sailboats , and also , during that time , they had the opportunity bomb with the teachers that there were going to be spending a lot of time work , because relationships . 

201
00:22:52,890 --> 00:23:13,439
I think , when you have students in high school to get that really engaged in mind , when we came back to the classroom , we spent the next few weeks under the standing in learning about measurement , learning about water quality , learned about the policies of water , learning about how water affects economics , how that affects you know , where cities are built and to do a cut event in a greedy circular . 

202
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:15,470
Murray , you know , touch all of the. 

203
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,360
Stacy , that just sounds absolutely amazing . 

204
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:26,000
And I can tell with the combination of your knowledge and your enthusiasm must be just been a gift to the songs . 

205
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:33,870
I have a prediction that , at some point , me , or maybe not doing your tenures at our program manager , but at some point you are going to get back into each encourage . 

206
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,600
Sounds like that's one place . 

207
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,060
You know , you want to be at some point . 

208
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:57,550
One more question is , daisy , before we close out here , you know , one of the phrases that often is associated with double , you know , if that is an important part of the opera innovation ecosystem , you know , which goes everywhere from academics and laboratories to entrepreneurs , you had some experience of that already on . 

209
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm just another group in a darker for a little while . 

210
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,290
How do you view its place in the innovation ecosystem? 

211
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,040
Oh , well , I think dark is as an amazing , incredible place . 

212
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,430
And in one of the things I think that's most powerful . 

213
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:17,350
He said , is that we have technical program managers , coal , located with lots of the end users . 

214
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:31,520
So one of the things that I think is amazing about dark as the services is on when I was in melbourne , we developed technology , but we were very fortunate because we had end users embedded with us at the telescope side . 

215
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,270
And it was huge because the end users can really give you some guidance and. 

216
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,108
Right , and just let me stop you just for a second soul in africa . 

217
00:24:40,108 --> 00:25:06,520
And for listeners who might not know what that phrase service leaves on me so at the door , but many women in uniform , they come from different services who , you know , have boots on the ground and experience in those services so that they can relate to the program managers and contribute to discussions with program managers about the kind of technology really would be valuable for the mission of furthering international security and defence. 

218
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:18,560
Unusually valuable , like , for example , I have a small business innovation research , her gram to develop variable laser detection so that are disappointed soldiers who know if they are being lazed . 

219
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:28,422
Well , I immediately talked to the end users that could potentially use this to understand , if it's , you know , an edge , maybe there's an inch wherever that's too big for them . 

220
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:33,080
They can't help that , you know , they need it if it was a pounder , I can't wait a pound . 

221
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,700
It has the way a quarter of . 

222
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,660
So these are really key pieces of information that you need when you're designing something . 

223
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:47,980
And so I doubt , but we just have access to , you know , amazing people that you know , have experience in the battlefield . 

224
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:55,740
Then come back and with enthusiasts and share that with us and give us ideas for , for new things that need to be developed . 

225
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,930
So I think that's what the most wonderful things about dark. 

226
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:08,550
Called the bring up beginning , it is just one element of many , you know , that make up as some former directors , of course , it is special sauce . 

227
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:22,510
What is it that makes the open such a successful technology development institution , and , you know , a lot of people actually have tried to emulate people from all over the world that come to observe and try to learn what dark has been doing it to see if they can learn lessons . 

228
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,211
But at the moment , they're still as just one doctor , as far as I know . 

229
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:36,280
So thank you says , it has been a really cool to talk with you about , you are ongoing science and technology , adventure , and i'm foreign , right here . 

230
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,620
And now that dark pass . 

231
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,280
So thanks for sharing this time with me . 

232
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,390
Oh , thank you . 

233
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,670
I will enjoy that chat , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us . 

234
00:26:44,670 --> 00:27:09,430
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from garbage , thanks also to ban celebrant for his partnership in producing this program for more information about doctor's taxi , williams , the program she runs at the agency , tactical technology office and the other ways with technologies dark is working on visit , dark and for links that enable you to download this podcast .
