00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:31,010
Self technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand alternatives operation technology is a driver of our times since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , the defence advanced research projects has been a driver of technology . 

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:39,190
Welcome to Voices from dark a window , and the dark is core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,060
My name is ivan , a motto and arm , your DARPA host today . 

4
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,230
I am pleased to be talking with . 

5
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,260
Doctors , said kung , a program manager in the agency of biological technology service . 

6
00:00:50,420 --> 00:01:18,793
He brings to doubt that interests in experience that ranges from a novel materials that can make technologies more capable , new approaches to therapists and medical counter and new strategies for acquiring scarce materials like rare earth elements , which have rolled in many high technologies and even portable water , we are recording our conversation from our respective pounds , as we do our parts to slow the spread of coffee nineteenth , because we are not in a recording studio . 

7
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:24,046
You might hear ambient sounds like trafficking melbourne to tell you a little bit more about safe . 

8
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:31,910
He joins the art of the university of california , sandy ago , where he is a professor in the department of chemistry and biochemistry and former department . 

9
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:46,218
His research has focused on the interface of bail in organic and medicinal chemistry and advanced materials , including middle organic frameworks or maps , which are many among themselves , chemical separations in catalysts . 

10
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:59,080
No stranger to federal science and technology rules that was the triple ASroger reveal fellow in global stewardship in the white house office of science and technology policy known for shorters OSTP. 

11
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,930
And he is an alarm . 

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,114
Owners of the dark responsibility . 

13
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:20,500
Defense science study group says , received a pair of bachelor's degrees from stanford university , one in chemistry and one in political and APHDand chemistry from the university of california , berkeley , which he followed with a post darker fellow position in biochemistry at the massachusetts institute of technology . 

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,301
Sounds cool , thanks for joining me . 

15
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,302
This conversation . 

16
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:25,503
That's my pleasure to try to be here . 

17
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:31,908
So I always like to get a sense of the origin of the scientist specific interests in your case in chemistry . 

18
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:45,257
And as we mentioned in something a specific against frameworks , and you also interested in sort of all that chemistry is going on inside of sales makes me wonder , you know , certainly the chemistry side of your lighting , things on fire in your parents . 

19
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:51,450
Base manager , you have some love at first side when you saw the period go elements , but you tell me where , where did your interests come from? 

20
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,350
Managers and science definitely started in childhood . 

21
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,760
My father before he became an office . 

22
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,560
Telemarketer was a bio georgia teacher for middle of high school , and he was always really passionate about science . 

23
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:13,960
And we spent many and evening together watching novel , or nationally graphic , or even the mutual . 

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,290
Oh my hair , I think it was. 

25
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,220
Oh , wild kingdom , yes , I remembered that. 

26
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,110
Wild kingdom , thank you . 

27
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,160
Yeah , so shows like this were a staple of our evening . 

28
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,660
Things are cosmos as well , of course , and he always just encourage my interest in science . 

29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,070
We would go fossil hunting off a more home bully varied in southern california , always assist without the top of the list . 

30
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:46,930
And really , after my dad , although he didn't go into a longer inquiry , and scientists himself here had a real passion for it and always really inspired my interest in it . 

31
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,570
And so even I did not profile interest going in the high school . 

32
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:59,980
I was very involved in speech and debate and student government , and had an interesting law and civilians that core interesting science I just couldn't shake . 

33
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,550
Yeah , and it just stuck with me all the way through my current career or. 

34
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,850
So fantastic practical influence in sparking the interesting science in general . 

35
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,970
But how about chemistry ? 

36
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,980
What is it the direct you there? 

37
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,122
Yeah , chemistry was AIsort of failing to it , which is probably not a super uncommon story . 

38
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:22,256
I would think I went to college , you know , knowing I was politician . 

39
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,650
Science as a major , maybe premature . 

40
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,325
I wasn't entirely sure I never really thought about being a chemistry majoring in chemistry . 

41
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:35,610
I was much more interested in the sort of extremes on either side of chemistry , which was either . 

42
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,531
I was very interested in biology , probably again , influenced by the TVshows . 

43
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,172
I watched . 

44
00:04:41,172 --> 00:05:09,384
I was interested , maybe like being a few biologists setting animals like an or the other stream of being an astronomy physicist , inspired by shows that cosmos , I was always really fascinated with space and astronomy , and had a real love for that , but I sort of fell in the chemistry , probably for two reasons , one , as I , my massachusetts , have a strong enough to be a natural physicist , and as much as I loved it , it was very challenging , but probably the bigger influence was actually just a friend in college . 

45
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:17,300
So when I was asking for his undergrad , I was in all freshman dorms there , but I was in the one dormitory of freshmen and started making friends right away . 

46
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:37,000
And one of my closest friends of my closest friend in college was a guarantee , stephen miller , and we became fast friends very early , and he had a real passion for chemistry , and we took those freshmen chemistry classes together and very competitive owls trying to beat each other on the next term of final . 

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,111
And he thought that kept nudging me towards chemistry , and I was good at it at the time . 

48
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:44,777
At least , you know , I didn't came as classes . 

49
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:53,860
And so as I think , a combination , having some sort of feeling of ethnic ford , but a lot of just urging by this body of mine to say , hey , let's do chemistry together . 

50
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,140
And it's really cool . 

51
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,190
And you should , you should stick with chemistry . 

52
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,500
And I thought of how it ended out . 

53
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:14,476
And the funny is also a professor chemistry at university , foreign games , well , and in our PHTthesis , I credited him for my interest in sticking with chemistry , and he , conversely , credited me , which I thought was ironic because I never thought I put chemistry . 

54
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:18,520
I was out of the other way around , but apparently we sort of self coaches each other in the field. 

55
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:27,420
Love that story , I mean , just how how two friends would influence each other , and also the chemistry degree is near , and due to my heart , because of that , that was my undergraduate degree as well . 

56
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,620
Campaign event spring up . 

57
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:42,460
And for what I do is a science communicator , I felt like what that did for me is giving me the language of science , but in a way where I could actually also talk to biologist and go in the other direction and talk to some of the anybody dealing with atoms and molecules . 

58
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,780
So so if I think it's a great degree. 

59
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah , I strongly agree with that . 

60
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,200
And although I can never encourage myself being a chemist as my crude developer , I definitely found it to be a really good film . 

61
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:23,864
I love the a synthetic chemistry training , so making new molecules , although I did have a postcard and biochemistry , but that's idea that the process of discovery and being creative in coming up with new molecules that nobody ever made before and being in the lab and making something that no one , at least on this planet , is ever made before orange and characterising and figuring out what it is and what it does is a spiritual element of creativity there that are not sure everybody appreciates that I found this is kept my passion in science over the years . 

62
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:24,720
I love to that . 

63
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,540
I think , you know , people will be excited about and interesting. 

64
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,128
Indeed , indeed , and these are hope . 

65
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:35,120
Some young people listening to this and hearing about the way of the excitement of discovery that comes with going into chemistry . 

66
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,951
So maybe you actually influence them . 

67
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:38,450
And there are reference in there . 

68
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:50,896
So when a movement tried to coming to dark on taking on the roads , program engineering , biological technologies of office , I was in twenty one thousand nine hundred and twenty years at the university , california , sandy ago , in an academic setting . 

69
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:55,310
Some just wondering what in buyer , the leap two , and how did they come about ? 

70
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,360
I think you. 

71
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,980
As you mentioned , I have always had a with my colleagues . 

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,454
Greece , I also had long standing in tuesday and policy and civics . 

73
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:11,323
This goes back to high school as well , where I was involved in a lot of clubs quickly , the genuine station of america , which was a very big civic club . 

74
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:16,320
And so a student government club that I really love and still love , still support . 

75
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:29,150
And so when i've got ten year , uses NDAgo around two thousand and sixty thousand and seven , I had time for a civilization , and it was time for me to sort of scratch that each in terms of policy interests and civic interests . 

76
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,741
And so I applied and received that replies , fellowship that he mentioned and went to work at all ATP for a year . 

77
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:39,400
It was actually under both the bush and obama administrations of their own transition . 

78
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,062
It was a wonderful experience . 

79
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,354
I absolutely loved it . 

80
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:48,818
It was just a totally different world , and it was one of the great benefits of being a professor and academic with that . 

81
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:56,310
You have these opportunities to literally step out of your everyday job and step in doing a timely , different world and do something totally different . 

82
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:16,760
And so those TPIdid advantage of science policy world and got to hang out around and near the white house and and see a change of administration is received today between two two administrations and just a lot of stuff that is acted in a chemistry I would never seen in my life , and I got a pretty open , close and personal view . 

83
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:25,610
It saw it was just great , and after I finished that september twenty nine team , I knew I wanted to come back and was just a matter of where and when . 

84
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:34,500
And so I looked at working at a variety , federal agencies on the national science , on and then dark became a people mentioned above . 

85
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,680
I learned about it through the disease , which you mention the defensive study group . 

86
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,550
There are a number of prominent people at my university . 

87
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,437
This is an eagle who a football program managers at the , including our chancellor and our DNA engineering . 

88
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:54,334
And they have mentioned how much they enjoyed dark on what special places it was , and so that really stimulated my interests . 

89
00:09:54,334 --> 00:10:02,153
And so about a decade after I left , DC, Idecided to try to positions in the federal government , particularly with focus on DARPA . 

90
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:05,318
And ultimately , it worked out I am here now , I really like it . 

91
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:08,111
I should say , i'm at dark under a special mechanism . 

92
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:16,629
I am still actually a part of the USDfaculty and ultimately plan on returning there , and I still have a research group that conducts our research . 

93
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,030
There is well filled with grassins and post dogs. 

94
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:30,090
Best of both worlds , because many program managers are so moved to come to dark , but that tells you that they know it's just for a couple of years , and they don't know at a time whether they are going to end up afterwards . 

95
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,820
So it's great to have . 

96
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,090
I would imagine the kind of security that this arrangement does afford you . 

97
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:49,280
So before we talk about a few of what are really amazing sanding programs that you ever see , including ones that help us take on the troubling rise of anti biotic resistance , and also precured . 

98
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,190
What are where it is scarce . 

99
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:59,330
I have to ask you about a seminar that you told a few times the UCS d it is called history of the american muscle car death. 

100
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,491
Yeah , that was a lot of fun . 

101
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:04,687
So UCS d has a program called freshman seminars . 

102
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:11,080
They tried to incentivize faculty to get to know the incoming freshmen better in a small environment . 

103
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,616
And so it hurt it like a large person in chemistry class to get to know your students well , and so they have this christmas . 

104
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:20,499
Women are programmed as limited to twenty students . 

105
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:23,960
It's one hour a week , and you can basically teach any topic you want . 

106
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,327
So the first couple of times I did it . 

107
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:31,458
I tried to keep it close to home to chemistry , and I talk classes in forensic chemistry . 

108
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,826
It was called by CSIfact infection . 

109
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:40,610
I told a class in archaeological chemistry , archaeological set of which I call two motorcycles , something like that . 

110
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:48,140
And then I realized how much latter to the university would give me on this , because they really were having factory , getting a freshmen . 

111
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:56,320
And so again , inspired by my father , my father , his brother were big motorhead when I was growing up , my dad was always buying and selling cars . 

112
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,930
So it is brother that worked in a gas station and own gas station together . 

113
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,670
Write new opinion . 

114
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:09,640
Hot dogs , los angeles , growing up together , I always love cars and not as knowledgeable about all mobiles as my father and his brother were , but I, Icertainly love them . 

115
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,860
Another history pretty well have only a few class of the years . 

116
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:22,490
And so I just thought , hey , why not learn more about it myself and just have a fun , engaging way with the students in much of my surprise , they approve the class . 

117
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,650
We did the class . 

118
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:33,817
About half a twitter of lectures , if you will , are discussions about the history of automobiles , particularly the muscle car period of the nineteen sixties in early seventies . 

119
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:38,160
But then we would do the last five classes as a on one of the places that uses any eagles . 

120
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,260
So I would invite the muslim club or invite the shopping club . 

121
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:49,060
I invited the more part club , and those guys love coming out , and they will show off their cars in the students would walk around the place . 

122
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,528
A lot of students is , but I would walk around and talk to the owners about their cars and learn about how they were . 

123
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:54,869
They were . 

124
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,424
They came from and how they restored them and all the stuff . 

125
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:58,957
So it was a lot , a lot of fun . 

126
00:12:58,957 --> 00:12:59,980
It was a lot of fun. 

127
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,180
Absolutely love it . 

128
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:10,880
So if you remind me that when I was in high school , my best friend had a sixty five months than you know that he restored , there was a lot of fun to drive around that . 

129
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,020
So this makes me wonder what muscle card you have in your driver. 

130
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,870
Yeah , so I have owned a couple of years . 

131
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,860
I had a couple of muscles , because they will . 

132
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,860
They used to be another pretty expensive , the use of the entry level car for a collector . 

133
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:29,990
So I had a seventy three mark one , a mastering gold with a final talk . 

134
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,340
It was quite the thing I had that actually back in grass school . 

135
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,890
I bought it off that uncle of mine . 

136
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,253
Then I had a seventy two mark one . 

137
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:53,215
Then I , when I got ten year , I bought myself a sydney three , mustn't convertible , and then I upgraded to a sixty nine firebird convertible , which I actually that car discovered when I was here at OSTP, my mentor at OCP, her father owner car . 

138
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:59,365
He was the original owner , had had its since nineteen sixty nine , wanted to get rid of it to a good home . 

139
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:08,080
And so I car back with me from my first ten year and DCand restored it and drove that car for a long , long time , is a wonderful car . 

140
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:17,700
And then my most recent acquisition , like I just saw a few years , is there a sixty three quarrel that convert about it was always a dream that was always a dream car . 

141
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,500
Mind , yeah , sixty three . 

142
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,750
so. 

143
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,510
Wrap it , okay , so you know , let's get to the business at hand , which is your experience at the dark . 

144
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:34,923
And so I wanted to start with one of your programs that , gosh , sounds like it would be great to have the , the technology you're invision in the anti viral technology , and it had that in hand . 

145
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:37,310
Now , the , the program , short name is interesting . 

146
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:42,202
It's one name is interfering and coal evolving provincial and therapy programs . 

147
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:46,205
We started actually , by a previous program manager , jim kim lit . 

148
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:51,320
I just would've shared sort of the basic concept of the program , and where it now. 

149
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,658
Sure , so it's a fascinating program , and I feel privileged to have inherited it . 

150
00:14:56,658 --> 00:15:00,530
When I joined , DARPA was a great introduction agency . 

151
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:13,891
Until you get me up to speed about how to how to learn about the program and manager program , and the program is focused on a class of what will be or could be a novel theraputics for treating viral disease . 

152
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:20,558
And his novel therapeutics are called tips , which stands for therapeutic interfering particle . 

153
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:32,724
So let's say , for example , you have the , now we have a vaccine for the flu , but we have to reinvent that vaccines every year , because the flu mutates and a new strain becomes dominant year after a year . 

154
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:46,618
So what this approach would do that was different , different from our a vaccine , which stimulates the new system or a small molecule , which is sort of your typical drug like aspirin , that which is directly set of attack , the virus is developed . 

155
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:52,286
These tips , the best way I think to describe it is that it's a neutral version of the flu virus . 

156
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:59,980
So it has all the components of the flu virus , but some genetic element is missing or disrupted , or others . 

157
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,050
Why is not properly constructed ? 

158
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:19,090
And so what you end up with is this tape , a therapy of kenya particle is viral particle that looks like the virus is how many of the components of the virus , but the key part that is missing province , it from self replicating , and that's really the key . 

159
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,740
And so this type can be given to someone it can enter . 

160
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,490
The person sells just like a virus . 

161
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,930
But once it's in the cell , it just stopped there and can do anything . 

162
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:46,729
However , if that same becomes infected by the live flu virus , the disease causing club virus , it turns the tip on , and what the tip will do is , instead of allowing the virus to replicate itself inside the tip will steal . 

163
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:49,667
The machinery is missing in its noodle genome . 

164
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:53,508
It will steal that machine ray virus and make copies of itself . 

165
00:16:53,508 --> 00:17:01,383
And that's really important , because what happens now is , instead of the virus replicating itself , the type replicate itself . 

166
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:12,001
And the tip is not disease causing , nor can the tip replicate once the virus is gone so effectively , the tip competes with the , until the virus is just knocked out . 

167
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:18,005
And in the whole system shuts down , and the virus is stopped , and even if it doesn't stop it on the first path . 

168
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:25,503
So let's say it competes with the virus may be knocked down the number of articles that are produced , but various dealers escapes . 

169
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,996
It can escape with it . 

170
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:40,500
And so those viral particles go , in fact , neighboring cells again , the tips can enter themselves as well and continue to come back and compete with until the library was suggested , exhausted and outcompeted . 

171
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,860
And then the whole system. 

172
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:53,656
That is an amazing kind of molecular dynamic to imagine , actually , in a sort of pulling off when you work at the performers , which charges say the research , said that of contracts that working under the program . 

173
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,850
How would you articulate the farther said any of these researchers have got into the goal? 

174
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,190
Well , I am very encouraged . 

175
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:07,220
It's very much your program entering its fourth year now , and the results of the innocent program are very intelligent . 

176
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,950
Tips could become a completely new class of therapy of canada measures for treating violence . 

177
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,537
We started , or again , gym , gym , look before me . 

178
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:30,170
And the other programming is that the manager program before me started with just saying or looking at , can we make safe and effective tips that can you make a tube that competes with the virus effectively knocks down an infection and isn't harmful to sales or an animal . 

179
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:45,376
And what I can tell you that for a wide range of viral diseases from the flute HIVto others , more exciting ones , you may not have heard of , and even some more current data looking at covered were trying to get for these . 

180
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:49,107
These establishes is like flu , HIV, and others . 

181
00:18:49,107 --> 00:19:03,130
There is very good data showing that these researchers can develop tips that the tips are safe in animal models , and as the tips effectively prevent not only infection , but the spread of that infection between animals . 

182
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,610
And so I think the program is looking very encouraging . 

183
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,090
We are pushing some of our performers to try to get these novel . 

184
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,140
Canada measures into a face , one clinical trial . 

185
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,610
And i'm hopeful before the programs over , we will do that . 

186
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,910
I think that's parliament . 

187
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,330
The last major hurdle is that this is an entirely new type of drug . 

188
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,090
It's not like vaccines or biologics or small molecules . 

189
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:38,770
The way we normally think of them , and so it will be interesting to see how this moves forward in a clinical setting , how the fta will available a therapy to look like this with a think will be appropriate . 

190
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,720
I am very encouraged that we could see tips as a real medical theraputics for dealing with violence in the future. 

191
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,460
Yeah , interesting . 

192
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,464
I am glad that you are encouraging your performers to really think about the trials and getting the they did there . 

193
00:19:52,464 --> 00:20:06,840
Because , as you mention , this is so different from the sort of pharmaceutical mechanism and antibiotic mechanism that it could will be that a regulatory challenge is going to be the dark ahead problem , even more so than the actual sort of chemical and former social and. 

194
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,810
Yeah , it very well could be , because it is a really different mechanism for drug . 

195
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:28,795
But if you think about the current code pandemic that were all living in , I mean , if you had a drug that could keep up with that virus and not only stamped out in an individual , but prevent that individual from spreading it to others , it's literally exactly what you would want even more . 

196
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:34,000
So I would say than vaccine , perhaps , in the current situation we have been living in . 

197
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,151
You know , having seen what we all lived in experience through the last , almost coming on a year . 

198
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:46,570
Now , I think that , you know , that should provide some real incentive for a tip to be given serious consideration , considering what they. 

199
00:20:46,570 --> 00:21:07,112
May you succeed because , as we know and democracy bets will work experiencing that right now , this new technology might not be in hand for this particular round of a pandemic , but hopefully for the next one , let's move on to a summer related program in the sense that it's aiming for a new kind of pharmaceutical techniques . 

200
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:15,164
But in this case , may be dealing more with bacteria and harnessing in the medical activity for life saving remedies , or in a short form . 

201
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:38,840
Hiller at HEALRsaid this one , two as a satisfactory focus on developing new countermeasures , though more focus on sort of looking at the public health communities were concerned about because of the ascent of antibiotic resistant microbes and the potential that we could enter a sort of a post end up at it everywhere we can no longer use these fantastic medicine . 

202
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,770
So how might the hero program step in and save the day when it comes to fighting off? 

203
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:51,170
Bacteria , sir , so here is a new program that my team is dark and I developed , but approve that we're pushing for now . 

204
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:59,180
Yeah , anybody resistance is in many ways , the sort of stealth pandemic that's been emerging for over twenty years now . 

205
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:17,570
So people , oh no , that this is a problem that the bacteria that we get infections from are becoming increasingly resistant to the analytics that we have available , that when a new energy is developed , residents emerges much more rapidly , sometimes within a year of the drug being first used . 

206
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,980
And so this is a crisis that has been well recognized by , I guess that many people have called the pandemic . 

207
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,580
That's been a sort of evolving or emerging for twenty years . 

208
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:42,210
And so the human program is designed to take on this challenge , using a new approach , a different approach that involves harnessing one's own biology to combat the bacterial function . 

209
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:48,460
And so there's a technology that's been about a little less than a decade . 

210
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,890
I would say , and it's an approach by which a new class of drugs often referred to his camera drugs . 

211
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:03,010
Camara , referring to the middle article creature that has multiple heads on a single body like fine and a dragon and eagle fuse to one body . 

212
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:27,162
These molecules also have multiple heads and the way they work is one head of the molecule engages your target , so something that is causing or propagating a disease that head is attached to another head that engages some sort of biology within your cell that is designed to either the activate or eliminate that the activators are destroyed . 

213
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:40,470
And so this concept has been widely investigated , as in any inconnue trials currently for addressing cancer , but it has not yet been applied to many other diseases , including bacteria , cross diseases . 

214
00:23:40,860 --> 00:24:02,554
And so what the hiller program is largely focused on is taking this protects or climate technology and porting it from its name and face with cancer biology and applying it to bacteria , threats and bacterial talks in such as anthrops toxin , or barcelona , or many patriotic micro organisms . 

215
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:26,010
And so this is a very , very different mechanism , because you're not just sort of poisoning the organism , or directly attacking a component of the organism , but you are buying the impact of what the organism needs to be patagonia , and you're then shadowing it away and just using natural biological processes to damage the activity , or destroy those such as the disease . 

216
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,720
And this has never been applied to microbial disease before . 

217
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:45,875
And so we're hopeful that by bringing again , sort of like with tips and entirely new medical camera measure modality or mechanism of action , we can overcome some of the resistance issues that are playing traditional and about development for decades. 

218
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:52,106
Yeah , so the way you describe these agents in it with the multiple heads in each one having a different function . 

219
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:57,961
Absolutely not just fascinating to think of that sort of macro molecular construction participants . 

220
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:07,029
Sounds like anybody , right , because it , I have to have a kind of specificity for one of those as where can go after the troubles and bacteria , but you do not go after everything else . 

221
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,870
So headache has specifically , yes , so. 

222
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,080
The use of an anybody is is definitely one possible approach . 

223
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,870
I'm sure , when hiller begins its research efforts is not actually at that stage yet . 

224
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:36,960
But once it starts , I am , if you look at the scientific literature on this , which you see is that there are actually a variety of that are being pursued in that inclusions at antibodies that also include small molecules or poor small molecule drives , can be very , very specific for a target , includes different kinds of biological or peptide base constructs . 

225
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,180
There are many different ways . 

226
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:48,370
One can can address this problem , actually both to develop the head to target the packaging , as well as the head to target the biological system to eliminate the passage . 

227
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:59,462
Both of those require development of very specific groups , and there are variety ways to do that , and actually part of the hill program is to invest in the technology . 

228
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:02,183
How do identify those , what we call leagues ? 

229
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,366
How do you identify the best legals ? 

230
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,895
What are the best approaches ? 

231
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:15,190
How do you discover them quickly and make sure , like you said , they're specifically so that is actually part of the investment hiller plans to make in developing the technology. 

232
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:23,604
The epidemic will also send it to me , almost like in one agent , you kind of putting together several components about natural music systems . 

233
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:27,332
Do right to anybody might allege onto a passenger particle . 

234
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:32,611
It also is then flagging other cellular parts of the municipal development for the kill . 

235
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:43,906
Where is it seems like you're getting not only your sort of selective identification of a passage in , on this case of microbes , but it is very same particle you've packaged in the killing mechanism . 

236
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,910
So it seems almost like a super efficient immune. 

237
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,700
Yeah , that I actually went on . 

238
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,810
My program . 

239
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,460
Manager colleagues made that observation to me . 

240
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:58,672
He said that , oh yeah , so it seems like you're creating an artificial immune system using other biological pathways . 

241
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:00,720
And I think that's a description . 

242
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,510
So there are certainly a lot of parallels with this camera approach to the native amusing system . 

243
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:25,308
I think the potential advantage of the approach here is that you can use it to compliment the natural annual system , because you're not necessarily going use the same clearance path with you could use these molecules , help recruit elements of the immune target the packaging . 

244
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:38,100
But again , there are many other passwords that are in signs that would degrade the passage and or an important component of the pathogen , or , as you said , flagged for destruction , which is actually how protects itself works . 

245
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:53,190
So I think , in a sense , we're almost like opening up human biology to see what other processes and human biology can actually , as a type of immune system , if we can honest them. 

246
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,476
Okay , when umbrella amazing programs , we have to be learning about themselves . 

247
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,209
And I want to talk about one more . 

248
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:02,180
And this one has , and that sounds like to be hard to live up to . 

249
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:10,850
But I love the acquaintance is all spell that you would expect AWEthat stands for atmospheric water extraction . 

250
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,330
Now , you know , the availability of fresh water is a big deal , is becoming a bigger and bigger deal . 

251
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:25,976
We had walked with a fresh water if changing weather patterns and roads are making fresh water , a real concern for the future in a world climate change . 

252
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:31,680
So talking about how you imagine the opportunity or program and what you hope to deliver with it to the us . 

253
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,040
Bilateral improves as a billion sectors. 

254
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:47,440
The opportunity was the first program I started at darbar , and despite its simple acronym , it was actually one of the more difficult acronyms to come up with , not just because it was my first program , but because I actually am a huge science fiction . 

255
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:59,980
And I was absolutely dead , said on naming the program , something related to taiwan , or lose skywalker or uncle owen , because uncle owen in star wars was the moisture farmers would take out . 

256
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:21,745
So I was very disappointed , but I could not come up with an agreement to fit any of those things , and so ended up with all but the opportunity seeks to take advantage of effect as you mention , what is the scarce resource not only essential to our war fighters , it's essential for humanitarian purposes , and it is literally been the cause of conflict throughout the world . 

257
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:50,790
And so the upper ground would like to produce a device with a relatively low footprint in terms of energy and size and weight that can harvest the naturally occurring moisture that we have in the air all around us , especially leaving here in the washington DCarea , especially in the summer , many of us will complain about how humidity is and a humidity , of course , is a measurement of how much gaseous water there is in the air . 

258
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,690
It's a very pure form of water , and it's just sort of sitting there , ready for the taking . 

259
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:15,500
The challenges is , how do you get that water out of the air and energy efficient manner with a small footprint device , so we have ways of capturing water from air ranging from very low energy devices , but that require a very large amount of since called fog nets . 

260
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:25,180
A fog nester used under humanitarian situations , they act almost like a big leaf and capture water , condemning out of the air . 

261
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,927
But there are huge installations . 

262
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:36,630
They are not very practical for the department defence , and you can only use them where you have a hundred percent relative humidity , so where you're literally the water is stripping out of the air . 

263
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,550
And so that's not always useful . 

264
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:49,260
We are other devices like condensers are the humidity fires that can coolly air such that you can then get the water to liquid fire out of the air , condense out of air . 

265
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:57,949
You can think of this is your home air conditioning unit if you ever run , sort of like a window unit , you'll see the water dripping off of the condensation . 

266
00:30:57,949 --> 00:31:04,880
In that case , has been used to call the air , but you can run that device , your air conditioner on a similar way to collect water . 

267
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:33,260
But the issue there is that , as we all know in the summer , especially in place , like the washing in this area , our electric bills go up tremendously when summer hits , because the air conditioning is a very energy intensive process , so that cooling of the air takes a lot of money and makes that kind of water capture likely not useful for the department of defence and not useful for a lot of other , say , humanitarian applications is just too energy intensive in the all program . 

268
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:51,780
We hope to find a happy meal medium of a device that can capture water from the air under a wide range of environmental conditions from very humid conditions to very dry conditions , with a small size , weight and power input in the key to this is two parts . 

269
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,810
First is the development of news orbit materials . 

270
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:04,020
So new material that can extract the water from the air efficient , and many of us rescue familiar with these urban materials . 

271
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,760
But we need an extraordinary once . 

272
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:22,663
So the everyday familiar example of a zombie is the little silicon package that you might get with a new pair of shoes or a new backpack or piece clothing that little silicon package is designed to absorb water from the air to keep the clothing fresh and not given being damaged by the humidity . 

273
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:26,890
So that material very effectively actually grabs the water from the air . 

274
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:34,030
The challenge was something like silicas is that it doesn't let the water go very easily , take a lot of energy to get the water back out of that material . 

275
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:47,330
And so what we are looking at in odds to the very sophisticated modern materials , next generation that cannot only absorb the water , but then release it under relatively mild conditions , such as that we can make , it advised the harvest water . 

276
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,240
So that's the first. 

277
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:54,160
The authorities are questioned or may help make your trigger the release that would have been used from from sort of electrical stimulation . 

278
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,689
magnetical . 

279
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,863
Meanwhile , the materials actually be stimulated to release it . 

280
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,980
There is a number of different possible. 

281
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,560
But is there are performers that have just started their work are looking at different options , but it could range from all the above . 

282
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,660
You just mention and and others as well . 

283
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,526
So you can hit materials , you can potentially do some of the things you mentioned . 

284
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,498
You can use a variety of sort of thermal electrical . 

285
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:20,470
Others stimulate to try to get the water back out . 

286
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:25,140
The key is to make sure that the energy required is as as low as possible , right. 

287
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,890
You're about to go into the sort of the second big element of the. 

288
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,791
right ? 

289
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,662
So the second big element is the engineering . 

290
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:44,776
So we do have some new zoo materials that have been described in scientific literature that looks very promising for this , and they have really spectacular water's option and release properties that we can build off of . 

291
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:48,730
But nobody is ever , really , holistically designed the device. 

292
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:55,835
这个时候，我们就可以看到这样的一种情况，在此之前也许会有很多问题。

293
00:33:55,835 --> 00:34:06,640
但是如果我们在这个过程当中有一些问题的时候，guys that maximum employees , these urban materials and the program is divided in the two . 

294
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,820
What we call tracks one is called the expansionary , and the other is called the stabilization . 

295
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:32,898
And the expeditionary track is designed to create a device that an individual would carry and would be very small , obviously in size , maybe something the size of the canteen that would harvest water from the air and then fill up that , for example , war fighters , canteen or their camel back or whatever receptacle they have for collecting the water . 

296
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:38,910
So this would be a small device just designed to provide enough water from individual on a daily basis . 

297
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:50,962
And then we have a stabilization approach where this would be a larger device , maybe something on the size of refrigerator , but this will produce a much larger amount of and could supply political drinking water for safety of individuals . 

298
00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:52,860
They are one hundred and fifty individuals . 

299
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,448
These require very different engineering challenges are present , very different engineering challenges . 

300
00:34:57,448 --> 00:35:06,774
And so our performers have to take that under consideration as well , both from the material standpoint and the engineering standpoint , depending on which device they're trying to successfully produce . 

301
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:14,050
But both the next petitionary and stabilization size device could have a number of both commercial and immediately in applications . 

302
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,900
We're going to come. 

303
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:19,187
For a learning here , you've been very generous with your time , just couple of quick questions . 

304
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,473
Maybe we can be brief here . 

305
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:21,920
One of them is just served trying . 

306
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:30,926
How do you think about your experience and academic team for twenty years and now is the program and a general federal RNDagency , which is to say , darker . 

307
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:35,930
And how would you compare and contrast the role of academic , and you know , agency like that in. 

308
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,950
Evolutionary ecosystem , I think they play very different roles in many respects . 

309
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:51,910
First of all , I like both work environments very much , and I have to really say that dark has been as many people told me it would be one of the best places I could ever imagine . 

310
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,330
working . 

311
00:35:52,330 --> 00:36:01,960
It is a fascinating agency filled with incredibly a smart , motivated people who create a incredibly supportive work environment . 

312
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,010
So I am very pleased to an honor to have been part of the arab and continue to be part of the arab . 

313
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:19,860
But I would say that in the role in terms of innovation and the ecosystem , you know , the universities are really sort of the front line , right , so medium in department of defense terms , they are sort of the tip of the sphere . 

314
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:36,778
Right , there are the ones in during the research , you know , with grad students and post dogs and underground and faculty and research staff out there , you know , pushing the boundaries , making the discoveries and and innovating , of course , and coming up with lots of creative ideas are constantly . 

315
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:44,890
I think that the role of dark , as well as you know , other federal agencies that don't have their own research component , like the national science foundation . 

316
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:50,264
We're like dark , but they're just funny research and not performing research themselves . 

317
00:36:50,264 --> 00:36:59,980
You know , they are critical part of that industry because that tip of the spear in the elevator is going to happen without federal support and federal funding . 

318
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:16,311
And so a place I doubt not only provides the financial support to allow the research to function and to proceed , but dark , I think , also plays , as well as agencies do a very important point in in pushing those boundaries . 

319
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:16,720
right . 

320
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:31,970
So one thing , having been on both sides of defense here , the academic research and the dark aside , one thing that dark is very well known for is really pushing the boundaries as an academics , historically , you know , sight fatal funding from a variety agencies . 

321
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:52,330
We're often , you can tend to be a little bit more conservative when you are asking for fatal support because you want to make sure that your programs and that the reviewers of your grand believe it's going to work , and that you can show that you don't research along those lines that shows that you are really capable of doing it , and that tends to keep our ambitions in academia . 

322
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:59,349
Sometimes real , temporary , because we have to make sure that we can convince the federal government and these agencies that we can continue to do that work . 

323
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:09,559
And that's a very important function are not knocking it anyway , but there can be a tendency for that , and and people I think , on both sides of the oil go size of the fence , know that . 

324
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,697
And so the dark of places are , especially , it is known for being a cutting edge agency . 

325
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:16,964
It's known for pushing the boundaries . 

326
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:27,660
And though our performers are highly qualified and highly skilled individuals , are they done and teams of individuals , they don't necessarily have to assume that they can do this yet . 

327
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:34,920
It is a latest and greatest , and in many ways , can be the most risky as research , and that's an important role in the dark of the fields . 

328
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:52,050
He's pushing that very cutting edge , allowing people to to take chances to try crazy ideas that are still grounded in good science and good concepts , but that might be outside the comfort zone of a lot of other parts of the federal government to find . 

329
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,979
And I think that's why you see . 

330
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:57,194
And this has been spoken about for many administrations . 

331
00:38:57,194 --> 00:39:00,740
Now , other federal agencies trying to emulate japan . 

332
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,820
And I think that's a good thing . 

333
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,240
I don't think they should try to emily daughter at the point of their own nonexistence . 

334
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,380
I think , you know , funny agencies like the animation and itself in the do e and missed online online . 

335
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:26,839
They play very important roles in the type of research they found in the way they do it , and they have their own emissions that are extremely important , but many of them have taken a nugget of darkness theme and try to incorporate it into the own portfolios . 

336
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,867
And that I do think is a good thing . 

337
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:37,900
I probably the most notable examples , arbitrary over the department of energy where they are trying to push , cutting out technology for energy sciences and those applications . 

338
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:51,640
Yeah , I think universities should have tipped the spear certainly idea generating as well , and in dark , a place that sort of super supportive role , and allowing and encouraging those type of researchers to push those boundaries. 

339
00:39:51,770 --> 00:40:02,565
Thanks for giving witness a sense of the many parts of the innovation ecosystem where academic fixing were dark with fixing and across the components of the research infrastructures that there was really great . 

340
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:11,224
So now , just before we do close here itself , I wanted to give you an opportunity to bring anything that just didn't come up in the discussion and didn't come about a question I ask like that . 

341
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:13,950
You think there might be interesting films in the snow. 

342
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:19,295
I guess coming from academia , it gives me a different perspective on DARPA and federal service . 

343
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:21,139
Certainly , i'm not the only one of done . 

344
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:27,591
This is many , many , many people before me , but I do think it gives me a perspective that I like to share , and I will share . 

345
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:27,775
two . 

346
00:40:27,775 --> 00:41:00,400
Four is darbar and in federal services in general , I think , is a very important and very valuable thing that academic scientists and science from industry , from the private sector , I should consider , we are very , very lucky to live in a country that saw highly values , science , innovation , engineering , and it's valuable , and I think important to take time out of one's own career to be part of medical system on the site and understand how a works . 

347
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,001
And you try to make it better . 

348
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:07,607
The other thing I like to highlight is for all those graduate students and post dogs out there . 

349
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:21,020
So it dark bug , just like it at my university job , I am given a small team of ph d level scientists to help support all of these programs that you talk about innocent and healer and all , and they help go through all the technical data . 

350
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:35,851
And how many programs , and they even helped inspire many , many components of these programs , and it's a career opportunity that I think many post dogs and graduate students across the country are probably not aware of , and it is a very , very exciting . 

351
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:38,760
And I think , in reaching korea past to consider . 

352
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,870
And so that's the other result of takeaway , but put out there into the either for the grass . 

353
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,680
Soon in the post , officer looking at in the weather , next step is. 

354
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,870
Great , this was just a really , really fun conversation for me . 

355
00:41:51,870 --> 00:42:09,416
We covered a lot , some amazing things when a one program that could bring a new anti viral technologies , another one that could potentially play role in this enormous global concern that antibiotics are becoming less effective , and we can really need new ways of countering bacterial infections . 

356
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:16,140
A program , yanking water out of the air , both for military and civilian users , perhaps down the line . 

357
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,790
Or , you know , you talk about the innovation ecosystem . 

358
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:31,010
You did a great recruiting talk at the end here by why one should work , replace like dark , but so I just want to thank you for all of your time , all of you thinking your expertise , thanks for joining me in this Voices from german conversation. 

359
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,010
He's been my pleasure . 

360
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,200
I went , thanks for having. 

361
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,420
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dirt . 

362
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:55,114
Thanks also to ban selected for his partnership in producing this program for more information about dark assets called the programs he runs in the agencies , biological technology office and the other breakthrough technologies .
