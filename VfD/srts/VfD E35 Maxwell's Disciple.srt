1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,980
Stop technology. 

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:30,940
The internet GPS in the column of your hand are tonight with technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research agency has been a driver of technology . 

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,200
Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window on the darkest core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 

4
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,910
My name is , I went a mutual on your dopp a host today . 

5
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:56,280
I am pleased to be talking with that your time roundup , who joined the dark as a program manager in twenty sixteen , first in the microsoft technology before transferring into the strategic technology , is still in may . 

6
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:06,354
We are recording our conversation from our respective homes as we do our part to slow the spread of coffee nineteenth , because we are not in a recording studio . 

7
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:09,100
You made your ambient sounds like trucks or trains . 

8
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:18,703
Let me tell you a little bit earlier in the morning , he collected three electrical engineering degrees from virginia technique , blacksburg , running his ph d in two thousand and eight . 

9
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:22,840
Several years before that , he got seriously involved with a good new radio project . 

10
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:40,390
That's GNU, like animal , which is an open source heaven for radio hackers , makers and others interested in using software models to do a wide range of radio anchor task , communicating with satellites or controlling household drones as a visiting scholar at the university of pennsylvania . 

11
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,328
And as a research scientists at the institute for defence center for communications research in prison , new jersey , TOM . 

12
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:57,020
Further those causes , which is work on other things on architectures and algorithms in signal processing for communications and the monitoring and use of the electronic expected . 

13
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,665
Thomas is much of a community builder as he is a tech guy . 

14
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:11,000
He has organized many conferences and workshops , and has been spreading the world like an adventurers and new technologies in wireless signal processing , among other radio techniques . 

15
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:23,180
Town's current interest include adapted in weaken figure of radios , improving the development cycle for new single processing techniques and creating general purpose electrical systems . 

16
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,474
Tomorrow , thanks for joining mysterious conversation . 

17
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:27,133
Yeah , thanks . 

18
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,011
I was excited . 

19
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:43,104
So before we dive into your portfolio group programs , which ranged from software defined radios , and we will explain to a new category of powerful , yet affordable chips for specialty computation , intense applications like signal processing . 

20
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:47,360
Let's give listener some sense of how radio technology became your. 

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,941
As you mentioned , I, Igot all three degrees from a virgin attack and black spot . 

22
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:57,310
And what happened was an unconvenient intellectual resource . 

23
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:09,382
So I was also getting a little chairman , english literature , one of my english professors think , realized my restlessness , put me in touch with charles boston , who was a professor of electrical engineering . 

24
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:13,828
But his wife , the freedom was a member of the effectively the english department . 

25
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:16,062
So there are chinese connection there . 

26
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,092
And I freely just walked into trouble . 

27
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:24,386
His office , a drug , boxing at the time and said he was a software , said he had a panda board later to do more . 

28
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,277
Well , you made the most my university career . 

29
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:31,341
I was more involved in my processors and networking , and just kind of how to make computers talk to each other . 

30
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:37,249
And charles is a wireless guy that we can accomplish notes and start to really look at a wireless networking , so we can . 

31
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:43,470
It took me on the test , the song , moreover , a summer period and was impressed enough that it was doing some bluetooth work . 

32
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,870
This is back in two thousand so early , early in the bluetooth era in person after it became me on , I kept working on lab . 

33
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:57,986
Do more stuff , higher frequency staff and radio propagation staff in an eventual determined to a massive degree . 

34
00:03:57,986 --> 00:04:03,020
And he called me , well funded , well , engaged with wireless stuff followers in my pitch. 

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:13,140
Well , beautiful , we should all have such men tools I always love , and I hear about , you know , teachers and individuals , but you know , adults , and I like to really have had transformative effects . 

36
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,130
What sounds like you like this profit was that person for you. 

37
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,270
Yeah , manager is the right words used for him that the number of things beyond just the skills of researcher . 

38
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:34,170
And as an engineer that I learned from him out of people in our situations just had to behave as a adult in the , in the field as an engineer that is doing more than just the court. 

39
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,842
You'd grateful that , okay . 

40
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,391
So what happened along this trajectory ? 

41
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:45,105
And as you , this interested your development , pacified as you became very much involved in the coming radio organization . 

42
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:49,459
So what I would , most people , I think listening might not know what that is about . 

43
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:53,246
And so I developed it just say , briefly , what is the good new radio project ? 

44
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:54,950
And then I love to know what catalyze. 

45
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:05,171
Near the dark , the new radio is a free and open source software framework for building software defined radio capabilities . 

46
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:16,950
So desperate , fine radio , it is the ability to program in your computer signal processing technology , appointing mass to signals that manipulate the electronic spectrum . 

47
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,110
And so we see here is that electronic spectrum . 

48
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,301
Electronic are one of the four fundamental forces of the universe . 

49
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:31,440
And we saw for radio allows us to do is right programs that manipulate one of four fundamental forces of universe . 

50
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:40,930
And once that thought really hit me , and he had a number of business field that was that kind of all moment of all this going . 

51
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,330
This is , this is incredible . 

52
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,310
This is breaking open and making accessible to us . 

53
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:59,930
And two hundreds of thousands of people around the world , they are beauty to access and control this thing that controls , as you mention drones , sadly , over cell phones or utility systems are now all connected in communication . 

54
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,120
Honestly , I usually reach , feel that that is is rude in this . 

55
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,150
And google radio is this tool that allows us to make. 

56
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,800
That happened in the robot , oh , no time . 

57
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:20,146
So you mentioned the world , you are having a kind of movement is your thinking about the electronic magnetic phenomenon , the world , and how you connect the interact with it . 

58
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:38,600
So this reminds me of something that I know I want to get the timing of you have on your arm or arms tattooed the famous four equations from maximum of four equations to scribe electronically phenomena was at this time that you were moved to get those status. 

59
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,024
Yes , it actually wants . 

60
00:06:41,024 --> 00:07:02,560
It was thinking about those four equations , but this is an excellent equations , and that shows us as as something that we , as humans have done , which is understand this , this incredible force and what it does for us are qualified in these four , in some senses , relatively simple , but they want to , you break up down the very complicated equations . 

61
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:12,250
And so there are the third attitude I got to reach on on each forum , and I looked down at those every , every day and and have that moment of all of what we believe that we. 

62
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:21,380
I've already to meet you in , that is one of the best metaphors of the kind of devotion you often see to science and technology . 

63
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,440
Buy program like you . 

64
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,850
So very cool . 

65
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,380
The second half of my question here was , so you described the new radio . 

66
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,030
What is it then that got you to? 

67
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:40,737
And what happened was in two thousand fifteen , I met bill chapel , who was the director of the microsystem office , and he invited me to a big DARPA , even called weight . 

68
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:44,354
That was showcasing what the dark of capabilities and technology . 

69
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:46,907
And he wanted me to come and talk about this . 

70
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:57,047
Now , this was my first interaction with DARPA as a grassroot in electronic engineering , especially from the school like virginia attack , were well aware of dark . 

71
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,851
It's part of our funding source . 

72
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,030
It's part of growth in the research community . 

73
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,980
So I met bill , and it was always in the back of my head that I love to go to dark . 

74
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:12,600
I love to be the kind of person I can make the contributions to the technology of the country and larger the , that's what darker . 

75
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:19,990
Yeah , I always represented to me is that the most impressive , cutting edge you , this world of the quarter comes from , so it was always the back of my head . 

76
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,170
I wanted to do this , but I never felt ready . 

77
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,380
I might be able to figure it . 

78
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,730
You know , what are not already foreign . 

79
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,440
I think I am ready . 

80
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,320
It's time to to step up and take the opportunity to see about getting into a position like this . 

81
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:44,640
So I ask bill , and he said , looks like , but the reason why I want to do that back to the real through the question was the elevation of focusing on this , this project in the radio , which is wonderful . 

82
00:08:44,830 --> 00:09:03,558
But I had this increase that I wanted to be able to affect more , and that's the opportunity that I saw a dark was to , instead of just coding , I was able to organize and really put real resources behind some of the ideas that were in the back of my head when I wanted to accomplish . 

83
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:06,226
And what I thought technology could become . 

84
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:14,421
And so yeah , so I jumped at an opportunity was made of twenty sixteen when I got to sit down for the first office meeting with crumble . 

85
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,918
The program managers and kind of realized out in over my head . 

86
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:24,090
I actually , once , when you , when you meet your fellow peers of dark parts are pretty uninspiring back to that again. 

87
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:32,574
You might have been involved your head for a while , but you shouldn't come to embrace the job and really become quite the PM with quite an amazing portfolio . 

88
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:34,350
That's why I want to get into now . 

89
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:40,626
So let's take a tour of the , in the fascinating programs that you and overseas , initially empty , owned . 

90
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:47,286
And now MSTO, the two , two of the six dark technical offices , let's talk briefly about two programs . 

91
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:54,070
The same related one goes by the name domain specific system on cheap programs , and one of the things related to me . 

92
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,290
But you're clarified that goes by the name , software defined hardware . 

93
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,301
So talking to me , well , the ocean , yeah , we hope to achieve with them . 

94
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,220
And what the status of those programs. 

95
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:11,700
Those who took great programs , I was able to formulate the full domain specific system on chip or DSsock program . 

96
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:24,760
And then I worked closely with the other program manager who crafted the estate for themselves from a fine hardware , but I had been running their program for the past year when he left the agency to people on familiar with software . 

97
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:34,850
It might seem weird that I went to DARPA and started running processor programs , but that's what the software defined in this really means is that what are the radio spectrum ? 

98
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:47,910
And the more you want to do , the more processing power you need in order to to do all those cool , single manipulations that make sadly communications work that make five g technologies . 

99
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,710
So new processors are cool to meet in this habitat . 

100
00:10:53,110 --> 00:11:02,538
The assault , it was all about trying to understand how to overcome the limitation of general purpose , embedded computing . 

101
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:12,228
What I mean by that is taking your general purpose , install processor , which call about that processor is , it can do almost any mathematical competition . 

102
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:12,690
You can . 

103
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:22,220
It doesn't necessarily do anything particularly well , but we were able to use that as our programming platform for all the general radio work . 

104
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,647
So we are , we were you using and slightly miss using this , this great general process . 

105
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:50,710
So , but what we realizes your every generation of a processor coming out , we be able to do more because you can do news if they're faster , the lower power , all those cool things that were coming with more slow as you start to see some of those that no size of the future sizes of these transistors starting to come to to the end of the lines , far is just free processing power in . 

106
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:56,272
You are waiting months or whatever , and so stealing from once in churchill , we realized the months are now . 

107
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,682
It's time to think the transition is running out . 

108
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:09,059
It's time to think what we she've LED earlier in our thinking and coming out it from the sino processing rules , like , you know , hazards , a lot of math that we go over and over again . 

109
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:14,630
What if we build a hard work salary that did just that , but then we tied it down to a system on chip . 

110
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:37,360
So lots of these different courts that all work on the same silicon chip package together that we could kind of balance this general purpose processing and special purpose computation to be able to accelerate those core math problems that we kept we keep burning into if we can make use of that , we get to accelerate our ability to control back to the control of the electronic government . 

111
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,170
So that was the correspondence . 

112
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,200
Now , the second part about the assault that's really important to me . 

113
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:55,933
And one of the key concepts of a new processor to me is , if you give me a new processor without code , without a compiler , without a way to use it from software , you've literally just handed me so little fat sand . 

114
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,552
And that is that all is good for . 

115
00:12:57,552 --> 00:13:02,480
So coming out from their perspective , the is also about the software tools . 

116
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:13,930
How do you actually make use of with no call in many core hydrogen is computation system , so we can have dozens , of course , each one of them doing different jobs of more effectively than other . 

117
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:25,410
How do you distribute the software down onto a trip like that without it becoming a massive burden to the developer , we couldn't rely on the general purpose processors to give us the speed . 

118
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:36,360
So what kind of balancing knows out by having some special purpose and some general purpose and taking advantage of of the small transistor , no sizes that more slaw has produced , and I see more release . 

119
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,340
The hard work is the entire silicon industry is produced for us , and then make a program. 

120
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,747
That program sounds like there is really hardware component . 

121
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:53,470
What it might be hard work century and a sense of specific models where software to find hardware sounds like you are using software to get specialized hardware. 

122
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,100
Yes , and the core distinction is every engineering problem is a trade off . 

123
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:07,246
And when I go , we're seeing in both the asylum establishes , you can get program ability and high performance in the same trip . 

124
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:13,768
And currently those are are competing objectives , so you only can get both and give high program ability . 

125
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:31,519
And the jump of his processor , highest specialization and efficiency in the athlete , we're saying that you can actually get both , but we're giving up something , so we're not going to replace the entire process or in your work station , or your laptop is create different types of architectures that meet different needs . 

126
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:40,780
In my case , that the assault needs was in better processing and really hipper , specialized math processing on the signals , or or video or image . 

127
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,960
There's whatever , what SDAjust asking is a different context of problems of a space of problems , big data , machine learning , large data sets . 

128
00:14:51,960 --> 00:15:12,980
You know , talking billions of a of bate of data or billions of trolls of images , or or or social networks , are whatever , whatever we're trying to understand and computer against the challenge with that kind of computational model is moving deeper in and out of the processor . 

129
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,230
That's typically a limitation . 

130
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,750
Often our processes are bored waiting for data to be delivered to them , and the really fast . 

131
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,014
And it takes a military offload that data back into memory , so offered a fine hardware . 

132
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:40,998
Is , how do you stuff software program , ability of the memory access models in order to make sure that you're balancing the data movement and competition , and again , without overburdening , the programmer for , for trying to specialize to this , this new architecture . 

133
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:46,230
So that's the , the , the similarities and the subtle distinctions between the two and the two. 

134
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,740
Let's settle it to another program since a little bit like software to find hardware . 

135
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,461
So this one is called soccer to find the radio for a point out , and I think that might actually rules to go . 

136
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:57,355
Go back away for you . 

137
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:58,250
So what about that? 

138
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,145
Yes , the software , fine radio is still four points on . 

139
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:13,726
This is again thinking about DSS , a new table processing framework and architecture and programming environment for doing things like software , financial processing . 

140
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:20,700
But then you have , we had a good new radio , which was designed to take advantage of general purpose in jail . 

141
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:41,280
Type course , we need to bridge that gap , and so what we're thinking about , what's your four point now is , how do we make a general programming environment like an radio able to target hydrogen year's processors , and in reason , why is because , as imagine general proposed , processors can do anything , just not particularly . 

142
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:51,370
But then you have other procedures like the famous wondering that everybody talks about as AGPwith the graphics processor unit , a lot of machine learning is now done on GPU . 

143
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,240
They're good for what we call densely neurological . 

144
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:02,076
There's a lot of problems that are represented as dense , linear , arguable problems and floated to GPU is really well . 

145
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:06,747
Then there's other things like few programmable gatherings or FPGA . 

146
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:11,550
Those are really good for high throughout high eye or input pricing problems . 

147
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:21,110
Each one of these has a role to play in different stages of of processing and entire signal working in radio had no idea how to take advantage of those . 

148
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,992
So we've been looking at this problem for a while . 

149
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:41,840
This hydrogen is crushing problem as it will lead , but the assault is coming along , and we're going , frankly , amazing stuff and in , but we also need to suffer programming environment that can take advantage of existing hydrogen users or even future hydro genius type . 

150
00:17:42,170 --> 00:18:11,740
So then if I take what you will take a step back , and I think about , because i'm also a history nerd as the maximum equations probably include , but going back to the evening to the seventy people really started to start programming in these digital single processors are DSP , you know , that was kind of the release ages of what became so far radio , and then in the nineties , there was a single speak easy , and this was actually ADODfunded project to create this , this machine called speeches that was like the first soft video . 

151
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:29,630
So that's kind of generation , two of software for one radios when we really qualified what a mental process , all the signals and in computers , and then good news radio , I think , represents today , what the third generation is , which is a small dinner , make flexible processing stage of the singles . 

152
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:43,460
And so we are thinking , what next is , let's , let's do good processing with program ability and mixing those together with ahead of genius processing nature of all the processes . 

153
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,330
That's the fourth generation of software video . 

154
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:55,860
That's what china do is make these things both again , flexible and programmable , but also take advantage of efficiencies that different types of. 

155
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,510
Elements provide for us . 

156
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:05,600
There are so to to finish out this tour , more of the research that you are overseen , talking about a relatively small , effective . 

157
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,790
It is called hatch. 

158
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,140
It uses more effort in daughter terms , but he said , it really keeps me in . 

159
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,590
My heart . 

160
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,920
Is dark . 

161
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,800
Program manager . 

162
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:19,627
This is a new embedded device that makes software defined radio practical . 

163
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:32,712
So what I mean by that is to communicate to the audience , radio spectrum , the election background , you need to have the ability to come into to transition between the art of waves . 

164
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,590
And as the digital processors. 

165
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,480
More programming , like a radio frequency waves in the process. 

166
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Yeah , so what we are trying to do with hydrogen is take advantage of dark technology , one that we ran in a program called the r FPGA . 

167
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,794
And that program is a lawyer academy . 

168
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:54,192
But I talked about few programmable gatherings before FGA. 

169
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:59,517
Those are digital processors that they can be reprogrammed to do a lot of things . 

170
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:03,002
What are , but we do the same thing with analog signals . 

171
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:10,757
Can we have a programmable array , a signal processing , your amplifiers and mixers and isolators and and futures . 

172
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:20,860
These are important building blocks in the for communicating , transmitting signals into the spectrum or receiving signals and in capturing them . 

173
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:36,099
So I heard of that project when I came to double it , we also worked , were investing in work with zillions to create a new type of embedded of pg processor , which had embedded analytics and digital dynamic converters . 

174
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:43,241
Now , those are how we DHO blocks that moved it between the digital world in the end of the world . 

175
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:51,514
So we thought we could remind these r FPGA s with this in better processor , with the integrated converters . 

176
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:59,980
That is a really amazing package that crazy and bedded software , fine radio platform for us . 

177
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,020
Digital operating system on the processor . 

178
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,046
It'll do the digital signal processing portion of the FPGA . 

179
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:27,155
And it talks to this r FPGA , not a really interesting thing about us , and why we call the head truck is because it has multiple channels so you could connect sixteen and tennis to a head shock device , and something is , this is in a lecturer electronic world . 

180
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:41,831
This is caught in a ray activity of the strawberries , or there's a lot of talk about that , especially with five g the more and tennis you have , the more it , it becomes an array that you can manipulate . 

181
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:44,780
Well , it turns out that the collective noun for hatches . 

182
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,260
So I thought I knew potential . 

183
00:21:46,260 --> 00:22:06,381
I was , because I thought that was fun , but the other really cool thing is not only easy in multi channel digital informing system , multi channel , multi function , because every antenna could be doing a different function , one could be scanning the spectrum for , for signals for interference . 

184
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:12,260
One could be communicating to a sort of other could be communicating to satellite frequently . 

185
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:23,460
So I truly call it on the other thing that we're pushing on in the system is the traditional commercial software radio system , the bedrock of all of all we do . 

186
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,530
But there are typically limited to about six bigger hurts . 

187
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:33,987
What subsequent hurts is important is that where most tourist real communications happened . 

188
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:44,598
So your TVand over their TVam FM broadcast most cell phone up until fifth generation , all cellphones open to face generation are under the six . 

189
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:48,360
Giga hurts so six times ten to the nine cycles per second . 

190
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,370
That's great . 

191
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:58,716
But what's happening now in the world is more people are trying to push into the higher spectrum , higher frequencies in the US. 

192
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:02,762
The five g high band colleague , you'll also care , called no leader wave . 

193
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:05,950
Those are about twenty a gaga hurts thirty seven . 

194
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,650
Gaga hurt thirty nine gager hers . 

195
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,562
Those are some of the new bands . 

196
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:17,300
Those are well outside of almost people have access to , and so hydrogen is actually pushing up to cover . 

197
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,720
forty . 

198
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,910
Giggle hurts , so could tune this thing up as high as the high , the high band of five , two . 

199
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,830
And why is that important to me ? 

200
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:40,813
This kind of goes back to the kenya radio foundation , what we did in canada , radio was really open this access to the document for people to change how they learn , what singles are , what , what radio waves are . 

201
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:48,550
We teach things differently now because of this type of technology , millimeter wave signals behave differently in the world . 

202
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,540
They , they just , they , they bounce off of things . 

203
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,860
They don't penetrate things this. 

204
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,010
The range of ways of millionaire ways that you are talking about that sort of forty and gigas. 

205
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,449
The thirtieth of the four days he had that type of those of these special . 

206
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:11,460
This happens in millimeter ways , so we behave differently , and we don't have the tools to access them , and really , really have that level of engagement that we do with the lower bans . 

207
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:35,860
And so we were hoping that we learn through kind of collective research and and just being able to have more researchers do , and their flexibility of programming the spectrum and and changing the way that they engage the spectrum , maybe hundreds of times per day to tweak , to tune something to to see how things behaved differently . 

208
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:44,450
That's the level , level of access that the device of casualties can give us two to the state of spectrum , this unknown space that works you were trying to operate. 

209
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,447
Okay , so what , just a couple of things like one is , it is very interesting to hear you are making a possible . 

210
00:24:50,447 --> 00:25:02,830
The crowd source investigation in areas of the electronic expectation that had not really been that accessible to as many this program will open it up to the question now is , then , how do you connect this to say the dark mission? 

211
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:20,580
Which means the complexity of of interacting with the large amount of them is well beyond what we can do with the numbers and resources that we have within the do d and so for us to take advantage of it . 

212
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:34,400
We really have to to engage the wider community and learn from them and build a mass of a research and research body that can help us tease the part . 

213
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,250
What's really important , what's not , what's effective . 

214
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,080
And what is it ? 

215
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:54,640
So what were were balancing the need for technological superiority in surprise , but with building a better understanding and engagement with this incredibly complicated , but force that we , we use for all of us stuff. 

216
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:08,104
Right , so we're getting to the end here , but you just made me want to ask you a certain question , or someone who has been so mercy in the electronic mechanic phenomenon to the point that you actually tattooed maximum occasions on your arms . 

217
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:18,310
And when you look out at air at the end , you're bringing in a sort of radio sensitivity in a radio kind of mine said , yeah . 

218
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:29,440
So you know how health failed every little millimeter of the air is , so must be a kind of very rich thing to have that understanding emerging industry , in which is your sense of nature. 

219
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:38,642
Yes , I actually think it does , you know , the ultimate force operates on this level of visible late that we see through our radio waves at the community . 

220
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:42,055
As it said , the satellite is the phones to their wireless . 

221
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:43,460
Senators , obviously not . 

222
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:56,710
It is in this sweet spot for us to use , manipulate and in bad information , and so we can move this , how we , we get over information moved around the world is through electronic development force . 

223
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,580
That's the decade . 

224
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:05,120
It's not just to play with is for the second playing with ways , but it is connecting information and moving information around us . 

225
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:32,330
So so when I think about that , what you just said , that kind of poverty , sense of the world being surrounded by electronic waves , when I really see is this , this interface of of information , which has been important to us as society , to move our , to move our stories around , to move friendships around to our economies , all that embedded in the fourth in some way . 

226
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,120
And again , that's what we are trying to help understand better and expose more people. 

227
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,590
We have worked with them . 

228
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,140
Nicely said , I just actually met one more question before really close out . 

229
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,410
And it has to do with the internet of things . 

230
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:51,110
This , the billions of various gadgets , smaller and large that are striving for . 

231
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:59,980
Since , you know , two of the electoral magnetic spectrum to give a receive signal , sensor , signal , signals in geolocation date and all kinds . 

232
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,010
And the second right now , this is probably another ten thousand of these internet of things . 

233
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,390
Gadgets such as one online . 

234
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:14,740
So when you think about that explosive growth and the program , so that it seems of your programs , what's the interviewer there? 

235
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:29,908
It's been since the three , geez , like since then , nine days since the world has been this excited about wireless technology for , and part of it is IOT , because all those devices need to communicate over the spectrum . 

236
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:37,032
And I don't go so far to say the special message , scarce resource it is , it is a renewable resource . 

237
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:40,120
It's not like if you one hurts , it is gone forever . 

238
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,830
You can use it , but it doesn't become congested . 

239
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,510
It does . 

240
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,790
They do step on each other that what we call interference in the military campaign jamming . 

241
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:54,955
Though these , these devices communicating this understanding of the automatic spectrum . 

242
00:28:54,955 --> 00:29:09,674
So just thinking about it from the ability to see and engage to the automatic is one of the things that cannot be necessary for us to tease apart these challenges of making these billions of devices can work and communicate together . 

243
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:26,429
The second thing is all of the personnel we do the way what I lead to call manuva bill , being manufacturer of changing frequency is changing away forms of avoiding other signals that you can communicate all that the stuff is going to take processing power . 

244
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:28,237
And all these IOT voices are . 

245
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:30,722
Many of them are connected to war power . 

246
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:36,146
They got batteries , so you have to build better , more effective processing capabilities . 

247
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:45,942
The process of so the radios have to be more efficient are programming and applications use of those sources , powers the scarce resource here . 

248
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:54,816
And so that's those two key aspects of how do we use the radio spectrum efficiently , and how do we manage our battery lies on these edge processors . 

249
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:03,248
The edge devices are better powered , both of those who can see themselves in the programs between ideas or program to the heritage program to STR. 

250
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:06,090
Four points out trying to make can combine a lot of. 

251
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:14,010
Well , attempts you usually are on at the four friends of many of the most important technological true jackets of these times . 

252
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,430
Really exciting . 

253
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,070
So i'm , we're getting gonna add to the end of this . 

254
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:24,600
I just wanted to give you an opportunity to let me know what question I didn't ask in your poll that I didn't ask it . 

255
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,620
And if there is a question like that asked answer. 

256
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:44,570
Real quick side and know when the middle of of contracting for new program that we call data protection and virtual environments in this is creating a new process to solve a hard cryptographic problem to allow us to compute on a credit data . 

257
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:52,730
So nothing about all of your , your personal data that exists in the cloud , or on another server somewhere . 

258
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,100
If it's always incriminated , then then deeper leaks start to become , I think of the past. 

259
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,926
No , that's a gorgeous program , because all of us are super anxious about the integrity of our data . 

260
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:06,081
But we also know that it , we can use this data . 

261
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:09,608
Really , we might be able to really discover important things . 

262
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah , yeah. 

263
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:24,920
Until that , in my world of thinking about arrive and processing , and it all coming around to really , it's about controlling that leads me to the ultimate of , how do we protect that information as we're controlling? 

264
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:42,940
TOM were out of time , but I have to thank you for the worldwide of the discussion will recover so much of what you are overseen as the dark program manager , but also just really enjoyed hearing you talk about your views on the history of technology and how it unfolds in all the twists and all is fascinating . 

265
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,570
The users as stories of innovation . 

266
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,640
So thanks for sharing all the same day. 

267
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,356
