00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,550
Stealth technology the internet gps in the palm of your hand autonomous operation. 

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:31,310
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the cold war darpa, the defense Advanced Research projects agency has been a driver of technology. 

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:40,390
Welcome to voices from darpa a window unto darpa's core of program managers their job to redefine what is possible. 

4
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,020
My name is Ivan Amato, and i'm your darpa host for this episode. 

5
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:55,040
The last 1 I will host, I decided to collect observations that program managers have shared with me and you listeners, since as they reflected on their time at the agency. 

6
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,850
So many of them told me that the job was the best, most fun, most rewarding, most impacted job they had ever had. 

7
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:14,880
Even though they knew from the start that they would only have the job for a few years, that's how darpa rolls, you can get the dream job and bring your new blood to, but then you need to hand that dream job off to yet some newer blood. 

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,600
Let me start with the words of Peter h y num. 

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,270
The agency's deputy director, who in a previous Santa darpa from 1999 to 2003. 

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,830
Served as a program manager overseeing programs in electronic wrong fare and electronic communications. 

11
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,670
I love the way he described the program manager's job to me back in June of 20. 

12
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,070
I don't have a program manager quite literally invents tomorrow. 

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:02:00,650
The upward program managers have the leeway the authority to find the the best teams in the world to work on a particular problem, and then they have the authority and capabilities to drive to achieve the results that are of to them. 

14
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:09,310
Darker is a place where the program managers are the ones who really drive the ship, the office directors and the the front office. 

15
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,970
Our job is to make it possible for them to do that to give them the tools and to help them achieve their goals. 

16
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:26,880
A darpa program manager blames a research problem with a plausibility story with a deep awareness and knowledge of the state of the art, and that problem idea. 

17
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:37,080
A very careful idea with use cases and such as to why that problem is of great importance to national defence and to our military. 

18
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:46,380
And then how it can be executed as a research program and then how progress will be measured and assessed, and then who will be who will benefit from the results. 

19
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:58,010
How will those results transition into practice and again and again and again for 60 years now, darpa program managers have set up programs, have run them. 

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:09,680
And quite literally, that rigour, that passion that a program manager brings to the job will be saving lives 5 10 15 years from now. 

21
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,950
I am particularly grateful to Tyler mcquade. 

22
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:31,190
Who was a big ideas program manager in the agency's defense sciences office in September 2016, when he sat down with me in a studio on the 13th floor of darpa headquarters in Arlington for my very first podcast recording, I wanted to start with Tyler because my aim was for the podcast to be accessible to a wide audience. 

23
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,990
And I knew he would say things like this a coconut. 

24
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,890
It smells the way it does because a chemistry. 

25
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:51,400
But he also revealed that tantalized, what if mentality that I would encounter over and over again throughout my podcast recordings with program managers or pms, as they also are known, darpa, is that one. 

26
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,550
Place where. 

27
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,400
We are thinking about. 

28
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,140
Innovation unconstrained like, where can we go. 

29
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,510
Yeah, that where can we go? 

30
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:14,950
That could be a tagline for darpa, dev Palmer was another podcast guest earlier in the series at the time in late 2016, he was a program manager in the agency's microsystems technology office or M T O. 

31
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,730
He would leave darpa the next year. 

32
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:25,120
But in 2020 he came back as pm's also sometimes do to become mto's current deputy director back in our podcast discussion. 

33
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,370
He heaped a whole lot of love about working at Dora. 

34
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,600
Coming to darpa is like grabbing the nose cone of a rocket and holding on for dear life. 

35
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,440
It's a fast moving place that has a significant impact on the trajectory of technology for the nation. 

36
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:49,330
And being part of that is an incredible thrill, the idea that you can come up with a technical idea that's. 

37
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,090
Interesting to you. 

38
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,250
And create a community to pursue that ideas. 

39
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,850
Experience you won't get anywhere else. 

40
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,960
You can take flyer bets on crazy things like integrating magnetics with semiconductors, and people will actually soldier up and tell you how they're gonna do it. 

41
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:18,210
Blake beckstein has followed a similar path to deaf Palmer's he too started out as a program manager in his case in in the biological technologies office, and later took on some management responsibilities. 

42
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,900
I recorded him when he was still a newbie. 

43
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,250
Blake has one of those gleams in his eye that makes anyone think this guy is going to do something amazing after all. 

44
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,010
One of his ambitions has been to protect nothing less than food supply from both natural and engineered threats. 

45
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,250
Which is another way of saying biological wrong fare, well, I came to darpa because I saw a fantastic opportunity. 

46
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,050
For my research community, the darpa mission is unlike things that i've done in the past. 

47
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,040
Because the dark emission is to look at high risk, high reward. 

48
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:59,790
Projects that could benefit humanity in a sort of that 20 to 50 year time frame, and it also gives an opportunity to derest. 

49
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,490
Ah, some programs and some projects. 

50
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,270
So that they can actually come to light and and see you. 

51
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:21,930
So when the opportunity to come to darpa presented itself, I thought it was just this awesome chance to do some really great science, and I was encouraged because I was asked to think about things that traditionally weren't funded very well. 

52
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:28,970
You know, the positive that can come out of this and the world changing abilities that we're gonna gain is incredible. 

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,060
Beckstein came into darpa with an uncommon specialty and interest in agricultural biotechnology and food security for eber furu. 

54
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:46,540
Who was a darpa program manager from 2014 through 2018 in the agency's defense sciences, also brought in a unique mindset, and she was nervous about it. 

55
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:57,780
She was skeptical about how a mathematician like herself would fit in in my podcast featuring fur, which aired in March of 2017, I asked her what she thought she might be able to do at darpa that she could not do elsewhere. 

56
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,020
I say darpa is probably the best place to be. 

57
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:24,470
If you are an applied mathematician, in fact, I just say for if you're a mathematician and i'd like to solve problems because one of the greatest thing about darpa is dead, there is this wealth of information, wealth of problems that are important, and I have to say they're very, very cool. 

58
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:40,680
The coolness factor for problems to solve for a mathematician here is enormous because you feel that not only you're solving a problem that has importance, they're certainly broader impact. 

59
00:07:40,680 --> 00:08:01,300
As far as you know, you're solving important problems in national security, but you also feel like the problems are so rich that in some ways, there is so much to contribute the richness of the problem is maybe the the biggest driver, a motivating factor for anybody's, certainly for a mathematician. 

60
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:16,090
And I just want to add, and i've been saying that to my friends to my colleagues, anybody who would listen that why mathematics is actually very important to to darpa and encourage them to come feature program managers. 

61
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:24,120
Is that when you're encountered by important problems and you see that your your ideas. 

62
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:40,660
The role you have as a mathematician that not only you try to look at these particular problems, but you try to abstract out and coming with different representation that would yield better solution for these problems, so you basically see that your ideas are at work. 

63
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,940
I mean, what better satisfaction are there. 

64
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,380
Hear that mathematicians out there. 

65
00:08:45,390 --> 00:09:04,490
Don't forget about darpa could be just the place for you wage shen, who's nearly five year stint as a program manager or A P M for short ended in 2019, he reveled in the way darpa embraces the most fundamental kind of scientific in an R And D continuum that can lead to the highest technologies of all, obviously. 

66
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,770
Even within the us government, there are a number of organizations of fund basic research. 

67
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,470
The fund applied research that fund various projects along that continuum. 

68
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,300
And I think darpa has a very unique role. 

69
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,230
It's it's a role that spans the gap between basic research and applied science. 

70
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:34,530
Oftentimes, we're looking for the applications that seem impossible, whether it's you know, launching ah drones off of flying aircraft or you know. 

71
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:44,610
Detecting human trafficking online, all of these things are things that you know we're emerging capabilities 3 or four years ago, but now have proven to be possible. 

72
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,220
And so darpa's, in a very unique place that. 

73
00:09:47,340 --> 00:10:02,730
Allows us to push the technology beyond the theoretical stages to the point where we can actually see where the where the applications are going to be, so we're not builders of the ultimate technology. 

74
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:24,300
Right, and at the end of the day, we fund the research, and that research eventually becomes product types in other forms, but if you look at the you know progression of robotics and self driving cars, all of those ai technologies were curated out of darpa programs early on and have subsequently you know a ten year horizon after that become productized. 

75
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,440
The industry has been able to take it up, so we serve a very crucial role. 

76
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,890
And the reason that we can serve that role is. 

77
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,150
The program managers themselves, these folks come with the ideas. 

78
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:54,840
And they can see the horizon Jonathan fouth, who from 2015 to 2019 brought interests in the social sciences and social psychology to darpa as a program manager in the information innovation expressed to me in the middle of his P M stint, a multifaceted enthusiasm for his temp job at the agency. 

79
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,700
Darpa is such an amazing place that. 

80
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,670
It's hard when you're in A A. 

81
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:08,420
Field doing research and development and leading other people and doing it to not know about darpa to not know about the amazing things that darpa has done. 

82
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,700
So for me, it was it was very natural to boy. 

83
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,210
I could imagine at some point. 

84
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,900
Appropriately, in my career, I would love to serve at darpa and spend those four. 

85
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,420
Or five years in my life here helping. 

86
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,700
Arriving at darpa. 

87
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,470
There's a sense of incredible empowerment that with the. 

88
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,570
Wherewithal that you get to. 

89
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,200
Really make some extraordinary things happen, not just oh, i'm going to run a program. 

90
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,710
But no, i'm going to, you know. 

91
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,890
Write a seminal book with. 

92
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,360
The best people in the world i'm going to. 

93
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,470
Change a whole discipline. 

94
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,860
It's an amazing feeling, and when you do all of that and you tie it back to national security and feeling. 

95
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,130
Like you're serving your country, it's a great feeling. 

96
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,870
As you already have heard A P M job at darpa is temporary three or four years. 

97
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,150
Maybe 5 is typically what you get. 

98
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,430
That's not job security, but it has been a catalyst with individual and institutional achievement. 

99
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,400
I wholeheartedly agree. 

100
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:15,020
That one of the things that makes a successful organization, this idea of bringing pro managers in for a short amount of time get. 

101
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,500
The work done that they envision getting done and then leave in order for new blood to come into the culture and into the organization. 

102
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
It's important. 

103
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,010
That's Scott. 

104
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,210
Where's benassi of the tactical technology office I recorded a podcast episode with him this past April. 

105
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,140
Just a month before he finished his four year pm gig. 

106
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,820
By understanding that you have a very limited time in a very special place like darpa, it becomes your priority. 

107
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:49,580
You focus all of your time and attention, day, night weekends on whatever these projects happens to be, it becomes a passion. 

108
00:12:49,590 --> 00:13:07,150
It becomes your life and you can do so for a two to 4 five year period, where this is everything that you're focused on, but eventually human nature takes over, and eventually people either get burnt out or they no longer have newer ideas that needs to be brought to bear. 

109
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:14,390
And that motivation isn't necessarily, but it is time for other people to come in with their new ideas. 

110
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:29,260
And there's another new ones that happens to you have a program and you work this program for a couple of years, and you're focused on making it successful, and but sometimes a program manager can get viced, and by bringing in new blood or a new program manager into a particular case. 

111
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:39,920
They may see in a different light and maybe able to make changes that the other program manager didn't wasn't aware of or maybe just decided that it'd be better to go down a different path. 

112
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:54,230
It's a double edge sword, but I think in general doing so, we're bringing in new program managers into take care of programs ongoing as well as bringing their own in is really what makes us such a. 

113
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:06,720
A great place to work Peter h y num when he was serving as acting director of darpa during part of 20, outlined what he thought were some of the most important institutional traits that made darpa so successful. 

114
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,600
One of them was that temporary nature of the program manager role, but there were others. 

115
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:21,980
A darpa or originally when it was upper back in 1958, somehow the framers the people who put this machine together. 

116
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,530
Quite a few things, really, absolutely right. 

117
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:40,920
And it's those my view, those those few things, but of an enabled dopper to succeed over 60 years now and delivering and and continuing to deliver and invent tomorrow for the department. 

118
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:49,980
So the first of these three things is that to everybody who works on the technical side of darpa program managers, office directors. 

119
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,750
Front office, folk world, temporary and by design, we we come. 

120
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,940
We send we spent four years or so here and then we leave. 

121
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,520
We come from industry. 

122
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,460
We come from universities we come from elsewhere in the government. 

123
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,970
We come from the the military services. 

124
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,660
We do our job, we push hard and then we leave this one thing. 

125
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:21,140
Dapur also is a project agency, so there are no standing activities. 

126
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,240
Dark is not always going to do X Y. 

127
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,640
It's continuously changing. 

128
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:44,040
I'd like to say that in some ways, darpa is framed to catch the night guys or to be in it and to drive to the next level, so it's in the zeitgeist, and in some ways, it is that it captures it exactly, and that's what these two things enable us to do. 

129
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:53,670
People ephemeral people will temporarily and project based, and then the third pieces, darpa has no assets of its own. 

130
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,750
We have no laboratories. 

131
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:17,000
We have no test facilities, we have no factories, so we don't have a standing army of anything, so and it's perfectly framed as an institution to continuously track and drive and push the frontiers of knowledge applied to problems at real interest in importance to the military. 

132
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:33,510
For major Christopher or lawsky, who was a program manager in the tactical technology office when I spoke with him in the fall of 2017, it was access to the collaborations it takes to move audacious ideas toward real technology that was special about the pm job, the biggest. 

133
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,960
Thing i've learned since being a program manager is that the innovation and collaboration is it's a team effort. 

134
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,100
I don't do it by myself. 

135
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:51,750
There's no way I could begin the fathom to manage all these programs and all these efforts that are under by myself, so I have a great team, a great support team that helps our technical experts in the field in their fields. 

136
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,280
And that ultimately, even us is not the ones that do it. 

137
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:13,250
It's the engineers and scientists at companies and universities and defense contractors that we fund that are the ones that ultimately are gonna bend metal and write code, and they deliver these capabilities to war fires, but I can't forget the war fighters either, because their invaluable advice recommendations are also part of a loop. 

138
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,520
So it's a of ecosystem that results in the innovation that provides these new capabilities. 

139
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:33,420
It is those war fighters that were foremost in the mind of Rosa Alejandra Lukash when she joined the defense sciences office in 2017 D S L program managers conceive of an overseas, some of the agency's most fundamental science projects. 

140
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:44,310
In her case in the way collections of electrons behave in materials, among other really fundamental stuff, I spoke with her when she was about halfway through her three and a half year run as a P M. 

141
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,370
As an American. 

142
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,940
Not by birth. 

143
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,500
But by choice, you know, I have a deep love for this country. 

144
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,710
The admiration for this country and a sense of duty regarding you know, trying to have this country to continue. 

145
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,400
Be what it is right now, and the best way, in my opinion, is to try to see, okay. 

146
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,710
What are the needs of the people that are the forefront of defending the country that would be the defense. 

147
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,600
They they are forces in general, right. 

148
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,380
And so what is that is going to make that difference in terms of you know. 

149
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:27,990
Advances in technology advances, this is in research that can help this dismission, and clearly the archives at the forefront of all of these funding agencies on that particular direction, so I was very, very intrigued and curious and interested in being part of this particular. 

150
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:43,850
Our organization for that reason, before colonel Matthew Hepburn came to darpa's biological technologies office to work on the challenge of responding far more rapidly than ever before to threats from both known and new infectious diseases, he had been pushing that goal in policy jobs in circles. 

151
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,740
That's when he got a call from the then DSO director Jeff ling, who asked Matt if he wanted to come to darpa. 

152
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:57,130
Where he could try and turn policy into action in his case into the technologies it will take to prevent pandemics. 

153
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,670
One of our mantras at darpa is this idea. 

154
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,570
Inspiring, inspiring creativity and new solutions to problems. 

155
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:22,630
And oftentimes, we say by sort of recruiting and people who have not traditionally thought about our problems to help us with those solutions, and so you know, I would love for the listeners of this podcast to be more inspired to address the problems and infectious diseases. 

156
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,440
And and what I mean by that is, I always say, people like me. 

157
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,430
We've invested our entire careers and our life work into this. 

158
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:40,810
And we have deep knowledge of the subject, but I love the thought of people that have expertise in computer science in mathematics in what we would say, well. 

159
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,940
Maybe those fields aren't necessarily obviously related. 

160
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:51,760
That's who I that's how we're going to solve the infectious diseases problems of the 21st century, and so when I speak on this, it's almost part. 

161
00:19:51,890 --> 00:20:03,600
It's one part recruiting, and it's especially recruiting that may not have all of the biases of the traditional experts in infection disease to come up with a creative solution to solve it. 

162
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:14,920
Matt must have really liked his darpa chop because he left in 2019 after six years, a long timer in darpa terms for about half of the time that Hepburn was working in the biological technologies office. 

163
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:41,410
Brad ring hysen had been working first as the office's deputy director, then is the director I met ring Hyson in March, just as the World Health Organization declared that the spread of sars Kobe to infections had grown into a global pandemic into covid-19, partly because of the programs Hepburn had worked on ring hyacinth and his team of pms were in a position to deploy the darpa model of research and development to this new. 

164
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,230
Multifaceted crisis darpa plays a really important role for the the entire government, quite honestly. 

165
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:56,340
But specifically for the department of and that in its ability to predict what is emerging uh as threats to both. 

166
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,620
Our war fighters and our dod personnel. 

167
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,950
But also to the country as a whole. 

168
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:08,840
And that has been something that's been persistent through the entire lifetime of darpa, but specific to infectious disease and emergent disease, this is something over the last. 

169
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,310
Two decades darpa has been there. 

170
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:17,100
We've learned what is needed and what is required to be able to fight the types of outbreaks. 

171
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:26,120
And pandemic that we're seeing right now with some amazing program manager's amazing forethought that's happened back 5, 10, even 15 years ago. 

172
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:37,470
Program managers started thinking about an ideal world where we can have a rapid response platform where we could instead of having to develop vaccines over the course of years. 

173
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,300
Maybe even decades at at in time wouldn't. 

174
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,120
It be great if we had a world where we could reduce that. 

175
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:53,370
Research and development process down to a matter of potentially weeks or months rather than having to wait on that tremendously long time frame, which we know living through what we're living through right now. 

176
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,950
It's just too long, even though the job of darpa program manager is by definition temporary. 

177
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:12,850
Some pms like the job so much they come back dev Palmer, who we heard from earlier, had done that, so did David gunning, whose fingerprints are all over the ascent of Siri and the entire category of digital assistance. 

178
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,700
I've been here three times. 

179
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,580
Because to me. 

180
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,440
It's one of the most fascinating jobs you. 

181
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,220
Can have you're the pinnacle of new technology development. 

182
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,980
You have such a broad view of what's going on, and darpa gives you this incredible freedom to pursue. 

183
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,840
What you see is, you know, a vision on where where. 

184
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,660
Things should go and Fisher A P M in the defense sciences office, is another several timer at darpa. 

185
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:48,780
She got her start as a so called seat, a contractor working for none other than Tyler mcquade, he was the P M I featured in the very first episode of this podcast, cita S E T A stands for science. 

186
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:56,820
Engineering and technical assistant cedars, who often bring in phd, postdoc and top to your professional experience to the job. 

187
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,440
Work closely on the programs with the program managers essential parts of the team. 

188
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,470
When I asked Fisher during a podcast conversation in if there was something I had failed to ask her. 

189
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,760
This is how our conversation went well. 

190
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,980
You didn't ask me how fun this was. 

191
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,100
Well, tell me how. 

192
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:28,230
Well, this being the podcast, but also life in general at darpa, and I say that because we get to interact with amazing top notch scientists on a daily basis multiple times times a day. 

193
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:39,640
Um, and that's really exciting, and it's really fun, and it's amazing opportunity, and those are the folks that are doing the the hard work to implement all of the ideas that we might generate here. 

194
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:49,830
I'm really put them to practice and and again from you know, the perspective of coming to work every day and being humbled by that and being so excited and energized by what they have to bring. 

195
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,760
In terms of their ideas and their talents. 

196
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,340
Some program managers get the darpa bug earlier than others. 

197
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:04,800
Few have gotten that bug earlier than current BTO program manager Eric Van dyson, whose portfolio of programs are anchored in the molecular biology of disease and health. 

198
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:12,480
He told me an hour podcast conversation in 2020 that darpa had been on his mind since the nineteen eighties when I was in. 

199
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:19,060
Middle school, I would ride my bike over to the library in falls Church across from Marshall high school in northern Virginia. 

200
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,590
And I would go in there, and i'd read popular mechanics. 

201
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,850
And I'd read car magazines. 

202
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,370
And I started reading stories about darpa that. 

203
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:32,070
Was when we were starting to hear about some of the the computing technologies and the networking technologies that were coming out of darpa. 

204
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,310
As part of ah the unveiling of the internet and so. 

205
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,050
That got me interested in 2020. 

206
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:52,180
I spoke with current DSO program manager Mark Roble, who hadn't had darpa on his mind since he was a teenager, the way van descended, but he had long known about the agency when he started his P M stint in March 2019 one year later. 

207
00:24:52,180 --> 00:25:05,940
When it became clear that sars Kobe too had spread into a pandemic, robo began pivoting a program under his wing known as sigma plus, to see if the threat detection technology that was its focus could be adapted for early detection of. 

208
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:22,650
Viruses darpa does amazing things, and as a federal employee for how going on 12 years, I think now and as an active duty service member for 22 years, you know very few places in government. 

209
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,930
Do you have the real capacity to make change to innovate. 

210
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:35,670
To discover and to do amazing things, and darpa is one of those places. 

211
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:50,200
It's literally a dream come true to be a program manager here, never in my wildest dreams, did I think this was actually going to come to be, and now i'm here, and it's been an awesome year. 

212
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,750
It was an awesome year when I detailed, and i'm hoping for another few years of awesomeness. 

213
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,290
Before I wrap up my tenure here. 

214
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,350
John Francis Morgan. 

215
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,370
A current program manager in the information innovation office had a long career before coming to darpa. 

216
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:15,210
He had long thought about a stint at the agency, and when the time was right for him, he finally found himself in a technology playground that was as fun as he. 

217
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,590
Had hoped it would be coming to darpa was something i'd always wanted to do. 

218
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,410
But I needed to wait for the right time in my career. 

219
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,750
I wanted to be sure my son had graduated from college. 

220
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:45,960
I wanted to achieve certain milestones and also get some people in place at my old employer to make sure that the research could carry on, and I also wanted to have the right set of ideas for programs I didn't want to show up and wander around for a year. 

221
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:52,860
Trying to come up with an idea for a program, so I had my little basket of program ideas, and I came in the door. 

222
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,150
I was all excited. 

223
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:02,090
I started up and part of the reason for coming to darpa is there's several need things that darpa program managers get to do. 

224
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,630
1. 

225
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:11,700
They get to talk with other people who are who are in the organization and get their ideas and get them completely unfiltered. 

226
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,540
But the other one you can tap into researchers all across the globe. 

227
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,830
You call up and say, hi, i'm from darpa, and I was wondering what you were thinking about something. 

228
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:33,750
And usually the conversation will run far longer than you ever anticipated or you ever even planned, but you're sorry, when it's over. 

229
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,430
I've been able to talk with researchers at caltech at mit. 

230
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:57,160
And they'll call back with another idea afterwards that is unbelievably exciting, and for someone like me, yeah, having that kind of access is the greatest entertainment I could ever hope for the other big piece about this is you get to go see their labs. 

231
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:06,900
And you got to go see stuff happening, and as you can guess from being a pilot and from being a ham radio operator, I love to touch the technology. 

232
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,990
I love to play with it. 

233
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,470
I love to do things with it. 

234
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,890
Over and over again, I heard from program managers a sense of responsibility to war fighters, to the nation. 

235
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:23,280
To the taxpayers a sense of privilege and of gratitude the fae of all people got to do this job. 

236
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,490
The P M job. 

237
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:35,160
Here's how Tristan mcclair Begley, whose current portfolio of programs in B T O are all about helping word fighters remain healthy and heal from mental and physical injuries expressed to me this past July. 

238
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,100
Program managers exist in a A privileged space. 

239
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:52,789
We are given a lot of freedom with which to make decisions with which to resource efforts in order to produce research projects that are very near and dear to us. 

240
00:28:52,789 --> 00:29:02,890
There is a lot of I I would dare to say that you know, program managers are very personally invested in the the programs that they're responsible for, and so you know. 

241
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:13,310
We have a tendency to take things personally because they're there is that degree of relationship that exists between the ideas, the problems we're trying to solve. 

242
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:34,390
The reasons why we're trying to solve those problems and ultimately how the research is done, and I would say that despite that emphasis on the program manager, as this sort monolithic entity responsible for all of this fantastic research and pushing at you know the boundaries of what is you know currently possible. 

243
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:55,270
I would also say that it has been part of my experience that this is a profoundly collaborative agency that I spend a substantial amount of time in very productive discussions with my colleagues here at the agency, getting very different perspectives on a number of fundamental issues and questions. 

244
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,790
As well as the collaborations that I have both with the other government mental agencies. 

245
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:22,660
The end users who is ultimately going to take the thing that I tried to invent and turn it into some real enabling capability for national security, for rehabilitation for treatment for restoration in our veteran population in the you know, broader civilian population, and then also with the with the researchers themselves. 

246
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:30,370
That part of the job of a darpa program manager is not just coming up with clever ideas and setting things in motion. 

247
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:37,630
But also continuing to work and pay attention to what the research is producing. 

248
00:30:37,630 --> 00:31:04,190
What does it tell you about your initial hypothesis and any assumptions that you made and which of those things are ultimately going to be rejected, we don't learn as much from success as we do from failure, and so sometimes you just have to be mindful that and do your best to establish the appropriate balance between things that are practically impossible for a reason versus things that are practically impossible just due to a. 

249
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:22,190
Lack of innovation talk to just about any program manager, and they will tell you that darpa, as an institution, has enough of a track record to claim it has a special sauce, a special institutional culture that makes it about as impactful as any player can get in the innovation ecosystem. 

250
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,610
Here's how Tim Chung, A P M with the tactical technology office, puts it. 

251
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,830
I definitely believe darpa has a secret sauce that has continued. 

252
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,900
I've been able to generate both the ideas, but also create and execute and realize those ideas. 

253
00:31:38,940 --> 00:32:00,680
I think on the one hand, certainly from the tactical technology office from which I have, we really love seeing technologies demonstrated, so systems being brought together and realized in some sort of field tester demonstration, and I think that's one end on the other hands we're interested in creating whole new, you know, foundations. 

254
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,950
Whole new areas of research that hadn't really been thought about. 

255
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:09,840
And I think that being able to spend that spectrum and do it in the context of, you know. 

256
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,950
100 or so programme managers across 300 programs is is pretty phenomenal. 

257
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:23,750
During a podcast recording in the spring of 2020, Chung floated a neologism that captures some of the institutional audacity darpa is known. 

258
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:32,250
It also relates to part of the draw for scientists and engineers like Chung, who have been the masterminds behind challenge based programs. 

259
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:51,230
Including most recently for chang, the subterranean challenge known for short as sub T, that challenge was all about seating, a research community that will be able to develop autonomous and robotic systems that work in natural and human maids underground settings for national defense missions and for humanitarian tasks such as. 

260
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,510
Disaster response, i'd say one of the ways I describe darpa. 

261
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,950
This was one of my colleagues had previously described the research this way. 

262
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:09,790
Is there a lot of folks out there that might say some research is impossible or some vision is impossible, and my colleague at the time said, actually, no. 

263
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,370
It's not impossible. 

264
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,410
It's rather it's unpossible, it's just that it hasn't been done yet. 

265
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,480
It's not that it can't be done. 

266
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:28,780
It just hasn't been done yet, and i'd like to embrace that philosophy and everything that that i'd try to touch in the just because it hadn't been done before is not proof that it can't be done. 

267
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,940
In fact, it's a challenge to say that maybe i'm the one who can who, who can do it. 

268
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:40,140
And darpa really gives us both the tools and the inspiration and the kind of community. 

269
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:54,490
I'd say that both the support, but also my you know, program manager colleagues, when I see all the amazing things there making possible, it makes me think that the things that once might have been considered impossible or are simply. 

270
00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:11,520
Just opportunities for Bruce draper, a program manager in the information innovation office, one of the most exciting ways these provisional unpossibility Chung referred to unfolds is the way a darpa project can spawn entirely new and lasting fields of research and development. 

271
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:21,910
In a place like darpa, you can create programs that help define the field and and create intellectual communities of people that are trying to tackle brand new problems, and that's an opportunity. 

272
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,100
It's something you can do it dark with it. 

273
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,560
You just can't do anywhere else. 

274
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:38,610
That community building opportunity resonates with Sergey brutus, an I 2 o program manager colleague of drapers who came to the agency from academia and has been intent on recruiting performers from that sector into his cyber security programs. 

275
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:47,910
It has been behind several darpa successes that i've experienced personally to define a new direction. 

276
00:34:48,690 --> 00:35:01,560
Define a new trend, and put some grand Funding behind that trend in order to get academia to listen to well, this is the that you might be missing. 

277
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,540
This is the a cool thing that might. 

278
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:15,890
With time create its own first tier publication of any of journals and conferences, and there, I believe darpa has been greatly successful. 

279
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:23,870
And talk about things that have never been done before from 2016 to 2020, Mike fitty was a program manager in the defense sciences office. 

280
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:49,570
Where he took on programs with goals as mind soaring as extracting propulsive energy from quantum mechanical fluctuations inherent in space itself in a discussion soon before he left the agency in June 2020, fitty pointed out to me that the researchers, that is, the performers in darpa speak that program managers contract with to work on projects tend to feel that they are part of a team with crucial goals to achieve. 

281
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,780
And so they become motivated to perform not just for themselves. 

282
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,150
But really for the country. 

283
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:08,350
I think there's something special about upper in the eyes of our performers as well as those of us fortunate enough to work for the agency, I think that rapid turnover. 

284
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:27,470
That sense of urgency that very well organized structure that diaper has makes performers feel that they are engaged in something special when they get funded, and they want to give their best, and I do see a lot of performers who put in um. 

285
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:52,120
That really a lot of extra effort to make those deadlines, keep us informed, stay on track, they understand that we're usually in an arrangement with them where there's program managers were in regular contact and wearing involved month by month, quarter by quarter with with what they're doing, and they don't want to disappoint. 

286
00:36:52,740 --> 00:37:04,220
And they understand that the program has a goal and the goal was approved for good reason because it's addressing some need that the dod has. 

287
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,490
Air force lieutenant colonel c David Lewis is an African American program manager to get where he is. 

288
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:17,630
He had to overcome systemic racism and to seize those opportunities that did arise whenever and wherever they did. 

289
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,330
Because there's a phrase that we use in the air force all the time, and that is a bloom where you're planted, um. 

290
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,890
You know, of course, being in the military, we don't get to choose where we live. 

291
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,720
All the time. 

292
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,060
We don't necessarily get to choose what assignment. 

293
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:49,090
And we get assigned to, and so the phrase is to say that no matter where you are, do the best that you can do because it's going to help out the country, and you always have to be prepared for when opportunity knocks because you know opportunity. 

294
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:53,030
And my opinion shows up at everyone's door. 

295
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:08,270
The question is, what have you been doing to prepare for that opportunity, when it comes, it took a lot of preparation pretty much, I think over my entire air force career up until that point to be ready for this opportunity, and it's worked out thus far. 

296
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:29,810
Part of the opportunity, lieutenant colonel Lewis alludes to here has to do with the privilege that program managers enjoy to devote taxpayer money, a precious resource to tough and risky problems that are worth investing in because of how much could be gained for the nation by the solutions to those problems in late I spoke with program manager John Waterston. 

297
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:40,980
A former nuclear submarine crew member and now captain in the US Navy reserves, he thinks of darpa as something like a venture capital fund with a mission to further the cause of national security. 

298
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,880
I feel what we do at darpa is being a venture capital fund, right? 

299
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:57,670
We are a place where you can bring ideas and mature them so that they have the most impact going forward, so Dara, we don't have excessive bureaucracy. 

300
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,250
We're able to move fast. 

301
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:09,130
We got this advance, manage that everyone's motivated to succeed and good ideas that have the most impact, and that that's what makes me excited every day that I come to work. 

302
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,670
It makes every day different, and those two things kind of keep me pushing you. 

303
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:20,290
Know now for almost four years, make that five years now in our podcast conversation. 

304
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:29,420
Waterstone pointed to yet another crucial ingredient of darpa's unique success at conceiving of new technologies and capabilities and ushering them toward realization. 

305
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,190
That ingredient is an embrace of the valuable lessons that come from failure. 

306
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:41,280
I'm not judged on success of my Progress, so i'm very comfortable operating with a lot of risk. 

307
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:47,740
I've had a lot of failures along the way as a P M at darpa, forgotten rid of programs, things didn't succeed. 

308
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,160
They didn't fire me. 

309
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,550
What they did to say, what did we learn from it. 

310
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,280
And how do we make the next iteration of what we do better, it's often said to fail fast. 

311
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:03,510
And we take those losses, and we turn into something valuable and that, that what makes darpa a very special. 

312
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:22,520
Place that celebration of risk taking and positive valuation of failure are also part of what BTO program manager Seth identifies as one of darpa's most empowering traits and in a podcast episode we posted in February of last year, he noted with interest how other government agencies sometimes try to emulate the darpa model. 

313
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,830
And so darpa plays this very special role because it is known for being a cutting edge agency. 

314
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:36,140
It's known for pushing the boundaries, and and though our performers are highly qualified and highly skilled individuals, they don't. 

315
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:47,280
And teams of individuals, rather, they don't necessarily have to have shown that they can do this yet it's the latest and greatest in many ways can be the most risky as research, and that's an important role. 

316
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,050
I think that darpa fulfills is pushing that very cutting edge. 

317
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:59,890
Allowing people to take chances to try crazy ideas that are still grounded in good science and good concepts. 

318
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:14,350
But that might be outside the comfort zone of a lot of other parts of the federal government to fund, and I think that's why you see, and this has been spoken about for many administrations now other federal agencies trying to emulate darpa. 

319
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:21,440
Cohen told me he could not be more grateful for the opportunity to be part of an organization that others aim to emulate. 

320
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:29,190
I have to really say that darpa has been, as many people told me, it would be one of the best places I could ever imagine working. 

321
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:38,800
It is a fascinating agency filled with incredibly, a smart, motivated people who create an incredibly supportive work environment. 

322
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,780
So i'm very pleased to an honor to have been part of darpa and to continue to be part of darpa. 

323
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:53,970
Even though program managers at short timers have that hair on fire, urgency about doing their work, they also are working on hard problems with long time horizons. 

324
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:59,840
It's a disconnect that many of them, including Whitney Mason, who was a program manager in the microsystems technology office. 

325
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,900
Actually found to be tantalizing, something about contributing now to a return on investment that will take. 

326
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:20,410
Decades to unfold the thing that I think is the most amazing and the most impactful part about darpa is that I get to throw the dart really hard. 

327
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,790
I get to say i've done some research. 

328
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,980
I've talked to people, I think it's gonna work, but it might not right. 

329
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:37,590
Failing fast is an option if you learn something, and so you really get to explore the space of what might be impactful ten years from now. 

330
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:50,030
20 years from now, 30 years from now, as opposed to having to make sure that it works, which is also a valuable job, but my technology doesn't have to work in two years, it doesn't have to go on a tank in two years. 

331
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,460
It can be way out there and far reaching, and I think changed the world. 

332
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:04,830
I often heard from program managers during my podcast discussions that they viewed darpa as an ideal of technology innovation, yet it was an ideal that was real and operational. 

333
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:19,710
One of them is Gordon killer, a program manager since 2017 in M T O, where he and colleagues are doing their darndest to keep the 70 year sprint of the microelectronics and microsystems technology revolutions going far into the future. 

334
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,180
This is what he told me. 

335
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,180
I had no doubt really in my mind. 

336
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:34,130
Darpa was clearly the pinnacle of doing innovative scientific research and development and leading the community to go to New York. 

337
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,120
New things, indeed. 

338
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,480
That's darpa's thing. 

339
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:43,460
And killer speaks for everyone else at the agency when he invites innovators out there to think about collaborating with darpa. 

340
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:49,760
Good ideas come from everywhere, and you mentioned the limited tenure that we have at darpa. 

341
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:57,760
We're always looking for new people, and so if you've got ideas, I care a lot about optical micro system, so for sure, come see me. 

342
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,120
If you've got ideas in this area. 

343
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,220
But you know, ah, get involved, darpa is not one person or one place. 

344
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:16,930
It's a collection of people that are excited about moving technology forward, and so you know, maybe you want to be a A program manager, maybe you want to work as a seat and maybe you want to be a performer and keep doing research search, but reach out and get involved with Dr. 

345
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,280
You might say that darpa director Stephanie Tompkins has gotten involved with the agency. 

346
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,520
She runs the place now, but her current position is just one of the four jobs she has had at darpa. 

347
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,090
And she says the program manager position is one of the best. 

348
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,170
I've been extraordinarily lucky. 

349
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,910
To have so many different jobs at darpa, i've been a program manager. 

350
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,530
I've had leadership roles in technology offices. 

351
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,880
I even served a year as the acting deputy director of, and then I left. 

352
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,200
Out before ever a few years ago or so, I thought, don't get me wrong. 

353
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,880
Getting a chance to come back and serve this organization as its director is a tremendous privilege. 

354
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:59,200
But the program manager is the center of darpa, the pms each and every one of them have a chance to change the world. 

355
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,010
And I can't think of any simpler way to put it. 

356
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,940
They come in with ideas that they think will make the nation more secure. 

357
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,080
They put together their plans and very quickly get an army of brilliant people working on these ideas. 

358
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,160
The rest of us are dark by our job. 

359
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,400
Is just to support the program managers so they can get on with their jobs. 

360
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,100
Of changing the world, it's just such an amazing place. 

361
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,000
I can't think of anywhere else I have ever been or ever heard of that works quite like this one. 

362
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,040
On with as much freedom. 

363
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,060
It's just extraordinary. 

364
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:57,310
Thanks, listeners, for sharing this time with me and with some of the program managers who have joined me over the past five years to capture some of the psychological, sociological and cultural foundations, and that underlie darpa's exceptional place in the innovation ecosystem, I look forward to handing the voices of darpa podcast off to my colleagues in public affairs and hearing the innovative new ways they are likely to take so listeners goodbye.
