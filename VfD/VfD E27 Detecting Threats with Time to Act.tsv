EDL	00:00:11,660	00:00:17,760	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Stealth technology, the internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, are tonight with operation
EDL	00:00:20,790	00:00:23,040	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Technology is a driver of our times
EDL	00:00:23,040	00:00:31,130	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Since its founding a nineteen fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, doubt the defense advanced research has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:31,670	00:00:39,180	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA, a window onto dark as core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:39,730	00:00:49,650	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	My name is ivan, a motto in your dark host today, and please to be with doctor mark, robot, a program manager in the defence sciences of since twenty nine team mark
EDL	00:00:49,650	00:00:56,818	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And I are recording our conversation from our respective homes as we do our part to slow the spread of coffee nineteenth
EDL	00:00:56,818	00:01:01,086	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	This is also why you might hear some ambient sounds like birds, simply even thunder
EDL	00:01:01,086	00:01:05,434	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	My heart goes out to all of those in the USand around the world
EDL	00:01:05,434	00:01:10,000	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	We're in doing grievous losses, stresses and anxieties due to the bank
EDL	00:01:10,000	00:01:23,200	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Now, a little bit about mark first adelaide, he has made his primary concern to help develop technologies that can counter weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threat
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:27,675	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Today, we will focus on one of the programs that overseas, the sigma plus program
EDL	00:01:27,675	00:01:33,902	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	We will learn how it quickly arrive as the current copyright nineteen pandemic on falls in the coming months
EDL	00:01:33,902	00:01:41,392	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And as we learn how to manage the ongoing presence of the all of this devastating new coordinate virus, proud to joining the door
EDL	00:01:41,392	00:02:00,000	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	But mark was a lead program manager for the department of homeland securities, countering weapons of mass destruction office and the former domestic nuclear detection of mark, a retired USair force officer, earned a doctorate and environmental health sciences with the concentration and health physics from the university of mission
EDL	00:02:00,000	00:02:06,826	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	He holds a master degree, nuclear engineering from result, your pilot technique institute, mark, thanks for joining me
EDL	00:02:06,826	00:02:08,687	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Thank you very much for having me
EDL	00:02:08,687	00:02:11,200	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	I went so before we talk about this program
EDL	00:02:11,200	00:02:15,660	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	I'd like to know something about the urgence of your drive to do something about weapons of mass destruction
EDL	00:02:15,660	00:02:19,080	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And what will the influence is that like you in that direction? 
EDL	00:02:19,080	00:02:35,990	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Well, at growing up with the early sixties and and was kind of that dark and covered error, a little bit, little bit after that, but I was certainly very much growing up during a time of these hiking concerns with respect, nuclear analysis
EDL	00:02:35,990	00:02:47,830	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And can I stop with me that and the program novel, I was kind of addicted to growing up, and I just got this passion to kind of learn about all things, nuclear
EDL	00:02:47,830	00:03:07,918	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And so subsequently, when to answer there, my new engineering degree, I had also been an artist sea at the time, and the yarn force in the, in the wisdom, decided to take my new continuing degree and put it towards health, physics community and how physics for those who may not be familiar with the profession is all about protecting people from radiation
EDL	00:03:07,918	00:03:30,700	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So I did that for twenty two years and year force, and so nuclear and religious threads with something that I, it's kind of steep down during my entire fourth career that LED me to the defensive reduction agency, when I retired from the air force, where then my research focus became, how do I develop new tools and capabilities to control the threat of nuclear terrorism
EDL	00:03:30,700	00:03:50,760	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And that then worked it way into the palm of online security, where I focused on nuclear terrorism, and then, through evolution of that organization, we expanded our horizons to the complete coming weapons of mass destruction, threats, so that enhanced with chemical and biological threats
EDL	00:03:50,760	00:03:57,440	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So it's been kind of fine since just growing up is a little care about this description, what we can do. 
EDL	00:03:58,310	00:04:01,590	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So much knowledge or grown up and running the sigma plus program
EDL	00:04:01,960	00:04:18,970	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	I'd like you to tell me and listeners about that program, which is the following to the sigma program, and should point out that earlier program and by former program management in the tank, was all about creating a distributed sensor network for detecting and monitoring nuclear and radiological threats in real time over large areas. 
EDL	00:04:19,700	00:04:24,810	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So you know, a little bit about signal plus, it is building on what was done
EDL	00:04:24,810	00:04:35,370	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So we're adding the capabilities to detect chemical threats and biological threats in a large scale region or in complex environment
EDL	00:04:35,370	00:04:50,460	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And that in the end of itself, is a significant challenge to taking radiation in urban environmentals, many different sources of the nine radiation that don't care about which we got a train or technology to ignore. 
EDL	00:04:50,830	00:04:56,310	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Where is even buildings right to the healthiest geological materials eliminated? 
EDL	00:04:56,310	00:05:07,138	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Exactly, and the patients coming out of a hospital who made it, my have had a fun of suitable treatment that had that had radio isolates associated with many different bananas sources
EDL	00:05:07,138	00:05:18,370	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So we need to have algorithms that are able to differentiate what we care about real threats, forces what we don't in read that that's very manageable
EDL	00:05:18,370	00:05:45,703	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And you think about a chemical environment, and as city, any city peaker city, there is always these constant emissions coming from businesses, coming from factories, coming from bruise, coming from research facilities, and those create the to very complex chemical background, and weren't again challenged to differentiate all of this benign background material from things that we care about
EDL	00:05:45,703	00:05:49,740	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	What are we care about things that obviously can cause as harm
EDL	00:05:49,740	00:06:06,754	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Michael li, and this can be chemical offer agents or taxi conductor chemicals, but were trying in similar, plus to move detection to what we call the left boom that before, naturally, when occurs, were trying to be able to detect the threats before they actually are used to cause harm
EDL	00:06:06,754	00:06:17,639	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So in the chemical space and means trying to detect somebody perhaps cooking and a hazardous compound that could be a homemade explosive, it could be an opportunity
EDL	00:06:17,639	00:06:38,060	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	It could be a natural campaign region and tried to attack the fugitive emissions that would be associated with somebody cooking one or more of these hazardous materials and detecting that in this very complex chemical background, that is what our urban environmental bright stuff
EDL	00:06:38,060	00:07:02,540	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	The same problem exists in the biological front we were trying to collect large firms of air, since in that air are their passengers present in differentiate those potential passages that might be associated while terrorist attack from all the other naturally occurring stuff that in the atmosphere, this could be power, and it could be things are in the environment
EDL	00:07:02,540	00:07:07,520	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Society with all the natural biological processes go on. 
EDL	00:07:07,520	00:07:13,910	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	The other region, so things in the environment, including source, could be to the causes of agent
EDL	00:07:13,910	00:07:15,060	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Okay with one thousand. 
EDL	00:07:15,060	00:07:17,941	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	That's right, we are actually trying to direct
EDL	00:07:17,941	00:07:26,173	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	This is what you mentioned earlier, some of our research, sea candidates actually detect south korea too, with and generating a unique signature
EDL	00:07:26,173	00:07:27,820	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Right, that's, that's the key
EDL	00:07:27,820	00:07:43,910	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	We need to be able to see if these technologies can generate things that are unique to south korea tour and current viruses, perhaps more broadly, and and be of the differences that from all the other things that are in the environment. 
EDL	00:07:44,250	00:07:44,490	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	right
EDL	00:07:44,490	00:07:46,290	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So let me just drilling to that a little bit
EDL	00:07:46,290	00:07:48,440	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	I mean, I know of the sigma program
EDL	00:07:48,440	00:08:00,000	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	It delivered kind of hand, health size praps other kind of formats of the radiological sensors that could be distributed all over the place in that data converging into a cloud based and political environment
EDL	00:08:00,000	00:08:08,639	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Here, i'm wondering what is the signal that a modified or sort of enhanced instrument that also now can look at biological threats
EDL	00:08:08,639	00:08:11,500	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	What is the signal that looking to detect it? 
EDL	00:08:11,840	00:08:13,700	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	There's one technical approach
EDL	00:08:13,700	00:08:17,670	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	We're doing something called romance, but cross could be where we take a sample from the air
EDL	00:08:17,670	00:08:23,690	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	We eliminate it with a laser and at laser in racks with the molecules that are present in that deposit
EDL	00:08:23,690	00:08:34,940	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	There's those multitudes undergo some play borrowers based on the slight stimulating at this lazy lights, stimulating again as warm and signature
EDL	00:08:34,940	00:08:39,880	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	That thing is measured, and there's a characterization that's done to see
EDL	00:08:39,880	00:08:51,436	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Does this virus have unique signature in roman space in the spectrum that's been generated, and we're bringing those measurements right now to see if that's the case
EDL	00:08:51,436	00:08:55,708	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	That's one technique, the other technique, that's a little bit further behind
EDL	00:08:55,708	00:09:03,166	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	But we're also thinking about how it may be applied to the space is taking and then analyzing it with actual DNA sequencing
EDL	00:09:03,166	00:09:22,560	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So taking a large function, assemble, concentrating whatever erasers might be, not simple, and then having that be analysed within several hours, ideally to see, is the packaging person in a serious animal, but based on the orange signature that would be associated with the crown of virus
EDL	00:09:22,560	00:09:25,730	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	What that affords is the ability to look at
EDL	00:09:25,730	00:09:35,880	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Now, the virus may evolve over time, because the original sequencing is kind of absolute detection of that passage in the environment
EDL	00:09:35,880	00:09:39,100	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And how that army may change over time. 
EDL	00:09:39,530	00:09:48,527	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Okay, it maybe you can talk to me and tell our listeners a little bit about what would happen if if you actually succeed in developing the technology, which I suspect you will
EDL	00:09:48,527	00:09:57,770	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	How will environmental monitoring fit into the overall challenge of sort of managing a new world in which, you know, this crown of viruses is part of our reality. 
EDL	00:09:58,150	00:10:07,210	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	IIsee crown virus has been subset of what is going to be a continual concern, and it is the threat of either pandemics, such as this
EDL	00:10:07,210	00:10:14,010	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Maybe that next crown of virus that can pop out somewhere, or the thread associate with your names
EDL	00:10:14,010	00:10:21,466	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	State actual development of passengers using these new tools and capabilities associated with synthetic biology
EDL	00:10:21,466	00:10:33,924	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So the entire development is trying to do something about that to get as close as we can detect kinds of events from environmental perspective, so that public health measures can be involved
EDL	00:10:33,924	00:10:40,270	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Countermeasures can be developed as expected as possible for future threats are coming down the line. 
EDL	00:10:40,270	00:10:48,442	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Interesting, in your case, you, you started at the top of the program manager in twenty one thousand, nine hundred and one month mark
EDL	00:10:48,442	00:10:49,610	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	When did you start
EDL	00:10:49,610	00:10:56,800	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Was much nine months later, covered nineteen begins to take hold in and dry, or maybe even less than nine months
EDL	00:10:56,800	00:11:00,000	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And then from there goes on its tour of the world
EDL	00:11:00,000	00:11:06,851	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So does it is now, what was the luck, you know, as cobber nineteenth became a reality when WHOdeclared it a pandemic
EDL	00:11:06,851	00:11:16,460	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And we had that change the way you thought of yourself as a program moving forward with your particular programs, which we actually do not have potential relevance of. 
EDL	00:11:16,460	00:11:18,170	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So we were gone down the pack
EDL	00:11:18,170	00:11:25,300	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Materials technologies to address as biological space, as was the chemical threats base
EDL	00:11:25,300	00:11:29,410	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And it was the only one that really kind of came home to us that we think about
EDL	00:11:29,410	00:11:30,850	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	All right, things are getting serious
EDL	00:11:30,850	00:11:32,630	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Now, what can we do to fight the
EDL	00:11:32,630	00:11:44,200	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So we started to till, and at the same time we're trying to till and do so where it makes sense were also focused on that longer term capability
EDL	00:11:44,570	00:11:46,430	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	That's gonna be needed for the next rate
EDL	00:11:46,430	00:11:49,030	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	I think that's the balance that we need to strike
EDL	00:11:49,030	00:11:57,570	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Let's support where we can and where makes sense, but we have a mission to preventing strategic surprise
EDL	00:11:57,570	00:12:06,750	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Single plus, we believe, I believe it's going to help address that from potential future events that we need these capabilities to detect an article. 
EDL	00:12:07,610	00:12:29,080	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Mark, if we gave out sigma plus such a successful and point where we know how technology that will be able to this kind of environmental monitoring of biological threats, whether there once they emerge naturally, like these sort of analysis, types of events that spill over from animal origins to humanity, or or whether it is not serious origins
EDL	00:12:29,390	00:12:33,610	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	What value is the information that you get from the environmental monitoring
EDL	00:12:33,610	00:12:36,930	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	How would the knowledge go to decision making in and taking actions? 
EDL	00:12:37,470	00:12:45,184	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	The concepts of operations for what we're developing within six months, kind of calls for persistent monitoring capabilities
EDL	00:12:45,184	00:12:51,330	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So this would be a mobile platform s we may think about taking advantage of public transport
EDL	00:12:51,330	00:12:59,156	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	We may think of taking advantage of things like first respond of vehicles that are constantly circulating through a city or region
EDL	00:12:59,156	00:13:01,489	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	He put them with new sensing capabilities
EDL	00:13:01,489	00:13:10,000	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	And I would just constantly be moving through that environment, sampling the year, looking for these threats or precautions to these threats
EDL	00:13:10,000	00:13:13,002	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	That information would then be networked
EDL	00:13:13,002	00:13:18,255	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So we would constantly be seen what the background environment looked like
EDL	00:13:18,255	00:13:18,756	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	running
EDL	00:13:18,756	00:13:25,271	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Advanced analytics are no sense of fees and fusing that data with other forms, textual information
EDL	00:13:25,271	00:13:40,410	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So in the case of both chemical and biological threats, and I may want to know what the local meteorological conditions, where they are going, where is going, I may want to look at a capture of a video associated with when I do get something anonymously
EDL	00:13:40,410	00:13:48,350	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Is there factory or building there that might be associated with what that anonymous chemical event was
EDL	00:13:48,350	00:13:56,960	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So an example of that is, if i'm dragging around the city, and I drive past a news line, and I pick up as a town, well, that can make sense, right
EDL	00:13:56,960	00:14:06,888	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So if I know where my vehicle is my pop, a map map is providing context to what that sensor is saying, and I can do the same thing and biological space too
EDL	00:14:06,888	00:14:22,460	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	So having this fuse data pulling in these other forms of contextual data and having that all be presented to say, a fusion center or a dispatched operator, somebody who is watched off a surface while who was looking at the data
EDL	00:14:22,460	00:14:46,560	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	The algorithms are helping with sense, making a lot what those sensors are seeing in the environment and were able to then throw this process bill to reduce false alarms, and yet also improve a judiciary, true events and then deploying capabilities as necessary to either improve our confidence that he, this is, this is suspicious
EDL	00:14:46,560	00:14:55,500	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Let's go send another sense right there to take a second sample and see if its persistency is there, or just say it now, that was a false positive
EDL	00:14:55,500	00:15:04,315	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	We can let that call being able through these advanced analytics to have a smart air jail system that is continuously learning about the environment
EDL	00:15:04,315	00:15:11,003	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Now we're talking about machine learning techniques that are learning about what's typical for environment
EDL	00:15:11,003	00:15:25,670	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	What's not been able to strike these anonymously detections that could be associated with an actual threatening, detected or bad actors trying to execute, adopting the attack by sympathizing making a capability. 
EDL	00:15:25,670	00:15:27,812	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	Quite an amazing vision there
EDL	00:15:27,812	00:15:48,990	| VfD E27 Detecting Threats with Time to Act |	It makes me think about in doubling the constructed landscape with a kind of century system and nervous system and analytics system, specifically enough to certainly be able to monitor in response to rights of weapons of mass destruction, so may make you succeed, because I think a lot of us would benefit from that
