EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,920	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I was 8 years old
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:29,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Living at my grandfather's house out in the country
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:33,600	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And I can remember him taking me out in the yard at night
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:38,208	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To see the light of Sputnik as it's flying overhead
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:40,768	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You're kind of conveying what a shock this week
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:41,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Where were you
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:42,816	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Complete the setting
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:44,352	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And Covington Kentucky outside

EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:47,424	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that at the time
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:51,776	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Also not only spark DARPA but sparked a huge interest in technology
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,848	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	My there's a huge interest in encouraging
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:57,664	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Young minds to be interested in engineering and science
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:59,968	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Remember that is kind of a
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:00,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Ark
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:01,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Started it
EDL	00:03:01,504	00:03:05,600	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Later on I was in Otterbein College in Ohio in the
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:07,392	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Late 60s early 70s
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:12,768	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know during this kind of Rapid change and a lot of cultural chain going on
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:15,328	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I became very interested in psychology
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:16,608	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that was my first
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:18,656	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Technical interest just how did people
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:23,776	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right people are clearly the issue and most of the problems we have today and
EDL	00:03:23,776	00:03:26,336	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	How does that mind work and what could we do about
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,104	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Eliquis
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Starting pay
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And then I
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:33,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Did that went through got a master's degree in Psychology started work
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:39,392	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a human factors engineer which was one of the practical uses of that
EDL	00:03:39,392	00:03:40,928	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Psychology degree I had
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:45,792	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And then very quickly the first jobs I had were too
EDL	00:03:46,560	00:03:52,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Look at the human factors of how they were introducing electronic displays into the cockpit
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:54,752	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Does a 19 late 1970
EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:56,544	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Kind of one of the first
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:00,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Are workplaces to be automated if you would
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:03,200	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Pilots were getting the most advanced technology
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:06,272	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They're putting electronic displays in the place of
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,040	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Instruments
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:11,904	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Pilots for making sub microsecond decision life-or-death decisions
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:15,744	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You want to make sure they get just the right information in just the right way
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:17,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know to make those to say
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:21,631	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that triggered my interest in computer science
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:27,007	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Because quickly became apparent that all the important aspects of this job were in computer soft
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:28,543	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:34,943	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Prompted my interest in computer science then went back to school to Stanford to get my master's degree in computer
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:36,735	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Are science and especially in AI
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:40,319	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That was one of ai's Summers if you will
EDL	00:04:40,831	00:04:43,135	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	There's a hole in the 1980s
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:47,999	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A lot of interest in expert systems in one of the first waves of AI
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:53,887	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that captured my interest and certainly was aligned with my background in cognitive psychology
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,727	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	David as I noted in my introduction you're now in your
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Third tour
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:00,031	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The program manager
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,799	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	DARPA
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,359	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The death of the later we'll talk about the programs you
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:04,639	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Who inherited in this latest
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:06,175	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Communicating with computers
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:11,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And the program that you initiated the explaining a guy but before we get to
EDL	00:05:11,551	00:05:15,647	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I'd like for you to take us on a brief tour of your prior to
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,415	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What time does the program
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:18,207	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So let's start
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:22,559	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	With how you and DARPA met for the very first time
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,607	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	As a p.m. I guess this was a 19-9
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:26,655	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Mission systems
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:32,031	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What is the said as they started off as a psychologist then switch the computer science
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:37,663	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In both those roles I was a researcher at the Air Force research Labs at Wright-Patterson
EDL	00:05:38,687	00:05:40,223	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So doing a lot of work at
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The time on the F-22 that was the latest
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,831	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Fighter aircraft of the day
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,647	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Now those computer displays that started
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:54,559	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know in the 1970s were very Advanced and in particular then I was working on a integrated
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,839	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Information maintenance system
EDL	00:05:56,607	00:06:01,215	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So now it was possible for the maintenance technician to walk up to a computer
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:04,799	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Walk up to the aircraft with a portable computer
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,079	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Plug it in
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:09,151	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Download information about what failures had occurred
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:12,991	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Get all of his tech manual instructions presented on the computer
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,295	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Create kind of an integrated
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:20,415	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know workplace for the maintenance technician to help him do his job the question about that because
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,695	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know when you go in
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,023	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Any garage tent have your own car looked
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:25,791	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Dad
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:27,583	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	There is a system very much like that
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:33,983	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes it's about this procedure this procedure that it was actually the very first prototype of electronic
EDL	00:06:33,983	00:06:35,263	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Maintenance instructions anywhere
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:36,543	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The services
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:38,079	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I did that
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:39,871	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Did that time on my program
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:46,015	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so I was doing that work that got the attention of the general who is running the F-22 program
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:52,927	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	He pulled me into the F-22 the kind of man age in coordinate of the development of all of his digital
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,695	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Ecology
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:58,303	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And while I was there some people from DARPA came to visit the try to convince the skeptic
EDL	00:06:58,303	00:06:58,815	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	General
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:03,167	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Oh that they should listen to DARPA and adopt some of their new technology
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:07,007	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So he expressed how skeptical he wasn't
EDL	00:07:07,007	00:07:08,799	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Pretty graphic way and said
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:12,383	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If you're going to do something on the F-22 you need to convince Dave
EDL	00:07:12,895	00:07:13,663	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	He's my guide
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:18,783	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Computers that was with the Steve cross who is deputy director of one of the offices

EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:33,887	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so I began to interact with those guys and when go left
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:36,191	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	DARPA after his tour was done
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:40,799	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Then they invited me to come to DARPA to be a p.m. in 1994
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,359	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I just I find an interaction you mentioned
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:46,687	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The general quite interesting because it reflects a conservatism
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:47,711	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:48,479	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The services
EDL	00:07:48,479	00:07:51,295	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Is have because they want to work with tried-and-true systems and it's a
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:52,063	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A bit scary
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:53,087	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Bring a new techno
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,367	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Knology which does not have as much
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:56,159	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Track record but then you were there
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,463	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	As someone really a champion of the new
EDL	00:07:58,463	00:08:02,559	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes a champion of the new in a very conservative environment it's not that there
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:08,191	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Technology adverse these people are very serious Engineers are building this aircraft
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:10,239	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	With enormous life and death
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,287	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know consequences if it's done incorrectly
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,359	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So they don't want to put anything in that airplane
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:17,919	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right unless they really know
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,431	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But they can depend on
EDL	00:08:18,943	00:08:25,343	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Give me a really solid understanding in background of where those people are coming from when you're trying to introduce new
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:25,855	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Technology
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:28,159	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Doing what you need to do to convince them
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,463	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	One thing that I noticed regarding your this first
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:32,511	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Tour of Duty is that not only did you come here
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,559	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You went full Mind and Body in
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If I'm reading your
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,607	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Background correctly
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:37,119	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You were
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,911	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Over c9pro
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,727	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Released in your period of 6 years in that
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,775	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Torrent they were 9
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:44,287	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Find programs on your
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,591	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yeah that's right I was starting
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:49,919	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	One or two new programs a year inherited a few
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:52,735	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know from other PMS but I was all-in
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:56,063	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I was a lot younger then had a lot more energy and
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:57,855	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But just love the job
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,391	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	She mention I've been through three times
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:02,719	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Cuz to me it's one of the most fascinating jobs you can have
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:06,303	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Pinnacle of new technology development
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:09,631	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You have such a broad view of what's going on
EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:15,263	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And DARPA gives you this incredible freedom to pursue what you see is you know what division ennui
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,031	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Where things should go
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,567	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That one of the standouts
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,079	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	From the
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:20,895	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	First work is known as command post of the
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,663	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The future
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,711	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And that one actually did get out into
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:26,527	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To the field so just briefly can you tell us a little bit about what the
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,087	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Goal of that program wasn't and infect how
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,111	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Howitzer
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,135	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It unfolded
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:37,535	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And of course my interest has been an AI all along and most of those nine programs I ran my first tour had
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,095	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Had to do with knowledge and reasoning
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:41,119	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Planning
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,935	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Trying to provide intelligent decision AIDS
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:46,751	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Two people so we created command post of the future
EDL	00:09:47,519	00:09:50,079	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know as a way to see if we could
EDL	00:09:50,079	00:09:51,359	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Explorer
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,151	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	All sorts of AI technology
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:54,943	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	See what worked
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:59,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Package that up into a system that Army Commanders
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:04,671	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Could use out in the field so we started that with a wide variety of Technologies of varying
EDL	00:10:04,671	00:10:09,023	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Degrees of maturity and risk and by time we got to the end of the program
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:12,095	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And I have left are but by then and there was
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,655	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Other people have taken over
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:18,495	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But the technology that survived was something that was
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:21,311	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Might call adaptive or intelligent visualization
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:26,175	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A lot of the more higher-risk AI techniques that actually kind of falling out this
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,687	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Too immature
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,967	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Bright
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:33,087	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But they had through a lot of iteration with some Visionary people from the
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,879	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Army Marine Corps Air Force
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:38,207	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And really kind of picked out the Nuggets of new technology
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:39,231	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They were incredibly value
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:45,375	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Basically was that if a commander and his staff could each have their own view of the battlefield
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:47,935	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In their command post the future screen
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,751	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So the operator saw the plans for the attack
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,591	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The logistics guy then so what did he have to do to support the
EDL	00:10:55,615	00:10:57,663	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Write the Intel guy just got to see
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:00,991	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What information was coming in on what the enemy would do neck
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:05,599	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In one of the commanders Army General Corelli who is the one who
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,391	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Champion didn't took it to Baghdad
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,487	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Ashley said that by watching his staff's
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:14,303	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Command post of the future screens
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:17,631	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	He had a better idea of what they were thinking
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,959	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Then he did if they were all in the same room talking to
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:25,567	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So would enable them to one be distributed which is very important
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:26,591	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Four the battle for
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:31,199	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The two gave him better insight into what his staff was thinking
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:33,503	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And where the bad how the battle
EDL	00:11:33,503	00:11:34,015	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Was emerging
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Fasting
EDL	00:11:36,063	00:11:38,111	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This event is a case where the
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:40,159	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Human machine interaction
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:43,231	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Something into something more than the
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:47,583	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes and parley critical part of that programs the way we set it up
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:50,143	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Was the have is constant iteration
EDL	00:11:50,655	00:11:51,935	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Between the technologist
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,239	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And the Visionary users
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:57,055	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right which is your Now call Dad Jewel
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:00,127	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Development there's a lot of
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:03,711	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Names that has pretty much been adopted by Silicon Valley as a religion
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:07,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But that strategy was pretty early in those days
EDL	00:12:07,807	00:12:10,367	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And they had a lot of exercises where they
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,135	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Play take the
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,183	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Researchers from the University
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:18,815	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Send them down to Fort Polk in the Army and actually put on the army gear and run them to exercise
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:21,375	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Realsense for what
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:22,143	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The problem was
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:29,055	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But they also had exercises where the Visionary military guys would work closely with the technologist
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:33,151	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To try to sort out what was the most valuable thing the technology could do
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,431	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	For user in the field
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:36,735	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And not just let the technologist kind of
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:39,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Hypothesize what that might be
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:40,575	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	With a somewhat naive idea
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:41,599	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But what's needed
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,671	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Some 2,000 you leave. But you go and do other things
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,975	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And in 2003 though
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:47,999	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You come back
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:49,535	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And this time you're in the information

EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:09,503	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Ron Brockman as the office Chiefs of this newly-formed office if
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:16,927	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And It Go was also the name of one of the original dark offices led by lickliter
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:22,047	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Is really where the personal computer was created where a whole idea of
EDL	00:13:22,047	00:13:26,655	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If those days are computer metal large Ivy and run frame just for listeners
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,191	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Lickliter is a
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,519	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Giant in the history of Dart but he's known as
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,335	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Usually is jcr licklider actually stands
EDL	00:13:36,127	00:13:38,175	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Joseph Carl robnett
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,943	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Lickliter
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:41,503	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And he really brought in an ethic of
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:45,087	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This idea that the human machine interaction in a symbiosis
EDL	00:13:45,087	00:13:47,391	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This was going to be a long long theme of
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,439	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	LG from then in the sixties when he
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:50,719	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Until now
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:56,095	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So David your View continuing the age of exactly I did before he came in
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:14:01,215	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Did what a computer meant was an IBM Mainframe that took up the size of a small room
EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:04,287	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And people would interact with it by
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:07,103	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sending Punch Cards into a punch card reader
EDL	00:14:07,103	00:14:09,151	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And getting an answer back on the other side
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:15,807	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	There was no concept of this being a personal computer you'd sit down with and interact with on a daily basis
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:19,391	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It was actually under his program is Alan Kay
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:22,719	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Who is that that Stanford at the time in later Park
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,511	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sketched out the first
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:28,095	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Diagrams of what we recognize today is the person
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,655	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Brighton park being Palo Alto Research Center
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,167	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly
EDL	00:14:32,191	00:14:34,751	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And Tony Rich so that was zip to ISO
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:38,079	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Tony Taylor and Ron Brockman they really wanted to bring that back
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:39,103	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They wanted
EDL	00:14:39,103	00:14:43,711	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To re-energize DARPA to go after the Next Generation
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:45,247	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Human-computer symbiosis
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:48,575	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And the phrase then was cognitive system
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:49,855	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Cognitive technology
EDL	00:14:49,855	00:14:53,183	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so Tony believed investing big in this
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:57,535	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so we came up with the idea for this program called pal
EDL	00:14:58,047	00:15:00,095	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Personalized assistant that learns
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:07,007	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Which even by DARPA standards was a fairly large program 250 million dollars over 5 years
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,799	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And it had multiple levels
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	One level that funded
EDL	00:15:11,103	00:15:15,199	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	20 some research universities and agencies around the country
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:19,551	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To explore a lot of cutting-edge technology in AI
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:21,855	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In particular machine learning
EDL	00:15:21,855	00:15:24,159	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Machine learning is now commonplace today
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:27,487	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Was just kind of emerging technology in those days
EDL	00:15:27,999	00:15:32,351	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So it funded a huge amount of basic research on machine learning
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:34,143	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Let me just stop you for a second
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:34,911	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Listening to me
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:36,959	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Not really know what that means
EDL	00:15:36,959	00:15:38,239	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We can't go into a full
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	How would you define that
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:46,431	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Willne earlier days of AI we tried to develop intelligent systems by having people
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:48,735	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Program rules
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:50,783	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Soar statements into a system
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:54,111	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That would tell it what the knowledge was unleaded then reason why
EDL	00:15:54,623	00:15:58,719	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	An expert system with electric systems knowledge bases
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,023	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	TurboTax
EDL	00:16:01,023	00:16:05,375	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Text today is kind of a current Incarnation shuttling program
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:06,143	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:12,543	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Those ended up being very difficult very difficult to program very difficult to maintain it's very difficult for people to
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,823	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But actually specify
EDL	00:16:14,335	00:16:16,383	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly the logic rules
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:18,175	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They're behind intelligence
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:24,575	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But over those decades and especially during this pal program began to realize that if you fed a computer Lotto
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:25,087	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Data
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:29,183	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In turned it Loose with the right machine learning algorithms which were
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:29,951	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We're kind of learning
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,511	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The statistics and probabilistic
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:33,791	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Nature of the data
EDL	00:16:34,303	00:16:37,375	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And learning different recognition patterns
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,935	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The computer could learn its own patterns
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:42,239	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They're not specified by a person
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:46,335	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But those patterns were much more effective at doing a lot of jobs
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:49,663	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Stand like understanding speech or recognizing images are
EDL	00:16:50,431	00:16:51,199	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know
EDL	00:16:51,199	00:16:52,479	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Finding credit card fraud
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,503	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Xcetera
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:57,599	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Answer machine learning was much more effective than the older style
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,623	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Explicit
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:17:00,159	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Logic rules
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,487	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So in a sense with the computer was doing is taking those
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:04,767	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Assertive
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,303	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Analog signal
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,327	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That we humans are coming
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,399	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Looking them now in there
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:11,679	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Beta version
EDL	00:17:12,191	00:17:13,471	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right and that's what they're comfort
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:14,495	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes
EDL	00:17:15,007	00:17:15,519	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:17,823	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that was a big component of the program
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:21,663	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We also did a lot of work on man-machine dialogue
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,431	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Gone
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:28,831	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know how do you carry on an intelligent dialogue with the computer the speech understanding to some extent was already being
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:32,159	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	How would you have a computer that could be an intelligent assistant
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,463	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It would watch what the user is doing
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:36,255	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Understand his job
EDL	00:17:36,767	00:17:39,839	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Then be able to give him assistants at the right time
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,375	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And one of the
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:47,775	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Metaphors we used as you want to do create an assistant that was like Sergeant O'Reilly on the old TV show
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:48,287	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Show MASH
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,103	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	For those of you old enough to remember
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:54,687	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	O'Reilly always knew what the kernel needed before the kernel
EDL	00:17:54,687	00:17:55,967	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Need new himself
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,735	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right so we just
EDL	00:17:57,503	00:18:01,855	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Followed the context of what the user was doing could anticipate
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,879	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And provide
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,647	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Intelligent advice
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:09,023	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that was the Grand Vision and we funded a lot of it very Advanced research and all of those areas
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:12,863	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And in one of our performers was the
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:16,703	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	SRA International out in Menlo Park California
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,263	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They were one of the integrators of this they
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,335	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They are looked at all the research was being developed
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,639	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Tried to create a prototype
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:30,271	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Of this pal system that would could actually be used as an intelligent assistant on your laptop
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,551	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that they were looking at
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:33,087	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Many of the
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:36,415	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Component technologies that the other performers were were developing in C
EDL	00:18:36,415	00:18:36,927	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	See how can we put this
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:43,839	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly and I was really their job was how do we integrate the best of all these techniques and put
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,119	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Bad together in night
EDL	00:18:45,119	00:18:47,423	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Real prototype of a condom
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:52,287	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so they as long as they were doing that began to develop a
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:56,127	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Kind of streamline more efficient version of that Arkansas
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:19:02,015	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And when the power program the research version the power program ended around
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	2008
EDL	00:19:03,807	00:19:07,647	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They had several people who'd worked on Powell and some
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:10,975	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	New performers they brought informed Adventure called Siri
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:14,047	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And they decided they were going to take this technology
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,327	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Adapted
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:17,887	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	For the iPhone which was a brand new product
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And people didn't know quite what to do with it
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:24,543	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Azarai was very wisely said
EDL	00:19:24,543	00:19:26,591	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This is the place for a cognitivist
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,407	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	People going to have this phone they won't have a
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:30,175	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Keyboard
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:32,991	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They're really going to need an assistant that can help them out
EDL	00:19:33,759	00:19:37,599	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So they had this Venture and for two years it was just funded as a new startup
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,647	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	DARPA then was out of the picture
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,743	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They got Venture money from Silicon Valley to develop this
EDL	00:19:44,255	00:19:48,863	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And in two years later they put their first Siri application on the App Store
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,911	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Napster was brand new
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:55,775	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And I think it was three days later they got a call from Steve Jobs himself
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:59,103	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Who said it first they're like washer this is.
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:02,687	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Try to just cause I didn't want random phones
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,223	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know in the office after they
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Began to believe it really was Steve Jobs
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:12,671	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	He asked the three founders he said why don't you come over to my house tonight for dinner I've got a
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:13,951	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Vision for what I want to do with
EDL	00:20:15,231	00:20:18,047	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And then there was some negotiation / selling
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:18,559	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The company
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Apple bought it
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:23,679	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's been several years developing it into the Sirius system
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:24,447	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Aquino today
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:30,335	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And for the first year of that Steve Jobs was personally involved in directing
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:31,359	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	He had really seen that
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:34,943	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	As a vision for he wanted to go but then got too well
EDL	00:20:36,223	00:20:38,527	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Okay so before we move on now to your
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,039	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Current
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:44,671	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What you described she was sort of the archetypal technology development cycle
EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:47,231	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	At DARPA when it's about a sex successful at the
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:48,767	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yet which is to say
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:51,071	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yeah you and others here in your
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:52,351	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Your performers those who work
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,143	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Under contract on your program
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,703	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They brought a technology to a point of proteus
EDL	00:20:57,471	00:20:58,239	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And
EDL	00:20:58,239	00:20:59,519	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Then taking the risk
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,847	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Down enough that say other corporate entities or
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,127	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	With the military services
EDL	00:21:04,127	00:21:04,895	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Can take a handoff
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:07,199	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And do the final development until we
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,247	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Product eggnog
EDL	00:21:09,759	00:21:10,783	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Turn off the dark
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,063	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What goes up to that point of
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:12,575	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The product
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:14,623	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Prototype
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,903	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Out with proof
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The principal hears a case where
EDL	00:21:17,696	00:21:18,720	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	All of this works
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:21,792	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But you did led to something that now is part of
EDL	00:21:21,792	00:21:22,816	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The Techno scape
EDL	00:21:23,328	00:21:23,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Of the world
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:27,424	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So the question I have for you is just what does that
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:33,056	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Feel like I'm here you are you you here Siri all over the place and you know that you had
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,848	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A role in the sequence
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:35,616	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That led to it
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:36,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:38,176	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What feels great
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:41,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It was quite a surprise in a way right as you save this
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:44,832	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That's DARPA's job we're always doing this advanced technology
EDL	00:21:45,344	00:21:46,880	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We're always trying to reduce the risk
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:49,952	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know and we knew a personal assistant
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:51,488	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Headband
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:54,560	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That's been a part of the AI science fiction
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:55,328	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sense
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:58,144	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	2001 and Star Trek in
EDL	00:21:58,144	00:22:02,240	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That's always at like why certainly will be able to interact talk to her computer someday
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:09,152	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But it never quite worked but I don't never know how l9ng vanilla
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,688	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We want the pod bay doors
EDL	00:22:12,224	00:22:18,112	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But the idea of a computer that was intelligent enough to carry on a conversation being assistant had been around for
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,160	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But never implemented
EDL	00:22:20,928	00:22:23,232	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	When people tried it didn't work well enough
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:25,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	There's always a little bit too kludgy
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:32,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And I think that that pal program really brought it to the point that Steve Jobs was willing to take a risk and say yeah I can make
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:32,960	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Make a real Prada
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,288	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And I can say I left Tarpon 2008
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,848	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's two years later that this comes out
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:42,944	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And renewed Apple had bought it but had no idea what they were going to do
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:47,040	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And then suddenly it's Apple's marketing department is advertising
EDL	00:22:47,040	00:22:47,808	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The product of my
EDL	00:22:47,808	00:22:48,320	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I program
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:49,600	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And that was very nice
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:51,136	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Like my children even
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:53,952	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Momentarily
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,256	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The greatest achievement of all right
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:59,584	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So let's then move now to your current
EDL	00:23:00,864	00:23:04,192	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Here in 2015 that you left in 2018 you want to wait either.
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:04,960	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Other things in
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:08,032	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Industry and you came back in 2015 so again
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:11,104	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Tell me that that approach how it is that you were convinced to come back
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,896	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We'll talk about your
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:13,664	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To program
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:19,296	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Well one is I said I didn't just being a DARPA's the best job I've ever had
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:23,136	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Wright's interesting to go out and Industry its industry to be in other places
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:28,512	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But if you enjoy technology and you really want to make an impact there's nothing like
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,024	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Like being a dark
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:35,424	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I was going to head been out for a while in a variety of jobs and Industry I was
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:38,240	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Kind of ready to looking for something to do
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:42,848	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The other Factor though is my son who lives in Roslyn nearby
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Just had her first grandchild
EDL	00:23:44,640	00:23:49,248	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that convince my wife it was worth moving from Seattle where are bases
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:51,808	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Back to DC
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:53,344	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So I got a great job
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:55,136	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	My wife got to play with our grandson
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:56,672	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that was
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:00,256	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Pure justification right there no need for anything else
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:07,168	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's so let's talk about the to program 1-1 you inherited that's communicating with computers WC right
EDL	00:24:08,192	00:24:09,472	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Tell me a little bit about the gold
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:16,384	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Well in a sense it's kind of do the next generation of Siri and Alexa in those
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:17,152	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sorts of things
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:19,456	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We're now that technology is there
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:25,600	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know what can understand what you say for the most part not always but for the most part and can provide you know minor
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:28,928	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Assistance can set an alarm can play a song
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,976	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right help you find directions
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:35,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Ncwc we really want to raise the level of intelligence
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,632	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In Partnership of the computer
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:40,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So it is really intelligent partner
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:46,080	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That's you know what joint partner with the human it's really human-computer symbiosis
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Not human is the manager
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:49,408	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Iran computer
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:50,176	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	As a low level of
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:51,968	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that's the goal
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,784	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Let's stay here for just one more minute what's a kind of
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,832	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Question that I might be able to ask
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:00,160	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	After a successful CWC communicating with
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:00,672	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Computers Pro
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That I can tell
EDL	00:25:02,464	00:25:03,232	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Say Siri now
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,792	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Let me not you Siri but you was one of the examples from the program
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:07,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Is the Harvard Medical School
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:12,192	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They have done some work on a previous star program called Big mechanism
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:16,032	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Where they are trying to create a system
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:19,872	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That could read masses of research in biology
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:24,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And then automatically construct models of cancer pathways
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:28,064	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Instead of had the human biologist having to read thousands of
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:29,088	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Research art
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,392	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The computer would do it themselves
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:37,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Ingrate suggestions of new Pathways offer how cancer behaves in a cell
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:39,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To the biologist would have that as a suggestion
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:44,192	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So now the CWC part of it is can we put a collaborative
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,472	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	User interface on top
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:49,056	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So now the biologists can collaborate with
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What's a computer
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:52,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To hypothesize how cancer works
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,920	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Christmas elf to design experiment
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,200	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	2
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:55,968	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know Soda
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:59,296	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The computer is working as a virtual
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:26:01,856	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Scientist the lab assistant if you will or
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:03,648	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Grad student in a biology lab
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:06,976	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Who's really helping to digest the literature
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:09,024	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Pull out the important nuggets
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,560	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,328	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Suggest
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Experiments
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,376	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I'm getting this.
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:15,168	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I think right that the value-added is
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If I'm a scientist in neuroscience
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,544	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And we each spent a month immersed in the literature
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:23,104	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You've read a hundred papers and I brought hundred paper
EDL	00:26:23,104	00:26:24,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But if I'm working with a
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:26,432	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Computer the computer might have read 10000
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:27,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Papers were exactly
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,248	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And now it has enough
EDL	00:26:29,248	00:26:32,064	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Intelligence and has the right kind of
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:36,928	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Dialog Machinery so it can carry on a much more intelligent conversation with you
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:42,048	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Today if it was Siri or you going to confirm technology and might find me articles on
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:44,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know certain pathway
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:46,144	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Ryder find me articles about a certain protein
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Computer could do that
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:51,264	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But it's really not going to absorb that information integrated
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,848	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And in carry-on kind of more give-and-take conversation
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:26:58,432	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What's a now let's move on to the program that I suspect is taking
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Most of your time because
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Play my mind is
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,040	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Seven performers
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:05,344	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And this is called
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,624	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Explainable
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,136	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Artificial
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:09,440	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	AI
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:12,512	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So talk about the impetus for the program I guess
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,024	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	First
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,304	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And then
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Talk to me about
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,608	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This status
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:21,984	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Well first I said I came back in 2015 you know
EDL	00:27:21,984	00:27:25,568	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I talked to the in-office director Dan Kaufman about
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:29,664	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Coming back to DARPA and and so is his
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:31,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Give you listeners probably no
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:36,320	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	My program manager comes to Darfur the question is what's your vision what project you want to do
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:39,648	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know that that's kind of a job interview better do it fast
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:43,232	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Because it said you already have your sell-by date on your badge right you're here for a few years
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:46,048	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so Dan head
EDL	00:27:46,048	00:27:48,864	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Actually suggested this idea of explainable
EDL	00:27:48,864	00:27:49,632	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	AI
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:54,752	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I had just been to a workshop with a group of Intel analyst from.
EDL	00:27:54,752	00:27:57,056	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And it was a group of machine learning and
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,616	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	HCI visualization people
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:03,968	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We're trying to convince this group ball the great new technology we could
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:04,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Provide
EDL	00:28:04,736	00:28:06,016	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To help Intel analysis
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:09,600	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And one of the ladies there who was an analyst at
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,904	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	One of the dod agency
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:13,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Said that's not a problem
EDL	00:28:14,208	00:28:17,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Her probably she already has big data analytics systems
EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:18,816	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They're recommending
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:21,632	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Suggesting patterns are Target's
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:23,680	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know suspects to her
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:28,032	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But she has to put her name on the recommendation that goes up the chain
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,080	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And she gets graded
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:31,104	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If not punished
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:33,152	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If that recommendation is wrong
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:35,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And she wanted these systems to it
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:37,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Reminder the rationale
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,296	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	For making the decisions that
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,856	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This was for her how she was going
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:42,624	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Trust them
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The machine
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:45,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Trusted in you in a window
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:48,768	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	When is the machine when is this a false alarm when is it
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:50,048	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Positive example like
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:50,560	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I should trust
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:51,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Into her
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,144	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Having the explanation
EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:55,168	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Would what's really needed
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:29:03,360	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that resonated and it's about that time is when the new wave of AI which is deep learning
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:04,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Just taking off
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,152	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Bright
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:11,552	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And you hear about this cold kind of new Revolution and AI That's all about these deep learning techniques
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:16,672	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What are kind of the most advanced of this machine learning technology we talked about earlier
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:19,744	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We're takes in huge volumes of data
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:24,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	These deep learning systems that are very large neural Nets
EDL	00:29:24,096	00:29:25,632	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	With millions of neurons if
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They're each learning weights
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,544	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It helped it build a model of what's the correct decision in any situation
EDL	00:29:33,056	00:29:34,080	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Electronic versions
EDL	00:29:34,592	00:29:37,408	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yeah exactly what they're incredibly OPEC
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:40,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And difficult for people to understand even their developers or not
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:41,248	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Quite sure
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,064	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	How do you say systems are making their decisions
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:47,648	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They can be incredibly accurate they're fed enough data
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:51,744	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And the data fits the world in the right way
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:53,280	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They can be very effective
EDL	00:29:53,280	00:29:55,328	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And now we're incredibly effect
EDL	00:29:55,328	00:29:56,352	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Tantalizing
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:56,864	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Faces
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,144	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Objects in image
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:29:59,936	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Voice record
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:00,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Cognition
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,008	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know and computer games
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,544	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But they're not very explainable
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:07,360	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's not very easy for user to understand
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:08,896	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What these systems are doing
EDL	00:30:08,896	00:30:11,200	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So for a lot of applications that's okay
EDL	00:30:11,200	00:30:13,760	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If you're finding cat videos on Facebook
EDL	00:30:13,760	00:30:15,040	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	An explanation is not
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:15,552	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A critical
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:18,880	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But if you are an analyst for DOD that's picking out
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,416	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Target's to investigate
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,488	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Are you running a autonomous
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:30,400	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Unmanned air vehicle that's going to go off onto a mission on its own you really want to get a good explanation
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,424	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What this thing is thing
EDL	00:30:32,192	00:30:33,984	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So it's a very hard problem
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:37,312	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To some extent this machine learning technology work so well
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:39,616	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Because it learns models
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:43,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That are inherently more difficult more complex in what person
EDL	00:30:43,712	00:30:44,224	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Quit special
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:47,040	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But yet you need to get some explanation out of it
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:49,600	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that user can get an intuition
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,112	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What the cyst
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,160	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that's the problem
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:58,560	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So we laid that out as is typical then the DARPA you talk to a lot of researchers a lot of people in
EDL	00:30:58,560	00:31:00,608	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	DOD about the problem
EDL	00:31:00,608	00:31:01,888	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You craft your
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:08,800	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Solicitation you get in your proposals and you pick your performers and as you mentioned I've picked 11 performers
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:12,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Or each developing what I'm calling an explainable Learning System
EDL	00:31:12,896	00:31:14,944	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So we still wanted to be a machine-learning sis
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:19,552	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We don't want to go back to the old version of Technology where you're trying to specify the rules
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:22,624	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	All the windows older versions they were more explainable
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:25,440	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Because a human head describe the logic
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,208	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's using
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:29,024	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It was much easier to regurgitate that logic
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Take to another human
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,584	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And people could understand what is
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:34,400	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But in this case that's not possible
EDL	00:31:34,400	00:31:38,240	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So each one of these 11 teams is developing two major components
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:40,288	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They're going to plug together into Asus
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:44,384	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	One component is a modified machine learning process
EDL	00:31:45,408	00:31:47,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So they're changing the Deep learning
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A process
EDL	00:31:48,736	00:31:50,528	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Were there adding a new learning Tech
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:54,368	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Color changing something about the way the system learns
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:54,880	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's model
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,928	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So there's more
EDL	00:31:56,928	00:31:57,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Interpretable
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:31:58,720	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	More explainable
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:32:00,000	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In the second piece
EDL	00:32:00,000	00:32:01,280	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Going back to my
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:04,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	No background in HCI in psychology
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:06,912	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Is the have an explanation interface
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:12,800	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Which is the best combination of visualization natural language generation
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:19,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know creates just the right explanation that's appropriate for an end-user so he understands what the sea
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	System is doing
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:23,552	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Even though that end user is not going to be a machine-learning
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:27,648	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So he has to take the complexity of this machine Learning System
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,952	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Create the right kind of explanation
EDL	00:32:29,952	00:32:31,744	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So your average user can understand what is
EDL	00:32:32,512	00:32:33,024	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The question about
EDL	00:32:34,048	00:32:34,816	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This is really
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:35,328	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The Human Side
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:37,120	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I might do something
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:37,888	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Behave in a certain way
EDL	00:32:38,656	00:32:39,424	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And somebody might say
EDL	00:32:39,936	00:32:41,728	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Why did you do that what's the explanation for your behavior
EDL	00:32:42,240	00:32:48,640	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes and I can come up with one after the fact that sounds reasonable to me yes but I can't read
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,176	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Can we be sure that I'm not
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:50,944	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Fooling myself
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:52,992	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Listen to just have just made up an explanation
EDL	00:32:53,504	00:32:54,272	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:55,808	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Can't that be happening here
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:33:01,184	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's it can't it's called rationalizations actualization one of the techniques were using we we could
EDL	00:33:01,184	00:33:05,792	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Some of the teams are taking approach where they're going to treat the machine Learning System is a black box
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	They don't know what's going on
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:12,960	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But they can experiment with it they can run a million simulation trials with different inputs
EDL	00:33:13,472	00:33:14,240	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And see what are the out
EDL	00:33:15,008	00:33:17,824	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And see if they can infer model that explains what is do
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:21,408	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So the test though we do to avoid the problem yours
EDL	00:33:21,408	00:33:23,200	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Describing is the test is
EDL	00:33:23,200	00:33:25,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Does your explanation predict
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,040	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What the machine will do in a new city
EDL	00:33:27,552	00:33:29,088	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So if you're fooling yourself
EDL	00:33:29,088	00:33:30,368	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The prediction will be wrong
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:33,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And especially to help user
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:34,464	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Gametrust
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:37,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know so the user needs to have a model
EDL	00:33:37,536	00:33:39,072	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	From the explanation
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,864	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So the user knows when
EDL	00:33:40,864	00:33:43,424	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In which situation should they trust it in when shouldn't they
EDL	00:33:43,936	00:33:45,216	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So they need to have
EDL	00:33:45,728	00:33:46,752	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Some model that
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:47,776	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So you know
EDL	00:33:48,288	00:33:50,592	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Predictive of what the system is going to do
EDL	00:33:51,104	00:33:51,872	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So they can
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:53,920	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Create this understanding in their own head
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:33:56,224	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Even though that understanding may be very different
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:59,296	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Then what's actually going on inside the machine
EDL	00:33:59,808	00:34:01,088	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's close enough
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:02,880	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's capturing the main features
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:04,672	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What the system is doing
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:07,232	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So that they can understand
EDL	00:34:07,232	00:34:08,768	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And have some faith
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:10,048	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And understanding what the system
EDL	00:34:11,072	00:34:12,352	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Another fascinating
EDL	00:34:12,352	00:34:13,120	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Think of Me about
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,400	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Explainable AI
EDL	00:34:14,400	00:34:15,168	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And certainly hasn't learned
EDL	00:34:17,472	00:34:21,824	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Is it also seems to be rubbing shoulders with some of the great questions of philosophy
EDL	00:34:23,104	00:34:24,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Dysentery
EDL	00:34:24,128	00:34:28,224	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Epistemology write a big word which means had had how do we come to know that
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:28,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Things as human
EDL	00:34:29,504	00:34:34,880	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What is an explanation anyway what's the nature of explanation it makes me think that philosophers would be quite interested
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:37,440	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Unfortunately they are
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:40,256	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And I'll explain that
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And we have
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:44,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	11 teams are actually building the system
EDL	00:34:44,096	00:34:45,632	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We have one team
EDL	00:34:45,632	00:34:48,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's just a group of cognitive psychologists
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:51,520	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Who are digging into what's known about explanation
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:54,592	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Not so much from philosophy but from psychology
EDL	00:34:55,104	00:35:00,480	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Psychologist for years have studied what explanation is more effective for person
EDL	00:35:00,480	00:35:02,016	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What explanation leads
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:02,528	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Learning
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,808	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Better than another
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:05,344	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What explanation
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:06,880	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Improve decision-making
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:10,208	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So their job is to just a dig through all that literature
EDL	00:35:10,208	00:35:11,488	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Here and help us out
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,000	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	With Watson
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:16,864	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And I mentioned about the business about philosophers Interest being unfortunate
EDL	00:35:16,864	00:35:22,752	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Because it's so easy to get lost in this very deep conversation about what is causality
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:24,032	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What's the next
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:24,544	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Coronation
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:27,616	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And we've had a fair amount of that discussion in the
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:31,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I'm trying to get around that by using a very practical definition
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The test will be
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:39,136	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	If you create one of these systems a human user has to use that system to make decision
EDL	00:35:39,136	00:35:39,904	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Used to manage
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:41,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	An unmanned vehicle
EDL	00:35:41,696	00:35:42,464	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Or two
EDL	00:35:42,464	00:35:43,488	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Do until analysis
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:48,864	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Does the explanation enable him to appropriately trust the system
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:53,472	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Does the explanation enable him to predict when the system will be right in winter
EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,008	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Will be wrong and that's our measure
EDL	00:35:55,520	00:35:57,312	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So I want to try to avoid
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:35:59,104	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This philosophical
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,152	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Swamped
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,224	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And just get to a practical solution
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:07,808	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	When does an explanation help a user do his job
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:08,320	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And one dozen
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:10,112	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So did you mean you want
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:12,416	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Tools in hand in a relatively short time
EDL	00:36:12,416	00:36:13,440	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	As opposed to
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,208	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A Thousand Years
EDL	00:36:14,208	00:36:16,000	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly right
EDL	00:36:16,000	00:36:18,304	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	1000 years of discussion with no tools
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:18,816	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sentient
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:21,888	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So we're getting toward the end we don't have that much
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:22,912	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But a few other things
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:27,264	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Discuss with you one of them is you're looking at
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,544	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The way artist
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,080	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Official intelligence is
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:31,616	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You received by the
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:33,408	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Discussions
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:34,176	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Abacus having
EDL	00:36:34,176	00:36:38,528	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	There is certainly some excitement I think the public is leaning toward a positive you
EDL	00:36:38,528	00:36:39,296	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Beyonce
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,088	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Fleets of driverless cars attack
EDL	00:36:41,088	00:36:42,112	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Actually I'm working out there there's
EDL	00:36:42,624	00:36:45,696	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sorry about that but they're also result that dystopian side
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:48,256	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Artificial intelligence is it
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:49,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's another kind of intelligence
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,304	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Scary
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:51,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Powerful
EDL	00:36:51,840	00:36:54,144	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And that this is something to really
EDL	00:36:54,144	00:36:55,424	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Fear and worry about
EDL	00:36:55,424	00:36:59,264	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So you're in the midst of you are one of the
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,800	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The tool builders in the AI space
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:03,872	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	How do you think about that
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:05,152	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You're the promise and the potential
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,688	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What's a great question
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:07,968	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And one bed
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,504	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We talked about a lot
EDL	00:37:10,528	00:37:14,880	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I'm so first day I like any technology can be used for good or evil
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,672	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right so there is both sides to a
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:18,976	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And we have to be
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:19,488	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Be careful
EDL	00:37:20,000	00:37:20,768	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Like to manage that
EDL	00:37:20,768	00:37:23,328	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Hive overall think it's very positive
EDL	00:37:23,328	00:37:24,352	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right I think it's
EDL	00:37:24,352	00:37:26,400	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Be much easier for us to avoid
EDL	00:37:26,400	00:37:27,680	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Literally negative aspects
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:29,728	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	This this is where
EDL	00:37:29,728	00:37:31,520	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Some of my press you and say well
EDL	00:37:31,520	00:37:32,032	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But you're teknaf
EDL	00:37:32,800	00:37:33,824	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Write an essay
EDL	00:37:33,824	00:37:34,336	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And so
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:36,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And you said that in a fairly Cavill
EDL	00:37:36,896	00:37:39,200	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Forgive me one or two bases for why you have it up
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,992	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What is
EDL	00:37:40,992	00:37:43,040	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The level of intelligence
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:44,064	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We're really Adonai
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:47,648	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So what we have even though there's been huge advances
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,440	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Especially in this deep learning Tech
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:50,720	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In the last couple
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,304	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	We're so far away from Human intelligence
EDL	00:37:54,816	00:37:56,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Anything that would be
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:57,632	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	An independent
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:58,656	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Superman
EDL	00:37:59,424	00:38:00,192	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Stats
EDL	00:38:00,192	00:38:00,704	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sad signs
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:05,056	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	To me it's like worrying about a meteor that's going to hit Earth
EDL	00:38:05,568	00:38:07,872	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Sometime in the next million years
EDL	00:38:07,872	00:38:09,152	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And in Life as We Know It
EDL	00:38:09,664	00:38:11,200	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right is not imminent
EDL	00:38:11,200	00:38:13,248	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Price is not high probability
EDL	00:38:13,248	00:38:15,808	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	In which NASA should make sure they've got telescopes
EDL	00:38:16,320	00:38:19,648	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know around the planet so we can see that when it's happening
EDL	00:38:20,416	00:38:22,720	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	So we need a small number of people worrying about
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:25,536	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Let's make sure we don't create a superintelligence
EDL	00:38:27,328	00:38:28,096	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But I think the
EDL	00:38:28,096	00:38:30,656	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The current technology today is so far from that
EDL	00:38:31,424	00:38:32,192	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	That's not a big canoe
EDL	00:38:32,960	00:38:35,264	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Dystopian and point of something as you said
EDL	00:38:35,264	00:38:36,032	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	But it's not
EDL	00:38:36,032	00:38:37,312	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Worth worrying about too much
EDL	00:38:38,592	00:38:42,176	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And it's on the other side then to move forward suggest to me that you think that
EDL	00:38:42,688	00:38:43,712	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Positive Ana
EDL	00:38:43,712	00:38:44,736	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Points are
EDL	00:38:44,736	00:38:46,272	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Really worth pursuing osher
EDL	00:38:46,272	00:38:48,064	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	What is just likes a driverless cars
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:48,576	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Write that
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:55,232	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	There's a lot of issues to be worked out there but I've no doubt when that comes they'll be fewer deaths on a highway
EDL	00:38:55,744	00:38:57,280	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Then it will be with human driver
EDL	00:38:57,792	00:39:01,632	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Medicine you know just huge advancements in applying this to Medicine
EDL	00:39:02,400	00:39:03,936	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I think one of the latest results
EDL	00:39:03,936	00:39:07,264	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It was one of these deep Learning Systems can learn to recognize
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:09,312	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Skin cancer
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:12,128	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Events better than human.
EDL	00:39:13,920	00:39:14,688	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know so
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:18,016	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Just analyzing the vast amounts of data that we have
EDL	00:39:18,016	00:39:18,784	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Hand
EDL	00:39:18,784	00:39:24,160	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	You know being able to understand it or just creating Siri in personal assistance it can do a better job
EDL	00:39:24,160	00:39:26,464	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	There's just so many things were AI is
EDL	00:39:26,464	00:39:26,976	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Going to be
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,280	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Right this is making me think
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,304	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Of your new grandchild
EDL	00:39:30,816	00:39:31,840	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	He or she
EDL	00:39:31,840	00:39:33,376	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Chi heat so she is
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:36,448	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	I'm going to grow up in a time when AI is
EDL	00:39:36,448	00:39:37,216	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Heart
EDL	00:39:37,216	00:39:37,984	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Of the landscape
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:39,776	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	A part of the tecnis right but he will not
EDL	00:39:40,288	00:39:42,080	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	No right time without a high
EDL	00:39:42,592	00:39:43,360	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	It's kind of interesting
EDL	00:39:43,360	00:39:46,432	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Have a great little video of him at 1 year old
EDL	00:39:47,200	00:39:48,992	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Is first interaction with Siri
EDL	00:39:49,760	00:39:52,064	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And he's learned if you press this button
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:54,368	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	The iPhone talks to him
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,952	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And he doesn't even have language that we understand but he would press this
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:39:58,464	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	Button
EDL	00:39:58,976	00:40:01,024	| Episode 19 The AI Intermediary |	And have a conversation in his own
