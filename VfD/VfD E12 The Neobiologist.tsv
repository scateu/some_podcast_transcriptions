EDL	00:00:11,580	00:00:32,772	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Stuff technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand on tournament operation technology is a driver of our times since its founding and nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , durban , the defence advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:32,772	00:00:41,840	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Welcome to Voices from darker a window on toddler's core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:41,840	00:00:45,125	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	My name is iphone a motto on your dark host today . 
EDL	00:00:45,125	00:00:47,942	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I am pleased to have with me in the studio . 
EDL	00:00:47,942	00:00:53,810	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Justin gallery , a program manager since twenty fourteen in dark is biological technology . 
EDL	00:00:54,130	00:01:28,540	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Justin , on the bachelor of science degree in chemistry at the university of illinois , urbana champagne and aged in chemistry from kale tech for fourteen years prior to arriving at dark , he was a professor in the chemistry department at emory university and inland georgia there , he LED a research program in synthetic biology , which is all about uncovering the rules and genetic programs by which sales behavior upgrade and to learn how to manipulate those rules and programs so that bacterial , fungal plant , animal cells can make drugs , fuels , coatings and other useful molecules . 
EDL	00:01:28,540	00:01:40,120	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Materials at DARPA , government continues to be driven by some of natures own most or dishes , biological feeds , such as the growth of a great soccer redwood tree from a seat . 
EDL	00:01:40,120	00:01:57,256	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	What if it were possible to leverage biologist own evolutionary home powers of chemical growth , cellphone organization , self healing and reproduction in the context of our build landscape of buildings , road vehicles and other constructions . 
EDL	00:01:57,256	00:01:59,237	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	That is the first question . 
EDL	00:01:59,237	00:02:02,751	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Just asking johnson , thanks for joining me in the studio today . 
EDL	00:02:02,751	00:02:03,930	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Glad to hear everyone . 
EDL	00:02:03,930	00:02:11,790	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Let's start by talking about your background and how you became interested in science in general and in chemistry and a synthetic biology in. 
EDL	00:02:11,790	00:02:13,171	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I actually started out . 
EDL	00:02:13,171	00:02:14,947	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It was very interesting physics . 
EDL	00:02:14,947	00:02:24,418	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I was inspired by a people like richard firemen , and he told these wonderful stories seem like an incredibly interesting guy , sexual , one of the things that promise a cow tag . 
EDL	00:02:24,418	00:02:30,533	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I thought , you know , if this character could do such a great scientist was placed that I wanted to be . 
EDL	00:02:30,533	00:02:37,930	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I quickly realized after about a week in college that I was not going to be a physicist whenever the less I like . 
EDL	00:02:37,930	00:02:40,940	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So chemistry seems like a good option . 
EDL	00:02:40,940	00:02:49,090	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I always like the idea in chemistry of the ability to create things didn't exist before it is core chemistry as an analytical size . 
EDL	00:02:49,090	00:02:55,369	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We understand the world around us by studying browser is a synthetic site , which means creating new opportunities . 
EDL	00:02:55,369	00:02:57,300	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And that was something I was really wrong . 
EDL	00:02:58,050	00:03:07,127	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Interestingly enough , I sort of put off biology , my biological education that is formally pretty much handed in the night grade . 
EDL	00:03:07,127	00:03:22,350	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But it's time when , on , during a graduate school in post dog , I went from this time where the word DNA and a architect owners do not attend to appoint where I really start to respect the remarkable chemistry that biology does . 
EDL	00:03:22,350	00:03:28,774	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I ultimately concluded that no matter how good of chemist I was that biology do better . 
EDL	00:03:28,774	00:03:37,073	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So asked the question , okay , well , can we harness the power of biological systems to essentially do our beating for us ? 
EDL	00:03:37,073	00:03:47,490	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So how can I reprogram a system that wants to do with one thing and get to the thing that I wanted to do , and that let me into the serious antarctic biology . 
EDL	00:03:47,490	00:03:53,987	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So we were interested in taking advantage of some of the properties that bacteria , simple microbes could do . 
EDL	00:03:53,987	00:03:55,905	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They are really to make stuff . 
EDL	00:03:55,905	00:03:57,822	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They are really to send stuff . 
EDL	00:03:57,822	00:04:00,030	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I got really interested in. 
EDL	00:04:00,030	00:04:10,190	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Ramming that before we talk about the two programs that you're running here dark , but I would like to hear about the sequence of events that let you from your own experience . 
EDL	00:04:10,190	00:04:12,900	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And emery , as a professor to develop itself . 
EDL	00:04:12,900	00:04:14,650	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So how do you and appear? 
EDL	00:04:14,650	00:04:16,449	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So it's a funny story . 
EDL	00:04:16,449	00:04:26,991	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I was at a meeting in cold spring harbor , new york , which is beautiful laboratory family's laboratory and long island , female for molecular biology . 
EDL	00:04:26,991	00:04:28,709	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	and 真的是sure of DNA 。
EDL	00:04:28,709	00:04:31,924	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	That's , we're meeting right outside of his office . 
EDL	00:04:31,924	00:04:35,828	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We got to see him walk through , coming back from his tennis matches . 
EDL	00:04:35,828	00:04:40,192	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I was , there was part of a short course on synthetic biology . 
EDL	00:04:40,192	00:04:45,352	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So the organizers had brought faculty members from around the country , around the world . 
EDL	00:04:45,352	00:04:47,788	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And about that time , double had announced . 
EDL	00:04:47,788	00:04:53,325	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The living foundry is programmed , which is one of the seminars in that biology programs . 
EDL	00:04:53,325	00:04:54,140	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Here are dark. 
EDL	00:04:54,140	00:04:57,100	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And then just tell listeners what was the cracks of that. 
EDL	00:04:57,100	00:05:08,260	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So the cracks of that program was engineering groups to produce new molecules and to reduce the time of the design billow test learn cycle to do that . 
EDL	00:05:08,260	00:05:19,104	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So instead of taking a decade in a billion dollars to generate , they wanted to reduce the time down to maybe days or weeks , and reduce the cost dramatically . 
EDL	00:05:19,104	00:05:19,824	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Dropped her . 
EDL	00:05:19,824	00:05:30,216	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Just put out a call on early hundred million dollars of investment , and I think , and he likes to say people at this meeting , who are all in this area , got really excited about it . 
EDL	00:05:30,216	00:05:43,190	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But we also were sort of amazed by the insults in the authority of a DARPA was asking , and I was getting really excited about this , and I got talking to the younger faculty members of these mostly sister professors that organize the meeting . 
EDL	00:05:43,190	00:05:53,350	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And they had mentioned that in a darker was expanding heavily in the senate biology , they were looking for program managers , and it's the program manager . 
EDL	00:05:53,350	00:05:57,270	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I was kind of interesting one in the sense that we're all temporary , dark . 
EDL	00:05:57,270	00:05:58,950	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It doesn't hire permanent staff . 
EDL	00:05:58,950	00:06:07,841	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	This program , we have an exploration date on our badge minus thirty december twenty eighteen , like , is yourselves , emergency of it . 
EDL	00:06:07,841	00:06:08,994	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It certainly does . 
EDL	00:06:08,994	00:06:16,850	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So in order to come to this job , you essentially have to leave what you are doing before , with the expectation that this is only going to be a temp job . 
EDL	00:06:16,850	00:06:27,704	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So for the folks that come from academics , you more or less have to have a tenure position if you intend to go back because early in your career , you cannot do this and be an assistant professor at the same time . 
EDL	00:06:27,704	00:06:29,078	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It just wouldn't work out . 
EDL	00:06:29,078	00:06:37,410	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But since I already had ten year , a lot of my colleagues that you would be great , you know , the field , you have the ability to take a break . 
EDL	00:06:37,410	00:06:48,170	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Ironically , after about three years appear , uh , I leave for memory , my team said , are you coming back something I never thought I would say is said , no . 
EDL	00:06:48,490	00:06:55,440	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So I gave up a ten year faculty position , a lifetime appointment , something I worked incredibly hard for . 
EDL	00:06:55,440	00:06:58,200	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And scientists , or the end of the bill of a career . 
EDL	00:06:58,500	00:06:59,250	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I gave up . 
EDL	00:07:00,030	00:07:05,820	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So I am currently have been observing at the pressure of the traffic leadership. 
EDL	00:07:06,260	00:07:17,330	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And don't know what i'm gonna do next hurry , but that also is an indication to me that you develop the certain kind of devotion and excitement about the programs that are involved with maybe more than you even expected . 
EDL	00:07:17,330	00:07:19,080	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So let's talk about the two programs . 
EDL	00:07:19,080	00:07:21,580	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The first one goes by the short name of breaks . 
EDL	00:07:21,580	00:07:29,000	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	BRICS, which stands biological robustness and complex settings . 
EDL	00:07:29,000	00:07:30,770	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	What is it that is now and what you hope to achieve. 
EDL	00:07:31,160	00:07:36,700	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The origin of that program goes back couple of years before I join the agency . 
EDL	00:07:36,700	00:07:54,280	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Santa biologists got good engineering bacteria to do what I would call parallel tricks , little cute things that work well in the latter example , engineering bacteria is such that when you expose them to light , they would change color so you could do photography . 
EDL	00:07:54,280	00:08:00,952	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You could take a patriot that she could shine light and shadows and so on , and you could take back photographs . 
EDL	00:08:00,952	00:08:09,766	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You'll cube kind of demonstrates the possibility for the field , but at the end of the day , you know , it's not going to put digital cameras . 
EDL	00:08:09,766	00:08:14,974	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So I myself have been engineering organisms to follow small molecules with the idea . 
EDL	00:08:14,974	00:08:27,790	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Maybe that you could chase down pollutants in the environments , you would have a bacterium that not only wanted to eat the oil , but actually could sense the oil and follow the road around if you wanted to clean up the environment . 
EDL	00:08:28,170	00:08:33,970	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And in doing all this , the question , I would inevitably get asked as okay when you can have transition this to the field . 
EDL	00:08:34,620	00:08:41,950	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And my answer , quite honest , because the systems that we are building work fine at thirty seven degrees . 
EDL	00:08:41,950	00:08:49,830	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Sales in a petri dish in a stereo environment with the presence of energy , alex , to keep any competition away . 
EDL	00:08:49,830	00:08:55,626	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So we were literally following these bacteria , and they could perform in that environment . 
EDL	00:08:55,626	00:09:09,730	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But if you said , okay , I want to take something that I engineered and laboratory , and I wanna put it in this contaminated site to clean up with them , it would never work because their microorganism is live everywhere . 
EDL	00:09:09,730	00:09:11,050	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They establish their own . 
EDL	00:09:11,450	00:09:19,400	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Nicholas , okay , so introducing this little weak laboratory strain of equality , it won't survive. 
EDL	00:09:19,400	00:09:25,290	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It wouldn't work , and just another angle was there , even at that time of regulatory framework that I would enable you to? 
EDL	00:09:25,290	00:09:33,328	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So from the lab out into the field , there is it like many regulator framework , sets a little bit complicated , but it does exist . 
EDL	00:09:33,328	00:09:44,160	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But we were so far away from that that even the national idea that we would like to do , that was almost crashes in regulation wasn't going to stop us from being successful here . 
EDL	00:09:44,160	00:09:59,630	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It was the science itself was going to stop the challenge , as I thought was we needed to be able to engineer organisms that for robust enough to survive , of course , have to deal with this problem of evolution . 
EDL	00:10:00,000	00:10:01,733	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Large population sizes . 
EDL	00:10:01,733	00:10:03,962	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Evolution occurs by mistakes . 
EDL	00:10:03,962	00:10:08,914	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Okay , when DNA could be copied and correctly and introduced his mistakes . 
EDL	00:10:08,914	00:10:09,410	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And it. 
EDL	00:10:09,410	00:10:14,040	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And we are all grateful for billions of years and worth the mistakes , are we? 
EDL	00:10:14,040	00:10:16,150	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Exactly the process works . 
EDL	00:10:16,510	00:10:20,930	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The public concern offenders who are going to create a superbug . 
EDL	00:10:21,510	00:10:22,510	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And my concern . 
EDL	00:10:22,510	00:10:28,080	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Actually , it was at the other end of the spectrum than anything we built this kind of break , just gonna , be too fragile . 
EDL	00:10:28,080	00:10:37,180	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So we have to be mindful of both if we want to engineer my crops that are resilient enough to do the job , but make sure that they are not innovating on the fly . 
EDL	00:10:37,590	00:10:44,320	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And one of the challenges there is this notion of engineering robustness into systems . 
EDL	00:10:44,320	00:10:53,540	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	If you talk to hard core engineers , build things like airplanes , there are many ways to make sure that airplanes fly safely . 
EDL	00:10:53,540	00:10:55,870	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Can we have multiply reduced systems ? 
EDL	00:10:55,870	00:11:00,000	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We have lots of sensing control , activation and so on . 
EDL	00:11:00,000	00:11:07,894	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We've got at the point now where air travellers incredibly safe , and there's entire engineering disciplines that help support that . 
EDL	00:11:07,894	00:11:26,620	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So I will talk to these engineers who are used working in the micro physical and say , okay , how do you deal with uncertainty and say a biological system , so is an example if you're thinking about an airplane flying , you can make reasonable guesses to what environment is . 
EDL	00:11:26,620	00:11:29,450	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Yeah , I know the temperature range that's likely to see . 
EDL	00:11:29,450	00:11:31,410	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I know how highest going to fly . 
EDL	00:11:31,410	00:11:33,450	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I can model the stresses on the wind . 
EDL	00:11:33,450	00:11:36,850	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Examples you could draw box around it . 
EDL	00:11:36,850	00:11:43,169	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Right , nature , you are very good thing that within a certain space that this should operate as expected . 
EDL	00:11:43,169	00:11:54,590	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And then beyond that , all bets may be off , but we've done a pretty good job during a box around the problem , but in biology , it's a lot more complicated . 
EDL	00:11:54,590	00:11:59,240	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We don't always know what an environment is going to be like . 
EDL	00:12:00,000	00:12:15,550	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Moreover , you have this past few thing of evolution , where is in physically engineered systems when something breaks generally , the fitness fertilized biological term of the object goes down . 
EDL	00:12:15,550	00:12:23,010	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Okay , so let's say , part of the airplane breaks the performance of that aircraft is generally not going . 
EDL	00:12:23,010	00:12:27,670	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Where is in biological systems breaking is innovation . 
EDL	00:12:27,670	00:12:33,010	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So it is possible that the reputation and organism acquires a new function . 
EDL	00:12:33,010	00:12:39,680	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It grows faster , now completes its colleagues when I talk to the engineers they go , is there an alliance of the world ? 
EDL	00:12:39,680	00:12:48,506	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The mechanical organizers know that the airplane breaks , it doesn't start flying twice as fast and twice as high as performance goes down . 
EDL	00:12:48,506	00:13:00,400	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So so there was a lot of intellectual barrier there that people thinking about engineering robust systems work as of yet thinking about she . 
EDL	00:13:00,400	00:13:02,960	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And it brings new challenges . 
EDL	00:13:02,960	00:13:04,780	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I recognize that , but i'm not an engineer . 
EDL	00:13:04,780	00:13:06,880	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So I had no idea how to solve this . 
EDL	00:13:06,880	00:13:12,710	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So when I came to dark , I had the convenient power of the purse , I could sculpt . 
EDL	00:13:12,710	00:13:22,727	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	A program basically asked , can we transition synthetic biology from electoral curiosity into the real world ? 
EDL	00:13:22,727	00:13:33,858	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So one of the great technological advancements of the last decades , so is the dramatic reduction in cost of DNA sequencing . 
EDL	00:13:33,858	00:13:38,306	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So we can study the DNA that's out in the world . 
EDL	00:13:38,306	00:13:51,020	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And there is a lot of , and by doing that , we started to recognize that there is this incredible diversity of microbes that grow honors and enough . 
EDL	00:13:51,020	00:14:14,560	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It turns out that if you are account up , the number of sales in your body that are yours , that have your DNA , and then compare that to the number sales of bacteria that live on your skin in your gut , those numbers , there's still a little debate about it , but there are approximately comparable and okay , so you are being driven by your bacteria . 
EDL	00:14:14,560	00:14:16,530	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They help you digest your food . 
EDL	00:14:16,530	00:14:19,800	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	For instance , they affect us in profound ways . 
EDL	00:14:19,800	00:14:23,190	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We're just beginning to discover the and. 
EDL	00:14:23,190	00:14:24,850	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But you should eliminate the straight . 
EDL	00:14:24,850	00:14:28,790	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So you essentially telling me that I am have bacteria. 
EDL	00:14:28,790	00:14:30,340	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	More or less , more or less . 
EDL	00:14:30,340	00:14:33,610	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So this opens up the tunnel is impossible . 
EDL	00:14:33,610	00:14:37,031	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They're by manipulating those bacteria . 
EDL	00:14:37,031	00:14:40,738	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We can develop their are politics , for example . 
EDL	00:14:40,738	00:14:43,304	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So the trade diseases of god . 
EDL	00:14:43,304	00:14:49,810	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Interesting , there's a typically hospital derived infection called ACDF. 
EDL	00:14:49,810	00:14:51,400	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Commonwealth cluster . 
EDL	00:14:51,400	00:15:02,090	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Divorce is essentially what happens in hospital settings is that when people take a strong , so in a biotics essentially clears the bacteria out of your gut . 
EDL	00:15:02,090	00:15:12,110	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Now see if lives in this very specific locations within your guards , that kind of hangs out in between some cells , and normally it's held and checked by everything else that's. 
EDL	00:15:12,110	00:15:12,890	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	In your guy , right ? 
EDL	00:15:12,890	00:15:24,867	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And just because some with owners probably approve the term we are talking about to hear about the , the microbiome right here , the microscope of the god , when you are talking about the bacteria over all of us , and that's the entire microbial amount of body . 
EDL	00:15:24,867	00:15:26,969	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I see you talking about the microbiology . 
EDL	00:15:26,969	00:15:28,020	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Yes , so specifically. 
EDL	00:15:28,020	00:15:28,693	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I got . 
EDL	00:15:28,693	00:15:34,981	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So what happens is that after and about a trip that got clears out , see if says , oh , my god , this is great . 
EDL	00:15:34,981	00:15:40,930	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You know , it's like it's expanding into a vacuum , and it makes people very , very sick that can be deadly . 
EDL	00:15:40,930	00:15:52,930	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The observation was made that perhaps by repopulating , the god with a normal gut bacteria , you might be able to knock down the city of infection . 
EDL	00:15:53,550	00:15:56,650	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So where do you get those bacteria repopulate ? 
EDL	00:15:56,950	00:16:06,160	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Well , the pilot terms these days are intentional microbiota transplant。
EDL	00:16:06,830	00:16:09,580	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But you are talking about vehicle material . 
EDL	00:16:09,580	00:16:13,960	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	However , correct that i've been appeared , and the place you prove this is a transport. 
EDL	00:16:14,420	00:16:21,980	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So in it works , if you eliminate a microbial community , you can replace it with a different community and restore function . 
EDL	00:16:21,980	00:16:23,670	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Now it's great work . 
EDL	00:16:23,670	00:16:27,160	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Some , it's something like ninety five percent successful . 
EDL	00:16:27,160	00:16:39,090	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But as I felt just the egg factor , if you had to design a solution to this problem is that the best you could come up with that , you would take somebody's pope and stick on him . 
EDL	00:16:39,090	00:16:50,238	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So if we started asking this question , could you build more to find communities from scratch , that might have the same function , but wouldn't carry all the extra packages . 
EDL	00:16:50,238	00:16:59,267	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So in that pope , there is a lot of other potential viruses and other bacteria that maybe you don't want to reintroduce into the cut . 
EDL	00:16:59,267	00:17:08,380	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So we , we , you've got very interesting this idea of building microbial communities that can perform a specific function , but have much more composition. 
EDL	00:17:08,380	00:17:17,889	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	This would cause be a tremendous service in a public health sense , because so many people , the astronaut testimony issues that seems to be related to the microbiome . 
EDL	00:17:17,889	00:17:20,790	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So you can come up with ways that are more political and to. 
EDL	00:17:20,790	00:17:25,130	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	To treat that , there would be religion , but it is also a department of defence specific problem as well . 
EDL	00:17:25,130	00:17:34,147	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So when soldiers deploy the place , reckon afghanistan , they're exposed to know my crops , whether something in the water and so on . 
EDL	00:17:34,147	00:17:37,779	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Traveler's diary , many of your other way of suffer from it . 
EDL	00:17:37,779	00:17:38,460	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It's not fun . 
EDL	00:17:38,460	00:17:52,760	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And not only can it ruin a vacation , but if you think about from a deep respective , if you're taking young , healthy people , you're deploying them in theater with the expectation that they're going to do in job , right , and then the sick , that's no good . 
EDL	00:17:52,760	00:18:00,000	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So one way that you could think about , maybe solving this problem would be to find a way of engineering robust community . 
EDL	00:18:00,000	00:18:10,320	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The god that more closely matches where they're going , and maybe your transition , that community state said , so maybe you get a tony , but you can be treated . 
EDL	00:18:10,320	00:18:11,370	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You're fine . 
EDL	00:18:11,370	00:18:13,550	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And then you deploy our season . 
EDL	00:18:13,550	00:18:17,010	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Don't have to worry about being not out of the game. 
EDL	00:18:17,010	00:18:22,550	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Right , as you arrive , if you were to characterize the status , the program breaks . 
EDL	00:18:22,550	00:18:24,460	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Now , how would you describe? 
EDL	00:18:24,460	00:18:26,740	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It's going well actually , very pleased . 
EDL	00:18:26,740	00:18:46,370	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So when we started that program , we realize that the science behind the microbiome is changing incredibly rapidly when launch the program , we didn't say specifically that we were going to solve this microbial engineering problem , because I felt that those problems were quite as well defined as we wanted . 
EDL	00:18:46,370	00:19:02,770	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So what we did was , what are the tools and technologies that we will have to develop that allow us to engineer microbial communities or microbiology that can function in complex environments , because we thought that there were gonna be some commonality . 
EDL	00:19:02,770	00:19:07,520	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So a microbial community in your god has to deal with changing environment . 
EDL	00:19:07,520	00:19:11,580	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Right , one day I drank a diet coke , and I had a breeder for lunch . 
EDL	00:19:11,580	00:19:12,820	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Then I ate a salad . 
EDL	00:19:12,820	00:19:16,020	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So there is all sorts of different stuff falling through there . 
EDL	00:19:16,020	00:19:35,635	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So what we said was , if you have the ability to engineer microbial community to perform a define function in some suitably complex environment , we figured we would learn enough lessons that we could then take that to maybe a different function in a different complex environment . 
EDL	00:19:35,635	00:19:51,688	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So certainly some primitives , commonalities in terms of the problems that you would have to solve to engineer community , that's going to function , whether I ultimately want to reach near a got microbiome or skip microbiome , or soil microbial . 
EDL	00:19:51,688	00:19:56,078	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	There are probably some common allies to the solutions there . 
EDL	00:19:56,078	00:20:14,040	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You can have any research groups developing on this one , right it overall , the program is probably about a dozen , and they've come up with some truly creative solutions to some of the challenges that we give them is the beginning of the program . 
EDL	00:20:14,040	00:20:25,720	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But we want you to engineer community that has an impact on an organism in a rational , predictable , safe , robust way . 
EDL	00:20:26,060	00:20:34,992	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It wouldn't specify what the test case had to be , whether the performers who focus on came with ideas to find their own space . 
EDL	00:20:34,992	00:20:38,716	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We , we define how complex could be or needed to be . 
EDL	00:20:38,716	00:20:46,829	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	But we didn't say engineer to get microbial of eggs , so we got some really creative solutions , including some that we're unexpected . 
EDL	00:20:46,829	00:20:53,947	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So some of the ones that I say were a little bit more online with what we kind of thought would come in . 
EDL	00:20:53,947	00:21:16,509	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Was we have a group at the vincent statuted harvard LED by pam solar in her group now have engineered a microbes that concerns information , and it changes color when it senses information takes a diagnostic soap , it can result in the god of they're using animals . 
EDL	00:21:16,509	00:21:22,665	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So using a mouse , it can resign the god of mouse for something like a hundred days without mutating . 
EDL	00:21:22,665	00:21:25,849	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So this is one of the things that we are worried about . 
EDL	00:21:25,849	00:21:29,587	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I thought this was going to be that the systems were gonna muted . 
EDL	00:21:29,587	00:21:31,009	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Waitress that they don't . 
EDL	00:21:31,009	00:21:36,696	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Actually , I am so as a pleasant surprise , they show that you can detect information in the bowl . 
EDL	00:21:36,696	00:21:39,060	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Scott , basically by looking at the pool . 
EDL	00:21:39,060	00:21:52,677	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So if there's information that might spot blue , so you can imagine , ultimately , using this is a diagnostic , one of the other more surprising test cases that agree with the university of texas LED by nancy . 
EDL	00:21:52,677	00:21:57,656	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Marian came up with was the microbiome of the honeybee . 
EDL	00:21:57,656	00:22:06,226	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Got , so we were definitely not expecting this , but it turns out that the honeybees are really interesting test case . 
EDL	00:22:06,226	00:22:18,170	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So unlike you and I , who have a lot of different microbes and architects , the honey bee has , depending on they , somewhere around eight or nine different species of bacteria . 
EDL	00:22:18,170	00:22:19,910	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So much simplified web satisfied . 
EDL	00:22:19,910	00:22:22,290	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So it was not one , but is not a thought . 
EDL	00:22:22,290	00:22:29,421	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So we thought that this was a really useful test case , because it's complicated , irreducibly complex . 
EDL	00:22:29,421	00:22:35,258	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And what also is it to think about the honeybee is the honey bee is a social animal . 
EDL	00:22:35,258	00:22:37,827	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It displays learning in memories . 
EDL	00:22:37,827	00:22:41,096	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You can train honey bees to do tasks and so on . 
EDL	00:22:41,096	00:22:52,450	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So what the text team was interested in doing was manipulating the gut microbial of the honey bee to see if we could alter their learning memory . 
EDL	00:22:52,930	00:22:55,550	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And it turns out that this actually works . 
EDL	00:22:55,550	00:23:01,600	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It turns out that there is something that known as the good brain access . 
EDL	00:23:01,910	00:23:09,310	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So there is an incredible number of nervously backwards from your brain and send up onto the god . 
EDL	00:23:09,830	00:23:17,370	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	If you think about it , you have the god brain axis and inside the gut , you have all these microbes living , and they're doing something . 
EDL	00:23:17,370	00:23:21,210	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And it turns out that there's essentially , you got brain microbic . 
EDL	00:23:21,210	00:23:24,296	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So the microbes in your gut can actually tackle your brain . 
EDL	00:23:24,296	00:23:28,160	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We are the molecules they produce how to interact with the cells in the gut. 
EDL	00:23:28,160	00:23:29,630	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So for absolutely amazing . 
EDL	00:23:29,630	00:23:35,700	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So the potentially opening up the door of engineering my own god microbial , and a way that might make me a okay . 
EDL	00:23:36,270	00:23:38,860	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So you know , we were , you know , that would be very cool . 
EDL	00:23:38,860	00:23:44,930	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So you are there yet , but you know , so you went by up to you only told us about two , and the user is about a dozen other groups . 
EDL	00:23:44,930	00:23:46,360	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We cannot get into all of them . 
EDL	00:23:46,360	00:23:52,270	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	In fact , I wanna move on now to the , to the second program , which is fairly new . 
EDL	00:23:52,270	00:24:13,950	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And this one goes by the acronym , and that stands for engineered living materials , and I know , and earlier discussion , none of the kind of metaphors that came up as we were talking about this result of a really beautiful one of when you think of where our thoughts come from , and then you think of the seeds that are the beginnings of all of those trees that collectively become the incredible landscape . 
EDL	00:24:13,950	00:24:20,940	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So , but you are thinking about that sort of biological brilliance and landscape in another way . 
EDL	00:24:20,940	00:24:26,370	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So talk was about what is and what the settings , what is. 
EDL	00:24:26,370	00:24:32,190	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Great parts of these jobs that we get a pretty high level of view of the technology landscape . 
EDL	00:24:32,190	00:24:37,260	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I got to a meeting called by a fabricate . 
EDL	00:24:37,260	00:24:41,520	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I admit a group of a company , and you are called economic . 
EDL	00:24:41,520	00:24:45,260	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And what economy was doing at the time . 
EDL	00:24:45,260	00:24:58,064	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	What is actually going to call their business is they were taking fundamental particulars of mushrooms , and in particular , the mycelia , which of the parts of mushrooms are grown underground . 
EDL	00:24:58,064	00:25:04,750	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And if you ever walked out on your one one morning , and so yeah , you see mushrooms like where they heard of those comfort , right ? 
EDL	00:25:04,750	00:25:05,930	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They grow really fast . 
EDL	00:25:05,930	00:25:16,311	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Okay , I want economic was doing was they were taking this organism and mixing it the cheapest agricultural waste they could find . 
EDL	00:25:16,311	00:25:19,720	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So we're talking in corn stocks that are ground up . 
EDL	00:25:19,720	00:25:26,235	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Apparently there is a market for agriculture who , what they would do is they take the the waste . 
EDL	00:25:26,235	00:25:28,564	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They would take the michelle year . 
EDL	00:25:28,564	00:25:43,800	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They were put it in a mode , a physical mode , and after a few days , the mystery would grow to feel the voice , and they were getting material that essentially has many of the properties of policy styrenes of style , phone pack material . 
EDL	00:25:44,110	00:25:46,260	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And they can sell this as a packing. 
EDL	00:25:46,260	00:25:54,950	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The material of the fungal system , those are more fibrous kinds of parts of enough mushrooming bodies are right now , right thinking about. 
EDL	00:25:54,950	00:25:59,300	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Mushrooms , but in in here , it just kind of ends up looking almost like a film . 
EDL	00:25:59,610	00:26:18,540	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Okay , so and I thought this was so cool because palestinian is pulling a pilot styling of cups , as we speak is one of the most useful yet prisoner's substances on earth , and that it is so inexpensive to make it is cheaper to make virgin palestinians to recycle it . 
EDL	00:26:18,540	00:26:20,284	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And it turns out to go away . 
EDL	00:26:20,284	00:26:23,118	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Where is these mushroom based materials ? 
EDL	00:26:23,118	00:26:25,780	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	If you throw on a composition , the golden way . 
EDL	00:26:26,240	00:26:41,177	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And so I was really intrigued by this idea of growing material from a perspective , I was particularly interested in this idea of growing materials on a specific site . 
EDL	00:26:41,177	00:26:47,020	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And one of the things that the egyptian folks had shown me was that they could take . 
EDL	00:26:47,020	00:26:56,549	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	There are mushroom materials that are not particularly dense , but if you put them under heat and pressure , you can get a material that's more or less equivalent to fiber board . 
EDL	00:26:56,549	00:26:57,692	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I thought this is cool . 
EDL	00:26:57,692	00:26:59,980	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You can essentially grow these materials . 
EDL	00:27:00,440	00:27:04,650	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Now , if you think about the department of defense , we operate all over the world . 
EDL	00:27:05,060	00:27:12,250	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	If you think about a rebuilding effort in afghanistan , and let's say , you need to get a pilot point there . 
EDL	00:27:12,250	00:27:26,700	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And the delhi has the world's best logistics system out there , but shipping heavy pilots of private across the world in the dangerous ones to me seems it's necessary , but silly , right . 
EDL	00:27:26,700	00:27:29,252	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It costs a lot of costs . 
EDL	00:27:29,252	00:27:30,846	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Fuel is dangerous . 
EDL	00:27:30,846	00:27:48,060	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Why couldn't you see it or effectively a seed like star and then grow the materials that you want on sight , so you reduce the logistic burden , you reduce the cost , you increase safety because you're not trying to truck inherently low value materials across the industry . 
EDL	00:27:48,060	00:28:00,580	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And then if you take this step further and say , well , what are some other remote places we might want to eventually produce materials if we ever decide to live on mars , there's no home people out . 
EDL	00:28:01,690	00:28:04,530	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We're not going to get there by just shipping everything we need . 
EDL	00:28:04,530	00:28:09,310	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We're going to have to be able to grow in for structure . 
EDL	00:28:09,310	00:28:13,790	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So the own program really gets at this early stage of growing materials . 
EDL	00:28:13,790	00:28:17,911	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Oh , and by the way , we want the materials to remain alive . 
EDL	00:28:17,911	00:28:27,730	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So in packing materials , obviously , you may not want that to remain alive , but living systems have great properties right , they can sell for pair . 
EDL	00:28:27,730	00:28:30,320	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	They can certainly respond the environment . 
EDL	00:28:30,320	00:28:40,210	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So could you imagine having a structure that upon damaging soil repairs in south marginal way that you do if you get a cut , that would be great . 
EDL	00:28:40,210	00:28:52,580	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Could you have that that new changes are properties with respect to the , the environment , so temperature , they may change the color , so they'll become reflective or absorptive . 
EDL	00:28:52,580	00:28:54,990	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	If you were in general properties . 
EDL	00:28:54,990	00:29:01,740	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So there's something about maintaining the living properties of materials that I think it's really. 
EDL	00:29:01,740	00:29:04,990	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Compelling , like this absolutely makes the successful reminding me . 
EDL	00:29:04,990	00:29:28,350	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	This comes , I guess , I guess that of a tradition of something easy because of smart materials , smart material , an idea there I remember being , you can you build AAbuilding that might have a reactive process , it , depending on what humidity , what the media logic conditions are insulted in some ways of the building itself , just by changing its microstructure can accommodate . 
EDL	00:29:28,350	00:29:32,940	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And so maybe you use less energy to heat and less energy for AC. 
EDL	00:29:33,310	00:29:39,630	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	The thing is amazing about this dose is i'm imagining living inside of a that is living . 
EDL	00:29:39,630	00:29:52,360	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I love the thought of it , but I also , you all suggest me , the village with it makes me feel like I might be living inside of a body , and I like some money to want you to think about that for second , and I wanted , what should we be concerned about ? 
EDL	00:29:52,360	00:29:54,470	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I keep food and refrigerator too long . 
EDL	00:29:54,870	00:29:56,000	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It goes bad . 
EDL	00:29:56,000	00:29:59,130	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And so could my house go bad and respect? 
EDL	00:30:00,010	00:30:05,569	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Yes , these are some of the things that we've asked our performers to be thinking about . 
EDL	00:30:05,569	00:30:09,572	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So if you have a system that grows , how do you control that growth ? 
EDL	00:30:09,572	00:30:17,833	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And there's obviously a natural president for this right human beings go to roughly define shapes and sizes and so on . 
EDL	00:30:17,833	00:30:23,552	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So , so nature has solved this problem of controlled growth and development . 
EDL	00:30:23,552	00:30:29,500	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We have AAsecond track of the own program that is getting it just this question . 
EDL	00:30:29,500	00:30:38,470	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So can we program biological systems in the to adopt specific sizes and shape? 
EDL	00:30:38,470	00:30:48,680	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So can I just have to say so , this is one of the most more regular things to me about biology , about a seat , about a fertilized egg , because it comes fairly simple shape . 
EDL	00:30:48,680	00:30:54,770	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And i'm looking at you , justin , and you have an interesting shape of human beings with all kinds of shoes . 
EDL	00:30:54,770	00:30:55,680	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	You know how to take that . 
EDL	00:30:55,680	00:30:58,530	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I went in the best of ways . 
EDL	00:30:58,530	00:31:06,660	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So what a dog descriptions idea too , actually , now try to build that more full genetic function of biology into. 
EDL	00:31:06,660	00:31:08,170	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Engineering materials , right ? 
EDL	00:31:08,170	00:31:12,440	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So you mention the seats , even building with once a live material forever . 
EDL	00:31:12,440	00:31:13,450	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Right , we use would . 
EDL	00:31:13,450	00:31:19,252	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And how do we get that , what we take this single piece , very , very small seat with digital in the ground . 
EDL	00:31:19,252	00:31:20,929	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We grow it for twenty years . 
EDL	00:31:20,929	00:31:23,655	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We get this beautiful living tree that you provide . 
EDL	00:31:23,655	00:31:25,333	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	Shade can be on help here it . 
EDL	00:31:25,333	00:31:31,810	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So all these great properties can see you too out of the atmosphere and produce oxygen that we need to breathe . 
EDL	00:31:31,810	00:31:36,230	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And then what we do , we cut the dancing , and then we put in the killing . 
EDL	00:31:36,230	00:31:37,250	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We rendered an earth . 
EDL	00:31:37,250	00:31:40,270	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	We saw it up in the dimensional number . 
EDL	00:31:40,270	00:31:47,923	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So could you think about starting with essentially a tree progenitor cell and grow dimensional number ? 
EDL	00:31:47,923	00:31:57,349	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So the sales would keep dividing a specific developmental pattern , and they would know they would be programmed to go to specific sizes and shapes . 
EDL	00:31:57,349	00:32:01,080	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So producing the national number without go to grow a trip. 
EDL	00:32:01,790	00:32:08,360	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	So jessica , that was absolutely amazing discussion of taking me on a conceptual journey that is just pleasing me now . 
EDL	00:32:08,360	00:32:12,320	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And I just want to thank you for engaging in this conversation. 
EDL	00:32:12,320	00:32:13,392	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	It's been my pleasure . 
EDL	00:32:13,392	00:32:15,000	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	I wouldn't spend a lot of. 
EDL	00:32:15,730	00:32:32,030	| VfD E12 The Neobiologist |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from double for more information about justin galab and his breaks and own programs and the other break through technology is dark .
