EDL	00:01:31,392	00:01:37,024	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I would love to start out for you and learning a little bit about you about your background your education
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:37,792	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Some of the
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:39,328	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Important things that of
EDL	00:01:39,328	00:01:41,888	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Happened throughout your career
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:44,192	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That ultimately LED you here to Darby
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:44,960	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Tell us a little bit
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:48,288	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well let me tell you a little bit about my
EDL	00:01:48,288	00:01:49,056	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Background
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:56,992	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And tell you that the chili my relationship mathematics has been a developing one and I have to say that
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,016	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Over the years
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:59,296	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It has really
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:01:59,808	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	T-Pain
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:06,720	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I was born and raised in Iran which has a long tradition of excellent and rigorous mathematical and
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,000	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Technical education
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,768	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,048	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Receive my
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,072	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Bachelor degrees
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,376	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	14 applied math
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:16,704	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Physics from UC Berkeley from then I went to
EDL	00:02:17,728	00:02:21,824	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A beautiful Campus of University of Wisconsin-Madison
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:26,176	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And then I went to Brown to get my PhD in applied math
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:29,248	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	After getting my PhD
EDL	00:02:29,248	00:02:31,552	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I came back to
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:37,952	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Meme of Postgraduate School to California to Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey and spent several years as Professor ended
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,720	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Department of
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:39,232	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Like math
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:46,144	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And while I was there I was contacted by a colleague of mine was working and very sick
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:52,544	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Similar research areas she suggested whether I would consider getting a job as a program manager
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:55,104	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	For computational mathematics said efforts
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,384	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Of the scientist
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:59,456	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Research
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:04,576	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's Arlington basic on the same block as a Starbucks
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,904	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I wasn't even sure what that entails
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:15,072	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But having my colleague and friend in a position and watching her but she was able to
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:19,168	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To to achieve but actually an inspiration and that's when I said yes
EDL	00:03:19,168	00:03:21,728	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And how then was did you make the direct connection here with
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,264	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	DARPA I suppose
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,288	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To being a pmlc
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:26,592	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The interesting thing was that about
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:33,504	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Maybe couple years into my job but some program managers from TWRP approached me and they said that with the
EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:37,856	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Interested in going are coming to DARPA and
EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:40,160	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I have to say
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:46,304	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	If I thought getting a position to a full-service scary and cut about a character I thought the
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:48,096	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Kites DARPA would be
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,656	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The scariest thing to do
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:56,288	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I become familiar with the research that being supported by DARPA and our permission
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:03,456	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I was having a hard time trying to see her supporting basic Research In Math
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:04,736	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mathematics could be
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:09,856	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Of any relevance to what darpro was doing and making that connection
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:11,648	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You certainly have done that with your
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,928	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Programs which we will
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:19,327	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Talk about in a little while you really haven't discovered that there really is a connection between you and end the
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:20,351	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Grams
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,935	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Before we actually talked about those I want to pull back a little bit
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:24,703	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	10
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,751	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Find apps how you
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:30,591	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And Mathematics became lifelong partners and I asked you this because
EDL	00:04:30,591	00:04:33,919	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I think this is true for me and I'm sure many listener is that
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:35,967	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The mathematics is just one of those fuels are
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:37,503	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So many of us
EDL	00:04:37,503	00:04:38,527	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is difficult
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:42,111	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We we we kind of push it away. The earliest time that we can
EDL	00:04:42,623	00:04:48,255	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And yet you've really had this partnership Tressa how did you develop this what I imagine is a
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,279	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The kind of love for
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:49,791	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	For the discipline
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,375	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So my interest in mathematics
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:59,519	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Was not actually from the point of view of being interested in abstraction
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:04,639	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Or just because this is this was the way my
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,663	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mine worked
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:12,063	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I was always interested in problem-solving but I was also interested in gaining
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:13,599	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Better understanding
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:14,879	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Pictures of the physical world
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:18,463	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So I didn't want to become an engineer
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,743	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Even though
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:26,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	At the time it seemed like all the smart kids to with strong mathematical abilities would like to go to
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:32,543	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Engineering or they would go to medical school but then I decided no I
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:36,639	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I want to try to become more of a scientist so I was thinking of physics
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:43,039	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The only thing is that I started as a physics undergrad but it only took me taking semester-long
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:49,439	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Concourse in their experimental to realize I don't have a lot of talent that I realized you didn't
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:54,047	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Necessarily come with a lot of pleasure enjoyed spending my time doing experiments
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:58,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So then I decided that I tell you what really gives me
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:03,519	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A lot of pleasure in and studying hard as was actually the more mathematical
EDL	00:06:03,519	00:06:04,031	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Aspect of the
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:05,567	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The physics courses
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:11,199	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I found out that oh I can I did a very quickly become a double major
EDL	00:06:11,711	00:06:13,247	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In-flight mathematic
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:20,415	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So that's how I started interest me about applied math is that
EDL	00:06:20,415	00:06:23,487	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In that way of engaging mathematics
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:28,607	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You are looking at these symbols and working with the symbol that many of us associate with Matt
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:30,911	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And you are finding out how they relate
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:34,495	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Wheel World in pretty dramatic ways
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:39,359	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One way of making this concrete in this conversation might be for you to tell us about how
EDL	00:06:39,871	00:06:41,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You applied
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:42,175	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A kind of mathematics
EDL	00:06:42,687	00:06:47,807	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Kind of an innovation for which you now have some mathematical entities named after you
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:49,087	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And and how that
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:52,159	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Led to operational
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:53,439	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Changes
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:54,975	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	With respect to the international
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:55,743	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Space Station
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,535	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Can you just tell us that story
EDL	00:06:57,535	00:06:58,559	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	About
EDL	00:06:58,559	00:06:59,839	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	W that math
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,607	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Two space station
EDL	00:07:02,143	00:07:02,655	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So
EDL	00:07:03,167	00:07:04,447	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The research that
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:06,495	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Doing
EDL	00:07:06,495	00:07:08,543	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	During my PhD in afterwards.
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:11,871	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To do with control and optimization of
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Natural systems that are modeled by
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:16,223	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What's an example of an atom
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,551	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Sound
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,367	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Animal control of
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,439	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A structure
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:31,071	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Or any combination of interaction of these
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,839	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Different physical
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:36,703	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So in the case of for example of spacecraft control
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:42,847	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is that beer looking at the situation we're looking at complex nonlinear Dynamics
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,663	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Where in this case
EDL	00:07:46,175	00:07:48,735	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So that means little changes can lead to big
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:55,135	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Results possibly even even though the sound engineer system right this is not necessarily like climate that you would say
EDL	00:07:55,135	00:07:57,183	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Quit being a Sally don't have any control over
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Innate randomness
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,791	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Patient but he were talking about engineering system
EDL	00:08:02,559	00:08:03,839	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That we would like
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:06,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To perform certain maneuvers
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:07,167	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In an optimal fashion
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:10,751	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you're expecting your system in this case
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,775	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The skyscraper
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:17,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Needs to perform certain Maneuvers at that lets you minimize a certain
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:17,919	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Objectives
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,199	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So in this case
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,711	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You trying to do it
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:24,063	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Sometimes it minimum time sometimes you're trying to do it with minimum
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:26,111	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Energy or
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:31,743	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Minimum
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,535	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Something to go for it
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,815	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is propellant on a
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Spacecraft can cost
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:37,887	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	$10,000
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:38,911	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A pound
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,959	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So if you can minimize that
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:45,567	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And give the Nvidia another needs to cost by the house across stuff like in the case of
EDL	00:08:45,567	00:08:47,103	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The National Space
EDL	00:08:47,103	00:08:47,871	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Station
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The cost of refueling
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:50,687	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Could be
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:57,855	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I mean not that situation so you really have to use everything in the most cost-efficient
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,671	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	An optical Manor
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:03,999	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So in this case for me actually I have to say that
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:07,327	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The whole success story here I owe it to my
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:11,167	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Basically my colleagues were able to
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:13,471	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	They said forget the theory and
EDL	00:09:13,471	00:09:15,775	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The algorithms that we developed
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And basically
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:18,079	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Work really hard
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,591	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	2
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,871	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	How to implement
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:25,759	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Right and if we were to just to say simply what the result was
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:32,159	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	My reading is correct is that you were able to come up with a way of using certain systems like gyroscopes
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:34,207	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	On the space station
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,767	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To achieve fairly dramatic
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:40,607	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Changes like 90 degree turns 180 degree rotations without
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:41,631	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The used
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:44,959	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A propellant released minimizing to a great degree
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The need for
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,239	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Propellant
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,335	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And it's this would not have happened
EDL	00:09:51,871	00:09:53,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I did not come up
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:53,663	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	With
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,479	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Inefficient
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,503	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	An accurate way of
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,039	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Implementing days
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:03,903	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Right input the actual control that went to those gyroscopes
EDL	00:10:03,903	00:10:06,975	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Emerge from the mathematical framework that you were able to
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To develop into this
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:10,559	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Should have brought that line all the way from the smoke.
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,375	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Abstract way of thinking math all the way to this
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:15,935	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Million-dollar multi-million dollar savings
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,239	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Of how you operate the International Space Station
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:23,103	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That to me is sort of one of the Miracles of of math and its connection to the real world
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:26,431	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What's what's Segway than two
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:30,271	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And the two programs that
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:32,575	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You are working on here
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,903	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So one of them goes by the acronym equips
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,695	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That stands for
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:42,303	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Enabling quantification of uncertainty in physical systems
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:48,703	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The other one that goes by the acronym model that stands for models Dynamics and
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,471	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Learning
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,007	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So let's start with equips
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:54,591	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And again that stands for enabling quantification of uncertainty
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:56,639	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In physical systems
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,663	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Sounds
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:10:58,687	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Fascinating the idea of
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:00,735	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Quantifying uncertainty
EDL	00:11:01,247	00:11:06,367	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Tell us about the program what the goals are and what
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,647	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The status is
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:08,671	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	At the moment
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:10,719	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The goals of the
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,279	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Program I have to say no
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,047	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Southern Loft
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,351	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The fashion which is not always my
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:22,495	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Almost state of Rio Fest
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:27,871	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yes but I do have to say that I had very lofty goals for the
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:28,639	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Program
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,407	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,175	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The way
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:32,991	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In my mind I was thinking of the program
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:34,015	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I still do
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,295	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To dress like bleach
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,111	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Change the wave
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:38,623	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	B
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:41,183	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Go through our modeling and simulation
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:47,327	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What you were saying physical world engineering system
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,655	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We do have a long history
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,447	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Basically
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:53,727	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mama Soul of scientific
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:11:58,591	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	History def of modeling physical
EDL	00:11:58,591	00:12:01,407	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Systems and physical phenomena
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:03,199	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And using mathematics
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,551	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But what I'm saying about changing the practice of modeling is
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:08,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In some ways
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,623	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Taking into account
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:13,951	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	How good how how bad we are
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	As modeler
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:19,839	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's almost like being inside certain level of honesty
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,887	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	2R model
EDL	00:12:22,655	00:12:23,935	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Innocence dad
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:28,543	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We have to consider the fact that it doesn't matter how good
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,823	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We think our models are
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:33,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	At the end are just going to be an approximation
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:36,223	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It just going to be a surrogate
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,991	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	For the physical real
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:43,391	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The fact that in the process sometimes we are not quite clear
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,415	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	About the
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:51,071	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Let's say the discrepancy between our what the output of our models are and what the physical world is
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,119	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's going to create a lot of
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Issues
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:56,447	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	When we trying to analyze a cyst
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:01,567	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	As far as physical modeling goes probably one of the most successful
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Stories is basically
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,711	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The navier-stokes equation
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:10,015	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you might apply the never Stokes
EDL	00:13:10,015	00:13:11,039	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Equation for example
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:11,551	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	If you wanted to
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Try to describe
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,367	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	How
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:16,415	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The cream you pour into your coffee
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,439	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Goes into that
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Fluid in you see the Beautiful
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:20,255	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Horse world
EDL	00:13:20,255	00:13:23,071	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Or it might be the way
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,607	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Masses of air in the atmos
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,631	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Sphere are flowing
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,191	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Adventure intermingling itself
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:31,519	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That's the clothes at the range that were talking about with the taxi
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:36,383	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In a basically Huff love everywhere you know
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:37,663	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Airplane games
EDL	00:13:38,687	00:13:42,271	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's basically the fundamental of aerospace engineer
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:48,927	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	At the celebrated equation but the problem with it is that you didn't you talk to
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:51,487	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So people who are looking at
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:53,535	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Physical physical flows fluid flow
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:58,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And they do still scratch their head and it still can say that
EDL	00:13:58,655	00:14:01,727	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We are talking a certain situation let's and Hypersonic
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,031	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But it's not at all clear
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That this is
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:05,823	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Equation
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:08,127	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	How to get talking about
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:12,223	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You were still talking about fluids but it's at the scale and
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,527	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Serta physical condition that
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,295	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's not at all clear
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:17,599	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The right equation
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,879	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Steven try to
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,391	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Assimilate
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:26,559	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yes we do have airplanes that fly we do have an aerospace industry has been one of our most
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,583	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Successful
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,607	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Water Industries
EDL	00:14:29,375	00:14:33,727	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Let the 20 Century and it will be even more in at 20th and the teacher Center
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,007	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:40,127	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It makes you a little worried that the sum of the work and the mathematical work that is being done
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:41,663	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is based on
EDL	00:14:41,663	00:14:46,271	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Certain assumptions that and the physical models that may actually not hold
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:48,319	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Correct me if I'm wrong but
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:50,367	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	As you were speaking I'm realizing
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:50,879	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,415	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We have
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:53,695	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	These
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,719	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Technology wish list
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:15:00,095	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We want Hypersonic vehicles in Hypersonic technology things that are
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:02,399	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What's the operating faster than the speed of sound
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:03,423	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What you're saying is
EDL	00:15:03,423	00:15:07,007	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We've got mathematical equations and traditions and method
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,055	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Fly roughly in the kind of
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,823	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Phenomenal
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:11,359	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That are applicable in
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,127	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Designing
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:14,687	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Hypersonic vehicle but we actually don't know
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:18,527	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We don't know cuz if it's an accurate representation of of that
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,319	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Hypersonic
EDL	00:15:20,319	00:15:21,343	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Arena
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,879	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	This need for
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:29,791	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Quantifying or uncertainty or lack of knowledge and also the kind of error and discrepancy.
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:34,911	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Between a mathematical models and a physical reality and our Engineers system comes from engineers
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:38,495	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Because one of the things is that
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:40,799	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You're looking right now in situations
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:41,823	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Bad
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:44,127	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The only way they can
EDL	00:15:44,127	00:15:45,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Consist of
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:46,175	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Certify
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:48,479	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Let's say their design or whatever did Bill
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:49,759	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:52,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	By using something right and in this case
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:54,623	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Probably try to do it using
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,231	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well in certain situation you can test
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:03,839	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And maybe you can if you do test summon the kind of testing maybe could do it
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:06,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In certain maybe certain components
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:09,215	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Before testing on the system
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,519	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Praise up listen up Coldplay
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:15,359	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Will necessarily have to be done on the entire when he's after you've already built it
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:20,223	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That's a little too late in order to come up with
EDL	00:16:20,223	00:16:23,039	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Ways of changing a design or changing the way it's
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:27,135	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Being built right so you would like to be involved in that whole process
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:29,951	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	As a mathematician and as an engineer
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:31,487	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A little earlier into that
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,791	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So the only way to do that
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,583	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Testing is not going to help
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Personable insurance
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,375	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Situation is
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:39,167	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is maybe too expensive
EDL	00:16:39,679	00:16:40,191	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Too late
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,727	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Something
EDL	00:16:42,495	00:16:43,007	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Possible
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:45,055	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is using simulation
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:49,407	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Whole thing about simulation is based on having a mathematical model
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:56,319	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And having the simulation tools like a basic it is numerical methods and all that and a computational tool
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,879	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:00,159	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Platform store
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:02,207	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Computers that you can actually Judy
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Assimilation
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,815	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So this is where you see that math comes in right there
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,375	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And this is the only way
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:10,911	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That we can test out
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,703	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	These
EDL	00:17:13,215	00:17:16,543	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	These new designs on your that are not already there not built
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:19,103	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But you have basically the elements of
EDL	00:17:19,103	00:17:21,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The design so you can at least test it out
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,687	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Using simulation
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:23,711	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Before
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:25,247	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Before you go
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:28,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I think I heard you once
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,135	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Talk about this is almost like a mathematics
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:32,415	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Honesty
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:38,559	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yes it is and I love the phrase now that you're talking about
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:39,583	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	This
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,119	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	World of
EDL	00:17:41,119	00:17:42,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Simulation
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:42,655	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Which is
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:45,215	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Based on mathematics and then perhaps
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,751	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mathematical models
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:48,799	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Operating in the form of computer mod
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,127	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But in there in that kind of abstracted
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,151	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Place
EDL	00:17:53,151	00:17:54,431	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	An extracted operation
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:57,247	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You're trying to develop a framework with equips
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:58,527	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:01,343	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It is kind of the reality check in the map
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:03,647	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Exactly how well is this
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:06,719	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Representing ultimately the real world
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:08,255	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Technology that we want
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,791	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To emerge out of this
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:10,559	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mathematic
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:11,071	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Sex and modeling
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:14,399	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is that
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,679	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mice characterization
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:21,055	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And what is so fascinating about this is that the feels goes very quickly from some
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,847	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	May in in the beginning may think
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:24,127	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Some philosophical
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:31,807	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Ruminations about what is reality what is representational reality what is a relationship
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:33,087	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Should of mathematics 2
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:35,391	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Physical world very quickly
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:36,415	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	2
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:38,975	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Some beautiful Theory
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,535	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So interesting
EDL	00:18:41,535	00:18:43,839	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Result that I expect from eclipse
EDL	00:18:43,839	00:18:45,375	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is to see whether it's
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:51,775	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Possible to come up with some common Frameworks and common tools that could deal with some of the
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:52,799	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The major challenges
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,639	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Within looking at very different application prompt
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:19:00,223	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	This is this is going to be an interesting
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:04,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A process to to observe and see what results come out of it
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,903	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Because the performers at this point are looking as system as
EDL	00:19:08,671	00:19:14,815	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A different as possible from each other from Aerospace structures to integrated circuits to chemical
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:18,143	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So we'll see whether something
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:18,655	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Commonwealth
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:19,679	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Come out of
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:23,007	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What's the maybe that's a nice cue to talk a little bit about
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:23,775	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Model
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:25,567	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Are the models Dynamics in learning
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:30,431	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So there's actually a very nice link between
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,479	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The program equips and model
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:36,575	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One issue that I need to emphasize about
EDL	00:19:36,575	00:19:37,343	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Quips
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:42,207	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Because right now I've only talked about about basic as you mention it took
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,743	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Trying to
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,767	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Capture
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	4
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:49,887	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Make honesty as part of her modeling
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:50,399	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Process
EDL	00:19:50,911	00:19:53,471	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But I haven't really told you about the challenges
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,519	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That beat we have enough
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,055	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Processing
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:19:59,359	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One of the biggest challenges is that
EDL	00:19:59,359	00:20:03,455	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The complex world that bear looking out of compass system we are looking at
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:04,479	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The high dimension
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,783	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	When you say hi dimensionality
EDL	00:20:07,551	00:20:10,623	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What do you mean by that sounds like there's many parts that we have to think about
EDL	00:20:10,623	00:20:11,135	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Right
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:15,743	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Exactly so so there's a lot of times when you think of dimension
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:18,815	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And you might have heard that you're thinking about the dark
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,095	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Three physical dimensions
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:24,959	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And then we have a dimension of time so we we think our physical world is basically
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,471	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Laika for dementia
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:30,591	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But the way we're using dimension
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:35,967	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Basically here is what we think exactly is the degree of Freedom or basically
EDL	00:20:35,967	00:20:37,759	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The number of variables that
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,295	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We need in order to
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,063	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	2
EDL	00:20:40,063	00:20:40,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Build a model
EDL	00:20:41,343	00:20:42,111	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What represents
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:45,439	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	At model a robot with 10 joints
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:46,719	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is that
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:48,255	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I could think of that very simply that
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:49,791	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	10 dimensional problem that is
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:50,815	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Exactly
EDL	00:20:52,095	00:20:53,375	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	1000
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:55,935	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You could be very exact
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:21:02,335	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And the interesting part is that you look at a robot and you have your look at it okay but I want to write down basically
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,615	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What I'm thinking about the
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,639	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The number of
EDL	00:21:05,151	00:21:08,223	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Variables are modes or whatever that I can
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:10,271	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Express the physical variable that I'm interest
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:12,831	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But at the same time
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:15,135	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Sometimes when I wanted to
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:17,184	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Any kind of approximation
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Right
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Of each of these
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,096	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	10 variables
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:25,120	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Start end dimension
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:29,472	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Each Dimension I'm actually need additional
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:30,752	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Dimensions
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,288	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In order to do my app
EDL	00:21:32,288	00:21:33,056	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Approximately
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:39,200	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So this is like at every step of our modeling here and and an approximation we are introducing
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:45,088	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	More Dimension cx-10 demand what we say is a 10 dimensional system
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:51,488	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Ends up being for example for each Dimension I may need another 10 yesterday
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:52,512	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Way of seeing how
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,536	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	10 Dimensions multiply
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:56,096	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In that robot cases that
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:56,864	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Each joint
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:22:02,240	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Self has has these three spatial dimensions and the temporal so each one has four
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:08,128	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So suddenly were already at 42 have to do with the physical
EDL	00:22:08,128	00:22:10,944	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Relate to the physical
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:15,040	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Representation but someone says something's Dimension comes from our
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,880	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Approximation and the modeling and the mathematical work that we need to do
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:21,440	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's at 7
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Really good question
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:25,024	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I said what what may be talked about
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:26,048	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	High dimensionality
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:29,120	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And this is what happens with the
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:30,912	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A system that we are looking at
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:34,496	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Dad's representation of this physical
EDL	00:22:34,496	00:22:35,776	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Systems
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:38,080	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Require
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:41,152	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Lots of Dimensions lots of variables lots of
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:42,944	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Heideman
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:45,248	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And the and the higher the dimensionality the
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:49,856	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The harder to compute to put into a computer actually run a simulation
EDL	00:22:50,368	00:22:52,416	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Legos back to how much Computing can we do
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:56,000	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And people say we'll know right now we do have
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:00,096	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Extremely good extremely fast
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,632	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Computing platforms
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,168	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And that is true
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:05,472	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And that's why at this point we can do
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:07,776	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Computing physical system that
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:09,312	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	20 years ago was no pasa
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:13,152	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But the more you do
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:16,480	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The higher the demand on viewer analysis tools
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,040	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Know about model
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:26,208	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So model is a sort of an acronym for models Dynamics and learning
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:31,840	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I would say that the goal of the program is
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:35,936	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Extracting mathematical models from Dynamic dataset
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:40,544	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The goals of a program when you say dynamic
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:45,408	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Dataset something a lot of data Dynamics makes me think of motion or time
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:51,808	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Did I get that right or would you want to ask what I mean by Dynamic data set is a data set that you get from
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:55,136	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Dynamical system with your system was Behavior changes
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:55,904	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Spectre
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:24:02,304	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you are a dynamic system I mean it's just life is
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,608	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The greatest example of a dynamical system
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:07,424	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One of the reasons that I wanted to
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,960	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Have this program
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:13,312	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Was also again seen that existing tools
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,848	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That we have or modeling
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Cannot handle
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:19,456	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Us on the complex dynamical system
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:23,552	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That we need to analyze
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:28,416	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You're looking again very similar but we're looking for a sample system such as weather
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:31,488	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In a fluid
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:37,632	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Biological systems even Engineers system like communication networks or
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:38,912	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Eunos
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:41,984	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Human social networks these are all examples of
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,288	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Dynamical systems
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:47,616	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But we don't have very good analytical
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,176	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Medical models to
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:51,200	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	2 Express
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:54,272	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The complex behavior of this system
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:57,344	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	If you just look at a dataset from
EDL	00:24:57,344	00:24:59,136	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Something like turbulent flow
EDL	00:24:59,904	00:25:03,488	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's fascinating because you CDs
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:07,328	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	These vortices these holes these Eddie's
EDL	00:25:07,328	00:25:13,472	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Is beautiful patterns come and go
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,008	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Exactly that's the
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,568	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What's so beautiful about these
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:19,616	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Old is different fennel confit
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:23,712	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	6 phenomena that can be expressed and then you see at these some commonality in
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:29,088	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And in this case what we trying to learn is that what are the common patterns that can be learned
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,648	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And basically
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:34,720	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Express dynamics of these systems
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:37,024	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	In terms of evolution of
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,072	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Yeah I search
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:43,680	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	We don't have the mathematical tools yet to deal with the data
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:49,824	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Some people say why you no look at us we not only beer at the age of Big Data be also the age of
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:54,944	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Machine learning and oldest different ways that we can handle data of any size
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:58,784	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But what I'm saying is that
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,064	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Assisting techniques
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:01,344	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Cannot handle
EDL	00:26:01,344	00:26:02,112	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The fact
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:03,392	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That data is
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:03,904	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Dynamic
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,792	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I know actually now going back and say look
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:13,888	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Go back to the beginning of dynamical System Theory
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,168	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I'm trying to develop
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:18,240	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Different way of modeling
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:20,800	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Extracting these models from dynamic
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,872	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Give me one example of a
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:27,456	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A phenomenon a system a technology that cannot really be modeled well now
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:30,528	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That if your model program is to
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:31,040	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Successful
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:32,064	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Wildomar
EDL	00:26:34,624	00:26:40,768	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Alaska performance in model program to start with something that we think we have some grasp of
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:47,168	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And use it basic as a test case I'm going back again to the classical problem of basic guitar panel flow
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,192	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	My Hope Is that
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,472	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	They can
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,544	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Plida methodologies
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:54,848	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mathematical methods that day
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,640	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Developed
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:59,968	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Two systems that are much less understood
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:03,808	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And their system for example of data did you get for example
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,600	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Wolfram neuroscience
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,392	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you're talking about things like
EDL	00:27:07,904	00:27:09,952	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	How brain signals propagator
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,232	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	How
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:12,256	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Patterns of new Rolex
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:12,768	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Tivity associate
EDL	00:27:13,280	00:27:14,304	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The sensory stimuli
EDL	00:27:14,816	00:27:15,328	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Or the way we move
EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:16,864	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Absolutely
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It could be
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:19,680	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Data that you can get even from
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Social networks and so
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:22,752	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Social systems
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:26,592	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And basically two systems for which was really
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:27,360	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	All right
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,384	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You're lacking
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,408	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Proper
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:30,432	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mac Medical
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:31,200	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Modeling
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:34,528	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Before Time runs out here I I just want to ask
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,088	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One question about
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,648	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Being an applied mathematician at a place
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:40,928	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Like DARPA
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:45,024	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One of the phrases hero a lot here is the Innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,584	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And what that means is
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:51,680	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It really was referring to what kind of all the players and all the stakeholders that it takes in order to go
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,704	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I'm sort of an idea about it
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,496	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	G2a
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:55,264	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Technology that you
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:56,288	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	But you haven't had that
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:57,824	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	What's the operational to the field
EDL	00:27:58,336	00:27:59,872	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So as an applied
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:02,944	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Mathematician what what do you think you can do here that you might not be able to do
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:07,552	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I saved our price probably the best place to be
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:08,576	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	If you are
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:14,464	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Applied mathematician in fact I just say format fewer mathematician and blank to solve a problem
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,232	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Because
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,512	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	One of the
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:19,328	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Greatest thing about door prizes dad
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,352	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	There's this wealth of
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:23,168	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Information about the
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:27,264	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Problems that are important and
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,824	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	I have to say they're very very cool
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:33,152	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The coolness Factor
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:37,760	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	4 problems to solve for a mathematician
EDL	00:28:37,760	00:28:39,296	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Here is enormous
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:46,208	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Because you feel that not only your solving a problem that has importance there's certainly broader
EDL	00:28:46,208	00:28:51,072	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Impact as far as universal solvent important problems and National Security
EDL	00:28:52,096	00:28:54,912	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Videos of feel like the problems are so rich
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,704	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That is some ways
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,496	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	There is some
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:00,032	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	There's so much to contribute
EDL	00:29:00,544	00:29:02,592	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The richness of the problem
EDL	00:29:02,592	00:29:04,128	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Are just
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,920	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Maybe the
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,944	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Biggest driver
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:09,248	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A motivating factor
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:10,016	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Anybody
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:12,832	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Certainty for mathematician and I and I just want to add
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:14,880	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That is that
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:18,720	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And I've been saying that to my my
EDL	00:29:18,720	00:29:25,120	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Friends to my colleagues anybody who would listen that why mathematics is actually very important to 2
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:25,632	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	DARPA
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,680	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And encourage them to come
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,008	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Feature program manager is that
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:32,288	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	When
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,568	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	You are encountered by
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,616	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Important problems
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:38,176	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And you see that your ideas
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:43,040	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	The role you have as a mathematician that not only try to look at these
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:48,672	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Particular Problems by Detroit to abstract out and coming with different representation that would yield
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,256	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	A better solution for these problems
EDL	00:29:52,256	00:29:54,048	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	So you basically see
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:57,376	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	That you ideas are at work I mean what better satisfaction
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:59,168	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Well free busy
EDL	00:29:59,168	00:30:01,216	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	It's been a delight for me to talk
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,752	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	To you about
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,544	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Your Love of mathematics
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:06,080	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	Coming out to your right now
EDL	00:30:06,592	00:30:10,176	| Episode 08 The Uncertainty Wrangler |	And to get some sense of how mathematics does
