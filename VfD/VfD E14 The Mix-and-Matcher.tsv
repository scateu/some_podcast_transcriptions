EDL	00:00:11,790	00:00:16,981	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Still of technology , the internet GPS in the palm of your hand are tonight
EDL	00:00:16,981	00:00:22,240	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Operation technology is a driver of our times
EDL	00:00:22,710	00:00:33,790	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Since its founding nearly sixty years ago , in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , the defense advanced research projects agency has been a driver of the technology
EDL	00:00:34,650	00:00:43,000	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:43,530	00:00:47,154	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	My name is iphone a motto , and I am your dark post today
EDL	00:00:47,154	00:00:53,270	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I am pleased to have with me in the studio , gym girl numbers , a program manager since twenty fifteen
EDL	00:00:53,270	00:00:56,950	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Industrial technology , as we will learn in just a few minutes
EDL	00:00:56,950	00:01:14,010	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He is among the dark program managers who was oversee programs that fall under the system of systems category , which is to say , very complicated technology frameworks with lots of components and moving parts among the technologies he integrated into unprecedented framework
EDL	00:01:14,010	00:01:26,040	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Maritime defence include undersea communications on the men , vehicles and systems , maritime power , energy systems or tournament's operation and networking of men and other systems
EDL	00:01:26,680	00:01:44,790	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Prior to joining double , jim was the director of the advanced technology office at the applied research electoral located a pencil in a state university there , he oversaw a research projects , including our indian solar systems and underestimate power systems for tropical and unmanned vehicles
EDL	00:01:45,130	00:01:56,350	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Jim earned a bachelor's urine physics from the USneighbourhood academy and then served five years on active duty as a nuclear trained officer in the USnavy following activity
EDL	00:01:56,350	00:02:04,030	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He joined the neighbor and earned his masters and doctoral degrees , nuclear engineering and plasma physics from the university of washington gym
EDL	00:02:04,030	00:02:04,606	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	globalized
EDL	00:02:04,606	00:02:06,525	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's so good to have you in the studio
EDL	00:02:06,525	00:02:08,060	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's my pleasure to be here
EDL	00:02:08,060	00:02:10,555	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Let's start by talking about your background
EDL	00:02:10,555	00:02:18,250	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You are background physics when you escape academy , and I suggest me that you arrived at the academy with some interests in science and the navy
EDL	00:02:18,670	00:02:20,030	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So where those interests come from? 
EDL	00:02:20,590	00:02:26,890	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well , I think my interests in the science and engineering really came from a my father
EDL	00:02:26,890	00:02:32,020	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I was raised in a family that had a lot of engineers , so that was kind of an expected thing
EDL	00:02:32,020	00:02:39,850	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And and I did pretty well in those subjects , although I didn't really know that man like most students , but I was kind of good at it
EDL	00:02:39,850	00:02:47,110	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And one thing about the neighborhood made eighty percent of everybody was the engineer nose day , so wasn't a hard. 
EDL	00:02:48,480	00:02:51,616	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I would guess that you're interested in plastic and physics
EDL	00:02:51,616	00:03:01,080	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's what you studied in your regular years , which is central to the process of nuclear fusion , somehow emerge from your time serving a nuclear submarine , which relies a nuclear enforced proportion
EDL	00:03:01,080	00:03:07,420	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I think you said to me one time that you would , you did a lot of boiling of water , but tell me about sort of that that connection you have with position and fusion. 
EDL	00:03:07,900	00:03:25,310	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah , well , it was all the interests of mine , just as a garden engineering , the whole world nuclear industry , and using fishermen to make power , of course , being in the navy , the opportunity go on a submarine and and serve was really the attraction
EDL	00:03:25,310	00:03:34,770	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's what got meant to it , that the fusion piece actually came about from experience ahead at the last animals in the summer time
EDL	00:03:34,770	00:03:45,320	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I have to confess that I did that solely to get out of spending a hot summer and maryland yelling at freshman , I looked for ways to get out of that
EDL	00:03:45,320	00:03:48,990	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	One of the options was to do a research of system
EDL	00:03:48,990	00:04:13,020	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It blows almost national lab , and I ended up working with the group in a plasma physics , doing fusion work , and the key piece that was just breathy for it was the first time that I was in a laboratory , and we were trying to do something where we did know how it was going to turn out previously that in classrooms and laboratories are those scientists in high
EDL	00:04:13,680	00:04:17,710	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You were usually just trying to make something work that you knew
EDL	00:04:17,710	00:04:42,570	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The answer was just , could you make it happen , and it was at last , almost where I finally saw we were doing experiments , and I realized these really bright people , they hope they know it was happening , but the reality was we did experiments to find out , and then we adjusted , and that was very exciting to me was to see this whole really doing research to explore , as opposed to just get something right
EDL	00:04:42,570	00:04:43,850	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You could get a great on it. 
EDL	00:04:43,850	00:04:45,272	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A tester of alabama , poor
EDL	00:04:45,272	00:04:51,200	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it was sort of that that excitement about discovery really slowing something you want nature totally. 
EDL	00:04:51,200	00:04:57,180	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	My , my whole view , and that's what let me choose and do that for grade school , I wanna get out of the navy. 
EDL	00:04:57,860	00:05:02,630	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then after your service and education , you , he went often to the defence industry for a while
EDL	00:05:02,630	00:05:10,370	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He worked on such things as under water , shark systems directed energy , weapons , counter , rocket armor and laser based instrumentation
EDL	00:05:10,370	00:05:15,266	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And well , so the fantastic surrounding phenomenon and technologies
EDL	00:05:15,266	00:05:24,818	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then you went into a more academic , there's still defence central setting up in state , and then somewhere along the way , you went to sector with dark
EDL	00:05:24,818	00:05:25,482	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So can you
EDL	00:05:25,482	00:05:27,945	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah , that intersection happened actually. 
EDL	00:05:27,945	00:05:42,220	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Manufacturing happened when I left grad school , and I joined the small company called vice power technologies in industry , which was the small company where you mention some of those projects and a undersea shark. 
EDL	00:05:42,220	00:05:47,020	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Programs for listener rice , who do not know what that mean , what , how would you describe that? 
EDL	00:05:47,020	00:05:49,250	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's by the way , I pad more fun
EDL	00:05:49,250	00:06:11,140	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	One of the anybody should , as far as the kind of range of projects we get to do what we were looking at was the whole idea of , can I create a nursing shock wave , which means basically light , often explosive under water , but do it in a way that we can shape the shock , waste or pile up on top of each other and smash something like a mine
EDL	00:06:11,460	00:06:13,850	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So we're actually looking at mine clearance , doing that
EDL	00:06:13,850	00:06:22,140	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that was an idea that we , we saw the darker as something that they would be interested in seeing if we could make it work
EDL	00:06:22,620	00:06:24,780	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that became my introduction to dark. 
EDL	00:06:24,780	00:06:29,980	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But so what i'm reading from that , that is that you are , what industry speaks is your performer
EDL	00:06:29,980	00:06:35,580	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yes , and performers are those who end up getting research contracts , working on some program
EDL	00:06:35,580	00:06:38,541	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So you are a performer worker in that particular project
EDL	00:06:38,541	00:06:44,760	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then so I presume that my new met other program managers may be enough to director , and that LED to a discussion. 
EDL	00:06:44,760	00:06:48,390	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah , we , we actually did a number of programs
EDL	00:06:48,390	00:06:53,538	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I probably three or four dark pilgrims as a performer during those years
EDL	00:06:53,538	00:06:59,148	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Then when I transition to the applied research lab , it can stay we , we picked up a couple of more
EDL	00:06:59,148	00:07:12,930	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So I had a had an ongoing relationship , actually , through multiple organizations of being a performer , doing dark programs , and exactly as you described as actually a former PM. 
EDL	00:07:12,930	00:07:27,800	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And at the time that video office structure climb light , can you point me aside and wanted to see , hey , what i'd be interested in , according to the site of the table and conceiving ideas and being a program. 
EDL	00:07:27,800	00:07:30,515	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay , and you quite evidently did come over here
EDL	00:07:30,515	00:07:38,871	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If I just go into your program manager page on the website , and or if I am talking more directly , I learned that you have three programs on your wing
EDL	00:07:38,871	00:07:48,450	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now , two of them , the blue wealth program and hunter programming both have to do with on men under water systems
EDL	00:07:48,450	00:07:50,350	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And there is one very multiple program
EDL	00:07:50,350	00:08:10,270	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's the cross domain and maritime surveillance and targeting program were known , in short , as city mass , and that's really a program which there was an unexpected systems of systems idea , of course , which the other two programs kind of feeding too is kind of component systems of the systems of systems
EDL	00:08:10,270	00:08:20,542	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So maybe we can talk about city masks and the whole idea of systems of systems , which really is a theme throughout durable
EDL	00:08:20,542	00:08:27,330	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You see , that kind of category is defining many programme's wealthy , the six technical offices
EDL	00:08:27,330	00:08:29,680	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So tell me what you think of with. 
EDL	00:08:29,680	00:08:35,320	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This concept of an absolutely an , exactly , in fact , and this is what kind of need about darker
EDL	00:08:35,320	00:08:40,520	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This is what IItalked to kind about the shoes talking about bringing me and was to look at
EDL	00:08:41,390	00:08:44,890	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We have this initiative to do system systems
EDL	00:08:44,890	00:08:46,770	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We want to look at american version
EDL	00:08:46,770	00:08:47,740	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Would you do that
EDL	00:08:47,740	00:09:07,000	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well , first , you had to understand what we mean by system of systems , and it's really this idea that as our defence has matured over the last few decades , and we make more more capable platforms , and a good example would be saying airplane or a submarine
EDL	00:09:07,780	00:09:09,750	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	These are becoming very sophisticated
EDL	00:09:09,750	00:09:14,320	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Platforms are very capable , but they also expensive
EDL	00:09:15,080	00:09:24,820	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They also take a long time to make , and what we're finding is to make them even better , cost a lot of money and time
EDL	00:09:24,820	00:09:29,260	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And you don't necessarily get that much more capability than you
EDL	00:09:29,260	00:09:34,410	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If you wear it is kind of creating like an awesome top , is you put more effort into it
EDL	00:09:34,410	00:09:36,070	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's getting increasingly. 
EDL	00:09:36,860	00:09:39,445	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And nobody seems to be a limited , yeah , just how much. 
EDL	00:09:39,445	00:09:43,055	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How much employee , yeah , that is tipping over
EDL	00:09:43,055	00:09:56,520	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And and so the whole idea that is , is there a better way to look at things to say , if I really want to do what dark is supposed to do , which is major capability gains and big strides
EDL	00:09:57,000	00:10:01,620	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Is there a different way to look at things , and one of the ideas is what
EDL	00:10:01,620	00:10:07,090	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How about if we distribute some of the functions that are on this platform
EDL	00:10:07,090	00:10:10,680	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So if you think about a platform , what is it
EDL	00:10:10,680	00:10:12,120	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It has the sense. 
EDL	00:10:12,120	00:10:16,050	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It has to defend itself and by platform you might. 
EDL	00:10:16,050	00:10:21,530	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I entered an aircraft , yeah , aircraft to a submarine exactly the
EDL	00:10:22,130	00:10:25,556	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it has this function that needs to sense
EDL	00:10:25,556	00:10:29,774	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It needs to communicate , it needs to defend itself
EDL	00:10:29,774	00:10:32,640	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It needs to do data process , I think
EDL	00:10:32,640	00:10:35,840	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And if I put that , all there is great , I concentrated
EDL	00:10:35,840	00:10:39,870	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But now , as I said , it is incremental gains
EDL	00:10:39,870	00:10:42,540	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And at each time I make a change of the facility of the stuff. 
EDL	00:10:43,180	00:10:43,920	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What if I. 
EDL	00:10:44,460	00:10:49,510	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Do a term we call what we disagree that I take these functions , say the sense in function
EDL	00:10:50,320	00:10:57,500	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I put it on a lower class platform , say , like an unmanned system that I can put farther away
EDL	00:10:58,080	00:11:12,070	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So now I get even greater dancing , because instead of being stuck on my platform , it's now far away , and in broader , and maybe I move forward , even open the earth of the nearest exactly , so I get high advantages
EDL	00:11:12,380	00:11:14,280	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The key pieces is I still have
EDL	00:11:14,280	00:11:22,980	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I have to be able to communicate , but if I can do that and handle the networking part to make all these things worked together
EDL	00:11:22,980	00:11:35,820	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well , now I really covers in my adversary , a difficulty , instead of doing what they are doing now , which is boring , lots of money , and to be able to go after these single platforms that are high value
EDL	00:11:36,490	00:11:39,590	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now they have to decide g do I go after the sensor thing
EDL	00:11:39,590	00:11:41,050	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well , I get that
EDL	00:11:41,050	00:11:43,350	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What's those two others are three more
EDL	00:11:44,680	00:11:47,880	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay , you got a little bit of my sensing , but I am still going
EDL	00:11:47,880	00:11:57,900	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And oh , by the way , the main aircraft or ship is still going , and so it forces them to now spread their forces to cover more
EDL	00:11:57,900	00:11:58,200	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	thanks
EDL	00:11:59,000	00:12:14,950	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And this whole idea is , I try to do this in a way that my total class is less than what I would for just a single platform , but my capability is much increased , and the problems I cause for the other side are much greater than. 
EDL	00:12:14,950	00:12:20,057	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It sounds to me that it also adds two things like versatility and resilience of the versatility
EDL	00:12:20,057	00:12:27,753	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now you can mix and match all kinds of different things until these systems of systems at the same time of one , it thinks , taken out of the other
EDL	00:12:27,753	00:12:29,254	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You still have this resilience
EDL	00:12:29,254	00:12:32,330	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We are , you're not thinking of shape , you're making so easy. 
EDL	00:12:32,330	00:12:39,137	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	No , you've written because that whole idea of an all talk about it is a adaptability
EDL	00:12:39,137	00:12:47,280	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Maybe I want to change my mix in real time , which means , hey , we know what the mission is , and we need some better
EDL	00:12:47,280	00:12:56,150	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Let's say , jamming capability or something I can put that in the mix , much easier than I can change it out on the whole platform
EDL	00:12:56,150	00:12:57,550	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We kind of get what you get
EDL	00:12:57,550	00:13:05,820	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	One else is an interchangeable parts , and you hit it on the head with resilience and see it means they have more things to deal with
EDL	00:13:05,820	00:13:13,960	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so if they take care of one or two of them , and we like to use the term , we degrade gracefully , as opposed to either , are more
EDL	00:13:14,300	00:13:15,000	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I am done
EDL	00:13:15,830	00:13:23,070	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And the other way , it's adaptable is over time , in the sense of hey technologies changing
EDL	00:13:23,070	00:13:30,730	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's one of the biggest factors for , yes , we see it in our commercial world all the time , and new iphones are coming out
EDL	00:13:30,730	00:13:33,600	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	New capabilities hit of filming a movie
EDL	00:13:33,600	00:13:51,240	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I do all I want my military systems to be able to adapt on those time scales , as opposed to it's gonna , be five years before we can build the next airplane if I more disagreed and disagreed and disagree , it is easier to change those parts out
EDL	00:13:51,240	00:13:52,790	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So both over long scale. 
EDL	00:13:53,160	00:13:56,170	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This is another theme i've been hearing about your job in other places
EDL	00:13:56,170	00:13:58,392	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The technology cycles are just speeding up so much
EDL	00:13:58,392	00:14:08,140	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so there is this interest in more editorial in turning that cycle faster without the huge amount of expense in the matter time it has taken the past to do that
EDL	00:14:08,140	00:14:10,830	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They go from version one to two , to three to four
EDL	00:14:10,830	00:14:13,240	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I guess this is in the maritime domain. 
EDL	00:14:13,240	00:14:15,880	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And absolutely , it affects all the domains
EDL	00:14:15,880	00:14:19,280	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And one of the issues there is your heroes used to turn
EDL	00:14:19,280	00:14:23,100	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And one of the challenges with compatibility
EDL	00:14:23,100	00:14:38,070	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How can I get better and quickly pulling these things in and making them so that they go to it together easily , and I don't have to do lots and lots of engineering and test steam to put these two things together
EDL	00:14:38,070	00:14:44,125	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that part of the system system challenges is getting good at being able to rapidly compose and policy. 
EDL	00:14:44,125	00:14:53,020	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Systems together , okay , so for some reason , as you were talking about this aggregation , I was thinking about a human body , which is a system of systems that got eyes that the system of get a liver
EDL	00:14:53,370	00:14:59,770	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's sure that this system of cells , and if that would disagree with it , actually , we and it will still be a living body with them
EDL	00:14:59,770	00:15:04,860	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The , it was an amazing task of command and communication and integration
EDL	00:15:04,860	00:15:16,620	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Kind of aware metaphor , perhaps , but it seems to protect yourself if you taking apart what has been an integral system like carrier , and you know , this , aggregating this into all kinds of pieces , what about that integration
EDL	00:15:16,620	00:15:18,295	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that sounds like a hard problem , it. 
EDL	00:15:18,295	00:15:20,618	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Absolutely and and you've done two things
EDL	00:15:20,618	00:15:39,610	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I like the body example , because the easiest thing to think about in our eyes , or a primary sensor , and I know how much better could you survive if you had to set the eyes that were yellow fifty yards in front of you , and you had an extra nose that you could put out over trying to do it
EDL	00:15:40,350	00:15:51,363	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But now you've hit on the head is , well , it works good my body , because those nerve endings you'd only have to go from my brain down to my nose or my eyes
EDL	00:15:51,363	00:15:52,706	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's not too far
EDL	00:15:52,706	00:15:54,210	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now I put it there
EDL	00:15:54,210	00:16:08,740	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So we put the prayer on being able to set up effective communication passed that are reliable , because otherwise , what good is that knows that she should sit mouth there that could smell everything
EDL	00:16:08,740	00:16:12,440	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But if you can get it back to the brain , it's of no value
EDL	00:16:12,440	00:16:22,122	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so you've tied in when we talk about these system of systems programs , sometimes people ask , well , you are really developing a lot of new technology
EDL	00:16:22,122	00:16:24,197	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You kind using existing stuff
EDL	00:16:24,197	00:16:37,590	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And exactly right , the dark , but hard part , the challenges , yeah , but i've got to do this now and make these reliable communications and networking and functions
EDL	00:16:37,590	00:16:43,700	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He knew , now i've got instead of two eyes , i've got four , what i've got to have a brain now that can handle that
EDL	00:16:43,700	00:16:49,060	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Which means how do I sequence things and do things because i'm getting more information
EDL	00:16:49,560	00:16:55,215	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's a good analogy to see what we're trying to do with the system of systems from a military stamp , right? 
EDL	00:16:55,215	00:16:59,430	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And again , when you talking about dark but hard , we are talking about systems and systems
EDL	00:16:59,430	00:17:05,781	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	When you are entertaining , very ambitious ideas like this , more than entertaining , actually trying to make them
EDL	00:17:05,781	00:17:10,451	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So what also then comes in here are issues that of communications , security
EDL	00:17:10,451	00:17:14,010	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And you know what I might want to try to spoof the system
EDL	00:17:14,010	00:17:16,221	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I might want to try to generate
EDL	00:17:16,221	00:17:21,650	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so suddenly these kinds of considerations become part of your above thinking. 
EDL	00:17:21,650	00:17:24,520	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Oh , absolutely , becomes a huge deal
EDL	00:17:24,950	00:17:27,790	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I can't afford to have somebody call up
EDL	00:17:27,790	00:17:33,810	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know , my forward eyeballs and turned them to look at the wrong direction to me
EDL	00:17:33,810	00:17:36,690	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so it's a good example of technology
EDL	00:17:36,690	00:17:38,160	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We're taking advantage of things
EDL	00:17:38,160	00:17:43,450	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But after then , look at what's the counter move and and do this straight off
EDL	00:17:43,450	00:17:45,080	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And and by the way , this is why we were doing
EDL	00:17:45,080	00:17:50,870	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This is dark , but it's not a hundred percent certain that this is the way to fight the future
EDL	00:17:50,870	00:18:00,030	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's our high politics , and there's a lot of evidence suggests , if you can do it , it's a great way , but that's a big year , and that's why we're doing the research
EDL	00:18:00,030	00:18:06,250	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So can we really make this work and be secure and reliable , and all these things that happen and. 
EDL	00:18:06,960	00:18:09,500	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Right , so you really probably what is possible
EDL	00:18:09,500	00:18:20,781	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And in , and if it is possible , even if it is desirable in the end , right when you do get together with other program managers here , other other professions here at the top to talk about systems of systems
EDL	00:18:20,781	00:18:23,690	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Who are you talking with , what are , what are some of the other ways
EDL	00:18:23,690	00:18:28,370	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I guess programs that you think of when the systems of systems , categories on your mind. 
EDL	00:18:28,370	00:18:29,580	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah , and it is funny
EDL	00:18:29,580	00:18:31,540	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	There's kind of two versions that I do
EDL	00:18:31,540	00:18:44,530	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So when I talk to other , when I true systems of systems PMand others program managers were doing other systems systems program , you know , in the defence science is office
EDL	00:18:44,530	00:18:45,505	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	John passed with
EDL	00:18:45,505	00:18:47,212	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He is really looking at
EDL	00:18:47,212	00:18:56,460	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey , can I come up with mathematical constructive to help me do that composition instead of a state of , hey , I think this looks good
EDL	00:18:56,460	00:18:58,770	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Let's try it now , let's go from there
EDL	00:18:59,120	00:19:04,230	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So we talk about what about , hey , how can I have machine learning
EDL	00:19:04,230	00:19:18,430	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	An intelligence helped me pull the stuff together , and interestingly , we almost always end logistics , because one of the issues is , now , i've got more things spread over part
EDL	00:19:19,140	00:19:21,790	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How do I get on there , and how do I sustain them
EDL	00:19:21,790	00:19:26,950	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know , the body works while the eyebrows come with the head , and it's a nice pack like it
EDL	00:19:26,950	00:19:29,560	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now i've got these two extra boards out there
EDL	00:19:30,260	00:19:41,021	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Who's going to hold on the doors and keep them care and fed it saturday , the other way , though , that I talk to PMabout programs is , how is there particular technology
EDL	00:19:41,021	00:19:47,363	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So maybe they're making a better unmanned aircraft , or a better sooner
EDL	00:19:47,363	00:19:48,835	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Where does that fit? 
EDL	00:19:48,835	00:19:51,860	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Under the system of systems where those systems feature. 
EDL	00:19:51,860	00:19:53,336	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Where do they fit in
EDL	00:19:53,336	00:20:03,480	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's where we've had really fun dialogue because of the next one of the big problems for somebody can come up with a great idea for a better sonar
EDL	00:20:03,480	00:20:05,460	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I work on that now developed it. 
EDL	00:20:06,610	00:20:08,600	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But danny kind ends up. 
EDL	00:20:08,600	00:20:13,585	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Porch of the panic on with I will this great sonar , but where do I put it in
EDL	00:20:13,585	00:20:18,136	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How should I employ it and enjoy by ten of them , or do you know what I do
EDL	00:20:18,136	00:20:28,104	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know what's interesting in system and systems you started to think about the whole , and it helps guide some things to say , you know what we really need
EDL	00:20:28,104	00:20:36,300	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That song is be able to look wider , not necessarily farther or different things that might help direct their work
EDL	00:20:36,300	00:20:41,440	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But at the same time , we're giving them a great story to say a husband fits in
EDL	00:20:41,440	00:20:42,580	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And my gosh does. 
EDL	00:20:42,580	00:20:43,856	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Make a difference , right
EDL	00:20:43,856	00:20:46,045	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Such an interesting thing that I elected
EDL	00:20:46,045	00:21:00,030	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You're putting out potential technologies capabilities , but then you're getting back information from the field where the commanders and work hard , who are exactly giving you feedback and say , you know , this is what we really need is this is what we've experienced in an dynamic
EDL	00:21:00,030	00:21:01,700	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You come up with something that really does
EDL	00:21:01,700	00:21:03,230	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Further reino national security. 
EDL	00:21:03,230	00:21:09,070	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Absolutely , in what's unique in this program that i've done , that , i've never done in my research career
EDL	00:21:09,850	00:21:25,860	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We actually spend a lot of time working with the navy and organizations to create a very sophisticated war fighting scenario , very realistic , based on the , except for more to guide our research
EDL	00:21:25,860	00:21:27,870	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's not normally done
EDL	00:21:27,870	00:21:34,900	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We usually kind of think k or look at an engagement in this would help me defeat this aircraft if they came against me
EDL	00:21:35,610	00:21:40,300	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Very rare to look at in terms of , hey , what would I do to win the war
EDL	00:21:40,300	00:21:42,140	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's the phrase we like to use
EDL	00:21:42,770	00:21:43,760	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey , this is great
EDL	00:21:43,760	00:21:52,680	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's a nice technology , but doesn't help me win , and that's not usually question that we ask , you know , we usually just say , doesn't make me faster. 
EDL	00:21:52,680	00:21:59,699	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Stronger , better yet , so as you bring in some languages in here , like , like music with the work
EDL	00:22:00,000	00:22:10,170	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	There's , there's another phrase I heard roundup , but I think it must relate to this next music or fair had that relate to systems of systems
EDL	00:22:10,170	00:22:10,520	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	yeah. 
EDL	00:22:10,520	00:22:17,510	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Music welfare is , in some sense , it is a different name for a system system
EDL	00:22:17,510	00:22:34,100	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Certainly this system fits into it , but it's this whole idea of the ear of bringing lots of pieces together , and no individual piece does everything tells the story , but collectively get the picture
EDL	00:22:34,790	00:22:40,870	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And what's interesting is , you can afford to lose a few pieces , and you still get the picture
EDL	00:22:41,340	00:23:01,820	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's this idea of being able to compose to make your music , tell a different message on our case , do a different function for the military and be able to put that together , make it , do that , rearrange the pieces , but does something different
EDL	00:23:01,820	00:23:09,910	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Tell the different story , so to speak , and it can withstand the fact that , like I said , if a few pieces get knocked out , you're not done
EDL	00:23:09,910	00:23:11,700	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it's really that the same idea
EDL	00:23:11,700	00:23:19,450	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But when I liked with the music is when you talk about this , the imagery of here , I can rearrange these two different stories to me
EDL	00:23:19,450	00:23:23,050	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That means I can recompose a new , different mission. 
EDL	00:23:23,760	00:23:30,100	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Right now , in a sense , that's been going on for a long time , but we have different military services that are different capabilities
EDL	00:23:30,100	00:23:31,800	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They work in a kind of different domains
EDL	00:23:31,800	00:23:43,500	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so you can almost think from a generalized point of view there , there has been this kind of music thinking , but here will also bring that down more on the technology levels. 
EDL	00:23:43,500	00:23:49,960	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Absolutely , and there is a little bit , you know , nothing is new , but we're trying to take it to a greater limit
EDL	00:23:50,530	00:24:12,200	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And one of the biggest differences there is , is , were really trying to bring in I men systems with man's systems and and game , create this much more rapid , adaptive , because yes , things have changed , but usually it would take decades to say , oh , organized this way differently
EDL	00:24:12,200	00:24:20,325	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And among the user , this kindness system differently in and in many years , it will come out and we'll put it together
EDL	00:24:20,325	00:24:24,240	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so you get very aesthetic kind in how you operate
EDL	00:24:24,240	00:24:25,930	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This is to be much more fluid
EDL	00:24:25,930	00:24:30,640	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So if you write its an extension , but really trying to take it to that lemon. 
EDL	00:24:30,640	00:24:33,810	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I said that you have had experience and academic
EDL	00:24:33,810	00:24:35,690	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I was more violent on the sudden side
EDL	00:24:35,690	00:24:38,651	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Thanks , you've had industry experience
EDL	00:24:38,651	00:24:50,670	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You're networking in the government setting , in particular , darker , some , just wondering how you view double and weight in the overall innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:24:50,670	00:24:51,700	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Where , where does it fit? 
EDL	00:24:51,700	00:24:55,056	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah , we have the services that have more traditional hay
EDL	00:24:55,056	00:24:58,413	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We've got these products , and we need to get better
EDL	00:24:58,413	00:25:09,750	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So what do kind of product improvement if you will , as opposed to dark is , hey , i'm gonna create a whole new virus product in terms of a whole new capability
EDL	00:25:09,750	00:25:16,120	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so it's the defense department , and really , that's the way we operate fairly quick
EDL	00:25:16,120	00:25:17,760	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We pull ideas together
EDL	00:25:18,140	00:25:21,000	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You then have an opportunity to make your case
EDL	00:25:21,000	00:25:37,038	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You need to baby , do a small project to get some data to tobacco position , but then you go forward and you meet with the tech council , and in a very short time , you'll get an answer that says , yes , let's go forward
EDL	00:25:37,038	00:25:40,610	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And now you are after the races to really make. 
EDL	00:25:40,980	00:25:56,190	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	By tech council , you're referring to what I understand here for program managers , or sometimes rehiring experiences where you have to go in front of leadership and really make the case for why the research is worthy , why it could have benefit to tax players and national security
EDL	00:25:56,190	00:26:00,000	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I think one other thing I was here when you use this VCeventual camp
EDL	00:26:00,000	00:26:07,908	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Local analogy is that there , also , I think , is unusual willingness , even expectation that there will be failure along the way
EDL	00:26:07,908	00:26:20,060	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Because if you are going to really move forward , not just incrementally , but in big steps , maybe you even leaps that you , you are going to fill one way onto his extraordinary , absolutely. 
EDL	00:26:20,060	00:26:26,630	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Just like as a venture capitalist , if you show up and say , hey , i've got a way to get to ten percent on your mind
EDL	00:26:26,630	00:26:28,321	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They're not interested
EDL	00:26:28,321	00:26:35,932	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They can go to the banker somewhere and get that what they want to see is , how do I tend for my money
EDL	00:26:35,932	00:26:48,900	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Same idea with dark , but when you're doing things like that , if it was that easy , everybody be doing it so that you have to be taking risk , you have to be pushing for things that you don't haven't been done
EDL	00:26:48,900	00:26:51,140	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And you know , a hundred percent of taking amy. 
EDL	00:26:51,810	00:26:57,109	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay , also , we're getting toward the end of our time here , but for some reason , feeling little mean
EDL	00:26:57,109	00:27:07,160	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	and so a german wouldn't ask you , since we just been talking about the value of failure , if you've got to feel your story to share with 我要。
EDL	00:27:07,160	00:27:18,440	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Turns out I probably have several , but user one , because it exists back to an old , dark project that this was when we were imagined earlier on the shock process
EDL	00:27:18,440	00:27:36,220	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We had a billion apparatus with a lot of , if you will think of it as a bunch of little cans , and or maybe sixteen of them all on a big rack that we loaded into the , and any idea was we would shoot this often and try to do the timing right to make a shock wave
EDL	00:27:36,220	00:27:47,080	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And we loaded in the water , and we hit the button , and we got the first shot , and we thought that was , and I speak bubble in water , and then we hit the thing again
EDL	00:27:47,420	00:27:57,070	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well , we did not have a sunny singing another time after a few times , we finally decided that it's not working and swiss to get it to bring the crane up
EDL	00:27:57,680	00:27:59,100	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He pulled it up there
EDL	00:28:00,030	00:28:06,840	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I think maybe one wire still dangling from the end of it , and we had bonuses and complete the smell of rings
EDL	00:28:07,280	00:28:16,440	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I think it took divers about two weeks to go find all the parts that we sprung all over the bottom of this query that we were testing
EDL	00:28:16,440	00:28:20,260	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that was not a completely typical day of. 
EDL	00:28:20,610	00:28:22,270	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How can I go sometimes
EDL	00:28:22,720	00:28:24,540	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay , but you learn some lesson
EDL	00:28:24,540	00:28:25,110	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We did
EDL	00:28:25,110	00:28:31,570	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We changed the way we ran up for sure , thereby was a kind of just another day in technology directly
EDL	00:28:32,440	00:28:37,250	| VfD E14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So jimmy , it's been a pleasure to spoken with you here for at least half hour
