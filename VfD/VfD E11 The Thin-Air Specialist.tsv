EDL	00:00:11,660	00:00:16,090	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Self technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand. 
EDL	00:00:16,090	00:00:32,030	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Autonomous operation technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight in the midst of the cold war , the defense advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:32,740	00:00:41,420	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as a core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:41,960	00:00:45,398	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	My name is ivan a motto , and I am your daughter host . 
EDL	00:00:45,398	00:01:23,895	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And i'm please have with me in the studio today , choosing a program manager since twenty fourteen , industrial systems technology of others try earned a pair of bachelor's degree is one in electrical engineering and one in computer engineering from west virginia university and our masters and doctoral degree and electrical engineering from the university of michigan for a decade prior to coming to DARPA , try founded and LED a series of programs within the micro electric mechanical systems technology department of sandia national laboratories in elbow cookie , new mexico , thanks for a journey in the studio today . 
EDL	00:01:23,895	00:01:24,570	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Now the point . 
EDL	00:01:24,980	00:01:29,010	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So i'd like to start out of discussion with some background about you . 
EDL	00:01:29,010	00:01:38,760	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I'd like to tell me about your education if there are teachers that were important to you growing up , and that let you in the kinds of engineering correction that you have. 
EDL	00:01:39,070	00:01:54,188	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yeah sure , so I grew up in a small town in west virginia , western , western , to be exact when I was in high school , I had exhausted the math classes were available at my local high school , so I ended up going part time to west virginia wesley in college . 
EDL	00:01:54,188	00:02:01,020	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And they set up kind of a class for many students from my high school , go to a class for high school students , the local college . 
EDL	00:02:01,390	00:02:05,760	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And before that , it was been good mass , but I never really knew how to apply it . 
EDL	00:02:05,760	00:02:11,560	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I figured I would go in the medicine or something of that nature , and it's part of that special class they set up for us . 
EDL	00:02:11,560	00:02:22,780	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The first half hour professional bride would come in , and he was engineering physicists , and he would come in and relate all of the calculus we were learning to physics problems . 
EDL	00:02:22,780	00:02:29,320	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I just found that fascinating , so that one of the junior high school , and from that point forward , I wanted to be an engineer. 
EDL	00:02:29,320	00:02:37,750	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So I like to hear a little bit about the base of your career where you really work a lot on men and get next steps from micro electric mechanical systems . 
EDL	00:02:37,750	00:02:42,550	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I know you did that even before going to a sandy as I talk a little bit about that whole man. 
EDL	00:02:42,550	00:02:47,180	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Part of your work in graduate school to university , michigan , I worked for a professor . 
EDL	00:02:47,180	00:02:50,491	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Canvas is one of the founders of names there . 
EDL	00:02:50,491	00:03:08,440	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I worked on analog interfaces for normal recording electorates , so I was developing integrated circuits to be able to record nervously potentials the brain for doing things like restoring function to people who have nervous system disabilities like paralysis . 
EDL	00:03:08,440	00:03:14,808	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Could , could be other things in the stimulation sense , like blindness , or are hearing loss or other of that nature . 
EDL	00:03:14,808	00:03:23,187	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I didn't went to send the international laboratories , which things a little bit of michigan I was designing circuit in their faces for members . 
EDL	00:03:23,187	00:03:30,284	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And sandy , I started exactly designing the max components and let the team of people designing and employment in those . 
EDL	00:03:30,284	00:03:33,729	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Primarily , we were working on small acoustic devices . 
EDL	00:03:33,729	00:03:40,420	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So you may not know that in your phone and all of signal is immediately converted into an acoustics of. 
EDL	00:03:40,420	00:03:43,015	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I arrived by our female radio frequencies. 
EDL	00:03:43,015	00:03:59,330	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Corrector , yeah , yeah , I mean , radio frequency , the radio frequency signal , which has a really long way of linked this converted into a acoustic signal , which has very small wavelength , which allows third in a small form factor before it's create , turned back into an electrical signal . 
EDL	00:03:59,330	00:04:15,610	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Uh , my joy was working on technologies that do that function , but more for department of defense applications , rather than the elephant , also worked on other things that really at the interface of the vibrational systems and acoustic systems and electronic systems and. 
EDL	00:04:15,610	00:04:17,960	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	All right , and then what was the pathway from sandy? 
EDL	00:04:18,310	00:04:24,610	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Two drop , I was a performer doing a lot of the research on those small acoustic violence components . 
EDL	00:04:24,610	00:04:30,270	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Bill chapel , the current director of microsystem technology office , was my program manager . 
EDL	00:04:30,270	00:04:37,640	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And so when he was promoted , he called me out of the blue one day , I think that was in march of the twenty fourteen . 
EDL	00:04:37,640	00:04:39,980	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Instead , he tried , this is built chapel . 
EDL	00:04:40,780	00:04:43,140	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How would you like to come the dark , but be a program manager ? 
EDL	00:04:43,140	00:04:44,320	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I think you be great at it . 
EDL	00:04:44,320	00:04:49,060	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I shared north , as was the bodies that was kind of a strange conversation . 
EDL	00:04:49,060	00:04:53,080	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I said , yeah , that that sounds like a great opportunity . 
EDL	00:04:53,080	00:04:54,560	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Can I call you back at a few minutes? 
EDL	00:04:55,660	00:05:00,030	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And is that that all all it took a few , just a few minutes , and then you know what your. 
EDL	00:05:00,030	00:05:07,320	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Oh , of course , i'll mean after that , I mean anybody who is an opportunity to come in to the album is fantastic opportunity . 
EDL	00:05:07,320	00:05:18,010	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Of course , I had to come in our view and put together talk that outlined the programs I would start to have to come in a view with the office director , but how it all started was from a phone call from belgium. 
EDL	00:05:18,640	00:05:32,110	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Speaking about those programs were gonna die when to talking about a number of those who have a very large portfolio , the most program managers that will only talk about a few , but there are two questions I want to ask you before we do that one has to do with your name . 
EDL	00:05:32,110	00:05:39,500	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Try , I call you try , but your official name is roy , and i'm just wondering if you could tell us the story of your name. 
EDL	00:05:39,500	00:05:41,821	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes , so my fish name is royal herald . 
EDL	00:05:41,821	00:06:05,450	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Also , the third turns out my dad really wanted me to be named after him is clearly roy herald's in junior , and my mom wasn't the biggest fan of the name roy , but so they made a deal that I could be named royal holders in the third , and everyone will call me troy and enforced this when I was a small child , as legend has it , I would sit in my high chair . 
EDL	00:06:05,450	00:06:11,530	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And if people called me roy , I would throw green wings at them and pound on a high chair , telling them the money in the morning was. 
EDL	00:06:11,530	00:06:13,420	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Nothing like negative reinforcement . 
EDL	00:06:13,420	00:06:21,384	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And so let some move on to we'll just some of your programs too , that I think our associate with one of those who can talk about them together . 
EDL	00:06:21,384	00:06:34,670	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Go by the short names of equals and paper equals stands for inbound controlled air releasable unrecoverable systems and zebra stands were vanishing programmable resources , and the vapor came before equals . 
EDL	00:06:34,670	00:06:39,570	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So I wanted to tell us a little bit about the labour across story , which is an ongoing woman. 
EDL	00:06:39,570	00:06:45,004	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yeah , so um , in the department of fans , a lot of times we have problems with electronically behind . 
EDL	00:06:45,004	00:06:50,080	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We don't want to leave things on the battlefield where other people might collect them . 
EDL	00:06:50,080	00:07:00,030	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We came up with the paper program , which is vanishing micro electronics program , is designed to be able to make micro electronics that have reliability . 
EDL	00:07:00,030	00:07:07,100	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Four months , commissioner , with commercial of the shelf electronic components that don't vanish . 
EDL	00:07:07,100	00:07:13,320	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But that when we want them to can rapidly vanish and and be invisible to the naked eye. 
EDL	00:07:13,320	00:07:17,620	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Okay , and do you mean when you say vanish in the most people to think of puff , it's gone . 
EDL	00:07:17,970	00:07:28,945	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Talk to me a little bit about the kind of technical path with some of your performers , which is to say , the research groups have been working on the kinds of pathways they're taking to try to realize this idea of vanished ability. 
EDL	00:07:28,945	00:07:33,205	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes , it is really too approaches that have been really prominent in the paper program . 
EDL	00:07:33,205	00:07:57,930	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A one was developed by the palestinian o'clock , and it is a vanishing glass substrates that basically turns into dust like particles , and that glass can be bound to integrated circuits and other things , and causing an entire system to you to vanish , and by dozens like particles , the part of the order size of one hundred mile crowds , which is about the weight of human hair . 
EDL	00:07:57,930	00:08:06,050	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So those ones vanished , but the material himself doesn't know physically completely vanish . 
EDL	00:08:06,050	00:08:08,670	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We did develop a material that does that . 
EDL	00:08:08,670	00:08:13,346	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	There was worked on there at the university of annoying and george attack and cornell . 
EDL	00:08:13,346	00:08:19,555	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Many of those materials were walking away where they're thermally unstable room temperature . 
EDL	00:08:19,555	00:08:22,660	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	They'd like to be a monument or be a guess . 
EDL	00:08:22,660	00:08:26,649	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So exactly make them at very cold temperatures , say , like minus fifty degrees . 
EDL	00:08:26,649	00:08:29,840	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	See , in this case , these vanishing materials of polymers . 
EDL	00:08:29,840	00:08:35,670	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And we'd like to make a really long polymer chain to get home like you are right , makes the parliamentary tough . 
EDL	00:08:35,670	00:08:40,400	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then we link it in a certain way at the very cold temperatures that we raise . 
EDL	00:08:40,400	00:08:46,650	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The open temperature remains stable , then in that material will in bed , something that called it . 
EDL	00:08:46,650	00:09:10,690	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	There are photo generator or a thermal laser generator networks , just like you might expect to those when you figure , when you expose it to a certain wavelengths of light , photos of generator criticism , if you take the thermal laser generator and exceed a certain temperature , it also creates an asset that asset can break one of the bonds between the polymer change . 
EDL	00:09:11,220	00:09:19,590	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And at that point , then it becomes storming unstable room temperature again , and the rest of it just vanishes and by vanishes . 
EDL	00:09:19,590	00:09:23,540	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It take turns from a solid directly into a gas . 
EDL	00:09:23,990	00:09:26,560	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Mental illness vanishes right before your eyes . 
EDL	00:09:26,560	00:09:31,255	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The first time you see , it is truly amazed , and actually , the second time you see it actually raised. 
EDL	00:09:31,255	00:09:38,494	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	They're gonna , always be aware , and it really is amazing chemistry to bring into the capability of vanishing materials . 
EDL	00:09:38,494	00:09:43,330	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And this , the program was successful enough in your eyes that you created the following program , right? 
EDL	00:09:43,330	00:09:43,980	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's correct . 
EDL	00:09:43,980	00:09:50,060	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So we were brainstorming , what else beyond micro electronics , could we do with these materials ? 
EDL	00:09:50,470	00:10:02,555	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We were thinking , where else could we push this materials would lead the new fundamental discovery and developments , and could be also at the same , sometimes useful , the permanent defence . 
EDL	00:10:02,555	00:10:14,690	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And we came up with the idea of vanishing air delivery vehicles for being able to deliver things in a very precise way into difficult , rich locations and not having a leave behind . 
EDL	00:10:14,690	00:10:22,240	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That could either destroy the environment or or lead to detection of the delivery . 
EDL	00:10:22,240	00:10:34,580	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And so the exercise program was born , and that program is currently in facebook and is developing vanishing air delivery platforms in the two phase. 
EDL	00:10:34,910	00:10:48,500	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Right , and I know one of the exciting potential applications for these kinds of vehicles would be in sort of public health disease outbreaks tells a little bit about those kinds of humanitarian applications of. 
EDL	00:10:48,500	00:10:52,452	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Absolutely , so one of the first things we started brainstorming out . 
EDL	00:10:52,452	00:11:09,560	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	The idea met hepburn , whose program manager started interacting with me , introducing the idea of being able to deliver medical supplies using the technology and how exciting that would be thinking about things where there's many humanitarian disaster and the wrong ways are destroyed . 
EDL	00:11:09,560	00:11:10,910	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Roads are impossible . 
EDL	00:11:10,910	00:11:31,820	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How can I get really critical supplies , vaccines , blood medications , water to locations that needed or needs to be precisely delivered and do that in kind of , in some cases of massive response without having to worry about going and collecting all of these air delivery vehicles . 
EDL	00:11:31,820	00:11:43,740	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How do I get not only the thing to biodegrade and disappear back into the environment , but how do I make the cost low enough that you can basically have a glider that you don't care if you ever go achieve. 
EDL	00:11:43,740	00:11:55,160	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	This is an exciting time in the lifecycle of the program , writes , because I know that in the coming months , you can move outside of the glimmer and the eye and fundamental europe , but toward vehicle. 
EDL	00:11:55,160	00:11:55,850	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's correct . 
EDL	00:11:55,850	00:12:14,820	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So if two things that are going to be coming up , that will conclude face of the program , a one is a flight test launching from thirty five thousand feet , showing a range of one hundred and fifty kilometers , and landing with ten meters of accuracy and doing that with a material search of it . 
EDL	00:12:14,820	00:12:27,064	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So the glider is made out of material that has as exact as possible , the same material properties as the vanishing material and the same manufacturing processes were trying to test out . 
EDL	00:12:27,064	00:12:46,540	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Can we actually meet these flight profiles using something within the constraints of the material properties and manufacturing of vanishing material , at the same time , we are also building a non flying demonstration of the vanishing material . 
EDL	00:12:46,540	00:13:00,650	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	For example , we might build nonsense of four the plane , just the wing of an airplane , but build that out of the vanishing material and show that we can extract significantly complex structure from the vanishing with terrorists . 
EDL	00:13:01,070	00:13:07,370	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then one year after those flight test , we will do a flight test of the actual vanishing. 
EDL	00:13:07,370	00:13:09,420	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Air delivery vehicle , no right . 
EDL	00:13:09,420	00:13:17,740	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Well , I will be excited to a keep track of that and will applaud with you when we see a first vehicle european disappear . 
EDL	00:13:17,740	00:13:20,260	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I wanna move to another program . 
EDL	00:13:20,260	00:13:27,850	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	This one goes by the name zero , which kind of connection with the ever ever more sensor late in world . 
EDL	00:13:27,850	00:13:29,810	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And so it tells a little bit better. 
EDL	00:13:30,130	00:13:40,390	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes , so in the error is a problem designed to basically take the internet of things and move it right to the tactical launch . 
EDL	00:13:40,390	00:13:45,960	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So today , when we think about the internet of things , it can't be what we really want to be . 
EDL	00:13:46,280	00:14:02,640	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We can take about a plane to our refrigerator or toaster , maybe our car , but we really limited things that either can be plugged into the wall , or that a human can take and plug into the device , or every couple days to recharge the battery . 
EDL	00:14:02,640	00:14:18,280	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And that's because the energy efficiency of our electronic cooperating off of small , cheap batteries today is not high enough to sit there and monitor the environment all the time and report back things that it says . 
EDL	00:14:18,280	00:14:22,210	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So what we're trying to do in zero is taken of a new paradise . 
EDL	00:14:22,210	00:14:28,890	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Well , we actually look at a very low power levels of nearly our power to me means less than ten . 
EDL	00:14:28,890	00:14:33,910	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And what and I choose that value , because that's the leakage of a small coins of battery . 
EDL	00:14:33,910	00:14:45,140	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	What we wanted to be able to set their continuously monitored environment , looking for an event that we are specifically tuned to . 
EDL	00:14:45,140	00:14:54,150	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That doesn't happen very often , but can't be missed , and then be able to wake up this higher power consuming electronics when we see that event . 
EDL	00:14:54,150	00:14:57,260	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So you can imagine what kind of events could those be . 
EDL	00:14:58,120	00:15:28,012	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Those could be like , maintain bridges and infrastructure with these types of sensors looking for a specific failure mode , earthquakes , you could imagine putting these throughout the environment , more thinking about augmenting vehicles to look for and find engine failures earlier , you could imagine dispersing the environment and detecting things like false fires or chemical leagues or other things of that nature . 
EDL	00:15:28,012	00:15:38,650	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We will hold class of these types of sensors looking for acoustic vibrational , inferior chemical , and and all of all being developed . 
EDL	00:15:38,650	00:15:46,520	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	All that can sense these very specific profiles , reject background influences and consume less than ten and a watch . 
EDL	00:15:46,520	00:15:52,870	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So they basically said they are always active , always listening , but consume , basically stand by type power. 
EDL	00:15:52,870	00:15:53,963	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Consumption right ? 
EDL	00:15:53,963	00:16:00,900	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I have fascinated , think about some of the world becoming the innovated with all kinds of sensors , almost aware of our bodies . 
EDL	00:16:00,900	00:16:03,300	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Are , I want to move on now too . 
EDL	00:16:03,300	00:16:12,222	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Just one more programmers goes by the name of neighborhood , am EVA and one form of that is mechanically based . 
EDL	00:16:12,222	00:16:22,680	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And tana , and I particularly interested in this , because I think it revealed , sort of the way you apply your engineers , mine to this invisible world . 
EDL	00:16:22,680	00:16:28,683	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A variety of frequency signals that that all around us talk to us a little bit about a member . 
EDL	00:16:28,683	00:16:29,127	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Okay , sure . 
EDL	00:16:29,127	00:16:29,350	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	so. 
EDL	00:16:29,730	00:16:38,660	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	A member kind of comes from my love of looking at problems and thinking about the ways we solve them today and how those are insufficient . 
EDL	00:16:38,660	00:16:45,870	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And if we could just do it this other way , it would be so much better , but we have some technology , the standing in our way of doing that . 
EDL	00:16:45,870	00:17:00,030	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So when the people were trying to do is people communicate from really difficult environments , say , like underground or underwater , or over very long distances without some type of repeater network and. 
EDL	00:17:00,030	00:17:02,850	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I should point out right through ground and throw water . 
EDL	00:17:03,190	00:17:06,600	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Radio signals do not travel very well through those media. 
EDL	00:17:06,600	00:17:18,540	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I would say , high frequency radio signals don't travel very well through those media , and the key then is to operate low frequencies , and that presents a very significant challenge . 
EDL	00:17:18,540	00:17:36,590	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Is that the wave linked at low frequencies is extremely long , in effect , that is the reason that they propagate water and ground is because the wavelength is very long , and that allows the signal because of the physics to be able to propagate through those media over much larger dimensions . 
EDL	00:17:36,590	00:17:48,380	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So the way we build in tennis today , we basically push current through wires , either kind of straight wires to build things like a lecture type of antennas or through coils and other things . 
EDL	00:17:48,380	00:17:57,962	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And it's very , very difficult to produce a significant amount of an arcade magnetic field when the antenna is very electrically small . 
EDL	00:17:57,962	00:18:06,124	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That means small with respect to the wavelengths , using those techniques of techniques are fabulous at higher frequencies . 
EDL	00:18:06,124	00:18:17,050	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But when you get a very low frequency where you want to be main portable , it just seems nearly impossible to make an internal with any type of efficiency at. 
EDL	00:18:17,050	00:18:24,340	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Those scientists believe that the military does have some antenna systems that can operate in these low frequencies , but there. 
EDL	00:18:24,340	00:18:34,990	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In nervous , yes , they're either the size of whole islands or counties , or sometimes they travel states to communicate these banks . 
EDL	00:18:34,990	00:18:39,120	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In other cases , you might real , a very long wire . 
EDL	00:18:39,120	00:18:44,030	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That's a column or and link out of an airplane to communicate these frequencies . 
EDL	00:18:44,030	00:18:48,010	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	In any case , the dimensions are very , very large. 
EDL	00:18:48,010	00:18:57,810	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So it's going to take a lot of interesting physics to go from something of that size to amazon portable technology that will generate the same. 
EDL	00:18:57,810	00:19:11,730	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Long wavelengths that's correct until our insight was that when we pushing those currents to those wires , what were doing is were creating electric and magnetic fields and were spending energy men . 
EDL	00:19:11,730	00:19:40,630	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And of course , we do that specific rate to determine the frequency , and what we did was , we looked in said , well , what if we just started with something that actually had a high amount of store magnetic field , for example , like a permanent , and instead of then using our power to create that magnetic field , we would take advantage of what nature has given us , which is this permanent magnet , of course , we've created and and machine that , but is a natural material phenomenon . 
EDL	00:19:40,630	00:19:44,710	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And instead , we created the art of frequency by moving it . 
EDL	00:19:44,710	00:19:52,610	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And then we also had the insight that moving things mechanically becomes very efficient , the lower in frequency you go . 
EDL	00:19:52,610	00:20:12,087	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So while mechanical based and tanner may be completely inappropriate where your iphone operates at giga hurts frequencies , it's in fact , very appropriate at a killer hurt type frequency to take a magnet and spin it , or mechanically move it to create an authority magnetic field . 
EDL	00:20:12,087	00:20:14,040	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Of course , magazine , only . 
EDL	00:20:14,040	00:20:27,130	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We're looking at the other types of materials that store these types of permanent fields , electric store , electric types , and there are other types of materials that are will be looking at the problem . 
EDL	00:20:27,760	00:20:39,950	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Another insight that we had was that if we should just took one really big thing and tried to move it , that the amount of store mechanical energy there will be very high , and that also would lead to a lot of efficiencies . 
EDL	00:20:40,270	00:20:59,260	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So one of the really key ideas , the middle program is , can we break that large thing up into a number of small , synchronized things that lower the total store energy and lower the power consumption and the risk that we're trying to mitigate is how small pieces can we break it into ? 
EDL	00:20:59,260	00:21:08,444	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But for the interactions between the pieces , particularly the magnetic and electric interactions between them started dominate the overall system performance . 
EDL	00:21:08,444	00:21:10,939	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You can imagine two magnetizer costs together . 
EDL	00:21:10,939	00:21:14,040	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I have a lot of force between them , they and around us one . 
EDL	00:21:14,040	00:21:21,340	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So trying to manage your controllers in the reaction is the big , risky part of the program that we're trying to overcome here at all. 
EDL	00:21:21,750	00:21:31,030	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Okay , and if you get your topic , and you imagine this program being successful , you want to be gives a sense of what additional communications capabilities would offer. 
EDL	00:21:31,030	00:21:33,620	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes , so this is a low frequency transmitters . 
EDL	00:21:33,620	00:21:36,410	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You are thinking about things like voice and test . 
EDL	00:21:36,410	00:21:58,670	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So at these types of frequencies is not really possible to do things like video forwards and employees , but will give you a new capability , say , from underground , if you are minor to be able to text or do voice to somebody above grounds , or if there were something like a mining accident , you could tell somebody where you were at , and you would have that type of communications . 
EDL	00:21:58,670	00:22:13,330	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Similarly , under water , maybe sixty two , one hundred meters under water , one could communicate text from underwater to the surface or to something even flying overhead , which today is , it is just not really possible. 
EDL	00:22:14,290	00:22:26,920	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And there is one other application that is quite interesting to me in that the way these low frequencies can travel through the atmosphere in unusual ways that it potentially could enable very long distance communication between. 
EDL	00:22:26,920	00:22:28,498	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Two points , that's correct . 
EDL	00:22:28,498	00:22:32,782	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Oh , um , at a slightly higher frequency , save around ten kilograms . 
EDL	00:22:32,782	00:22:37,969	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	There's a wave guide that formed between the ionosphere and the surface of the earth . 
EDL	00:22:37,969	00:22:41,750	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We often that wave guide to bounce signals off . 
EDL	00:22:41,750	00:22:44,670	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And what's called the high frequency event . 
EDL	00:22:44,670	00:22:55,910	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So things like ham radios work based on that physics , but you have to know the location of the receiver to know how to bounced down to the receiver . 
EDL	00:22:55,910	00:23:03,918	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So if you don't know that you much rather feel that wave guide the arrival , and that's what happens as a technique hurt . 
EDL	00:23:03,918	00:23:21,206	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So we're trying to build something that can do that wave , guide and want you couple that we've got the propagation physics or the loss of the RFStravels over distance is very favorable compared to things that don't propagate in the wave guide . 
EDL	00:23:21,206	00:23:37,550	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And so that's what would enable you to reach these really long range communications , thinking things again , like voice and text over hundreds of kilometers from something that you can really hold in the palm of your hand , just not possible today , using other technologies. 
EDL	00:23:37,960	00:23:46,120	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We've talked about four different programs , and when I think about all the different technical components of them is rather amazing . 
EDL	00:23:46,120	00:23:51,540	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So this makes me in a realize that your engineers mind really covers a lot of territory . 
EDL	00:23:51,540	00:24:05,863	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I think we once had a discussion where you telling me that in some ways , you think the attack of the engineer is quite a great one that there is really kind of connection between the kind of problem solving engineers do , and the creativity that we might even see in the orders . 
EDL	00:24:05,863	00:24:13,290	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I'm just wondering if you got some thoughts about that and how you might comparing contrast those kinds of ways of exercising our minds. 
EDL	00:24:13,290	00:24:22,100	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Yes , so it takes me an idea that I borrowed from my thesis adviser can wise you at the university of michigan on their north campus . 
EDL	00:24:22,100	00:24:32,970	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	They have centrally located our music engineering , and I think , believe architecture and his point was all they basically stuck all of the creative fields together . 
EDL	00:24:32,970	00:24:45,410	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	This is uh some people might not think that music and engineering would go together , but I think that was his insight that becoming an engineer and being an engineer requires quite a bit creativity . 
EDL	00:24:45,410	00:24:53,600	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I think , particularly if you want to make anything more than an incremental improvement to the way things are done today . 
EDL	00:24:53,600	00:25:16,020	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	It really requires the type of creativity to look at the way that they are done , understand patients of that and then come up with some completely new approach that would allow you to get beyond those limitations and make you the ten x hundred x jumps and performance that we are seeking , particularly here adopted . 
EDL	00:25:16,020	00:25:25,876	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So creativity is a huge part of being able to found new programs , particularly in areas that are not obvious that are leading in life from one program to another . 
EDL	00:25:25,876	00:25:32,927	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	How do I get off the certain trajectories and get myself on a different trajectory , which is the one I want to be on . 
EDL	00:25:32,927	00:25:36,660	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And I think it's really the creativity that allows you to make that. 
EDL	00:25:36,660	00:25:47,893	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	That kind of jump before we close tribe , I just wondering if there is a science fiction technologies , technology that you might have learned about when your kid , you might have read a great science fiction book . 
EDL	00:25:47,893	00:25:54,270	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You saw something in the movie up with a society yourself that does not exist now , but that you really think well. 
EDL	00:25:55,170	00:26:00,050	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Absolutely , I think both come from back the future . 
EDL	00:26:00,050	00:26:09,630	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So I am actually optimistic that one day I might get a whole car , and I would love to be able to do time travel . 
EDL	00:26:09,630	00:26:13,160	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So I am not so optimistic about that , what , but. 
EDL	00:26:13,160	00:26:13,820	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	You never know . 
EDL	00:26:13,820	00:26:18,020	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Well , so , and if you could do time travel , would you be more interested in going back? 
EDL	00:26:18,020	00:26:21,776	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We're forward , I would definitely be more interested in going forward in time . 
EDL	00:26:21,776	00:26:22,460	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I was say what. 
EDL	00:26:22,460	00:26:26,466	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	But I knew you are going to say that this has been absolutely amazing . 
EDL	00:26:26,466	00:26:34,757	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We've gone from vanishing materials and managing vehicles to censors that use of almost , but I were paying attention to the environment . 
EDL	00:26:34,757	00:26:36,705	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	We've talked about harvard vehicle . 
EDL	00:26:36,705	00:26:40,796	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	So this is just been an amazing conversation for me , and I want to thank you . 
EDL	00:26:40,796	00:26:42,660	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Try for spending the time with me. 
EDL	00:26:42,660	00:26:43,910	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	Thanks , i've been , I really enjoyed. 
EDL	00:26:44,650	00:26:48,130	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	And thank you listeners for sharing this time with us . 
EDL	00:26:48,510	00:26:52,790	| VfD E11 The Thin-Air Specialist |	I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dirt .
