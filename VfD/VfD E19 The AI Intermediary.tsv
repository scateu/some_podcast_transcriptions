EDL	00:00:11,570	00:00:21,790	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Stuff technology , the internet , GPS in the column of your hand are tonight with technology is a driver of our times . 
EDL	00:00:22,150	00:00:30,350	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defense advanced research projects has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:30,800	00:00:39,470	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:39,470	00:00:45,413	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	My name is iphone a motto , and on your dark bowl host until I am pleased to have with me in the studio . 
EDL	00:00:45,413	00:01:20,589	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Miss your david gunning , who has been admitted his third tour of duty as a program manager , durban , in this case , with the information innovation office during his previous tour in the early years of the new millennium , david managed the personalized system that learns program paul that lent to the now familiar voice of syria during his first tour and nineteen nineties , he managed to variety of AIprojects artificial intelligence , including the command post of the future , which was later adopted by the USarmy as the command control system for using a regular afghanistan between his institute . 
EDL	00:01:20,589	00:01:28,230	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But mister gonna play the variety professional roles , among them , program director for data and lyrics and contextual intelligence at the pale . 
EDL	00:01:28,230	00:01:44,720	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Although research center park , a number of funding and managerial roles for test , and as a senior scientist in the air force research lab at white petterson air force base , the synthetic threat threatens career , have been artificial intelligence and human computers in bias . 
EDL	00:01:44,720	00:01:47,164	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It's a threat that goes back to his education . 
EDL	00:01:47,164	00:01:56,690	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They would hold a pair of master's degrees , one in computer size from stanford university and another and experimental psychology from the university of david gonna . 
EDL	00:01:56,690	00:01:58,230	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Thanks for joining me in the studio today . 
EDL	00:01:58,230	00:01:59,580	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes , glad to do so . 
EDL	00:02:00,000	00:02:01,031	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You're a double . 
EDL	00:02:01,031	00:02:05,157	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You work at the intersection of different mine sets , skill sets and tall sets . 
EDL	00:02:05,157	00:02:12,530	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	In your case , intersection seems to focus on humankind , computer kind in the ways these two creatures can work together . 
EDL	00:02:12,840	00:02:16,540	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Where do those interests come from and go back as foreign , we need to learn. 
EDL	00:02:16,540	00:02:23,740	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Well , I can go back to the original event that started up up , spotted in nineteen fifty eight . 
EDL	00:02:24,380	00:02:29,900	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I was eight years old living at my grandfather's house out in the country . 
EDL	00:02:30,480	00:02:40,880	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And I can remember him taking me out on the yard night to see the light of the spotlight gets its flying overhead in a kind of conveying what I shocked this world . 
EDL	00:02:40,880	00:02:58,060	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But where were you to complete the setting and coming down and talk outside governing kentucky , and so that at the time , also , not only sparked dark , but sparked a huge interest in technology , she might as a huge interest in encouraging young minds to be interested in engineering and science . 
EDL	00:02:58,060	00:03:00,300	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So I can remember that is kind of the sport dark . 
EDL	00:03:00,690	00:03:02,310	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It started later on . 
EDL	00:03:02,310	00:03:12,990	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I was an album college in ohio and late sixties , early seventies , you know , during this kind of rapid change , and a lot of cultural change going on . 
EDL	00:03:12,990	00:03:15,389	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I became very interested in psychology . 
EDL	00:03:15,389	00:03:18,007	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So there was my first technical entries . 
EDL	00:03:18,007	00:03:23,680	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Just , how do people work , right , people , clearly , the issue in most of the problems we have the day . 
EDL	00:03:23,680	00:03:24,680	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	How does that mind work ? 
EDL	00:03:24,680	00:03:26,281	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And what could we do about ? 
EDL	00:03:26,281	00:03:40,580	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It was was the starting point , and that I did that would get master's degree in psychology , started to work at the right patterns and air force base as a human factors engineer , which was one of the practical uses of that psychology degree . 
EDL	00:03:40,580	00:03:52,855	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I am , and then very quickly , the first jobs I had worked to look at the human factors of how they were introducing electronic displays into the cockpit . 
EDL	00:03:52,855	00:04:07,249	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	This , in nineteen ninety seven days , can one of the first workplaces to be automated if you want pilots were good in the most advanced technology , they are putting electronic displays in the place of instruments . 
EDL	00:04:07,249	00:04:27,550	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Pilots were making submitted microsecond decision , life or decisions you want to make sure they get just the right information and just the right way , you know , to make those decisions , and so that trigger might interest in computer science because quickly became parents that all the important aspects job were in computer software . 
EDL	00:04:27,550	00:04:50,110	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that prompted my interest in computer science , then went back to school to stand for to get my masters degree in computer science , and especially in AI, that was one of the aisles , summers , if you will , there is a hole in the nineteen eighties , a lot of interest in expert systems in one of the first waves of a and so that captured my interests . 
EDL	00:04:50,110	00:04:54,150	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And certainly was a lined with my background in cognitive psychology. 
EDL	00:04:54,650	00:05:10,229	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	David , as I noted in my introduction , you know , in your third tour as a program management dirt butt , and just the latter will talk about the programs you inherited in this latest tour , communicating with computers and the program that you initiated explaining AI. 
EDL	00:05:10,229	00:05:17,334	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But before we get to that , i'd like for you to take us on a brief of your prior two times as a program management . 
EDL	00:05:17,334	00:05:22,558	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So let's start with how you and double met for the very first time as APM. 
EDL	00:05:22,558	00:05:27,545	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Iguess this was the ninety ninety four in the information systems of us . 
EDL	00:05:27,545	00:05:28,050	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	What is? 
EDL	00:05:28,050	00:05:41,930	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	As they started off as a psychologist and switched the computer science in both those roles , I was a research idea for his research lives , right , patterson , so doing a lot of work at the time on the afternoon too . 
EDL	00:05:41,930	00:05:44,800	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	That was the latest fighter aircraft of the day . 
EDL	00:05:45,260	00:05:56,448	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Now , those computer displays that , you know , and nineteen seventies were very advanced , and particularly then I was working on a integrated information mainland system . 
EDL	00:05:56,448	00:06:05,715	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So now it was possible for the maintenance technician woke up to a computer , woke up to the aircraft with a portable computer plugged in . 
EDL	00:06:05,715	00:06:09,373	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Download information about what files had occurred . 
EDL	00:06:09,373	00:06:17,800	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Did all of his tech manual instructions present on the computer , great kind of integrated in a workplace for the maintenance technician. 
EDL	00:06:17,800	00:06:27,530	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Do you help him do it , just a question about that , because , you know , you know , when you go into a any garage tent of your own car looked at regard , there is a system very much like that . 
EDL	00:06:27,530	00:06:28,630	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yeah , it is . 
EDL	00:06:28,630	00:06:29,840	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But this proceeded. 
EDL	00:06:29,840	00:06:39,980	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Proceeded that it was actually the very first prototype of electronic maintenance instructions anywhere the service did that the that time on my program . 
EDL	00:06:39,980	00:06:46,460	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so I was doing at work that gets the attention of the general who was running the afternoon two program . 
EDL	00:06:46,460	00:06:48,610	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	He pulled me into the afternoon , too . 
EDL	00:06:48,610	00:06:53,343	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The kind of managing coordinate model model of his digital technology . 
EDL	00:06:53,343	00:06:56,882	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And what I was there , some people from doctor came to visit . 
EDL	00:06:56,882	00:07:03,410	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They tried to convince the skeptical of the day he should listen to double and adopt some of their new technology . 
EDL	00:07:04,050	00:07:07,980	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So he expressed how skeptical he wasn't photographic way . 
EDL	00:07:07,980	00:07:29,682	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Instead , if you're not doing something , going to have twenty two , you need to convince dave going on his , my computers that was with the steve cross , who was deputed record of one of the officers geo video hold , who was a program manager here on long from stanford university , who is doing a project and intelligent integration of the world heat systems using AI. 
EDL	00:07:29,682	00:07:42,030	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so I began to interact with those guys in when jail left , died after his tour was done , then invited me to come to the door , but to be APMand nineteen ninety four , I just , I finally had. 
EDL	00:07:42,030	00:07:44,187	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	这个是我们这边的一个产品。
EDL	00:07:44,187	00:07:54,790	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	然后第二部分就是说呃有些客户可能需要去做什么东西，或者其他方面还有没有什么问题的话，可以bringing a new technology ，which does not have as much of a track record . 
EDL	00:07:54,790	00:07:58,440	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But then you were there , as someone really a champion of the. 
EDL	00:07:58,440	00:08:00,000	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes , can I be in the new year ? 
EDL	00:08:00,000	00:08:04,087	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Very conservative environment is not that their technology adverse . 
EDL	00:08:04,087	00:08:05,807	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	These people are very serious . 
EDL	00:08:05,807	00:08:12,834	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Engineers are building the aircraft with the normal life and deaths , and , you know , consequences that we started incorrectly . 
EDL	00:08:12,834	00:08:23,536	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So they don't want to put anything in that airplane right unless they really know that they can depend on it , but they may really solid understanding in background where those people are coming from . 
EDL	00:08:23,536	00:08:28,120	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	When you're try to introduce new technology , you know what you need to do to convince them. 
EDL	00:08:28,120	00:08:33,429	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	One thing that I noticed regarding your this first tour , beauty is , and naturally , did you come here ? 
EDL	00:08:33,429	00:08:34,859	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But you went full mind and body . 
EDL	00:08:34,859	00:08:37,510	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And if i'm reading your background correctly . 
EDL	00:08:37,510	00:08:43,170	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Overseas , nine programs released in your period of six years , and at first tour. 
EDL	00:08:43,170	00:08:45,400	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	There were nine programs , and you win , yeah , that's right . 
EDL	00:08:45,400	00:08:52,740	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I was starting , wanted to new programs a year and heard at a few , you know , for mother PMS, but I was all in . 
EDL	00:08:53,090	00:08:58,240	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I was like younger than had a lot more energy , and but just love the job you mention . 
EDL	00:08:58,240	00:09:02,930	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I've been here three times , just to me , is one of the most fascinating job you can have . 
EDL	00:09:02,930	00:09:06,340	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You are the panic goal of new technology development . 
EDL	00:09:06,750	00:09:16,120	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You have such a broad view was going on , and dark gives you this incredible freedom to pursue what you see is advantage on where they should go. 
EDL	00:09:16,120	00:09:24,040	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Now , one of the standards from that first tour is not a command post of the future , and that one actually did get out into the field . 
EDL	00:09:24,040	00:09:31,500	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So just briefly , could tell us a little bit about what gold of that program wasn't , in fact , how I was so it unfolded in the field. 
EDL	00:09:31,500	00:09:36,384	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Of course , my interests spent AIall along in most of those nine programs . 
EDL	00:09:36,384	00:09:44,520	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I ran my first tour had to do with knowledge in reasoning , planning , trying to provide intelligent decision ages to people . 
EDL	00:09:44,520	00:10:00,340	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we created command posts of the future , you know , as a way to save weekend , explore all sorts of vi technologies , see what work packaged that up into a system that army commanders could use out in the future film . 
EDL	00:10:00,340	00:10:06,500	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we started that with a wide variety of technologies of varying degrees of maturity and risk . 
EDL	00:10:06,500	00:10:08,980	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And by time we get to the end of the program . 
EDL	00:10:09,540	00:10:20,655	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And I had left up by then it was other people were taken it over , but the technology that survive was something that was my call adapted for intelligent visualization . 
EDL	00:10:20,655	00:10:37,895	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	A lot of the , the more higher risk I techniques that actually kind of following out this two imagery , right , but they had through a lot of virtue with some visionary people from the army , marine , corn , air force and really kind of picked out the knowledge of the new technology . 
EDL	00:10:37,895	00:10:48,100	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And they were incredibly valuable , and basically , was that if a commander in his staff could each have their own view , the battlefield in their command post the future screen . 
EDL	00:10:48,560	00:10:55,910	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So the operators saw the plans for the attack , the logistics guide , and saw , what did he have to do to support that plan , right ? 
EDL	00:10:55,910	00:11:01,090	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The entire guy just got to see what the information was coming in on what the I mean , we do next . 
EDL	00:11:01,090	00:11:07,760	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And one of the commanders are army , general korea , who is the one who championed it and took it to back then . 
EDL	00:11:08,410	00:11:17,890	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Ashley said that by watching his staff campaign pushed the future screens , he had a better idea of what they were thinking . 
EDL	00:11:18,190	00:11:27,000	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Then he did , if they were all in the same room , so it enabled them to one be distributed , which is very important for the battlefield . 
EDL	00:11:27,000	00:11:33,390	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The two gave him better insight into what his staff was and wear the battle , the battle. 
EDL	00:11:33,390	00:11:43,890	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Was emerging so fascinating this , that is the case where the human machine interaction into something more than the components. 
EDL	00:11:43,890	00:11:55,050	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes , and partly critical part of that programs where we set it up was the health is consistent interaction between the technologies and the visionary use . 
EDL	00:11:55,050	00:12:03,720	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Right , which is it now called edgy development as a lot of names , is pretty much been adopted by silicon valley as religion . 
EDL	00:12:04,050	00:12:12,880	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But that strategy was pretty early in those , and they had a lot of exercises where they take researchers from the university . 
EDL	00:12:13,280	00:12:34,470	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Send them down the ford pork in the army , initially put on the army gear and run up director sizes , so they get a real sense of what the problem was , but they also had exercises where the visionary military guys would work closely with the technologies to try to sort out what was the most valuable thing the technology could do for user in the field . 
EDL	00:12:34,470	00:12:40,970	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And not just let the technologies kind of hypothesize what that might be with somewhat idea of. 
EDL	00:12:40,970	00:12:41,770	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But watching it in . 
EDL	00:12:42,120	00:12:51,180	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So in two thousand , you leave the article and do other things , and in two thousand reasons , you come back , and this time , you need information processing technology . 
EDL	00:12:51,180	00:13:00,060	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Office tells a little bit about the programmes that you , well , they are , including one that I think many listeners will have purple. 
EDL	00:13:00,060	00:13:22,060	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Working back , as they say , a tony teller , just comment is the new director around black men as the office cheese of this newly formed officer , though , and ipad was also the name of one of the original dark officers are LED by a legislator is really where the personal computer was created with whole idea . 
EDL	00:13:22,060	00:13:23,930	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yeah , those days , a computer met a large . 
EDL	00:13:23,930	00:13:25,280	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I be in range and just. 
EDL	00:13:25,280	00:13:37,608	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	For listeners who don't know so lick lighter is a giant in the history of dark , but he is now usually as JCRAlegislator actually stands for those in joseph , carl robinet lick later . 
EDL	00:13:37,608	00:13:50,432	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And he really brought in an ethic of of this idea that the human machine interaction in the symbolism was going to be a long , long theme of technology from the end of sixties , when he was until now . 
EDL	00:13:50,432	00:13:53,670	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so david , you'll continue in this tradition. 
EDL	00:13:53,670	00:14:12,790	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly , and I did before he came in , did what a computer man was an , I be a main frame to took up eyes of a small room , and people would interact with it by sending punch cards and do a punch card reader and getting an answer back on the other side , there was no concept of this being a personal computer . 
EDL	00:14:12,790	00:14:33,160	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You sit down with , interact with on a daily basis , and was actually under his program as alan kay , who was that the stanford at the time in later , it park sketched out the first diagrams of what we recognized the day is the personal computer in parking pilot to research in the exactly right and the journey . 
EDL	00:14:33,160	00:14:34,060	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So that was it . 
EDL	00:14:34,060	00:14:38,020	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So tony teller and run block men , I really wanted to bring that back . 
EDL	00:14:38,020	00:14:45,790	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They wanted to reenergize the top to go after the next generation of human computer service . 
EDL	00:14:45,790	00:14:50,490	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And the phrase then was cognitive systems , cognitive technology . 
EDL	00:14:50,490	00:14:53,532	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so tony believed in western biggest . 
EDL	00:14:53,532	00:15:09,630	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so we came up with the idea for this program called pile , personalized the system to learn which , even by daughter standards , was a fairly large program , two hundred and fifty million dollars over five years , and it had multiple levels at one level . 
EDL	00:15:09,630	00:15:21,770	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It funded twenty some research , universities and agencies around the country to explore a lot of cutting edge technology in AI, in particular , machine learning . 
EDL	00:15:21,770	00:15:28,003	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Machine learning is now common place today , with this kind of emerging technology and those days . 
EDL	00:15:28,003	00:15:32,460	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we'd funded a huge amount of basic research on machine learning. 
EDL	00:15:32,460	00:15:34,520	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And let me just save you for a second for listening . 
EDL	00:15:34,520	00:15:36,800	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You might not really know what that means . 
EDL	00:15:36,800	00:15:39,810	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We can go into a full seminar about that . 
EDL	00:15:39,810	00:15:41,400	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But what would you find that? 
EDL	00:15:41,400	00:15:46,937	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Well , in the earlier days of AI, we try to develop intelligent systems by having program . 
EDL	00:15:46,937	00:15:54,464	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Rules are statements into a system that we tell it what the knowledge wasn't later than reason with that . 
EDL	00:15:54,464	00:15:59,033	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And the expert systems of expert systems and knowledge bases . 
EDL	00:15:59,033	00:16:04,990	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And the terrible tax today is kind of a current incarnation in that time , just playing programs . 
EDL	00:16:04,990	00:16:17,456	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly , those ended up being very difficult , very difficult to program , very difficult to maintain its very difficult for people that actually , exactly the logic rules that are behind intelligence . 
EDL	00:16:17,456	00:16:40,390	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But over those decades , and especially during this power program , began to realize that if you fed a computer , a lot of data entertained loose with the right machine learning algorithms , which were kind of learning the statistics and probably stick nature of the data and learning a different recognition patterns , the computer could learn its own patterns . 
EDL	00:16:40,390	00:16:49,580	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They were not specified by a person , but those patterns were much more effective than doing a lot of jobs than like understanding , speech , recognizing images . 
EDL	00:16:50,280	00:16:53,480	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You know , a funny credit card fraud . 
EDL	00:16:54,020	00:16:59,650	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so machine learning was much more effective than the older style , explicit logic. 
EDL	00:17:00,000	00:17:09,002	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Basketball , so , in a sense of the computer was doing is taking those , those sort of analyzed signals that that we humans are comfortable with . 
EDL	00:17:09,002	00:17:14,070	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But looking them now in their data versions , right , and that's where they are comfortable. 
EDL	00:17:14,070	00:17:25,646	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes , exactly , until there was a big component of the program , but we also did not work on machine dialogue on , you know how you carry on an intelligent dialogue with a computer . 
EDL	00:17:25,646	00:17:28,816	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The speech , understanding to some extent was already being developed . 
EDL	00:17:28,816	00:17:32,320	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	How would you have a computer that could be an intelligent assistance ? 
EDL	00:17:32,630	00:17:39,870	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They would watch what the user is doing , understand his job , then be able to give him assistance at the right time . 
EDL	00:17:39,870	00:17:56,320	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And one of the metaphors we used as you wanted to create an assistant that was like a surgery right only on the old TVshow match for those viewed enough to remember already always knew what the kernel needed before the kernel need new himself , right . 
EDL	00:17:56,320	00:18:04,140	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we just followed the context of what the user could anticipate and provide intelligent advice . 
EDL	00:18:04,140	00:18:09,230	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So there was the grand vision , and we found it a lot of it very advanced research , and all of those areas . 
EDL	00:18:10,030	00:18:19,680	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And in one of our performers was the israel international and how the middle park , california , they were one of the integrators of the state . 
EDL	00:18:19,680	00:18:30,290	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They looked at all the research was being tried to create a prototype of this power system that would conductor be used as an intelligent assistance on your laptop. 
EDL	00:18:30,290	00:18:36,610	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So that they were looking at many of the component technologies that the other performers were were developing and see. 
EDL	00:18:36,610	00:18:39,870	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We put it together exactly , and I was really their job . 
EDL	00:18:39,870	00:18:47,900	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Was , how do we interpret the best of all these techniques and put that together , and a real prototype of a cut into a system . 
EDL	00:18:47,900	00:18:56,670	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so they , as long as they were doing that , began to develop a kind of streamlined , more efficient version of the architecture . 
EDL	00:18:57,380	00:19:03,060	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And when the pile program , the research version , the book , our program ended around two thousand and eight . 
EDL	00:19:04,360	00:19:27,300	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They had several people who worked on power , and some new performers they brought in from the venture called , and they decided they were going to take this technology adapted for the iphone , which was a brilliant new product at the time , and people didn't know quite what to do as a ride was very wisely said , this is the place for , according to the system . 
EDL	00:19:27,300	00:19:28,690	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	People gonna help this phone . 
EDL	00:19:28,690	00:19:30,270	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They won't have a keyboard . 
EDL	00:19:30,270	00:19:32,990	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They really going to need an assistance that can help them out . 
EDL	00:19:33,720	00:19:35,850	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So they had the adventurer in for two years . 
EDL	00:19:35,850	00:19:39,760	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It was just funded as a new start up , darker than without the picture . 
EDL	00:19:40,070	00:19:43,730	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They get venture money from silicon valley to develop . 
EDL	00:19:44,060	00:19:49,709	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And in two years later , they put their first syrian application on the APP store . 
EDL	00:19:49,709	00:19:51,592	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The APP store was brand new . 
EDL	00:19:51,592	00:19:59,010	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And I think , was three days later , they got a call from steve jobs himself , who said , in first , they are like what sure this is . 
EDL	00:19:59,010	00:20:00,030	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Steve jobs . 
EDL	00:20:00,030	00:20:07,200	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	He just caused by the trend of phones , you know , in the office after they began to believe it really was steve jobs . 
EDL	00:20:07,810	00:20:11,860	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	He asked the three founders , he said , wanted to come over to my house tonight for dinner . 
EDL	00:20:11,860	00:20:18,930	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I've got a vision for what I wanted to do , and it was some negotiation over selling the company . 
EDL	00:20:18,930	00:20:24,720	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Apple boarded , spends several years developing it under the syrian assistant we know today . 
EDL	00:20:25,230	00:20:30,270	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And for the first year of that , steve jobs was personally involved in directing it . 
EDL	00:20:30,270	00:20:34,640	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	He had really seen that as a vision for he wanted to go , but then get. 
EDL	00:20:35,390	00:20:48,255	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	To continue , okay , so before we move on now to your current in your third tour , which is described your result of the architectural technology development cycle at dark , wanted about successful . 
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,941	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They can get in the u and others here in your performance . 
EDL	00:20:51,941	00:20:55,140	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Those works under contract on your programs . 
EDL	00:20:55,140	00:21:06,346	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They brought the technology to a point of proving it and then taking the risk down enough that say , other corporate entities , or where the military services can take a hand off and do the final . 
EDL	00:21:06,346	00:21:09,423	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Developmentally , we actually have the product technology . 
EDL	00:21:09,423	00:21:16,440	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Some of the development goes to that point of a product technology , but it's more to that prototype with a proof of principle . 
EDL	00:21:16,440	00:21:24,040	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Here is the case where all of this worth that you did , let do something that now is part of the technology of the world . 
EDL	00:21:24,510	00:21:27,750	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So the question I have for you is just , what does that feel like ? 
EDL	00:21:27,750	00:21:35,649	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I mean , here you are , you hear right here you all over the place , and you know that you had it a role in the sequences that LED to it . 
EDL	00:21:35,649	00:21:36,840	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So I had that film. 
EDL	00:21:36,840	00:21:44,093	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We've feels great and was quite a surprise in a way , right , as you say , that starbucks job were always doing . 
EDL	00:21:44,093	00:21:50,927	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	His advanced technology were always trying to , you know , and we knew a personal assistant had been . 
EDL	00:21:50,927	00:22:03,308	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	That's been apart of the AI science fiction since two thousand and one and star track , and that's always like what certainty , be able to interact october computer someday . 
EDL	00:22:03,308	00:22:07,930	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But we've never quite work , but we've never heard about that. 
EDL	00:22:07,930	00:22:09,730	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But now we want , we want the party . 
EDL	00:22:09,730	00:22:10,720	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It was all right. 
EDL	00:22:11,210	00:22:23,419	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But the idea of a computer that was intelligent enough to carry on a conversation being assistant had been around for a long time , but never employment it when people tried it , it didn't work well enough . 
EDL	00:22:23,419	00:22:25,754	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It was always a little bit too close to . 
EDL	00:22:25,754	00:22:34,121	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And I think that that power program really brought it to the point the cheap jobs is willing to take a risk and say , yeah , I can make a real product out of this . 
EDL	00:22:34,121	00:22:39,852	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And like you say , left up in two thousand and eight , it's two years later that this comes out and renewed . 
EDL	00:22:39,852	00:22:50,020	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Apple had bought it , but had no idea what they're going to do , and it suddenly its apple's marketing department is advertising the product , my program , and that was very nice . 
EDL	00:22:50,020	00:22:52,520	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	My , my children even thought I was a cool guy . 
EDL	00:22:52,520	00:22:52,810	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I. 
EDL	00:22:53,130	00:22:56,680	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Momentarily , the greatest achievement of all right . 
EDL	00:22:56,680	00:23:00,000	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So let's then move now to your current . 
EDL	00:23:00,000	00:23:03,075	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You came here in twenty fifteenth , you left until thursday . 
EDL	00:23:03,075	00:23:05,959	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You wanna wait , you do other things in an industry . 
EDL	00:23:05,959	00:23:07,689	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And you came back in twenty fifteen . 
EDL	00:23:07,689	00:23:13,690	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So again , tell me that that approach holders that you were convinced the third time , and it was talking about your two programs. 
EDL	00:23:13,690	00:23:18,646	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Well , one is , I said , and it just being a dark is the best job by weather hand . 
EDL	00:23:18,646	00:23:21,714	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It is interesting to go out in industry . 
EDL	00:23:21,714	00:23:23,250	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It's to be in other places . 
EDL	00:23:23,750	00:23:29,280	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But if you enjoy technology and you really want to make an impact , there's nothing like being a darker . 
EDL	00:23:29,950	00:23:53,260	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So I was in a headband out for a while in a friday jobs in industry , i'm ready to looking for something to do the other factor of those myself who lives in ruslan nearby just had a first grandchild , and so that convinced my wife it was worth moving from seattle , where our baseball , oh , back to DC, Igot a great job . 
EDL	00:23:53,260	00:23:55,990	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	My wife got to play with her grandson all day . 
EDL	00:23:55,990	00:23:56,820	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So that was A. 
EDL	00:23:56,820	00:23:58,716	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	That would be a pure justification , right ? 
EDL	00:23:58,716	00:24:00,617	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	There are no need for anything thing else . 
EDL	00:24:00,617	00:24:04,116	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So let's talk about the two programs , one , one you can hurt it . 
EDL	00:24:04,116	00:24:06,175	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	That's communicating with computers . 
EDL	00:24:06,175	00:24:09,910	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	See that you see , right , just as tell me a little bit about to go. 
EDL	00:24:09,910	00:24:26,960	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Well , innocence is going to do the next generation of earlier alexander and no source of things , or now that technology is there , you know , can understand what you say for the most part , not always , but for the most part , and can provide , you know , assistance . 
EDL	00:24:26,960	00:24:29,630	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Consultant alarm can play a song , right ? 
EDL	00:24:29,630	00:24:32,690	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Keep you find directions instead of yourself . 
EDL	00:24:32,690	00:24:37,750	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We really want to raise the level of intelligence and partnership of the computer . 
EDL	00:24:38,190	00:24:44,550	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So it is really an intelligent partner that , you know , I join partner with the human is really human . 
EDL	00:24:44,550	00:24:51,890	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Computer sympathize , not human as the manager and computer as a low level of system to that score. 
EDL	00:24:51,890	00:24:53,863	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Let's stay here for just one more minute . 
EDL	00:24:53,863	00:25:03,280	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	What's the kind of question that I might be able to ask after a successful seat of UCcommunicating with computer's program that I can't ask , say , siri. 
EDL	00:25:03,280	00:25:12,480	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Let me not use serious , but use one of the examples from the program is the harvard medical school , where they had done some work on a previous dark a program called big mechanism . 
EDL	00:25:12,480	00:25:40,320	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Were they trying to add credit system that could read masses of research and biology and an automatically construct models of cancer pathways instead of at the human biology , was having to read thousands of research articles , the computer would do it themselves in great suggestions of new pathways of how cancer behaves in a sale , so the biologists would have that as a suggestion . 
EDL	00:25:40,320	00:25:46,070	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So now we see that we see part of it is , can we put a collaborative user interface on top of that ? 
EDL	00:25:46,480	00:26:00,480	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So now the biologists can collaborate with a computer to hypothesize how answer works in the sale , the design experiments too , you know , so that the computer is working as a virtual site layout . 
EDL	00:26:00,480	00:26:12,180	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The system , if you wear a greatest tune in a biology layout , who's really helping to digest the literature , pull out the important and suggest experiments that should be . 
EDL	00:26:12,180	00:26:13,330	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I'm getting this knife. 
EDL	00:26:13,330	00:26:24,704	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Think like that , the value added is a farmers scientist in euros , scientists , and we each spend a month in most in , you've read one hundred papers , and I have read one hundred papers , but are found working with the computer . 
EDL	00:26:24,704	00:26:27,380	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The computer might have read ten thousand papers were really exact. 
EDL	00:26:27,380	00:26:38,705	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You know , what has enough intelligence and has the right kind of dialogue machinery so it can carry on a much more intelligent conversation with you about them today . 
EDL	00:26:38,705	00:26:49,530	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It was seriously in a concerned technology might find me , you know , a certain pathway right to find me articles about a certain protein , and a computer could do that , but it is really not gone up . 
EDL	00:26:49,530	00:26:54,220	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Sort of bad information integrated , and I am carry on kind of more given. 
EDL	00:26:54,220	00:27:01,810	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Conversation with the scientists or so now move on to the program that I suspect is taking up most of your time because of the number of mine might discreet you . 
EDL	00:27:01,810	00:27:09,310	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	At least eleven performers on this , and this is called explainable artificial intelligence XAI. 
EDL	00:27:09,310	00:27:11,970	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So talk about in place for the program . 
EDL	00:27:11,970	00:27:17,270	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I guess first and then talk to me about the status and health. 
EDL	00:27:17,730	00:27:31,000	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Well , first I said , I came back in two thousand and fifteen yuan , a talk to the an office director , then caught men about the coming back to darker and insurers lessons . 
EDL	00:27:31,000	00:27:36,320	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Now my program manager comes to dark with the question is , what revision , what project do you want to do ? 
EDL	00:27:36,720	00:27:38,195	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You know that that's kind of job? 
EDL	00:27:38,195	00:27:42,305	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And you better do it fast , because you usually have yourself by date on your badge . 
EDL	00:27:42,305	00:27:43,440	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You hear for a few years. 
EDL	00:27:43,440	00:27:59,700	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so then he actually suggested this idea of explainable AIIhad just been to a workshop on with a group of intelligence from the OD , and it was a group of machine learning and HIvisualization . 
EDL	00:28:00,080	00:28:13,900	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We're trying to convince this group of the great new technology we could provide the help in television analysis and wonderful it is there who was an analysis that one of the deal said , that's not a problem . 
EDL	00:28:13,900	00:28:39,840	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Her problem , she already has big data analytics systems that recommending , suggesting patterns or targets are in a suspect to her , but she has to put her name on the recommendation that goes up the chain , and she gets greeted , if not punished , if that recommendation is wrong , and she wanted these systems to explain the horizontal for making the decisions they make. 
EDL	00:28:39,840	00:28:42,930	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	This was for her , how she was going to trust the machine. 
EDL	00:28:42,930	00:28:45,443	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Right , trust it and trust in a win . 
EDL	00:28:45,443	00:28:46,586	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	When is the machine ? 
EDL	00:28:46,586	00:28:48,414	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Winners is a false alarm . 
EDL	00:28:48,414	00:28:50,471	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Winners is a positive example . 
EDL	00:28:50,471	00:28:56,010	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I and to her , having the explanation was what really needed to make that happen . 
EDL	00:28:56,860	00:29:04,714	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so that resonated is about that time is when the new wave of AI, which is deep learning , is taking off right . 
EDL	00:29:04,714	00:29:11,910	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And you hear about this call and a new revolution in AI, that's all about the egg learning techniques . 
EDL	00:29:11,910	00:29:25,920	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Where are kind of the most advanced of this machine learning technology we talked about earlier , or takes an huge violence of data , these deep learning systems that are very large , narrow match with millions of neurons . 
EDL	00:29:25,920	00:29:39,960	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Well , there are each learning wage that helped build a model of which the correct decision in any situation , electronic versions , of course , yeah , exactly , but they're incredibly opaque and difficult for people to understand . 
EDL	00:29:39,960	00:29:44,210	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Collaborators are not quite sure how these systems were making their decisions . 
EDL	00:29:44,750	00:29:46,390	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They can be incredibly accurate . 
EDL	00:29:46,390	00:29:51,490	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Their federal data and the data fits the world right away . 
EDL	00:29:51,800	00:30:04,347	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They can be very effective in our incredible effective at analysis , faces and objects and images and voice recognition , and , you know , and computer games , but they're not very explainable . 
EDL	00:30:04,347	00:30:08,695	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It's not very easy for user to understand what these systems are doing . 
EDL	00:30:08,695	00:30:10,869	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So for a lot of applications . 
EDL	00:30:10,869	00:30:23,460	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	That's okay if you find in cat videos on facebook , the nation is not critical , right , but if you are an analyst for DOD, that's picking out targets to investigate , are you running in autonomous ? 
EDL	00:30:24,040	00:30:28,160	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And then there were a goal that's going to go off on to a mission on its own . 
EDL	00:30:28,160	00:30:32,900	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You really want to get a good explanation of what the standard is thinking . 
EDL	00:30:32,900	00:30:34,040	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So it's a very hard problem . 
EDL	00:30:34,040	00:30:44,700	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	The sum extend this machine learning technology works so well because it learns models that are inherently more difficult , more complex than what person would specify . 
EDL	00:30:44,700	00:30:50,640	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But yet , you need to get some explanation out of it so that user can get an integration for what the system is doing . 
EDL	00:30:51,170	00:30:52,210	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So that's the problem . 
EDL	00:30:52,210	00:30:53,520	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we lay that out . 
EDL	00:30:53,520	00:30:54,730	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	There is a typical . 
EDL	00:30:54,730	00:31:12,380	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Then a doubt you talk to a lot of researchers , a lot of people in duty about the you craft , your solicitation , and you get in your proposals , and you pick your performers and have you mentioned , i've picked eleven performers or each developing what i'm calling an explainable learning system . 
EDL	00:31:12,740	00:31:14,970	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we still wanted to be a machine learning system . 
EDL	00:31:14,970	00:31:25,920	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We don't want to go back to the old version of technology where you're trying to specify the rules , although we know the older versions , they were more more because a human had described the logic it's using . 
EDL	00:31:26,270	00:31:32,060	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It was much easier to regard to take that logic to another human , and people could understand what is doing . 
EDL	00:31:32,600	00:31:34,420	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But in this case , that's not possible . 
EDL	00:31:34,420	00:31:41,655	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So each one , these eleven teams developing two major components , the dark and applied together into a system . 
EDL	00:31:41,655	00:31:55,698	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	One component is a modified machine learning process , so they're changing the deep process , or they're adding a new learning technique that changing something about the way the system learns its model . 
EDL	00:31:55,698	00:32:23,487	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So this is more interpretation , more explainable in the second , going back to my inner background , and AGI and psychology is to have an explanation interface , which is the best combination of visualization , natural language generation , you know , creates just the right explanation that appropriate for the end users , or who understands what the system is doing , even know that the user is not going to be a machine learning expert . 
EDL	00:32:23,487	00:32:29,850	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we have to take the complexity of this machine learning system system , increase the right kind of explanation . 
EDL	00:32:29,850	00:32:31,950	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So you're average user can understand what. 
EDL	00:32:31,950	00:32:35,570	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Doing so , question about that , and this really comes from the human side . 
EDL	00:32:36,100	00:32:42,290	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So I might do something behaved in a certain way , right , and somebody might say , why did you do that with the explanation for your behavior ? 
EDL	00:32:42,290	00:32:46,980	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes , and I can come up with one after the fact that sounds reasonable to me . 
EDL	00:32:46,980	00:32:51,550	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yes , but I can't really be sure that i'm not fooling myself until just one . 
EDL	00:32:51,550	00:32:53,514	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Maybe i've just made up an explanation . 
EDL	00:32:53,514	00:32:55,243	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So cannot be happening here . 
EDL	00:32:55,243	00:32:59,380	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	It , it again at gold rationalization , rationalization , one of the. 
EDL	00:32:59,380	00:33:01,250	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Make sure you , we , we could . 
EDL	00:33:01,250	00:33:06,610	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Some of the teams are taking a approach , whether going to treat the machine learning systems of black box . 
EDL	00:33:06,610	00:33:09,630	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They don't know what's going on , but they can experiment with that . 
EDL	00:33:09,630	00:33:18,656	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	They can run a million simulation trials with different input and see what the output and and see if they can throw a model of the explains what is doing . 
EDL	00:33:18,656	00:33:23,031	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So the test , though we do to avoid the problem you describe it is the text . 
EDL	00:33:23,031	00:33:27,520	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Is , does your explanation predict what the machine will do in a new situation . 
EDL	00:33:27,520	00:33:39,120	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So if you fool in yourself , the prediction will be wrong , and especially to help the use gaining trust , you know , so the user needs to have a model from the explanation . 
EDL	00:33:39,120	00:34:01,002	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So the user knows when in which situation , should they trust it , and when they , so they need to have some model , which , you know , predictive of what the systems gonna do , so they can create this understanding , and even though that understanding may be very different than what's actually going on inside the machine , it is close enough . 
EDL	00:34:01,002	00:34:10,780	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	This capturing the main features of what the system is doing , so that they can understand and have some faith and understanding what the system will. 
EDL	00:34:10,780	00:34:23,193	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Then another fascinating thing to me about explainable AI , and certainly , as I am learning for me right now , is it also seems to be robbing shoulders with some of the great questions of philosophy . 
EDL	00:34:23,193	00:34:28,734	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Not , it gets into a piece of technology where a big world which we had had , we come to know things as human things . 
EDL	00:34:28,734	00:34:30,350	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And what is an explanation anyway ? 
EDL	00:34:30,350	00:34:35,720	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	What's the nature of explanation makes me think the philosophers would be quite interested in what you do. 
EDL	00:34:35,720	00:34:43,833	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Unfortunately , they are , and our explain that , and we have the eleven teams are actually building the system . 
EDL	00:34:43,833	00:35:07,240	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We have one team that is just a group of cognitive psychologists who were digging into what's known about the explanation , not so much from philosophy , but from psychology psychologist for years , have started what explanation is more affected for personal , what explanation leads to learning better than another explanation , what explanations improve decision making . 
EDL	00:35:07,240	00:35:12,780	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So their job is suggested to rule that literature and help us out with what's an explanation . 
EDL	00:35:12,780	00:35:15,480	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And I mentioned business about philosophers . 
EDL	00:35:15,480	00:35:23,120	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Interesting , unfortunate , because it is so easy to get lost in this very deep conversation about what is called . 
EDL	00:35:23,120	00:35:24,730	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And what's an explanation ? 
EDL	00:35:24,730	00:35:43,920	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And we've had a fair amount of that discussion in the program i'm trying to get around that by using a very practical definition , the test will be , if you create one of these systems , a human user has to use that system to make decisions to manage a non main vehicle or to doing televisions . 
EDL	00:35:44,440	00:35:56,362	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Does the explanation enabled him to appropriately trust the system , does the enabled him to predict when the system will be right , and when it will be wrong , and that's our measure . 
EDL	00:35:56,362	00:36:04,710	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So I want to try to avoid this philosophical swamp and just get to a practical solution on . 
EDL	00:36:04,710	00:36:07,760	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	When does an explanation help user do his job ? 
EDL	00:36:07,760	00:36:10,000	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And when doesn't it so give you me , you want? 
EDL	00:36:10,000	00:36:14,890	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Tools in hand in a relatively short time , I suppose , to a thousand years of discussion. 
EDL	00:36:14,890	00:36:18,860	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Exactly right , a thousand years of discussion with no tools at the end. 
EDL	00:36:20,380	00:36:31,676	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we're getting together , and we don't have that much time , but there are few other things that like to adjust the discussion you want them is in looking at the way our official intelligence is is received by the public . 
EDL	00:36:31,676	00:36:33,973	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	We kind of discussions the public is having . 
EDL	00:36:33,973	00:36:35,740	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	There is certainly some excitement . 
EDL	00:36:35,740	00:36:41,923	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I think the public is leaning toward a positive view on , say , fleets of driverless cars that actually are working out there . 
EDL	00:36:41,923	00:36:55,420	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	There are still some ways around that , but there also without that disturbing insight that the artificial intelligence is another kind of intelligence , and it's scary , and it might be more powerful , and that this is something to really fear and worry about it . 
EDL	00:36:55,420	00:37:00,820	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So you are in the midst of you are one of the , the tool builders , SAIspace . 
EDL	00:37:01,190	00:37:05,850	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And how do you think about that , the in the promise and the potential paris. 
EDL	00:37:05,850	00:37:09,470	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	What's a great question , and one that we mean , we talk about a lot . 
EDL	00:37:10,470	00:37:20,600	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I'm so first day , I like any technology can be used for good or evil , right , others , both sides do it , and we have to be careful right to manage that . 
EDL	00:37:20,600	00:37:23,650	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And I have overall think it's very positive , right . 
EDL	00:37:23,650	00:37:27,680	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	I think it's be much easier for us to avoid that , really make it. 
EDL	00:37:27,680	00:37:33,408	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Backs of this , this is where someone might press you and say , well , but your technologies , right , and yes . 
EDL	00:37:33,408	00:37:39,780	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And so , and you said that in a fairly carefully away , so give me one of two bases for why you , you have an appointment. 
EDL	00:37:39,780	00:37:44,590	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	What is the level of intelligence were really at an aim ? 
EDL	00:37:44,590	00:38:11,600	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So what we have even known that we spent huge advancements , especially in the deep learning technology in the last couple years , were so far away from human intelligence or anything that would be an independent super intelligence that that science fiction to me is like worrying about a media that's gonna hit earth sometime in the next million years , and in life , as we know , right is not imminent , right . 
EDL	00:38:11,600	00:38:17,780	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You're not high probability , you know , which nurses should make sure they get telescopes , you know , around the planet . 
EDL	00:38:17,780	00:38:26,730	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we can see that when it's happening , so we need a small number of people worrying about , let's make sure we don't create a super intelligence that gets out ahead . 
EDL	00:38:27,230	00:38:30,790	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But I think the current technology today is so far from that. 
EDL	00:38:31,380	00:38:32,480	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	That's not a big concern . 
EDL	00:38:32,850	00:38:46,320	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So the disturbing and point is something , as you said , it's not worth worrying about too much now , but on the other side , then to move forward suggests to me that you think the positive employees are really worth resuming. 
EDL	00:38:46,320	00:38:48,705	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	What are just like a driver's cars , right ? 
EDL	00:38:48,705	00:38:51,957	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	There is a lot of issues to be worked out there . 
EDL	00:38:51,957	00:38:56,510	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	But I have no doubt when that comes , we'll be fewer deaths on the highway . 
EDL	00:38:56,510	00:39:12,480	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Then it will be with human drivers , medicine , you know , just huge scientists and applying this medicine , think one of the latest results was one of these deep learning systems can learn to recognize skin cancer events better than human . 
EDL	00:39:13,780	00:39:24,200	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	You know , so just analyzing the vast amounts of data that we have , and you know , being able to understand it or just creating theory and personal systems that can do a better job . 
EDL	00:39:24,760	00:39:27,250	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So many things where AIis going to be. 
EDL	00:39:27,250	00:39:28,180	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Useful , right ? 
EDL	00:39:28,180	00:39:32,290	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	This is making me think of your new grandchild , he or she , she is . 
EDL	00:39:32,290	00:39:43,350	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So he is going to grow up any time when AIis part of of the landscape , part of the technique sleep , he will not know what I am with everything I have that kind of. 
EDL	00:39:43,350	00:39:46,550	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	That tried , I should have a great little video of him at one year old . 
EDL	00:39:47,030	00:40:02,912	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	His first interaction was serious , and he's learned if he presses this button , the iphone talks to him , and he doesn't even have languages we understand , but he would press this button and have a conversation in his own global language , just fascinating . 
EDL	00:40:02,912	00:40:07,200	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So I think we'll be interesting to see how this generation grows. 
EDL	00:40:07,200	00:40:09,420	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Well , we have been going to want to see that video at some point . 
EDL	00:40:09,820	00:40:14,010	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So we are at the time , and I just want to thank you for engaging with . 
EDL	00:40:14,010	00:40:17,609	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And really , what has been an absolutely fascinating start of my morning here . 
EDL	00:40:17,609	00:40:20,522	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Lots of things we need to think about for the rest of the day . 
EDL	00:40:20,522	00:40:22,065	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	So thanks , a lot for priority . 
EDL	00:40:22,065	00:40:22,750	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Yeah , thank you . 
EDL	00:40:22,750	00:40:23,778	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	Certainly enjoyed it . 
EDL	00:40:23,778	00:40:25,440	| VfD E19 The AI Intermediary |	And thanks listeners for sure .
