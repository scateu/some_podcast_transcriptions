EDL	01:02:12,958	01:02:14,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	making some time to talk with me today
EDL	01:02:14,875	01:02:16,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about your ongoing adventure in
EDL	01:02:16,708	01:02:18,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technology development  - thanks Ivan it's
EDL	01:02:18,875	01:02:21,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	great to be here  - I always love to hear
EDL	01:02:21,666	01:02:23,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about the origin story of a person's
EDL	01:02:23,583	01:02:25,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	interests and i think listeners do too
EDL	01:02:25,375	01:02:27,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	especially when uh those interests are
EDL	01:02:27,833	01:02:30,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	hyper-specialized in the eyes of most
EDL	01:02:30,083	01:02:31,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	people i mean i think we agree most
EDL	01:02:31,458	01:02:32,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	people probably never even heard the
EDL	01:02:32,958	01:02:35,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	term opto electronics uh you told me in
EDL	01:02:35,916	01:02:37,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	earlier correspondence that both your
EDL	01:02:37,750	01:02:39,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	father and mother got you going in the
EDL	01:02:39,458	01:02:41,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	science and engineering directions uh
EDL	01:02:41,583	01:02:44,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that you would ultimately take so i'm
EDL	01:02:44,000	01:02:45,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	hoping you might share with us a little
EDL	01:02:45,375	01:02:47,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	bit about what it was like what kind of
EDL	01:02:47,041	01:02:49,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	encouragement you got in your childhood
EDL	01:02:49,125	01:02:51,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	household and then also what other
EDL	01:02:51,500	01:02:54,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	influences you think of when you might
EDL	01:02:54,625	01:02:56,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	explain why you think the way you do
EDL	01:02:56,875	01:02:58,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	think now
EDL	01:02:58,416	01:03:00,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sure well i grew up in canada like you
EDL	01:03:00,416	01:03:02,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	mentioned in in a relatively small town
EDL	01:03:02,333	01:03:05,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	my parents really both loved exposing us
EDL	01:03:05,458	01:03:07,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	as kids to lots of different things so i
EDL	01:03:07,041	01:03:09,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	was busy you know doing sports and music
EDL	01:03:09,833	01:03:12,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	but i really loved academics my mom was
EDL	01:03:12,083	01:03:15,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a teacher and a librarian and a nurse my
EDL	01:03:15,458	01:03:17,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	dad was a university physics professor
EDL	01:03:17,916	01:03:20,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so you know academics was sort of
EDL	01:03:20,250	01:03:22,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	really important in our family as far as
EDL	01:03:22,625	01:03:23,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	science
EDL	01:03:23,916	01:03:25,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	i really loved problem solving when i
EDL	01:03:25,666	01:03:27,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	was a kid and i also liked building
EDL	01:03:27,500	01:03:28,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	things
EDL	01:03:28,708	01:03:31,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	when i was little i used lego blocks and
EDL	01:03:31,125	01:03:33,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	as i got bigger i used meccano which
EDL	01:03:33,375	01:03:36,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	here we call erector set and so you know
EDL	01:03:36,500	01:03:39,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	tiny little uh nuts and bolts and
EDL	01:03:39,458	01:03:41,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	putting things together was sort of my
EDL	01:03:41,500	01:03:43,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	my specialty and really that's sort of
EDL	01:03:43,750	01:03:45,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	what my career looks like i i do a lot
EDL	01:03:45,750	01:03:47,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of problem solving and building tiny
EDL	01:03:47,750	01:03:48,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	little things
EDL	01:03:48,791	01:03:50,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yeah fascinating to think about the
EDL	01:03:50,375	01:03:52,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	erector sets which you know had
EDL	01:03:52,375	01:03:54,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	macroscopic parts and you could actually
EDL	01:03:54,375	01:03:56,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	manipulate them with your hands and and
EDL	01:03:56,541	01:03:57,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	when i think of the
EDL	01:03:57,833	01:03:59,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the devices and the parts that you're
EDL	01:03:59,416	01:04:01,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	working with now on the micrometer and
EDL	01:04:01,833	01:04:03,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	smaller scales it's just kind of
EDL	01:04:03,750	01:04:05,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	astonishing
EDL	01:04:05,375	01:04:07,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	now you spent
EDL	01:04:07,000	01:04:09,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	14 years at
EDL	01:04:09,166	01:04:11,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sandia you know one of our national labs
EDL	01:04:11,958	01:04:13,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and i
EDL	01:04:13,000	01:04:14,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	would guess that
EDL	01:04:14,291	01:04:15,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	while there and maybe even before you
EDL	01:04:15,958	01:04:18,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	had heard about DARPA but uh i also do
EDL	01:04:18,750	01:04:22,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	like to share with listeners the how did
EDL	01:04:22,333	01:04:24,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	this particular program manager get to
EDL	01:04:24,416	01:04:27,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	darpa story and so what's that story for
EDL	01:04:27,541	01:04:29,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you was it somebody you knew at darpa
EDL	01:04:29,458	01:04:32,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	did you in a sense let darpa know about
EDL	01:04:32,041	01:04:33,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you and your interest how did you get
EDL	01:04:33,375	01:04:35,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	here -  yeah you know it's a little bit of
EDL	01:04:35,458	01:04:37,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	all of those back when i was in grad
EDL	01:04:37,333	01:04:39,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	school i actually worked on on darpa
EDL	01:04:39,375	01:04:41,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	programs i guess that was my first
EDL	01:04:41,000	01:04:43,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	introduction but then i got to sandia i
EDL	01:04:43,166	01:04:44,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	worked on a lot of different
EDL	01:04:44,291	01:04:46,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technologies in this
EDL	01:04:46,291	01:04:49,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical microsystem space and i was
EDL	01:04:49,333	01:04:51,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	there for like you said 14 years with my
EDL	01:04:51,250	01:04:52,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wife who also
EDL	01:04:52,666	01:04:54,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	studied applied physics and did a lot of
EDL	01:04:54,583	01:04:57,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	building of small things i got a call
EDL	01:04:57,375	01:05:00,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	from the MTO microsystem technology
EDL	01:05:00,500	01:05:03,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	front office saying that the director
EDL	01:05:03,166	01:05:05,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wanted to to talk to me and i thought
EDL	01:05:05,541	01:05:07,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	well that's interesting he's probably
EDL	01:05:07,708	01:05:09,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	looking for a reference for somebody
EDL	01:05:09,541	01:05:11,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that i work with
EDL	01:05:11,083	01:05:13,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	who's looking to move to darpa
EDL	01:05:13,333	01:05:14,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and
EDL	01:05:14,416	01:05:16,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it turns out no actually they had seen
EDL	01:05:16,291	01:05:17,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	some of the work that i was doing and
EDL	01:05:17,541	01:05:19,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	they wanted to know if i wanted to come
EDL	01:05:19,000	01:05:21,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to darpa which you know i was very
EDL	01:05:21,166	01:05:22,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	familiar with darpa but hadn't really
EDL	01:05:22,916	01:05:24,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	thought about coming to be a program
EDL	01:05:24,583	01:05:26,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	manager but you know given that
EDL	01:05:26,583	01:05:28,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	opportunity i thought about it really
EDL	01:05:28,916	01:05:31,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	hard really quick in fact we had to make
EDL	01:05:31,333	01:05:33,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a decision pretty fast
EDL	01:05:33,166	01:05:35,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and came out and interviewed and and
EDL	01:05:35,250	01:05:37,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	things things moved quick picked up the
EDL	01:05:37,541	01:05:39,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	family and moved out of new mexico and
EDL	01:05:39,708	01:05:41,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	came out to the east coast so i've been
EDL	01:05:41,875	01:05:44,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	at darpa since 2017. so that's a big
EDL	01:05:44,833	01:05:46,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	decision i mean one thing that always
EDL	01:05:46,125	01:05:48,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	amazes me about program managers
EDL	01:05:48,500	01:05:50,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	is that you know you come in knowing
EDL	01:05:50,916	01:05:52,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that this is not
EDL	01:05:52,416	01:05:54,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	almost certainly not a lifelong
EDL	01:05:54,500	01:05:56,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	appointment you know in fact
EDL	01:05:56,416	01:05:58,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know one of the pieces of the secret
EDL	01:05:58,333	01:05:59,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sauce one of the ingredients of the
EDL	01:05:59,458	01:06:01,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	secret sauce of the organization is that
EDL	01:06:01,375	01:06:02,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know you come in knowing that you're
EDL	01:06:02,583	01:06:03,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	just going to be here for three four
EDL	01:06:03,958	01:06:05,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	five years that sort of thing some
EDL	01:06:05,625	01:06:07,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	people do of course come back for second
EDL	01:06:07,000	01:06:09,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	tours of duty later but tell me just a
EDL	01:06:09,625	01:06:10,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	little bit about
EDL	01:06:10,833	01:06:13,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know why you had so much confidence
EDL	01:06:13,166	01:06:15,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and sort of excitement about coming to
EDL	01:06:15,625	01:06:17,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	darpa that you were willing to leave a
EDL	01:06:17,625	01:06:19,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	place you'd been for 14 years and then
EDL	01:06:19,083	01:06:20,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	go to one where you might only be there
EDL	01:06:20,416	01:06:22,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	for a few years
EDL	01:06:22,125	01:06:24,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yeah it's a great question i had no
EDL	01:06:24,041	01:06:27,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	doubt really in my mind darpa was was
EDL	01:06:27,458	01:06:30,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	clearly sort of the pinnacle of doing
EDL	01:06:30,125	01:06:31,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	innovative
EDL	01:06:31,333	01:06:34,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	scientific research and development and
EDL	01:06:34,416	01:06:36,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	leading the community to go do new
EDL	01:06:36,125	01:06:39,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	things that had always been my passion
EDL	01:06:39,375	01:06:42,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and i didn't go into science and
EDL	01:06:42,208	01:06:45,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technology for a a stable long-term
EDL	01:06:45,541	01:06:47,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	job at one place i wanted to make an
EDL	01:06:47,875	01:06:50,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	impact and darpa was clearly the way to
EDL	01:06:50,125	01:06:51,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	do that
EDL	01:06:51,166	01:06:54,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	what comes next we don't really know but
EDL	01:06:54,041	01:06:56,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	i feel like my life has been this series
EDL	01:06:56,125	01:06:58,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of fortunate events that kind of stack
EDL	01:06:58,916	01:07:00,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	up and and i'm sure there'll be great
EDL	01:07:00,750	01:07:03,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	opportunities after i'm done here
EDL	01:07:03,333	01:07:05,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	well may that good fortune continue
EDL	01:07:05,958	01:07:08,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so gordon now let's dive into your
EDL	01:07:08,833	01:07:11,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	portfolio of programs when i look at the
EDL	01:07:11,708	01:07:13,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	half dozen or so of the programs you you
EDL	01:07:13,541	01:07:15,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	have taken on i think one of them has
EDL	01:07:15,458	01:07:17,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	gone to completion that they're
EDL	01:07:17,625	01:07:20,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	thematically connected in several ways
EDL	01:07:20,333	01:07:22,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	one of them has to do with the design
EDL	01:07:22,916	01:07:24,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and integration of micro devices that
EDL	01:07:24,916	01:07:27,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	manipulate and manage electrons and
EDL	01:07:27,541	01:07:29,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photons but also connecting all of the
EDL	01:07:29,958	01:07:31,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technology work that you're doing is is
EDL	01:07:31,875	01:07:33,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a kind of another sort of technology
EDL	01:07:33,958	01:07:36,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	advancement that i've seen at darpa can
EDL	01:07:36,416	01:07:39,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	be even more consequential than say an
EDL	01:07:39,375	01:07:41,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	initial invention and i'm talking here
EDL	01:07:41,333	01:07:44,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about a term that we hear uh and you
EDL	01:07:44,416	01:07:46,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	hear in technology circles called c-swap
EDL	01:07:46,833	01:07:49,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that's c-s-w-a-p
EDL	01:07:49,000	01:07:51,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it refers to uh the challenge of taking
EDL	01:07:51,458	01:07:53,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	or transforming what originally are sort
EDL	01:07:53,250	01:07:55,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of big expensive power hungry
EDL	01:07:55,000	01:07:57,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technologies and making them smaller and
EDL	01:07:57,333	01:07:59,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lighter and more energy efficient and
EDL	01:07:59,333	01:08:01,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	cheaper and this then opens them up to
EDL	01:08:01,625	01:08:04,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	kind of wider access because say they're
EDL	01:08:04,291	01:08:06,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	cheaper and not so unwieldy(笨重的) and
EDL	01:08:06,583	01:08:07,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	essentially you're taking something
EDL	01:08:07,541	01:08:09,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that's impractical for many and making
EDL	01:08:09,375	01:08:10,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it more practical
EDL	01:08:10,750	01:08:13,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so it's those kind of two themes that i
EDL	01:08:13,000	01:08:13,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	see
EDL	01:08:13,791	01:08:15,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and if you keep those in mind and
EDL	01:08:15,958	01:08:18,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	feel free to bring other themes in
EDL	01:08:18,125	01:08:19,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	as well
EDL	01:08:19,333	01:08:21,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	take me and listeners on a tour of your
EDL	01:08:21,375	01:08:22,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	programs
EDL	01:08:22,833	01:08:24,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sure yeah well the
EDL	01:08:24,666	01:08:26,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the term c-swap that you you bring up
EDL	01:08:26,750	01:08:29,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know it stands for cost size weight
EDL	01:08:29,791	01:08:31,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and power
EDL	01:08:31,000	01:08:33,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and it really is a way to quantify
EDL	01:08:33,791	01:08:36,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	uh the benefits of miniaturization
EDL	01:08:36,750	01:08:37,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and
EDL	01:08:37,625	01:08:39,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if i look at the portfolio of programs
EDL	01:08:39,333	01:08:41,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that i've got i'd say there's sort of
EDL	01:08:41,541	01:08:44,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	two big themes the first is
EDL	01:08:44,375	01:08:46,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	generally optical microsystems
EDL	01:08:46,750	01:08:49,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and the idea being if we
EDL	01:08:49,625	01:08:51,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	build systems out of very small
EDL	01:08:51,791	01:08:52,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	components
EDL	01:08:52,916	01:08:55,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	integrate them together
EDL	01:08:55,000	01:08:56,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	then we can make them
EDL	01:08:56,750	01:08:59,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	low-cost make them mobile deploy them
EDL	01:08:59,625	01:09:02,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	all over and add new functionality
EDL	01:09:02,500	01:09:04,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	typically the way we do these optical
EDL	01:09:04,666	01:09:07,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	microsystems is through another thing
EDL	01:09:07,250	01:09:08,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that's sort of a theme of my programs
EDL	01:09:08,666	01:09:11,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	which is heterogeneous integration
EDL	01:09:11,083	01:09:12,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and that means different things to
EDL	01:09:12,500	01:09:14,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	different people but really it's about
EDL	01:09:14,500	01:09:16,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	bringing different materials
EDL	01:09:16,416	01:09:19,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technologies and functions together into
EDL	01:09:19,458	01:09:20,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a
EDL	01:09:20,125	01:09:22,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	really small package we often
EDL	01:09:22,833	01:09:25,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	think of many of these programs as
EDL	01:09:25,333	01:09:27,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	creating some sort of capability in the
EDL	01:09:27,375	01:09:29,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	size of a sugar cube rather than a beach
EDL	01:09:29,708	01:09:31,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	ball
EDL	01:09:31,250	01:09:34,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	one that goes back a ways is
EDL	01:09:34,208	01:09:36,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	moab let's start with that one
EDL	01:09:36,375	01:09:40,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	modular optical aperture building blocks
EDL	01:09:40,041	01:09:42,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and i remember first encountering this
EDL	01:09:42,291	01:09:43,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and thinking
EDL	01:09:43,541	01:09:45,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a sort of this remarkable idea of taking
EDL	01:09:45,875	01:09:48,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	what might be a whole system of lenses
EDL	01:09:48,291	01:09:50,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know think of a telescope or
EDL	01:09:50,291	01:09:52,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	binoculars or those are more familiar
EDL	01:09:52,500	01:09:54,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	ones but then uh in a way flattening
EDL	01:09:54,833	01:09:57,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	those down all into into something like
EDL	01:09:57,250	01:09:59,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a more integrated kind of optical system
EDL	01:09:59,166	01:10:00,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that would be much less bulky than the
EDL	01:10:00,833	01:10:03,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	originals you inherited that right and
EDL	01:10:03,000	01:10:05,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so tell me a little bit about
EDL	01:10:05,166	01:10:06,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	what you got where you took it and where
EDL	01:10:06,833	01:10:08,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it's at now
EDL	01:10:08,125	01:10:09,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yeah great so moab was one of the
EDL	01:10:09,875	01:10:12,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	programs that i inherited back in 2017
EDL	01:10:12,666	01:10:14,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	when i arrived at darpa it's a great
EDL	01:10:14,833	01:10:17,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	example of this optical micro system
EDL	01:10:17,458	01:10:19,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	integration concept
EDL	01:10:19,333	01:10:22,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and the idea is that most of the lidars
EDL	01:10:22,500	01:10:25,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that we build today this is a laser for
EDL	01:10:25,375	01:10:28,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	3d ranging it's become really exciting
EDL	01:10:28,416	01:10:30,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and enabling for autonomous vehicle
EDL	01:10:30,708	01:10:33,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	navigation also used on on your phone
EDL	01:10:33,458	01:10:36,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	perhaps to recognize you so typically
EDL	01:10:36,291	01:10:38,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lidar systems that we use in in the
EDL	01:10:38,375	01:10:40,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	military are large systems they have a
EDL	01:10:40,833	01:10:43,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	telescope they have a gimbal
EDL	01:10:43,083	01:10:44,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and they're hand assembled
EDL	01:10:44,916	01:10:47,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	right and so they tend to be big slow
EDL	01:10:47,458	01:10:48,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	expensive
EDL	01:10:48,750	01:10:51,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so MOABB is a program that looks to
EDL	01:10:51,708	01:10:54,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	shrink all of that down onto a chip
EDL	01:10:54,416	01:10:56,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sort of like a postage stamp
EDL	01:10:56,583	01:10:57,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	non-mechanical
EDL	01:10:57,958	01:11:00,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical beam steering particularly for
EDL	01:11:00,916	01:11:03,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	for lidar and other kinds of optical
EDL	01:11:03,083	01:11:04,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	techniques
EDL	01:11:04,291	01:11:05,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and
EDL	01:11:05,250	01:11:07,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a lot of this is done through
EDL	01:11:07,000	01:11:09,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	integrated photonics which allows you to
EDL	01:11:09,000	01:11:11,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	take discrete
EDL	01:11:11,000	01:11:13,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical functions like modulators or
EDL	01:11:13,791	01:11:15,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lasers detectors
EDL	01:11:15,625	01:11:18,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and put them into sort of micro scale
EDL	01:11:18,291	01:11:19,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and then assemble them together onto a
EDL	01:11:19,875	01:11:21,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	chip and maybe put thousands or tens of
EDL	01:11:21,708	01:11:23,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	thousands of components on a chip that
EDL	01:11:23,875	01:11:25,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you manufacture in a semiconductor
EDL	01:11:25,708	01:11:27,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	foundry just like you do with integrated
EDL	01:11:27,958	01:11:29,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	circuits
EDL	01:11:29,625	01:11:32,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the program is now in phase three has
EDL	01:11:32,291	01:11:33,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	made
EDL	01:11:33,375	01:11:36,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	enormous progress we've had many world
EDL	01:11:36,125	01:11:38,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	records over the last few years scaling
EDL	01:11:38,833	01:11:40,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	this technology and
EDL	01:11:40,666	01:11:43,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	now it's actually being flight tested
EDL	01:11:43,625	01:11:46,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and shows a path for doing things on on
EDL	01:11:46,500	01:11:48,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	small uavs and other kinds of mobile
EDL	01:11:48,750	01:11:49,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	systems
EDL	01:11:49,708	01:11:52,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	okay and do you imagine that those kinds
EDL	01:11:52,041	01:11:53,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of systems are the ones where this
EDL	01:11:53,875	01:11:55,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technology will see at least its
EDL	01:11:55,708	01:11:57,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	widest initial application or do you
EDL	01:11:57,958	01:12:00,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	imagine also that there are some other
EDL	01:12:00,208	01:12:03,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	very big application areas down the line
EDL	01:12:03,000	01:12:04,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yeah that's a good question and you know
EDL	01:12:04,916	01:12:06,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	i'd say that for most of the integrated
EDL	01:12:06,666	01:12:09,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photonics technologies that we look at
EDL	01:12:09,458	01:12:13,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	there is a very large commercial driver
EDL	01:12:13,333	01:12:15,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	for most of the things that we pursue
EDL	01:12:15,541	01:12:16,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so
EDL	01:12:16,750	01:12:18,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if you think about the the engineering
EDL	01:12:18,583	01:12:21,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	cost of creating something like MOABB
EDL	01:12:21,083	01:12:22,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	there's a whole lot of upfront
EDL	01:12:22,916	01:12:25,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	development cost
EDL	01:12:25,458	01:12:26,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	eventually though you get to the point
EDL	01:12:26,916	01:12:28,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where you can
EDL	01:12:28,666	01:12:30,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	essentially stamp these
EDL	01:12:30,666	01:12:33,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	chips out in a foundry
EDL	01:12:33,375	01:12:34,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and
EDL	01:12:34,375	01:12:36,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it would allow you to scale these to
EDL	01:12:36,041	01:12:38,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sort of millions or hundreds of millions
EDL	01:12:38,125	01:12:39,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of units
EDL	01:12:39,375	01:12:40,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where the
EDL	01:12:40,375	01:12:43,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the unit price can be very low and so
EDL	01:12:43,000	01:12:46,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	for for MOABB the path there is for
EDL	01:12:46,375	01:12:49,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	commercial automotive where you can see
EDL	01:12:49,375	01:12:51,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know there are hundreds of millions
EDL	01:12:51,250	01:12:53,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of cars every year that need
EDL	01:12:53,791	01:12:57,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lidar systems that are small compact
EDL	01:12:57,000	01:12:59,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so MOABB might be good for the dod
EDL	01:12:59,375	01:13:02,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	initially and in certain uh cases but
EDL	01:13:02,125	01:13:04,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	also there's a path to commercialization
EDL	01:13:04,500	01:13:07,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and helping the the broader community
EDL	01:13:07,333	01:13:09,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	very cool very cool so let me now move
EDL	01:13:09,166	01:13:11,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to one another program that i've i've
EDL	01:13:11,791	01:13:14,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	known about for a while in fact i even
EDL	01:13:14,041	01:13:16,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	had met the programmator who started
EDL	01:13:16,125	01:13:18,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that one dan green so i'm referring here
EDL	01:13:18,375	01:13:21,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to chips which is common heterogeneous
EDL	01:13:21,625	01:13:25,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	integration and ip reuse strategies so
EDL	01:13:25,333	01:13:26,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you don't have to actually parse all of
EDL	01:13:26,833	01:13:27,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that
EDL	01:13:27,541	01:13:29,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	those words out there's probably an
EDL	01:13:29,166	01:13:31,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	easier way just to describe
EDL	01:13:31,333	01:13:32,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	what the goal of that program is and
EDL	01:13:32,916	01:13:36,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where what its status is so chips is a a
EDL	01:13:36,375	01:13:40,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	program in our eri portfolio electronics
EDL	01:13:40,208	01:13:42,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	resurgence initiative this is a number
EDL	01:13:42,125	01:13:43,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of programs that we're doing here in the
EDL	01:13:43,958	01:13:45,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	office
EDL	01:13:45,000	01:13:47,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to help define what's next for
EDL	01:13:47,083	01:13:49,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	semiconductor microelectronics
EDL	01:13:49,458	01:13:50,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and
EDL	01:13:50,583	01:13:52,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	chips came about because there is an
EDL	01:13:52,291	01:13:54,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	observation that you know as moore's law
EDL	01:13:54,583	01:13:55,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	goes on
EDL	01:13:55,791	01:13:57,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and we can put more and more transistors
EDL	01:13:57,541	01:13:59,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	on a chip
EDL	01:13:59,083	01:14:01,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	both the cost of fabricating chips at
EDL	01:14:01,708	01:14:03,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	advanced nodes
EDL	01:14:03,000	01:14:05,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and designing them essentially puts the
EDL	01:14:05,625	01:14:07,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	newest technology out of reach for both
EDL	01:14:07,875	01:14:10,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the military and for sort of moderate or
EDL	01:14:10,291	01:14:12,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	small commercial uses
EDL	01:14:12,416	01:14:13,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if you think about
EDL	01:14:13,958	01:14:17,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	say the most advanced GPUs or CPUs built
EDL	01:14:17,541	01:14:19,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	by big microelectronics companies and
EDL	01:14:19,708	01:14:21,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	those are central processing units and
EDL	01:14:21,708	01:14:23,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	graphics processing units yep that's
EDL	01:14:23,708	01:14:25,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	right if you think about these they
EDL	01:14:25,458	01:14:27,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	might cost a couple of hundred dollars
EDL	01:14:27,375	01:14:28,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	each
EDL	01:14:28,208	01:14:30,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	but the design time that goes into them
EDL	01:14:30,125	01:14:31,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it can be
EDL	01:14:31,250	01:14:34,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	thousands of engineering years
EDL	01:14:34,291	01:14:36,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so you know if you want to put
EDL	01:14:36,041	01:14:38,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	something on a on an aircraft we can't
EDL	01:14:38,500	01:14:41,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	afford to do that every time so instead
EDL	01:14:41,333	01:14:43,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	chips takes a modular approach
EDL	01:14:43,625	01:14:45,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	essentially a chiplet integration
EDL	01:14:45,458	01:14:47,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	approach where you don't need to create
EDL	01:14:47,958	01:14:49,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a full
EDL	01:14:49,541	01:14:52,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	asic or application specific integrated
EDL	01:14:52,041	01:14:54,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	circuit from the ground up every time
EDL	01:14:54,583	01:14:57,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	instead you can compose a system out of
EDL	01:14:57,000	01:14:58,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	smaller pieces
EDL	01:14:58,416	01:15:00,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where you really only have to create
EDL	01:15:00,375	01:15:03,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	maybe a couple small capabilities like
EDL	01:15:03,333	01:15:05,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	say a machine learning accelerator
EDL	01:15:05,333	01:15:08,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	chiplet or an rf radio frequency front
EDL	01:15:08,500	01:15:09,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	end chip
EDL	01:15:09,791	01:15:11,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and then assemble it with other things
EDL	01:15:11,541	01:15:13,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that are that are also in the the chips
EDL	01:15:13,875	01:15:16,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	library and put it in a package in fact
EDL	01:15:16,750	01:15:18,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	chips has been a great success it
EDL	01:15:18,583	01:15:21,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	actually has transitioned over to osd
EDL	01:15:21,083	01:15:22,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where they have
EDL	01:15:22,416	01:15:23,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	made a
EDL	01:15:23,333	01:15:25,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	much bigger investment in the in the
EDL	01:15:25,083	01:15:27,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	navy ship program
EDL	01:15:27,166	01:15:29,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to try and make this a commercial
EDL	01:15:29,541	01:15:31,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	reality
EDL	01:15:31,000	01:15:33,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and i will just remind readers that osd
EDL	01:15:33,000	01:15:35,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	stands for the office of the secretary
EDL	01:15:35,083	01:15:36,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of defense
EDL	01:15:36,583	01:15:38,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	now as we continue the tour of your
EDL	01:15:38,375	01:15:41,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	programs let's move to pipes which
EDL	01:15:41,458	01:15:43,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	stands for photonics in the package for
EDL	01:15:43,958	01:15:47,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	extreme scalability pipes is actually a
EDL	01:15:47,000	01:15:48,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	really exciting program for me and it's
EDL	01:15:48,833	01:15:51,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the first one i started at darpa pypes
EDL	01:15:51,375	01:15:53,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	is a program that is
EDL	01:15:53,166	01:15:55,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about a technology called optical
EDL	01:15:55,250	01:15:56,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	interconnects
EDL	01:15:56,583	01:15:59,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and that really means the technologies
EDL	01:15:59,250	01:16:02,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that you would use to
EDL	01:16:02,291	01:16:04,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	send data from one ship to another with
EDL	01:16:04,583	01:16:07,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photons rather than electrons
EDL	01:16:07,000	01:16:08,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	now i started
EDL	01:16:08,583	01:16:10,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	working on darpa programs back in in
EDL	01:16:10,500	01:16:12,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	grad school at stanford with professor
EDL	01:16:12,375	01:16:14,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	david miller who was an expert at
EDL	01:16:14,291	01:16:16,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical interconnects
EDL	01:16:16,208	01:16:18,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical interconnects were seen as sort
EDL	01:16:18,125	01:16:21,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of the future for microelectronics but
EDL	01:16:21,041	01:16:23,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	microelectronics kept moving forward
EDL	01:16:23,708	01:16:26,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	without optics for a long time having
EDL	01:16:26,125	01:16:27,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	said that we've now gotten to a point
EDL	01:16:27,958	01:16:30,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where moore's law has sort of put us
EDL	01:16:30,500	01:16:33,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	into a corner we can do more and more
EDL	01:16:33,083	01:16:35,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	transistors and compute on a chip but
EDL	01:16:35,375	01:16:37,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the wiring or essentially the technology
EDL	01:16:37,333	01:16:39,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to move data around doesn't really get
EDL	01:16:39,625	01:16:42,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	better as you shrink it down
EDL	01:16:42,041	01:16:44,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so you've got this bottleneck where you
EDL	01:16:44,041	01:16:46,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	create all of this data on chip but you
EDL	01:16:46,041	01:16:47,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	can't move it from one place to another
EDL	01:16:47,708	01:16:50,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	very efficiently and we've reached a
EDL	01:16:50,208	01:16:52,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	problem where we're both bottlenecked in
EDL	01:16:52,416	01:16:55,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	terms of total capacity and the energy
EDL	01:16:55,333	01:16:57,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that we use to move data becomes
EDL	01:16:57,333	01:16:59,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	enormous and and sort of dominates our
EDL	01:16:59,250	01:17:00,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	system
EDL	01:17:00,375	01:17:02,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so instead we have to turn to a
EDL	01:17:02,208	01:17:04,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	different solution and optics is that
EDL	01:17:04,500	01:17:05,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	solution
EDL	01:17:05,541	01:17:08,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if you think about the internet or data
EDL	01:17:08,208	01:17:11,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	centers right we've already used
EDL	01:17:11,333	01:17:13,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	fiber optics to move data around for a
EDL	01:17:13,791	01:17:15,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	long time 20 or 30 years
EDL	01:17:15,958	01:17:18,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and this has gotten meaningful at a
EDL	01:17:18,583	01:17:21,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	shorter scale as we go forward
EDL	01:17:21,375	01:17:24,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	PIPES is looking to integrate photonics
EDL	01:17:24,125	01:17:25,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	into the package like it says in the
EDL	01:17:25,708	01:17:28,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	title for advanced
EDL	01:17:28,208	01:17:31,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	microelectronic systems like CPUs and
EDL	01:17:31,000	01:17:33,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	GPUs which you defined before or or
EDL	01:17:33,166	01:17:36,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	reconfigurable processors like FPGAs
EDL	01:17:36,291	01:17:38,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	which are field programmable gate arrays
EDL	01:17:38,583	01:17:41,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	FPGAs can be really powerful chips but
EDL	01:17:41,375	01:17:42,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	out of the box they don't really do
EDL	01:17:42,750	01:17:43,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	anything
EDL	01:17:43,875	01:17:45,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	they're meant to be programmed by the
EDL	01:17:45,458	01:17:47,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	customer and so they can really be
EDL	01:17:47,958	01:17:49,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	applied to different scenarios different
EDL	01:17:49,958	01:17:52,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	applications this makes it a really good
EDL	01:17:52,416	01:17:54,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	application for the PIPES program and so
EDL	01:17:54,833	01:17:57,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the program has a number of performers
EDL	01:17:57,166	01:17:59,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	they all have very challenging metrics
EDL	01:17:59,333	01:18:01,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	given that this this field is is
EDL	01:18:01,958	01:18:04,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	relatively uh mature
EDL	01:18:04,500	01:18:06,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so we're pushing
EDL	01:18:06,291	01:18:08,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	Intel and Xilinx two of our bigger
EDL	01:18:08,041	01:18:10,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	performers to put photonics into their
EDL	01:18:10,750	01:18:13,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	most advanced fpgas they've actually had
EDL	01:18:13,166	01:18:15,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	great success we're just moving into
EDL	01:18:15,000	01:18:16,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	phase two
EDL	01:18:16,125	01:18:17,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and then we have a number of smaller
EDL	01:18:17,541	01:18:20,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	companies and academics
EDL	01:18:20,041	01:18:21,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	working to really improve the the
EDL	01:18:21,708	01:18:23,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	underlying technologies the integration
EDL	01:18:23,625	01:18:25,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the circuits
EDL	01:18:25,000	01:18:27,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the photonic components themselves
EDL	01:18:27,458	01:18:29,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to help us
EDL	01:18:29,083	01:18:30,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	as you go forward in time so sort of
EDL	01:18:30,916	01:18:32,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	five or ten years out these technologies
EDL	01:18:32,750	01:18:35,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	are going to be particularly important
EDL	01:18:35,250	01:18:37,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	right and there are so many interesting
EDL	01:18:37,166	01:18:38,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technical questions i could ask i'm just
EDL	01:18:38,833	01:18:40,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	going to sort of go to one just to give
EDL	01:18:40,666	01:18:42,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a flavor of the kinds of challenges
EDL	01:18:42,041	01:18:43,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you're dealing with you know so like
EDL	01:18:43,250	01:18:45,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	with optical fiber technology i mean
EDL	01:18:45,625	01:18:47,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that all emerged out of out of really
EDL	01:18:47,541	01:18:50,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	kind of specialty incredibly pure
EDL	01:18:50,208	01:18:52,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know glass i mean that's glass
EDL	01:18:52,375	01:18:54,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technology uh here when you talk about
EDL	01:18:54,666	01:18:56,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical interconnects and photonic
EDL	01:18:56,375	01:18:58,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	components i mean just give us a
EDL	01:18:58,833	01:19:01,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	just a real short sense of what kinds of
EDL	01:19:01,166	01:19:02,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	materials that you're actually talking
EDL	01:19:02,750	01:19:05,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about sure so we're talking about many
EDL	01:19:05,166	01:19:06,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	materials but
EDL	01:19:06,833	01:19:09,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	usually they're at the chip scale and so
EDL	01:19:09,000	01:19:11,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	we have compound semiconductors like
EDL	01:19:11,000	01:19:13,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	gallium arsenide or indium phosphide 砷化镓或磷化铟
EDL	01:19:13,375	01:19:15,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	often integrated with silicon where
EDL	01:19:15,458	01:19:17,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	silicon might be doing a lot of the
EDL	01:19:17,541	01:19:20,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	electronics and the compounds might be
EDL	01:19:20,291	01:19:21,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	doing
EDL	01:19:21,375	01:19:23,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	emission and detection of light and then
EDL	01:19:23,541	01:19:26,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	those might be interconnected with glass
EDL	01:19:26,125	01:19:27,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	fibers or other things that that go
EDL	01:19:27,958	01:19:30,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	between one source and one detector that
EDL	01:19:30,375	01:19:32,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	might be a meter apart or a kilometer
EDL	01:19:32,666	01:19:34,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	apart depending on the on the
EDL	01:19:34,291	01:19:36,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	application  - great thanks for those
EDL	01:19:36,291	01:19:38,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	details okay now i would like to
EDL	01:19:38,416	01:19:40,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	continue and talk about a couple of more
EDL	01:19:40,500	01:19:43,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of your programs next let's move to
EDL	01:19:43,000	01:19:45,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lumos which i think maybe is one of your
EDL	01:19:45,708	01:19:48,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	uh newest this stands for lasers for
EDL	01:19:48,291	01:19:51,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	universal micro scale optical systems
EDL	01:19:51,625	01:19:53,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	what are you up to with lumos
EDL	01:19:53,791	01:19:56,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yeah so lumos is the program that i most
EDL	01:19:56,291	01:19:59,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wanted to do when i came to darpa lumos
EDL	01:19:59,000	01:19:59,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	was
EDL	01:19:59,958	01:20:02,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it's a heterogeneous(异构) integration program
EDL	01:20:02,833	01:20:05,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that that basically integrates new
EDL	01:20:05,250	01:20:08,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	materials in sort of a 3d way
EDL	01:20:08,291	01:20:11,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	onto semiconductor wafers (晶圆) and so
EDL	01:20:11,458	01:20:14,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if you look at integrated photonics
EDL	01:20:14,041	01:20:16,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	today it's moved very fast in the last
EDL	01:20:16,291	01:20:17,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	decade
EDL	01:20:17,458	01:20:19,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	because silicon photonics has been very
EDL	01:20:19,708	01:20:20,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	successful
EDL	01:20:20,833	01:20:23,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	we use silicon in traditional
EDL	01:20:23,958	01:20:25,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	electronic circuits
EDL	01:20:25,708	01:20:27,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and by leveraging the fabrication
EDL	01:20:27,791	01:20:30,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	techniques people have moved silicon
EDL	01:20:30,125	01:20:33,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photonics forward very fast you can
EDL	01:20:33,250	01:20:34,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	fabricate
EDL	01:20:34,416	01:20:36,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	really complex
EDL	01:20:36,375	01:20:38,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photonic integrated circuits
EDL	01:20:38,750	01:20:40,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	however silicon is actually not a great
EDL	01:20:40,750	01:20:43,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	material for optics
EDL	01:20:43,166	01:20:45,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it's really good for fabrication but
EDL	01:20:45,458	01:20:48,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it doesn't emit light at least not very
EDL	01:20:48,208	01:20:50,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	efficiently doesn't really detect most
EDL	01:20:50,291	01:20:52,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of the light that we care about and it
EDL	01:20:52,750	01:20:54,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	doesn't do other effects like nonlinear
EDL	01:20:54,500	01:20:56,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	effects that we might care about
EDL	01:20:56,416	01:20:59,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so LUMOS is about integrating materials
EDL	01:20:59,166	01:21:01,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	onto silicon or other other low loss
EDL	01:21:01,791	01:21:02,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	materials
EDL	01:21:02,833	01:21:05,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	particularly to make lasers so
EDL	01:21:05,875	01:21:07,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lasers and amplifiers in the in the
EDL	01:21:07,875	01:21:11,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical space are really foundational
EDL	01:21:11,083	01:21:13,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the laser was invented about 60 years
EDL	01:21:13,375	01:21:15,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	ago around the same time darpa actually
EDL	01:21:15,625	01:21:17,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	they co-evolved
EDL	01:21:17,166	01:21:18,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yes
EDL	01:21:18,125	01:21:19,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and you know people
EDL	01:21:19,625	01:21:21,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	realized really quickly that that lasers
EDL	01:21:21,708	01:21:23,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	were going to be really important they
EDL	01:21:23,791	01:21:25,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	shrunk them down to make semiconductor
EDL	01:21:25,541	01:21:28,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lasers and you know we keep finding new
EDL	01:21:28,416	01:21:30,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	applications for for lasers silicon
EDL	01:21:30,666	01:21:32,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photonics doesn't really have lasers and
EDL	01:21:32,291	01:21:34,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so you need to integrate separate laser
EDL	01:21:34,500	01:21:37,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	chips to build up a system so LUMOS is
EDL	01:21:37,333	01:21:39,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	saying how do we put lasers directly
EDL	01:21:39,708	01:21:41,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	directly on these wafers and so the
EDL	01:21:41,875	01:21:43,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	teams are doing various things they're
EDL	01:21:43,625	01:21:46,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	they're growing compound semiconductors
EDL	01:21:46,041	01:21:47,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	right on top of silicon they're
EDL	01:21:47,708	01:21:49,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	integrating tiny little chiplets on
EDL	01:21:49,791	01:21:52,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	silicon they're doing non-linear
EDL	01:21:52,041	01:21:54,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wavelength conversion so that we can
EDL	01:21:54,583	01:21:56,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	create new wavelengths maybe in the
EDL	01:21:56,666	01:22:00,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	visible for quantum or atomic systems
EDL	01:22:00,208	01:22:02,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and looking at how do you amplify light
EDL	01:22:02,375	01:22:04,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	to get to sort of watts of power on
EDL	01:22:04,666	01:22:06,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	these on these wafers
EDL	01:22:06,583	01:22:08,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	well so it sounds like tremendous amount
EDL	01:22:08,666	01:22:10,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of versatility both kind of in the
EDL	01:22:10,666	01:22:13,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	spectrum element and also power
EDL	01:22:13,791	01:22:15,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know when you think of two or three
EDL	01:22:15,166	01:22:16,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	applications that would just tickle you
EDL	01:22:16,750	01:22:18,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if you saw them getting out there in the
EDL	01:22:18,583	01:22:19,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	in
EDL	01:22:19,333	01:22:21,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	real life what comes to mind well so i
EDL	01:22:21,791	01:22:23,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	think that there's going to be a lot of
EDL	01:22:23,333	01:22:25,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	new applications beyond just moving data
EDL	01:22:25,458	01:22:27,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	around which is what photonics is used
EDL	01:22:27,083	01:22:28,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	for today so
EDL	01:22:28,750	01:22:30,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so sensors for
EDL	01:22:30,666	01:22:32,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	positioning navigation and timing that's
EDL	01:22:32,416	01:22:34,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a big thing that we care about in in the
EDL	01:22:34,375	01:22:36,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	dod but understanding where you are and
EDL	01:22:36,416	01:22:38,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	navigating in the world
EDL	01:22:38,041	01:22:40,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	often we make precision sensors with
EDL	01:22:40,500	01:22:42,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	with quantum systems or atomic systems
EDL	01:22:42,583	01:22:45,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and you have to interface with atoms
EDL	01:22:45,166	01:22:46,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	every atom might be different it might
EDL	01:22:46,416	01:22:49,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	be a rubidium atom or a cesium atom 铷原子或铯原子
EDL	01:22:49,166	01:22:51,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and LUMOS is trying to address this by
EDL	01:22:51,375	01:22:53,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	making a flexible platform that can
EDL	01:22:53,166	01:22:56,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	create really narrow line width lasers
EDL	01:22:56,583	01:22:58,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	at just about any wavelength that you
EDL	01:22:58,416	01:23:01,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	care about on a chip right and is this
EDL	01:23:01,458	01:23:04,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where the optical frequency combs come
EDL	01:23:04,125	01:23:06,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	in which i've been hearing about and
EDL	01:23:06,375	01:23:08,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	actually had a little bit of a challenge
EDL	01:23:08,041	01:23:10,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	with a public affairs colleague of mine
EDL	01:23:10,291	01:23:12,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	uh to see if we could uh just if you
EDL	01:23:12,833	01:23:14,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	could describe that in a way that most
EDL	01:23:14,416	01:23:15,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	people would understand
EDL	01:23:15,875	01:23:18,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	well sure i can i can give it a try so
EDL	01:23:18,041	01:23:20,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	uh yeah optical frequency combs have
EDL	01:23:20,750	01:23:24,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	seen sort of a huge explosion of advance
EDL	01:23:24,291	01:23:27,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	in the last few years the idea is
EDL	01:23:27,541	01:23:30,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	typically using non-linear techniques we
EDL	01:23:30,291	01:23:32,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	go from a single optical frequency if
EDL	01:23:32,583	01:23:34,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you think of a laser it's sort of one
EDL	01:23:34,375	01:23:37,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	single color and we create a number of
EDL	01:23:37,958	01:23:39,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	different frequencies that are all
EDL	01:23:39,875	01:23:42,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	equally spaced in the frequency spectrum
EDL	01:23:42,666	01:23:45,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if you think of them looking like a comb
EDL	01:23:45,458	01:23:46,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that you would you know comb your hair
EDL	01:23:46,916	01:23:49,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	with each one of these tones equally
EDL	01:23:49,083	01:23:51,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	spaced this essentially becomes a very
EDL	01:23:51,708	01:23:54,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	precise ruler and it can be used in many
EDL	01:23:54,416	01:23:56,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	different applications can be used for
EDL	01:23:56,583	01:23:59,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	frequency metrology it can be used for
EDL	01:23:59,250	01:24:01,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	spatial metrology
EDL	01:24:01,541	01:24:04,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and it's really created a whole new area
EDL	01:24:04,416	01:24:06,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of science and applications including
EDL	01:24:06,666	01:24:09,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	some of my other programs uh like DODOS
EDL	01:24:09,458	01:24:11,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and griffin okay we'll get to that just
EDL	01:24:11,791	01:24:13,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	in one minute but some i was thinking
EDL	01:24:13,333	01:24:14,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about these
EDL	01:24:14,583	01:24:16,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical frequency combs the other day
EDL	01:24:16,375	01:24:18,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sitting back on my deck and i was
EDL	01:24:18,125	01:24:21,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wondering like if in addition to
EDL	01:24:21,333	01:24:23,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	kind of specifying
EDL	01:24:23,250	01:24:24,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	this
EDL	01:24:24,291	01:24:26,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know range of frequencies if if you
EDL	01:24:26,833	01:24:28,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	can individually
EDL	01:24:28,750	01:24:32,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	also determine and specify the intensity
EDL	01:24:32,375	01:24:34,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of each of those frequencies because
EDL	01:24:34,500	01:24:36,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	with that then you'd be able to kind of
EDL	01:24:36,375	01:24:37,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	simulate
EDL	01:24:37,625	01:24:38,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the
EDL	01:24:38,583	01:24:39,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	color
EDL	01:24:39,458	01:24:42,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	experience of any particular thing like
EDL	01:24:42,041	01:24:44,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a leaf or wood and the way each of those
EDL	01:24:44,916	01:24:47,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	absorbs and emits a different
EDL	01:24:47,541	01:24:50,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	portfolio of light frequencies can you
EDL	01:24:50,041	01:24:51,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	do that with an optical frequency comb
EDL	01:24:51,791	01:24:53,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	or are all of those component
EDL	01:24:53,625	01:24:56,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	frequencies the teeth of the comb as it
EDL	01:24:56,291	01:24:58,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	were or tones as you refer to them
EDL	01:24:58,750	01:25:01,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	are they all the same intensity well so
EDL	01:25:01,166	01:25:03,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	typically they start out maybe similar
EDL	01:25:03,250	01:25:05,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	in intensity but you can certainly
EDL	01:25:05,000	01:25:07,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	modulate each one of them and and create
EDL	01:25:07,958	01:25:10,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	just about any spectrum that you want
EDL	01:25:10,375	01:25:11,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so
EDL	01:25:11,541	01:25:13,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know one of the
EDL	01:25:13,166	01:25:15,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	clear uses for optical frequency combs
EDL	01:25:15,083	01:25:18,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	would be for spectral sensing and so you
EDL	01:25:18,125	01:25:20,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	could imagine creating thousands of of
EDL	01:25:20,750	01:25:23,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	tones at different frequencies
EDL	01:25:23,083	01:25:26,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and sensing maybe a gas plume and
EDL	01:25:26,375	01:25:28,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	understanding exactly which molecules
EDL	01:25:28,833	01:25:31,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	are present at what concentration by
EDL	01:25:31,375	01:25:33,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	detecting the relative intensity of each
EDL	01:25:33,541	01:25:35,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	one of those we also have
EDL	01:25:35,708	01:25:37,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	under the pipes program that i talked
EDL	01:25:37,250	01:25:39,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about some teams that are using optical
EDL	01:25:39,625	01:25:41,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	frequency combs
EDL	01:25:41,250	01:25:44,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	with each each comb tooth being sort of
EDL	01:25:44,750	01:25:47,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	an independent source almost like
EDL	01:25:47,458	01:25:50,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	how systems today are built with
EDL	01:25:50,666	01:25:52,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	individual lasers at different colors
EDL	01:25:52,583	01:25:55,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wavelength division multiplexing or wdm
EDL	01:25:55,375	01:25:58,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	instead you could have one comb laser
EDL	01:25:58,125	01:26:00,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that creates hundreds of lines
EDL	01:26:00,583	01:26:02,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and then modulate each one and now you
EDL	01:26:02,375	01:26:04,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	have hundreds of of optical channels
EDL	01:26:04,583	01:26:07,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	each carrying their own data
EDL	01:26:07,375	01:26:09,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yeah astonishing
EDL	01:26:09,000	01:26:11,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so let's finish out your
EDL	01:26:11,458	01:26:14,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	tour of programs with with two that are
EDL	01:26:14,666	01:26:16,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	related
EDL	01:26:16,041	01:26:18,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and one preceded the other i'm referring
EDL	01:26:18,125	01:26:21,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	here to the two programs known as dodos
EDL	01:26:21,541	01:26:23,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and griffin
EDL	01:26:23,458	01:26:26,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and i'll let you spell those out and
EDL	01:26:26,916	01:26:28,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	tell me
EDL	01:26:28,125	01:26:30,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the technology trajectory that they
EDL	01:26:30,750	01:26:32,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	amount to
EDL	01:26:32,416	01:26:33,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sure so
EDL	01:26:33,708	01:26:37,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	dodos is uh the direct on-chip digital
EDL	01:26:37,791	01:26:40,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical synthesizer this is a program i
EDL	01:26:40,583	01:26:42,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	inherited also when i arrived back in
EDL	01:26:42,666	01:26:46,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	2017 it's a fantastic program and it's a
EDL	01:26:46,208	01:26:47,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	little esoteric so for people that
EDL	01:26:47,958	01:26:51,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	aren't in the optical physics space
EDL	01:26:51,166	01:26:53,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it'll take just a minute to explain but
EDL	01:26:53,541	01:26:55,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	if you're familiar with microwave and
EDL	01:26:55,708	01:26:59,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	radio frequency technologies the direct
EDL	01:26:59,000	01:27:01,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	digital synthesizer or dds
EDL	01:27:01,958	01:27:05,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	is commonplace today in a radio in your
EDL	01:27:05,250	01:27:07,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	car you no longer have a tuning knob
EDL	01:27:07,875	01:27:10,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that you kind of have to tweak and find
EDL	01:27:10,375	01:27:12,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the right frequency
EDL	01:27:12,125	01:27:13,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	instead you just hit a button and your
EDL	01:27:13,875	01:27:16,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	radio goes there it generates the right
EDL	01:27:16,375	01:27:19,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	frequency optics today is kind of still
EDL	01:27:19,541	01:27:22,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	stuck in the microwave world of the 60s
EDL	01:27:22,500	01:27:24,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where we build a laser
EDL	01:27:24,666	01:27:26,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and then we measure what the output
EDL	01:27:26,375	01:27:28,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wavelength is or the frequency you might
EDL	01:27:28,375	01:27:30,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	be able to lock it to something but you
EDL	01:27:30,291	01:27:32,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	don't really just tell it where to go
EDL	01:27:32,916	01:27:35,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and dodos which is looking to make an
EDL	01:27:35,625	01:27:38,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical analog of the dds
EDL	01:27:38,500	01:27:40,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	is trying to do that we just finished
EDL	01:27:40,416	01:27:42,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	dodos this year and made enormous
EDL	01:27:42,416	01:27:45,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	strides and the idea is if you use
EDL	01:27:45,166	01:27:47,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical frequency combs as your ruler
EDL	01:27:47,791	01:27:50,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and some microwave techniques where we
EDL	01:27:50,208	01:27:52,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	know frequencies very well hopefully you
EDL	01:27:52,416	01:27:54,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	can create
EDL	01:27:54,416	01:27:56,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical frequencies with incredible
EDL	01:27:56,916	01:27:59,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	precision and accuracy and so in fact
EDL	01:27:59,791	01:28:02,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	under DODOS we've we've seen many many
EDL	01:28:02,291	01:28:03,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	orders of magnitude improvement in the
EDL	01:28:03,875	01:28:06,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	accuracy of of optical frequencies and
EDL	01:28:06,500	01:28:07,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	this is all using chip scale
EDL	01:28:07,791	01:28:10,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technologies so again trying to to take
EDL	01:28:10,208	01:28:12,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technologies that today look like a a
EDL	01:28:12,375	01:28:14,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	room or a rack and put it into the size
EDL	01:28:14,916	01:28:17,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of a sugar cube right and just to help
EDL	01:28:17,083	01:28:19,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	listeners who might be impressed that
EDL	01:28:19,166	01:28:21,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you can get the highest precision on a
EDL	01:28:21,458	01:28:23,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	frequency might be impressed by that
EDL	01:28:23,458	01:28:25,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	capability but it doesn't know why what
EDL	01:28:25,375	01:28:27,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	do we get from that well sort of again
EDL	01:28:27,625	01:28:30,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	like changing the paradigm(范例) the way that
EDL	01:28:30,583	01:28:33,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	digital synthesis did for radios we also
EDL	01:28:33,708	01:28:35,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	use optical frequencies for
EDL	01:28:35,000	01:28:36,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	communications
EDL	01:28:36,375	01:28:38,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so you could imagine incredible
EDL	01:28:38,583	01:28:40,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	improvements in
EDL	01:28:40,500	01:28:42,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical communications by having
EDL	01:28:42,750	01:28:44,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	precision control of frequencies at both
EDL	01:28:44,750	01:28:45,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	ends
EDL	01:28:45,541	01:28:49,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	essentially doing coherent communications(相干通信)
EDL	01:28:49,000	01:28:50,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	where both sides know
EDL	01:28:50,041	01:28:52,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	what wavelengths are being communicated
EDL	01:28:52,375	01:28:55,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	very precisely or you could do precision
EDL	01:28:55,541	01:28:58,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	uh lidar where maybe you have one source
EDL	01:28:58,500	01:29:00,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	emitting and a different source
EDL	01:29:00,125	01:29:02,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	receiving it's also important for for
EDL	01:29:02,500	01:29:04,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	doing optical sensing where you perhaps
EDL	01:29:04,833	01:29:05,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	know
EDL	01:29:05,875	01:29:07,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the precise wavelength of different
EDL	01:29:07,541	01:29:10,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	transitions for different molecules or
EDL	01:29:10,375	01:29:13,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	again quantum anatomic sensors
EDL	01:29:13,458	01:29:15,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	okay and then just one more point on
EDL	01:29:15,333	01:29:16,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	this one because as you were talking
EDL	01:29:16,666	01:29:19,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about you know if i know and can produce
EDL	01:29:19,875	01:29:22,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	an extremely um you know precise
EDL	01:29:22,125	01:29:23,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	frequency
EDL	01:29:23,333	01:29:25,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	for communication and i want my
EDL	01:29:25,333	01:29:27,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	recipient to be able to do that same
EDL	01:29:27,708	01:29:29,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	thing or if my recipient can that sounds
EDL	01:29:29,958	01:29:31,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	like it would open up kind of you know
EDL	01:29:31,458	01:29:33,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	privacy and security channels
EDL	01:29:33,958	01:29:35,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yeah that's a great point you could
EDL	01:29:35,541	01:29:38,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	certainly do that so DODOS was the prior
EDL	01:29:38,916	01:29:41,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	program that led into GRYPHON talk about
EDL	01:29:41,000	01:29:43,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	GRYPHON right so as we got near the end
EDL	01:29:43,083	01:29:46,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of DODOS we saw this this great advance
EDL	01:29:46,583	01:29:49,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	in technology in fact i should say that
EDL	01:29:49,083	01:29:50,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	under dodos
EDL	01:29:50,666	01:29:52,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	perhaps the biggest outcome here was
EDL	01:29:52,833	01:29:55,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	seeing the whole community
EDL	01:29:55,250	01:29:58,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	get excited about non-linear photonics
EDL	01:29:58,208	01:29:59,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	we had
EDL	01:29:59,625	01:30:01,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	from the the performers under DODOS we
EDL	01:30:01,625	01:30:04,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	had well over a hundred peer-reviewed
EDL	01:30:04,125	01:30:05,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	journal submissions
EDL	01:30:05,708	01:30:08,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and we had more than 25
EDL	01:30:08,291	01:30:10,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	high impact journals in in the nature
EDL	01:30:10,583	01:30:12,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and science suite of journals
EDL	01:30:12,750	01:30:15,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	this is really changing the field and
EDL	01:30:15,166	01:30:16,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	there's whole sessions at conferences
EDL	01:30:16,750	01:30:18,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	now on DODOS's technology
EDL	01:30:18,833	01:30:21,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	now on to GRYPHON
EDL	01:30:21,000	01:30:23,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	which stands for generating rf with
EDL	01:30:23,541	01:30:25,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photonic oscillators for low noise it's
EDL	01:30:25,958	01:30:27,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a little bit of a stretch but we like
EDL	01:30:27,333	01:30:29,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the name the GRYPHON  program is a
EDL	01:30:29,250	01:30:30,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	recognition that if you can make
EDL	01:30:30,500	01:30:32,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	extremely precise frequencies in the
EDL	01:30:32,375	01:30:33,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical domain
EDL	01:30:33,958	01:30:36,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and then divide those frequencies down
EDL	01:30:36,208	01:30:39,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	from these sort of 100 terahertz
EDL	01:30:39,000	01:30:41,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	frequencies down to the microwave
EDL	01:30:41,458	01:30:43,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you actually reduce noise when you do
EDL	01:30:43,250	01:30:44,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that and that means you can get
EDL	01:30:44,916	01:30:46,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	incredibly
EDL	01:30:46,375	01:30:49,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	precise low phase noise oscillators in
EDL	01:30:49,083	01:30:50,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the microwave regime
EDL	01:30:50,666	01:30:51,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so
EDL	01:30:51,541	01:30:53,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	oscillators
EDL	01:30:53,375	01:30:55,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	are important in our entire world right
EDL	01:30:55,625	01:30:56,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	they
EDL	01:30:56,916	01:30:59,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	they form the clock that drives every
EDL	01:30:59,875	01:31:01,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	piece of digital electronics your phone
EDL	01:31:01,875	01:31:04,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	your computer microwave oscillators in
EDL	01:31:04,208	01:31:06,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	particular are important for
EDL	01:31:06,500	01:31:09,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	communications and for radar and so the
EDL	01:31:09,958	01:31:12,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	dod cares a lot about making very
EDL	01:31:12,208	01:31:15,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	precise microwave oscillators
EDL	01:31:15,250	01:31:16,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and they try and make them very low
EDL	01:31:16,916	01:31:18,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	noise very quiet
EDL	01:31:18,291	01:31:20,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	essentially a pure tone if you think of
EDL	01:31:20,916	01:31:23,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	ringing a bell and just maybe you know a
EDL	01:31:23,458	01:31:26,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	crystal wine glass that's a pure tone at
EDL	01:31:26,208	01:31:27,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	microwave frequencies
EDL	01:31:27,875	01:31:29,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it is something that's sort of an
EDL	01:31:29,458	01:31:32,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	exquisite oscillator and it gets used in
EDL	01:31:32,666	01:31:35,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	again exquisite systems but using
EDL	01:31:35,250	01:31:37,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	GRYPHON kinds of techniques or dodo's
EDL	01:31:37,625	01:31:39,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	kinds of techniques
EDL	01:31:39,083	01:31:41,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you can imagine making these exquisite
EDL	01:31:41,625	01:31:44,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	oscillators(振荡器) not with RF(射频) electronics
EDL	01:31:44,750	01:31:47,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	which are often sort of hand-tuned
EDL	01:31:47,250	01:31:48,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	hand-built
EDL	01:31:48,666	01:31:51,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	expensive bulky things but putting them
EDL	01:31:51,166	01:31:53,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	on a chip and you use optics and
EDL	01:31:53,625	01:31:56,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	photonics on this chip
EDL	01:31:56,125	01:31:58,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	but it's a case where we don't really
EDL	01:31:58,208	01:32:00,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	care that there's there's optics inside
EDL	01:32:00,500	01:32:02,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the package what we want to do is
EDL	01:32:02,500	01:32:04,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	generate a microwave signal that
EDL	01:32:04,041	01:32:06,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	ultimately comes out so griffin again
EDL	01:32:06,750	01:32:09,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	with sort of this sugar cube idea in
EDL	01:32:09,166	01:32:10,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	mind has
EDL	01:32:10,375	01:32:13,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	has goals of making very very quiet rf
EDL	01:32:13,166	01:32:16,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	or microwave signals with optics inside
EDL	01:32:16,208	01:32:17,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the the tiny box
EDL	01:32:17,958	01:32:18,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and
EDL	01:32:18,833	01:32:21,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the idea would be we make we make better
EDL	01:32:21,166	01:32:24,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	radars better communication systems
EDL	01:32:24,125	01:32:27,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and we can make them small
EDL	01:32:27,250	01:32:29,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	low power and low cost
EDL	01:32:29,791	01:32:31,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	there's a lot of commercial applications
EDL	01:32:31,541	01:32:32,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	as well like
EDL	01:32:32,833	01:32:35,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	imaging radar say for a autonomous
EDL	01:32:35,333	01:32:37,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	vehicle or if you make it small enough
EDL	01:32:37,875	01:32:41,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	maybe it goes in in every cell phone
EDL	01:32:41,000	01:32:42,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	wow okay well gordon
EDL	01:32:42,916	01:32:44,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that was kind of an amazing tour of all
EDL	01:32:44,833	01:32:47,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	of these programs i mean when i think of
EDL	01:32:47,541	01:32:50,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the technical challenges when i think of
EDL	01:32:50,416	01:32:52,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the probably dozens of research
EDL	01:32:52,583	01:32:55,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	performers who are working across these
EDL	01:32:55,000	01:32:57,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	half dozen or so programs and you
EDL	01:32:57,458	01:32:59,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	keeping track of all of them and
EDL	01:32:59,625	01:33:01,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and seeing how they can all integrate
EDL	01:33:01,958	01:33:04,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and synthesize uh you have really got a
EDL	01:33:04,916	01:33:07,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	lot on your shoulders i uh give you some
EDL	01:33:07,333	01:33:09,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	pats on the back for doing all that and
EDL	01:33:09,083	01:33:10,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	it's exciting to think about the
EDL	01:33:10,208	01:33:12,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technologies that will move forward so
EDL	01:33:12,208	01:33:14,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	before we kind of come in for a landing
EDL	01:33:14,125	01:33:15,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	here i just want to see was there
EDL	01:33:15,958	01:33:18,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	anything that you thought of afterwards
EDL	01:33:18,416	01:33:20,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	from any of these programs that you know
EDL	01:33:20,750	01:33:22,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you'd like to just share with listeners
EDL	01:33:22,291	01:33:24,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	before i do take you in for a landing
EDL	01:33:24,208	01:33:27,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and liberate you so i think that there's
EDL	01:33:27,166	01:33:29,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	a whole lot of unknowns as to where this
EDL	01:33:29,375	01:33:31,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technology could go and there's a lot of
EDL	01:33:31,708	01:33:35,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	potential and so you know i worry about
EDL	01:33:35,000	01:33:37,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	occasionally on our DARPA  programs which
EDL	01:33:37,333	01:33:39,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	are very focused right we're trying to
EDL	01:33:39,333	01:33:41,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	solve one particular problem that that
EDL	01:33:41,958	01:33:44,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	we're missing things there's
EDL	01:33:44,208	01:33:45,791	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	there's other things like you know
EDL	01:33:45,791	01:33:48,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	biosensing or medical applications
EDL	01:33:48,583	01:33:51,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and so we need to to kind of look at the
EDL	01:33:51,250	01:33:53,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	big picture and always keep looking for
EDL	01:33:53,000	01:33:55,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	new opportunities i would say that one
EDL	01:33:55,458	01:33:56,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	thing i want to make sure that the
EDL	01:33:56,833	01:33:58,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	listeners hear
EDL	01:33:58,208	01:33:59,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	is that
EDL	01:33:59,375	01:34:02,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	good ideas come from everywhere and
EDL	01:34:02,666	01:34:04,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you mentioned the limited tenure that we
EDL	01:34:04,750	01:34:06,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	have at DARPA we're always looking for
EDL	01:34:06,375	01:34:09,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	new people and so if you've got ideas i
EDL	01:34:09,375	01:34:11,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	care a lot about
EDL	01:34:11,000	01:34:12,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	optical microsystems so for sure come
EDL	01:34:12,833	01:34:14,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	see me if you've got ideas in this area
EDL	01:34:14,750	01:34:17,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	but you know get involved DARPA is not
EDL	01:34:17,333	01:34:19,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	one person or one place it's a
EDL	01:34:19,083	01:34:20,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	collection of people that are excited
EDL	01:34:20,916	01:34:23,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	about moving technology forward and so
EDL	01:34:23,333	01:34:24,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know maybe you want to be a program
EDL	01:34:24,916	01:34:26,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	manager maybe you want to work as a STAEA
EDL	01:34:26,833	01:34:28,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	maybe you want to be a performer and
EDL	01:34:28,666	01:34:31,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	keep doing research but uh reach out and
EDL	01:34:31,625	01:34:33,458	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	get involved with darpa
EDL	01:34:33,458	01:34:35,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	all right you hear that listeners it's a
EDL	01:34:35,083	01:34:37,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	pitch for you guys to get in touch and i
EDL	01:34:37,166	01:34:39,875	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	should point out that the acronym aceta
EDL	01:34:39,875	01:34:44,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	stands for the scientific technical and engineering  assistance
EDL	01:34:44,500	01:34:45,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	who
EDL	01:34:45,375	01:34:47,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	work with program managers like you,
EDL	01:34:47,333	01:34:49,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	Gordon, to take
EDL	01:34:49,083	01:34:50,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	programs through their entire life
EDL	01:34:50,666	01:34:52,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	cycles
EDL	01:34:52,125	01:34:54,041	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	so as i see it you're kind of in the
EDL	01:34:54,041	01:34:56,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	business of turning science fiction or
EDL	01:34:56,125	01:34:59,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	at least sort of visions of technology
EDL	01:34:59,166	01:35:02,208	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	into reality we've talked about a num a
EDL	01:35:02,208	01:35:04,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	number of the ways you're trying to do
EDL	01:35:04,125	01:35:06,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that but i'm wondering if as a kind of a
EDL	01:35:06,750	01:35:08,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	技术狂热 technophile and a technology developer
EDL	01:35:08,583	01:35:11,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	yourself do you dream about non-existent
EDL	01:35:11,166	01:35:12,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	technologies
EDL	01:35:12,416	01:35:14,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	not yet hear technologies that you wish
EDL	01:35:14,375	01:35:18,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	were real things yeah well
EDL	01:35:18,583	01:35:20,291	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you know right now
EDL	01:35:20,291	01:35:21,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	time travel
EDL	01:35:21,541	01:35:24,125	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	or maybe slowing time down
EDL	01:35:24,125	01:35:25,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	there's so much
EDL	01:35:25,708	01:35:27,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that i want to do
EDL	01:35:27,000	01:35:28,916	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	and you know sometimes it's at work
EDL	01:35:28,916	01:35:31,000	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	sometimes it's it's being at home with
EDL	01:35:31,000	01:35:32,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	the family sometimes it's it's going and
EDL	01:35:32,666	01:35:34,416	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	doing other things and there's just not
EDL	01:35:34,416	01:35:36,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	enough time that would be it
EDL	01:35:36,833	01:35:38,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	right so that would be a technology that
EDL	01:35:38,666	01:35:40,833	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	would kind of end the lament(抱怨) that we all
EDL	01:35:40,833	01:35:43,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	have you know so many books not enough
EDL	01:35:43,625	01:35:45,958	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	time you know so so many careers to
EDL	01:35:45,958	01:35:47,541	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	pursue not enough somebody might want to
EDL	01:35:47,541	01:35:49,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	climb not enough time gordon i think if
EDL	01:35:49,333	01:35:50,583	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	you can actually solve that problem
EDL	01:35:50,583	01:35:52,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that's the one you will be most uh
EDL	01:35:52,375	01:35:54,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	remembered for though i don't think
EDL	01:35:54,375	01:35:55,708	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	that's going to be a darpa program as
EDL	01:35:55,708	01:35:57,250	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	far as i know who knows
EDL	01:35:57,250	01:35:59,166	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	but you might be able to pitch that to
EDL	01:35:59,166	01:36:01,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	close i just want to thank you for
