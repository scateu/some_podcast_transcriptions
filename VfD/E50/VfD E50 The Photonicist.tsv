EDL	00:00:41,040	00:00:43,748	| VfD_E50 |	my name is ivan amato and I'm your DARPA host 

EDL	00:00:43,748	00:00:45,360	| VfD_E50 |	Today I am pleased to be talking
EDL	00:00:45,360	00:00:48,719	| VfD_E50 |	with dr gordon keeler gordon who knew he
EDL	00:00:48,719	00:00:50,320	| VfD_E50 |	wanted to be a scientist by the time he
EDL	00:00:50,320	00:00:52,640	| VfD_E50 |	was in second grade joined DARPA as a
EDL	00:00:52,640	00:00:54,320	| VfD_E50 |	program manager in the agency's
EDL	00:00:54,320	00:00:58,320	| VfD_E50 |	microsystems technology office in 2017.
EDL	00:00:58,320	00:01:00,640	| VfD_E50 |	his work is all about exquisite control

EDL	00:01:18,560	00:01:21,119	| VfD_E50 |	technologies we have had in hand before

EDL	00:01:21,119	00:01:23,360	| VfD_E50 |	to me his deliverables represent a
EDL	00:01:23,360	00:01:25,040	| VfD_E50 |	pinnacle of the entire history of
EDL	00:01:25,040	00:01:27,360	| VfD_E50 |	technology prior to joining DARPA gordon
EDL	00:01:27,360	00:01:31,280	| VfD_E50 |	spent 14 years at the department of energy's sandia national laboratories in

EDL	00:02:11,802	00:02:12,959	| VfD_E50 |	Dr gordon killer thanks for
EDL	00:02:12,959	00:02:14,879	| VfD_E50 |	making some time to talk with me today
EDL	00:02:14,879	00:02:16,720	| VfD_E50 |	about your ongoing adventure in
EDL	00:02:16,720	00:02:17,913	| VfD_E50 |	technology development 
EDL	00:02:17,913	00:02:19,587	| VfD_E50 |	Thanks ivan it's great to be here 

EDL	00:02:19,587	00:02:21,680	| VfD_E50 |	I always love to hear
EDL	00:02:21,680	00:02:23,599	| VfD_E50 |	about the origin story of a person's
EDL	00:02:23,599	00:02:25,360	| VfD_E50 |	interests and I think listeners do too
EDL	00:02:25,360	00:02:27,840	| VfD_E50 |	especially when uh those interests are
EDL	00:02:27,840	00:02:30,080	| VfD_E50 |	hyper-specialized in the eyes of most
EDL	00:02:30,080	00:02:31,440	| VfD_E50 |	people I mean I think we agree most
EDL	00:02:31,440	00:02:32,959	| VfD_E50 |	people probably never even heard the
EDL	00:02:32,959	00:02:35,920	| VfD_E50 |	term opto electronics uh you told me in
EDL	00:02:35,920	00:02:37,760	| VfD_E50 |	earlier correspondence that both your
EDL	00:02:37,760	00:02:39,440	| VfD_E50 |	father and mother got you going in the
EDL	00:02:39,440	00:02:41,599	| VfD_E50 |	science and engineering directions uh
EDL	00:02:41,599	00:02:44,000	| VfD_E50 |	that you would ultimately take. So I'm
EDL	00:02:44,000	00:02:45,360	| VfD_E50 |	hoping you might share with us a little
EDL	00:02:45,360	00:02:47,040	| VfD_E50 |	bit about what it was like what kind of
EDL	00:02:47,040	00:02:49,120	| VfD_E50 |	encouragement you got in your childhood
EDL	00:02:49,120	00:02:51,519	| VfD_E50 |	household and then also what other
EDL	00:02:51,519	00:02:54,640	| VfD_E50 |	influences you think of when you might
EDL	00:02:54,640	00:02:56,879	| VfD_E50 |	explain why you think the way you do
EDL	00:02:56,879	00:02:58,400	| VfD_E50 |	think now.

EDL	00:02:58,400	00:03:00,400	| VfD_E50 |	sure well I grew up in Canada like you
EDL	00:03:00,400	00:03:02,319	| VfD_E50 |	mentioned in in a relatively small town
EDL	00:03:02,319	00:03:05,440	| VfD_E50 |	my parents really both loved exposing us
EDL	00:03:05,440	00:03:07,040	| VfD_E50 |	as kids to lots of different things so I
EDL	00:03:07,040	00:03:09,840	| VfD_E50 |	was busy you know doing sports and music
EDL	00:03:09,840	00:03:12,080	| VfD_E50 |	but I really loved academics my mom was
EDL	00:03:12,080	00:03:15,440	| VfD_E50 |	a teacher and a librarian and a nurse my
EDL	00:03:15,440	00:03:17,920	| VfD_E50 |	dad was a university physics professor
EDL	00:03:17,920	00:03:20,239	| VfD_E50 |	and so you know academics was sort of
EDL	00:03:20,239	00:03:22,640	| VfD_E50 |	really important in our family as far as
EDL	00:03:22,640	00:03:23,920	| VfD_E50 |	science
EDL	00:03:23,920	00:03:25,680	| VfD_E50 |	I really loved problem solving when I
EDL	00:03:25,680	00:03:27,519	| VfD_E50 |	was a kid and I also liked building
EDL	00:03:27,519	00:03:28,720	| VfD_E50 |	things
EDL	00:03:28,720	00:03:31,120	| VfD_E50 |	when I was little I used lego blocks and
EDL	00:03:31,120	00:03:33,360	| VfD_E50 |	as I got bigger I used meccano which
EDL	00:03:33,360	00:03:36,480	| VfD_E50 |	here we call erector set and so you know
EDL	00:03:36,480	00:03:39,440	| VfD_E50 |	tiny little uh nuts and bolts and
EDL	00:03:39,440	00:03:41,519	| VfD_E50 |	putting things together was sort of my
EDL	00:03:41,519	00:03:43,760	| VfD_E50 |	my specialty and really that's sort of
EDL	00:03:43,760	00:03:45,599	| VfD_E50 |	what my career looks like I I do a lot
EDL	00:03:45,599	00:03:48,000	| VfD_E50 |	of problem solving and building tiny
EDL	00:03:48,000	00:03:49,280	| VfD_E50 |	little things
EDL	00:03:49,280	00:03:50,879	| VfD_E50 |	yeah fascinating to think about the
EDL	00:03:50,879	00:03:52,879	| VfD_E50 |	erector sets which you know had
EDL	00:03:52,879	00:03:54,879	| VfD_E50 |	macroscopic parts and you could actually
EDL	00:03:54,879	00:03:57,040	| VfD_E50 |	manipulate them with your hands and and
EDL	00:03:57,040	00:03:58,319	| VfD_E50 |	when I think of the
EDL	00:03:58,319	00:03:59,920	| VfD_E50 |	the devices and the parts that you're
EDL	00:03:59,920	00:04:02,319	| VfD_E50 |	working with now on the micrometer and
EDL	00:04:02,319	00:04:04,239	| VfD_E50 |	smaller scales it's just kind of
EDL	00:04:04,239	00:04:05,519	| VfD_E50 |	astonishing
EDL	00:04:05,519	00:04:07,120	| VfD_E50 |	now you spent
EDL	00:04:07,120	00:04:09,280	| VfD_E50 |	14 years at
EDL	00:04:09,280	00:04:12,080	| VfD_E50 |	sandia you know one of our national labs
EDL	00:04:12,080	00:04:13,120	| VfD_E50 |	and I
EDL	00:04:13,120	00:04:14,400	| VfD_E50 |	would guess that
EDL	00:04:14,400	00:04:16,079	| VfD_E50 |	while there and maybe even before you
EDL	00:04:16,079	00:04:18,880	| VfD_E50 |	had heard about darba but uh I also do
EDL	00:04:18,880	00:04:22,479	| VfD_E50 |	like to share with listeners the how did
EDL	00:04:22,479	00:04:24,560	| VfD_E50 |	this particular program manager get to
EDL	00:04:24,560	00:04:27,680	| VfD_E50 |	DARPA story and so what's that story for
EDL	00:04:27,680	00:04:29,600	| VfD_E50 |	you was it somebody you knew at DARPA
EDL	00:04:29,600	00:04:32,160	| VfD_E50 |	did you in a sense let DARPA know about
EDL	00:04:32,160	00:04:33,520	| VfD_E50 |	you and your interest how did you get
EDL	00:04:33,520	00:04:35,600	| VfD_E50 |	here yeah you know it's a little bit of
EDL	00:04:35,600	00:04:37,440	| VfD_E50 |	all of those back when I was in grad
EDL	00:04:37,440	00:04:39,520	| VfD_E50 |	school I actually worked on on DARPA
EDL	00:04:39,520	00:04:41,120	| VfD_E50 |	programs I guess that was my first
EDL	00:04:41,120	00:04:43,280	| VfD_E50 |	introduction but then I got to sandia I
EDL	00:04:43,280	00:04:44,400	| VfD_E50 |	worked on a lot of different
EDL	00:04:44,400	00:04:46,400	| VfD_E50 |	technologies in this
EDL	00:04:46,400	00:04:49,440	| VfD_E50 |	optical microsystem space and I was
EDL	00:04:49,440	00:04:51,360	| VfD_E50 |	there for like you said 14 years with my
EDL	00:04:51,360	00:04:52,800	| VfD_E50 |	wife who also
EDL	00:04:52,800	00:04:54,720	| VfD_E50 |	studied applied physics and did a lot of
EDL	00:04:54,720	00:04:57,520	| VfD_E50 |	building of small things I got a call
EDL	00:04:57,520	00:05:00,639	| VfD_E50 |	from the mto microsystem technology
EDL	00:05:00,639	00:05:03,280	| VfD_E50 |	front office saying that the director
EDL	00:05:03,280	00:05:05,680	| VfD_E50 |	wanted to to talk to me and I thought
EDL	00:05:05,680	00:05:07,840	| VfD_E50 |	well that's interesting he's probably
EDL	00:05:07,840	00:05:09,680	| VfD_E50 |	looking for a reference for somebody
EDL	00:05:09,680	00:05:11,199	| VfD_E50 |	that I work with
EDL	00:05:11,199	00:05:13,440	| VfD_E50 |	who's looking to move to DARPA
EDL	00:05:13,440	00:05:14,560	| VfD_E50 |	and
EDL	00:05:14,560	00:05:16,400	| VfD_E50 |	it turns out no actually they had seen
EDL	00:05:16,400	00:05:17,680	| VfD_E50 |	some of the work that I was doing and
EDL	00:05:17,680	00:05:19,120	| VfD_E50 |	they wanted to know if I wanted to come
EDL	00:05:19,120	00:05:21,280	| VfD_E50 |	to DARPA which you know I was very
EDL	00:05:21,280	00:05:23,039	| VfD_E50 |	familiar with DARPA but hadn't really
EDL	00:05:23,039	00:05:24,720	| VfD_E50 |	thought about coming to be a program
EDL	00:05:24,720	00:05:26,720	| VfD_E50 |	manager but you know given that
EDL	00:05:26,720	00:05:29,039	| VfD_E50 |	opportunity I thought about it really
EDL	00:05:29,039	00:05:31,440	| VfD_E50 |	hard really quick in fact we had to make
EDL	00:05:31,440	00:05:33,280	| VfD_E50 |	a decision pretty fast
EDL	00:05:33,280	00:05:35,360	| VfD_E50 |	and came out and interviewed and and
EDL	00:05:35,360	00:05:37,680	| VfD_E50 |	things things moved quick picked up the
EDL	00:05:37,680	00:05:39,840	| VfD_E50 |	family and moved out of new mexico and
EDL	00:05:39,840	00:05:42,000	| VfD_E50 |	came out to the east coast so I've been
EDL	00:05:42,000	00:05:44,960	| VfD_E50 |	at DARPA since 2017. so that's a big
EDL	00:05:44,960	00:05:46,240	| VfD_E50 |	decision I mean one thing that always
EDL	00:05:46,240	00:05:48,639	| VfD_E50 |	amazes me about program managers
EDL	00:05:48,639	00:05:51,039	| VfD_E50 |	is that you know you come in knowing
EDL	00:05:51,039	00:05:52,560	| VfD_E50 |	that this is not
EDL	00:05:52,560	00:05:54,639	| VfD_E50 |	almost certainly not a lifelong
EDL	00:05:54,639	00:05:56,560	| VfD_E50 |	appointment you know in fact
EDL	00:05:56,560	00:05:58,479	| VfD_E50 |	you know one of the pieces of the secret
EDL	00:05:58,479	00:05:59,600	| VfD_E50 |	sauce one of the ingredients of the
EDL	00:05:59,600	00:06:01,520	| VfD_E50 |	secret sauce of the organization is that
EDL	00:06:01,520	00:06:02,720	| VfD_E50 |	you know you come in knowing that you're
EDL	00:06:02,720	00:06:04,080	| VfD_E50 |	just going to be here for three four
EDL	00:06:04,080	00:06:05,759	| VfD_E50 |	five years that sort of thing some
EDL	00:06:05,759	00:06:07,120	| VfD_E50 |	people do of course come back for second
EDL	00:06:07,120	00:06:09,759	| VfD_E50 |	tours of duty later but tell me just a
EDL	00:06:09,759	00:06:10,960	| VfD_E50 |	little bit about
EDL	00:06:10,960	00:06:13,280	| VfD_E50 |	you know why you had so much confidence
EDL	00:06:13,280	00:06:15,759	| VfD_E50 |	and sort of excitement about coming to
EDL	00:06:15,759	00:06:17,759	| VfD_E50 |	DARPA that you were willing to leave a
EDL	00:06:17,759	00:06:19,199	| VfD_E50 |	place you'd been for 14 years and then
EDL	00:06:19,199	00:06:20,560	| VfD_E50 |	go to one where you might only be there
EDL	00:06:20,560	00:06:22,240	| VfD_E50 |	for a few years
EDL	00:06:22,240	00:06:24,160	| VfD_E50 |	yeah it's a great question I had no
EDL	00:06:24,160	00:06:27,600	| VfD_E50 |	doubt really in my mind DARPA was was
EDL	00:06:27,600	00:06:30,240	| VfD_E50 |	clearly sort of the pinnacle of doing
EDL	00:06:30,240	00:06:31,440	| VfD_E50 |	innovative
EDL	00:06:31,440	00:06:34,560	| VfD_E50 |	scientific research and development and
EDL	00:06:34,560	00:06:36,240	| VfD_E50 |	leading the community to go do new
EDL	00:06:36,240	00:06:39,520	| VfD_E50 |	things that had always been my passion
EDL	00:06:39,520	00:06:42,319	| VfD_E50 |	and I didn't go into science and
EDL	00:06:42,319	00:06:45,680	| VfD_E50 |	technology for a a stable long-term
EDL	00:06:45,680	00:06:48,000	| VfD_E50 |	job at one place I wanted to make an
EDL	00:06:48,000	00:06:50,240	| VfD_E50 |	impact and DARPA was clearly the way to
EDL	00:06:50,240	00:06:51,280	| VfD_E50 |	do that
EDL	00:06:51,280	00:06:54,160	| VfD_E50 |	what comes next we don't really know but
EDL	00:06:54,160	00:06:56,240	| VfD_E50 |	I feel like my life has been this series
EDL	00:06:56,240	00:06:59,039	| VfD_E50 |	of fortunate events that kind of stack
EDL	00:06:59,039	00:07:00,880	| VfD_E50 |	up and and I'm sure there'll be great
EDL	00:07:00,880	00:07:03,440	| VfD_E50 |	opportunities after I'm done here
EDL	00:07:03,440	00:07:06,080	| VfD_E50 |	well may that good fortune continue
EDL	00:07:06,080	00:07:08,960	| VfD_E50 |	so gordon now let's dive into your
EDL	00:07:08,960	00:07:11,840	| VfD_E50 |	portfolio of programs when I look at the
EDL	00:07:11,840	00:07:13,680	| VfD_E50 |	half dozen or so of the programs you you
EDL	00:07:13,680	00:07:15,599	| VfD_E50 |	have taken on I think one of them has
EDL	00:07:15,599	00:07:17,759	| VfD_E50 |	gone to completion that they're
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,479	| VfD_E50 |	thematically connected in several ways
EDL	00:07:20,479	00:07:23,039	| VfD_E50 |	one of them has to do with the design
EDL	00:07:23,039	00:07:25,039	| VfD_E50 |	and integration of micro devices that
EDL	00:07:25,039	00:07:27,680	| VfD_E50 |	manipulate and manage electrons and
EDL	00:07:27,680	00:07:30,080	| VfD_E50 |	photons but also connecting all of the
EDL	00:07:30,080	00:07:32,000	| VfD_E50 |	technology work that you're doing is is
EDL	00:07:32,000	00:07:34,080	| VfD_E50 |	a kind of another sort of technology
EDL	00:07:34,080	00:07:36,560	| VfD_E50 |	advancement that I've seen at DARPA can
EDL	00:07:36,560	00:07:39,520	| VfD_E50 |	be even more consequential than say an
EDL	00:07:39,520	00:07:41,440	| VfD_E50 |	initial invention and I'm talking here
EDL	00:07:41,440	00:07:44,560	| VfD_E50 |	about a term that we hear uh and you
EDL	00:07:44,560	00:07:46,960	| VfD_E50 |	hear in technology circles called c-swap
EDL	00:07:46,960	00:07:49,120	| VfD_E50 |	that's c-s-w-a-p
EDL	00:07:49,120	00:07:51,599	| VfD_E50 |	it refers to uh the challenge of taking
EDL	00:07:51,599	00:07:53,360	| VfD_E50 |	or transforming what originally are sort
EDL	00:07:53,360	00:07:55,120	| VfD_E50 |	of big expensive power hungry
EDL	00:07:55,120	00:07:57,440	| VfD_E50 |	technologies and making them smaller and
EDL	00:07:57,440	00:07:59,440	| VfD_E50 |	lighter and more energy efficient and
EDL	00:07:59,440	00:08:01,759	| VfD_E50 |	cheaper and this then opens them up to
EDL	00:08:01,759	00:08:04,400	| VfD_E50 |	kind of wider access because say they're
EDL	00:08:04,400	00:08:06,720	| VfD_E50 |	cheaper and not so unwieldy and
EDL	00:08:06,720	00:08:07,680	| VfD_E50 |	essentially you're taking something
EDL	00:08:07,680	00:08:09,520	| VfD_E50 |	that's impractical for many and making
EDL	00:08:09,520	00:08:10,879	| VfD_E50 |	it more practical
EDL	00:08:10,879	00:08:13,120	| VfD_E50 |	so it's those kind of two themes that I
EDL	00:08:13,120	00:08:13,919	| VfD_E50 |	see
EDL	00:08:13,919	00:08:16,080	| VfD_E50 |	and if you keep those in mind and
EDL	00:08:16,080	00:08:18,240	| VfD_E50 |	feel free to bring other themes in
EDL	00:08:18,240	00:08:19,440	| VfD_E50 |	as well
EDL	00:08:19,440	00:08:21,520	| VfD_E50 |	take me and listeners on a tour of your
EDL	00:08:21,520	00:08:22,960	| VfD_E50 |	programs
EDL	00:08:22,960	00:08:24,800	| VfD_E50 |	sure yeah well the
EDL	00:08:24,800	00:08:26,879	| VfD_E50 |	the term c-swap that you you bring up
EDL	00:08:26,879	00:08:29,919	| VfD_E50 |	you know it stands for cost size weight
EDL	00:08:29,919	00:08:31,120	| VfD_E50 |	and power
EDL	00:08:31,120	00:08:33,919	| VfD_E50 |	and it really is a way to quantify
EDL	00:08:33,919	00:08:36,880	| VfD_E50 |	uh the benefits of miniaturization
EDL	00:08:36,880	00:08:37,760	| VfD_E50 |	and
EDL	00:08:37,760	00:08:39,440	| VfD_E50 |	if I look at the portfolio of programs
EDL	00:08:39,440	00:08:41,679	| VfD_E50 |	that I've got I'd say there's sort of
EDL	00:08:41,679	00:08:44,480	| VfD_E50 |	two big themes the first is
EDL	00:08:44,480	00:08:46,880	| VfD_E50 |	generally optical microsystems
EDL	00:08:46,880	00:08:49,760	| VfD_E50 |	and the idea being if we
EDL	00:08:49,760	00:08:51,920	| VfD_E50 |	build systems out of very small
EDL	00:08:51,920	00:08:53,040	| VfD_E50 |	components
EDL	00:08:53,040	00:08:55,120	| VfD_E50 |	integrate them together
EDL	00:08:55,120	00:08:56,880	| VfD_E50 |	then we can make them
EDL	00:08:56,880	00:08:59,760	| VfD_E50 |	low-cost make them mobile deploy them
EDL	00:08:59,760	00:09:02,640	| VfD_E50 |	all over and add new functionality
EDL	00:09:02,640	00:09:04,800	| VfD_E50 |	typically the way we do these optical
EDL	00:09:04,800	00:09:07,360	| VfD_E50 |	microsystems is through another thing
EDL	00:09:07,360	00:09:08,800	| VfD_E50 |	that's sort of a theme of my programs
EDL	00:09:08,800	00:09:11,200	| VfD_E50 |	which is heterogeneous integration
EDL	00:09:11,200	00:09:12,640	| VfD_E50 |	and that means different things to
EDL	00:09:12,640	00:09:14,640	| VfD_E50 |	different people but really it's about
EDL	00:09:14,640	00:09:16,560	| VfD_E50 |	bringing different materials
EDL	00:09:16,560	00:09:19,600	| VfD_E50 |	technologies and functions together into
EDL	00:09:19,600	00:09:20,240	| VfD_E50 |	a
EDL	00:09:20,240	00:09:22,959	| VfD_E50 |	really small package we often
EDL	00:09:22,959	00:09:25,440	| VfD_E50 |	think of many of these programs as
EDL	00:09:25,440	00:09:27,519	| VfD_E50 |	creating some sort of capability in the
EDL	00:09:27,519	00:09:29,839	| VfD_E50 |	size of a sugar cube rather than a beach
EDL	00:09:29,839	00:09:31,360	| VfD_E50 |	ball
EDL	00:09:31,360	00:09:34,320	| VfD_E50 |	one that goes back a ways is
EDL	00:09:34,320	00:09:36,480	| VfD_E50 |	moab let's start with that one
EDL	00:09:36,480	00:09:40,160	| VfD_E50 |	modular optical aperture building blocks
EDL	00:09:40,160	00:09:42,399	| VfD_E50 |	and I remember first encountering this
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,680	| VfD_E50 |	and thinking
EDL	00:09:43,680	00:09:46,000	| VfD_E50 |	a sort of this remarkable idea of taking
EDL	00:09:46,000	00:09:48,399	| VfD_E50 |	what might be a whole system of lenses
EDL	00:09:48,399	00:09:50,399	| VfD_E50 |	you know think of a telescope or
EDL	00:09:50,399	00:09:52,640	| VfD_E50 |	binoculars or those are more familiar
EDL	00:09:52,640	00:09:54,959	| VfD_E50 |	ones but then uh in a way flattening
EDL	00:09:54,959	00:09:57,360	| VfD_E50 |	those down all into into something like
EDL	00:09:57,360	00:09:59,279	| VfD_E50 |	a more integrated kind of optical system
EDL	00:09:59,279	00:10:00,959	| VfD_E50 |	that would be much less bulky than the
EDL	00:10:00,959	00:10:03,120	| VfD_E50 |	originals you inherited that right and
EDL	00:10:03,120	00:10:05,279	| VfD_E50 |	so tell me a little bit about
EDL	00:10:05,279	00:10:06,959	| VfD_E50 |	what you got where you took it and where
EDL	00:10:06,959	00:10:08,240	| VfD_E50 |	it's at now
EDL	00:10:08,240	00:10:10,000	| VfD_E50 |	yeah great so moab was one of the
EDL	00:10:10,000	00:10:12,800	| VfD_E50 |	programs that I inherited back in 2017
EDL	00:10:12,800	00:10:14,959	| VfD_E50 |	when I arrived at DARPA it's a great
EDL	00:10:14,959	00:10:17,600	| VfD_E50 |	example of this optical micro system
EDL	00:10:17,600	00:10:19,440	| VfD_E50 |	integration concept
EDL	00:10:19,440	00:10:22,640	| VfD_E50 |	and the idea is that most of the lidars
EDL	00:10:22,640	00:10:25,519	| VfD_E50 |	that we build today this is a laser for
EDL	00:10:25,519	00:10:28,560	| VfD_E50 |	3d ranging it's become really exciting
EDL	00:10:28,560	00:10:30,839	| VfD_E50 |	and enabling for autonomous vehicle
EDL	00:10:30,839	00:10:33,600	| VfD_E50 |	navigation also used on on your phone
EDL	00:10:33,600	00:10:36,399	| VfD_E50 |	perhaps to recognize you so typically
EDL	00:10:36,399	00:10:38,480	| VfD_E50 |	lidar systems that we use in in the
EDL	00:10:38,480	00:10:40,959	| VfD_E50 |	military are large systems they have a
EDL	00:10:40,959	00:10:43,200	| VfD_E50 |	telescope they have a gimbal
EDL	00:10:43,200	00:10:45,040	| VfD_E50 |	and they're hand assembled
EDL	00:10:45,040	00:10:47,600	| VfD_E50 |	right and so they tend to be big slow
EDL	00:10:47,600	00:10:48,880	| VfD_E50 |	expensive
EDL	00:10:48,880	00:10:51,839	| VfD_E50 |	and so moab is a program that looks to
EDL	00:10:51,839	00:10:54,560	| VfD_E50 |	shrink all of that down onto a chip
EDL	00:10:54,560	00:10:56,720	| VfD_E50 |	sort of like a postage stamp
EDL	00:10:56,720	00:10:58,079	| VfD_E50 |	non-mechanical
EDL	00:10:58,079	00:11:01,040	| VfD_E50 |	optical beam steering particularly for
EDL	00:11:01,040	00:11:03,200	| VfD_E50 |	for lidar and other kinds of optical
EDL	00:11:03,200	00:11:04,399	| VfD_E50 |	techniques
EDL	00:11:04,399	00:11:05,360	| VfD_E50 |	and
EDL	00:11:05,360	00:11:07,120	| VfD_E50 |	a lot of this is done through
EDL	00:11:07,120	00:11:09,120	| VfD_E50 |	integrated photonics which allows you to
EDL	00:11:09,120	00:11:11,120	| VfD_E50 |	take discrete
EDL	00:11:11,120	00:11:13,920	| VfD_E50 |	optical functions like modulators or
EDL	00:11:13,920	00:11:15,760	| VfD_E50 |	lasers detectors
EDL	00:11:15,760	00:11:18,399	| VfD_E50 |	and put them into sort of micro scale
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,000	| VfD_E50 |	and then assemble them together onto a
EDL	00:11:20,000	00:11:21,839	| VfD_E50 |	chip and maybe put thousands or tens of
EDL	00:11:21,839	00:11:24,000	| VfD_E50 |	thousands of components on a chip that
EDL	00:11:24,000	00:11:25,839	| VfD_E50 |	you manufacture in a semiconductor
EDL	00:11:25,839	00:11:28,079	| VfD_E50 |	foundry just like you do with integrated
EDL	00:11:28,079	00:11:29,760	| VfD_E50 |	circuits
EDL	00:11:29,760	00:11:32,399	| VfD_E50 |	the program is now in phase three has
EDL	00:11:32,399	00:11:33,519	| VfD_E50 |	made
EDL	00:11:33,519	00:11:36,240	| VfD_E50 |	enormous progress we've had many world
EDL	00:11:36,240	00:11:38,959	| VfD_E50 |	records over the last few years scaling
EDL	00:11:38,959	00:11:40,800	| VfD_E50 |	this technology and
EDL	00:11:40,800	00:11:43,760	| VfD_E50 |	now it's actually being flight tested
EDL	00:11:43,760	00:11:46,640	| VfD_E50 |	and shows a path for doing things on on
EDL	00:11:46,640	00:11:48,880	| VfD_E50 |	small uavs and other kinds of mobile
EDL	00:11:48,880	00:11:49,839	| VfD_E50 |	systems
EDL	00:11:49,839	00:11:52,160	| VfD_E50 |	okay and do you imagine that those kinds
EDL	00:11:52,160	00:11:54,000	| VfD_E50 |	of systems are the ones where this
EDL	00:11:54,000	00:11:55,839	| VfD_E50 |	technology will see at least its
EDL	00:11:55,839	00:11:58,079	| VfD_E50 |	widest initial application or do you
EDL	00:11:58,079	00:12:00,320	| VfD_E50 |	imagine also that there are some other
EDL	00:12:00,320	00:12:03,120	| VfD_E50 |	very big application areas down the line
EDL	00:12:03,120	00:12:05,040	| VfD_E50 |	yeah that's a good question and you know
EDL	00:12:05,040	00:12:06,800	| VfD_E50 |	I'd say that for most of the integrated
EDL	00:12:06,800	00:12:09,600	| VfD_E50 |	photonics technologies that we look at
EDL	00:12:09,600	00:12:13,440	| VfD_E50 |	there is a very large commercial driver
EDL	00:12:13,440	00:12:15,680	| VfD_E50 |	for most of the things that we pursue
EDL	00:12:15,680	00:12:16,880	| VfD_E50 |	and so
EDL	00:12:16,880	00:12:18,720	| VfD_E50 |	if you think about the the engineering
EDL	00:12:18,720	00:12:21,200	| VfD_E50 |	cost of creating something like moab
EDL	00:12:21,200	00:12:23,040	| VfD_E50 |	there's a whole lot of upfront
EDL	00:12:23,040	00:12:25,600	| VfD_E50 |	development cost
EDL	00:12:25,600	00:12:27,040	| VfD_E50 |	eventually though you get to the point
EDL	00:12:27,040	00:12:28,800	| VfD_E50 |	where you can
EDL	00:12:28,800	00:12:30,800	| VfD_E50 |	essentially stamp these
EDL	00:12:30,800	00:12:33,519	| VfD_E50 |	chips out in a foundry
EDL	00:12:33,519	00:12:34,480	| VfD_E50 |	and
EDL	00:12:34,480	00:12:36,160	| VfD_E50 |	it would allow you to scale these to
EDL	00:12:36,160	00:12:38,240	| VfD_E50 |	sort of millions or hundreds of millions
EDL	00:12:38,240	00:12:39,519	| VfD_E50 |	of units
EDL	00:12:39,519	00:12:40,480	| VfD_E50 |	where the
EDL	00:12:40,480	00:12:43,120	| VfD_E50 |	the unit price can be very low and so
EDL	00:12:43,120	00:12:46,480	| VfD_E50 |	for for moab the path there is for
EDL	00:12:46,480	00:12:49,519	| VfD_E50 |	commercial automotive where you can see
EDL	00:12:49,519	00:12:51,360	| VfD_E50 |	you know there are hundreds of millions
EDL	00:12:51,360	00:12:53,920	| VfD_E50 |	of cars every year that need
EDL	00:12:53,920	00:12:57,120	| VfD_E50 |	lidar systems that are small compact
EDL	00:12:57,120	00:12:59,519	| VfD_E50 |	and so moab might be good for the dod
EDL	00:12:59,519	00:13:02,240	| VfD_E50 |	initially and in certain uh cases but
EDL	00:13:02,240	00:13:04,639	| VfD_E50 |	also there's a path to commercialization
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:07,440	| VfD_E50 |	and helping the the broader community
EDL	00:13:07,440	00:13:09,279	| VfD_E50 |	very cool very cool so let me now move
EDL	00:13:09,279	00:13:11,920	| VfD_E50 |	to one another program that I've I've
EDL	00:13:11,920	00:13:14,160	| VfD_E50 |	known about for a while in fact I even
EDL	00:13:14,160	00:13:16,240	| VfD_E50 |	had met the programmator who started
EDL	00:13:16,240	00:13:18,480	| VfD_E50 |	that one dan green so I'm referring here
EDL	00:13:18,480	00:13:21,760	| VfD_E50 |	to chips which is common heterogeneous
EDL	00:13:21,760	00:13:25,440	| VfD_E50 |	integration and ip reuse strategies so
EDL	00:13:25,440	00:13:26,959	| VfD_E50 |	you don't have to actually parse all of
EDL	00:13:26,959	00:13:27,680	| VfD_E50 |	that
EDL	00:13:27,680	00:13:29,279	| VfD_E50 |	those words out there's probably an
EDL	00:13:29,279	00:13:31,440	| VfD_E50 |	easier way just to describe
EDL	00:13:31,440	00:13:33,040	| VfD_E50 |	what the goal of that program is and
EDL	00:13:33,040	00:13:36,480	| VfD_E50 |	where what its status is so chips is a a
EDL	00:13:36,480	00:13:40,320	| VfD_E50 |	program in our eri portfolio electronics
EDL	00:13:40,320	00:13:42,240	| VfD_E50 |	resurgence initiative this is a number
EDL	00:13:42,240	00:13:44,079	| VfD_E50 |	of programs that we're doing here in the
EDL	00:13:44,079	00:13:45,120	| VfD_E50 |	office
EDL	00:13:45,120	00:13:47,199	| VfD_E50 |	to help define what's next for
EDL	00:13:47,199	00:13:49,600	| VfD_E50 |	semiconductor microelectronics
EDL	00:13:49,600	00:13:50,720	| VfD_E50 |	and
EDL	00:13:50,720	00:13:52,399	| VfD_E50 |	chips came about because there is an
EDL	00:13:52,399	00:13:54,720	| VfD_E50 |	observation that you know as moore's law
EDL	00:13:54,720	00:13:55,920	| VfD_E50 |	goes on
EDL	00:13:55,920	00:13:57,680	| VfD_E50 |	and we can put more and more transistors
EDL	00:13:57,680	00:13:59,199	| VfD_E50 |	on a chip
EDL	00:13:59,199	00:14:01,839	| VfD_E50 |	both the cost of fabricating chips at
EDL	00:14:01,839	00:14:03,120	| VfD_E50 |	advanced nodes
EDL	00:14:03,120	00:14:05,760	| VfD_E50 |	and designing them essentially puts the
EDL	00:14:05,760	00:14:08,000	| VfD_E50 |	newest technology out of reach for both
EDL	00:14:08,000	00:14:10,399	| VfD_E50 |	the military and for sort of moderate or
EDL	00:14:10,399	00:14:12,560	| VfD_E50 |	small commercial uses
EDL	00:14:12,560	00:14:14,079	| VfD_E50 |	if you think about
EDL	00:14:14,079	00:14:17,680	| VfD_E50 |	say the most advanced gpus or cpus built
EDL	00:14:17,680	00:14:19,839	| VfD_E50 |	by big microelectronics companies and
EDL	00:14:19,839	00:14:21,839	| VfD_E50 |	those are central processing units and
EDL	00:14:21,839	00:14:23,839	| VfD_E50 |	graphics processing units yep that's
EDL	00:14:23,839	00:14:25,600	| VfD_E50 |	right if you think about these they
EDL	00:14:25,600	00:14:27,519	| VfD_E50 |	might cost a couple of hundred dollars
EDL	00:14:27,519	00:14:28,320	| VfD_E50 |	each
EDL	00:14:28,320	00:14:30,240	| VfD_E50 |	but the design time that goes into them
EDL	00:14:30,240	00:14:31,360	| VfD_E50 |	it can be
EDL	00:14:31,360	00:14:34,399	| VfD_E50 |	thousands of engineering years
EDL	00:14:34,399	00:14:36,160	| VfD_E50 |	and so you know if you want to put
EDL	00:14:36,160	00:14:38,639	| VfD_E50 |	something on a on an aircraft we can't
EDL	00:14:38,639	00:14:41,440	| VfD_E50 |	afford to do that every time so instead
EDL	00:14:41,440	00:14:43,760	| VfD_E50 |	chips takes a modular approach
EDL	00:14:43,760	00:14:45,600	| VfD_E50 |	essentially a chiplet integration
EDL	00:14:45,600	00:14:48,079	| VfD_E50 |	approach where you don't need to create
EDL	00:14:48,079	00:14:49,680	| VfD_E50 |	a full
EDL	00:14:49,680	00:14:52,160	| VfD_E50 |	asic or application specific integrated
EDL	00:14:52,160	00:14:54,720	| VfD_E50 |	circuit from the ground up every time
EDL	00:14:54,720	00:14:57,120	| VfD_E50 |	instead you can compose a system out of
EDL	00:14:57,120	00:14:58,560	| VfD_E50 |	smaller pieces
EDL	00:14:58,560	00:15:00,480	| VfD_E50 |	where you really only have to create
EDL	00:15:00,480	00:15:03,440	| VfD_E50 |	maybe a couple small capabilities like
EDL	00:15:03,440	00:15:05,440	| VfD_E50 |	say a machine learning accelerator
EDL	00:15:05,440	00:15:08,639	| VfD_E50 |	chiplet or an rf radio frequency front
EDL	00:15:08,639	00:15:09,920	| VfD_E50 |	end chip
EDL	00:15:09,920	00:15:11,680	| VfD_E50 |	and then assemble it with other things
EDL	00:15:11,680	00:15:14,000	| VfD_E50 |	that are that are also in the the chips
EDL	00:15:14,000	00:15:16,880	| VfD_E50 |	library and put it in a package in fact
EDL	00:15:16,880	00:15:18,720	| VfD_E50 |	chips has been a great success it
EDL	00:15:18,720	00:15:21,199	| VfD_E50 |	actually has transitioned over to osd
EDL	00:15:21,199	00:15:22,560	| VfD_E50 |	where they have
EDL	00:15:22,560	00:15:23,440	| VfD_E50 |	made a
EDL	00:15:23,440	00:15:25,199	| VfD_E50 |	much bigger investment in the in the
EDL	00:15:25,199	00:15:27,279	| VfD_E50 |	navy ship program
EDL	00:15:27,279	00:15:29,680	| VfD_E50 |	to try and make this a commercial
EDL	00:15:29,680	00:15:31,120	| VfD_E50 |	reality
EDL	00:15:31,120	00:15:33,120	| VfD_E50 |	and I will just remind readers that osd
EDL	00:15:33,120	00:15:35,199	| VfD_E50 |	stands for the office of the secretary
EDL	00:15:35,199	00:15:36,720	| VfD_E50 |	of defense
EDL	00:15:36,720	00:15:38,480	| VfD_E50 |	now as we continue the tour of your
EDL	00:15:38,480	00:15:41,600	| VfD_E50 |	programs let's move to pipes which
EDL	00:15:41,600	00:15:44,079	| VfD_E50 |	stands for photonics in the package for
EDL	00:15:44,079	00:15:47,120	| VfD_E50 |	extreme scalability pipes is actually a
EDL	00:15:47,120	00:15:48,959	| VfD_E50 |	really exciting program for me and it's
EDL	00:15:48,959	00:15:51,519	| VfD_E50 |	the first one I started at DARPA pypes
EDL	00:15:51,519	00:15:53,279	| VfD_E50 |	is a program that is
EDL	00:15:53,279	00:15:55,360	| VfD_E50 |	about a technology called optical
EDL	00:15:55,360	00:15:56,720	| VfD_E50 |	interconnects
EDL	00:15:56,720	00:15:59,360	| VfD_E50 |	and that really means the technologies
EDL	00:15:59,360	00:16:02,399	| VfD_E50 |	that you would use to
EDL	00:16:02,399	00:16:04,720	| VfD_E50 |	send data from one ship to another with
EDL	00:16:04,720	00:16:07,120	| VfD_E50 |	photons rather than electrons
EDL	00:16:07,120	00:16:08,720	| VfD_E50 |	now I started
EDL	00:16:08,720	00:16:10,639	| VfD_E50 |	working on DARPA programs back in in
EDL	00:16:10,639	00:16:12,480	| VfD_E50 |	grad school at stanford with professor
EDL	00:16:12,480	00:16:14,399	| VfD_E50 |	david miller who was an expert at
EDL	00:16:14,399	00:16:16,320	| VfD_E50 |	optical interconnects
EDL	00:16:16,320	00:16:18,240	| VfD_E50 |	optical interconnects were seen as sort
EDL	00:16:18,240	00:16:21,160	| VfD_E50 |	of the future for microelectronics but
EDL	00:16:21,160	00:16:23,839	| VfD_E50 |	microelectronics kept moving forward
EDL	00:16:23,839	00:16:26,240	| VfD_E50 |	without optics for a long time having
EDL	00:16:26,240	00:16:28,079	| VfD_E50 |	said that we've now gotten to a point
EDL	00:16:28,079	00:16:30,639	| VfD_E50 |	where moore's law has sort of put us
EDL	00:16:30,639	00:16:33,199	| VfD_E50 |	into a corner we can do more and more
EDL	00:16:33,199	00:16:35,519	| VfD_E50 |	transistors and compute on a chip but
EDL	00:16:35,519	00:16:37,440	| VfD_E50 |	the wiring or essentially the technology
EDL	00:16:37,440	00:16:39,759	| VfD_E50 |	to move data around doesn't really get
EDL	00:16:39,759	00:16:42,160	| VfD_E50 |	better as you shrink it down
EDL	00:16:42,160	00:16:44,160	| VfD_E50 |	so you've got this bottleneck where you
EDL	00:16:44,160	00:16:46,160	| VfD_E50 |	create all of this data on chip but you
EDL	00:16:46,160	00:16:47,839	| VfD_E50 |	can't move it from one place to another
EDL	00:16:47,839	00:16:50,320	| VfD_E50 |	very efficiently and we've reached a
EDL	00:16:50,320	00:16:52,560	| VfD_E50 |	problem where we're both bottlenecked in
EDL	00:16:52,560	00:16:55,440	| VfD_E50 |	terms of total capacity and the energy
EDL	00:16:55,440	00:16:57,440	| VfD_E50 |	that we use to move data becomes
EDL	00:16:57,440	00:16:59,360	| VfD_E50 |	enormous and and sort of dominates our
EDL	00:16:59,360	00:17:00,480	| VfD_E50 |	system
EDL	00:17:00,480	00:17:02,320	| VfD_E50 |	so instead we have to turn to a
EDL	00:17:02,320	00:17:04,640	| VfD_E50 |	different solution and optics is that
EDL	00:17:04,640	00:17:05,679	| VfD_E50 |	solution
EDL	00:17:05,679	00:17:08,319	| VfD_E50 |	if you think about the internet or data
EDL	00:17:08,319	00:17:11,439	| VfD_E50 |	centers right we've already used
EDL	00:17:11,439	00:17:13,919	| VfD_E50 |	fiber optics to move data around for a
EDL	00:17:13,919	00:17:16,079	| VfD_E50 |	long time 20 or 30 years
EDL	00:17:16,079	00:17:18,720	| VfD_E50 |	and this has gotten meaningful at a
EDL	00:17:18,720	00:17:21,520	| VfD_E50 |	shorter scale as we go forward
EDL	00:17:21,520	00:17:24,240	| VfD_E50 |	pypes is looking to integrate photonics
EDL	00:17:24,240	00:17:25,839	| VfD_E50 |	into the package like it says in the
EDL	00:17:25,839	00:17:28,319	| VfD_E50 |	title for advanced
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:31,120	| VfD_E50 |	microelectronic systems like cpus and
EDL	00:17:31,120	00:17:33,280	| VfD_E50 |	gpus which you defined before or or
EDL	00:17:33,280	00:17:36,400	| VfD_E50 |	reconfigurable processors like fpgas
EDL	00:17:36,400	00:17:38,720	| VfD_E50 |	which are field programmable gate arrays
EDL	00:17:38,720	00:17:41,520	| VfD_E50 |	fpgas can be really powerful chips but
EDL	00:17:41,520	00:17:42,880	| VfD_E50 |	out of the box they don't really do
EDL	00:17:42,880	00:17:44,000	| VfD_E50 |	anything
EDL	00:17:44,000	00:17:45,600	| VfD_E50 |	they're meant to be programmed by the
EDL	00:17:45,600	00:17:48,080	| VfD_E50 |	customer and so they can really be
EDL	00:17:48,080	00:17:50,080	| VfD_E50 |	applied to different scenarios different
EDL	00:17:50,080	00:17:52,559	| VfD_E50 |	applications this makes it a really good
EDL	00:17:52,559	00:17:54,960	| VfD_E50 |	application for the pipes program and so
EDL	00:17:54,960	00:17:57,280	| VfD_E50 |	the program has a number of performers
EDL	00:17:57,280	00:17:59,440	| VfD_E50 |	they all have very challenging metrics
EDL	00:17:59,440	00:18:02,080	| VfD_E50 |	given that this this field is is
EDL	00:18:02,080	00:18:04,640	| VfD_E50 |	relatively uh mature
EDL	00:18:04,640	00:18:06,400	| VfD_E50 |	so we're pushing
EDL	00:18:06,400	00:18:08,160	| VfD_E50 |	intel and xilinx two of our bigger
EDL	00:18:08,160	00:18:10,880	| VfD_E50 |	performers to put photonics into their
EDL	00:18:10,880	00:18:13,280	| VfD_E50 |	most advanced fpgas they've actually had
EDL	00:18:13,280	00:18:15,120	| VfD_E50 |	great success we're just moving into
EDL	00:18:15,120	00:18:16,240	| VfD_E50 |	phase two
EDL	00:18:16,240	00:18:17,679	| VfD_E50 |	and then we have a number of smaller
EDL	00:18:17,679	00:18:20,160	| VfD_E50 |	companies and academics
EDL	00:18:20,160	00:18:21,840	| VfD_E50 |	working to really improve the the
EDL	00:18:21,840	00:18:23,760	| VfD_E50 |	underlying technologies the integration
EDL	00:18:23,760	00:18:25,120	| VfD_E50 |	the circuits
EDL	00:18:25,120	00:18:27,600	| VfD_E50 |	the photonic components themselves
EDL	00:18:27,600	00:18:29,200	| VfD_E50 |	to help us
EDL	00:18:29,200	00:18:31,039	| VfD_E50 |	as you go forward in time so sort of
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:32,880	| VfD_E50 |	five or ten years out these technologies
EDL	00:18:32,880	00:18:35,360	| VfD_E50 |	are going to be particularly important
EDL	00:18:35,360	00:18:37,280	| VfD_E50 |	right and there are so many interesting
EDL	00:18:37,280	00:18:38,960	| VfD_E50 |	technical questions I could ask I'm just
EDL	00:18:38,960	00:18:40,799	| VfD_E50 |	going to sort of go to one just to give
EDL	00:18:40,799	00:18:42,160	| VfD_E50 |	a flavor of the kinds of challenges
EDL	00:18:42,160	00:18:43,360	| VfD_E50 |	you're dealing with you know so like
EDL	00:18:43,360	00:18:45,760	| VfD_E50 |	with optical fiber technology I mean
EDL	00:18:45,760	00:18:47,679	| VfD_E50 |	that all emerged out of out of really
EDL	00:18:47,679	00:18:50,320	| VfD_E50 |	kind of specialty incredibly pure
EDL	00:18:50,320	00:18:52,480	| VfD_E50 |	you know glass I mean that's glass
EDL	00:18:52,480	00:18:54,799	| VfD_E50 |	technology uh here when you talk about
EDL	00:18:54,799	00:18:56,480	| VfD_E50 |	optical interconnects and photonic
EDL	00:18:56,480	00:18:58,960	| VfD_E50 |	components I mean just give us a
EDL	00:18:58,960	00:19:01,280	| VfD_E50 |	just a real short sense of what kinds of
EDL	00:19:01,280	00:19:02,880	| VfD_E50 |	materials that you're actually talking
EDL	00:19:02,880	00:19:05,280	| VfD_E50 |	about sure so we're talking about many
EDL	00:19:05,280	00:19:06,960	| VfD_E50 |	materials but
EDL	00:19:06,960	00:19:09,120	| VfD_E50 |	usually they're at the chip scale and so
EDL	00:19:09,120	00:19:11,120	| VfD_E50 |	we have compound semiconductors like
EDL	00:19:11,120	00:19:13,520	| VfD_E50 |	gallium arsenide or indium phosphide
EDL	00:19:13,520	00:19:15,600	| VfD_E50 |	often integrated with silicon where
EDL	00:19:15,600	00:19:17,679	| VfD_E50 |	silicon might be doing a lot of the
EDL	00:19:17,679	00:19:20,400	| VfD_E50 |	electronics and the compounds might be
EDL	00:19:20,400	00:19:21,520	| VfD_E50 |	doing
EDL	00:19:21,520	00:19:23,679	| VfD_E50 |	emission and detection of light and then
EDL	00:19:23,679	00:19:26,240	| VfD_E50 |	those might be interconnected with glass
EDL	00:19:26,240	00:19:28,080	| VfD_E50 |	fibers or other things that that go
EDL	00:19:28,080	00:19:30,480	| VfD_E50 |	between one source and one detector that
EDL	00:19:30,480	00:19:32,799	| VfD_E50 |	might be a meter apart or a kilometer
EDL	00:19:32,799	00:19:34,400	| VfD_E50 |	apart depending on the on the
EDL	00:19:34,400	00:19:36,400	| VfD_E50 |	application great thanks for those
EDL	00:19:36,400	00:19:38,559	| VfD_E50 |	details okay now I would like to
EDL	00:19:38,559	00:19:40,640	| VfD_E50 |	continue and talk about a couple of more
EDL	00:19:40,640	00:19:43,120	| VfD_E50 |	of your programs next let's move to
EDL	00:19:43,120	00:19:45,840	| VfD_E50 |	lumos which I think maybe is one of your
EDL	00:19:45,840	00:19:48,400	| VfD_E50 |	uh newest this stands for lasers for
EDL	00:19:48,400	00:19:51,760	| VfD_E50 |	universal micro scale optical systems
EDL	00:19:51,760	00:19:53,919	| VfD_E50 |	what are you up to with lumos
EDL	00:19:53,919	00:19:56,400	| VfD_E50 |	yeah so lumos is the program that I most
EDL	00:19:56,400	00:19:59,120	| VfD_E50 |	wanted to do when I came to DARPA lumos
EDL	00:19:59,120	00:20:00,080	| VfD_E50 |	was
EDL	00:20:00,080	00:20:02,960	| VfD_E50 |	it's a heterogeneous integration program
EDL	00:20:02,960	00:20:05,360	| VfD_E50 |	that that basically integrates new
EDL	00:20:05,360	00:20:08,400	| VfD_E50 |	materials in sort of a 3d way
EDL	00:20:08,400	00:20:11,600	| VfD_E50 |	onto semiconductor wafers and so
EDL	00:20:11,600	00:20:14,159	| VfD_E50 |	if you look at integrated photonics
EDL	00:20:14,159	00:20:16,400	| VfD_E50 |	today it's moved very fast in the last
EDL	00:20:16,400	00:20:17,600	| VfD_E50 |	decade
EDL	00:20:17,600	00:20:19,840	| VfD_E50 |	because silicon photonics has been very
EDL	00:20:19,840	00:20:20,960	| VfD_E50 |	successful
EDL	00:20:20,960	00:20:24,080	| VfD_E50 |	we use silicon in traditional
EDL	00:20:24,080	00:20:25,840	| VfD_E50 |	electronic circuits
EDL	00:20:25,840	00:20:27,919	| VfD_E50 |	and by leveraging the fabrication
EDL	00:20:27,919	00:20:30,240	| VfD_E50 |	techniques people have moved silicon
EDL	00:20:30,240	00:20:33,360	| VfD_E50 |	photonics forward very fast you can
EDL	00:20:33,360	00:20:34,559	| VfD_E50 |	fabricate
EDL	00:20:34,559	00:20:36,480	| VfD_E50 |	really complex
EDL	00:20:36,480	00:20:38,880	| VfD_E50 |	photonic integrated circuits
EDL	00:20:38,880	00:20:40,880	| VfD_E50 |	however silicon is actually not a great
EDL	00:20:40,880	00:20:43,280	| VfD_E50 |	material for optics
EDL	00:20:43,280	00:20:45,600	| VfD_E50 |	it's really good for fabrication but
EDL	00:20:45,600	00:20:48,320	| VfD_E50 |	it doesn't emit light at least not very
EDL	00:20:48,320	00:20:50,400	| VfD_E50 |	efficiently doesn't really detect most
EDL	00:20:50,400	00:20:52,880	| VfD_E50 |	of the light that we care about and it
EDL	00:20:52,880	00:20:54,640	| VfD_E50 |	doesn't do other effects like nonlinear
EDL	00:20:54,640	00:20:56,559	| VfD_E50 |	effects that we might care about
EDL	00:20:56,559	00:20:59,280	| VfD_E50 |	so lumos is about integrating materials
EDL	00:20:59,280	00:21:01,919	| VfD_E50 |	onto silicon or other other low loss
EDL	00:21:01,919	00:21:02,960	| VfD_E50 |	materials
EDL	00:21:02,960	00:21:06,000	| VfD_E50 |	particularly to make lasers so
EDL	00:21:06,000	00:21:08,000	| VfD_E50 |	lasers and amplifiers in the in the
EDL	00:21:08,000	00:21:11,200	| VfD_E50 |	optical space are really foundational
EDL	00:21:11,200	00:21:13,520	| VfD_E50 |	the laser was invented about 60 years
EDL	00:21:13,520	00:21:15,760	| VfD_E50 |	ago around the same time DARPA actually
EDL	00:21:15,760	00:21:17,280	| VfD_E50 |	they co-evolved
EDL	00:21:17,280	00:21:18,240	| VfD_E50 |	yes
EDL	00:21:18,240	00:21:19,760	| VfD_E50 |	and you know people
EDL	00:21:19,760	00:21:21,840	| VfD_E50 |	realized really quickly that that lasers
EDL	00:21:21,840	00:21:23,919	| VfD_E50 |	were going to be really important they
EDL	00:21:23,919	00:21:25,679	| VfD_E50 |	shrunk them down to make semiconductor
EDL	00:21:25,679	00:21:28,559	| VfD_E50 |	lasers and you know we keep finding new
EDL	00:21:28,559	00:21:30,799	| VfD_E50 |	applications for for lasers silicon
EDL	00:21:30,799	00:21:32,400	| VfD_E50 |	photonics doesn't really have lasers and
EDL	00:21:32,400	00:21:34,640	| VfD_E50 |	so you need to integrate separate laser
EDL	00:21:34,640	00:21:37,440	| VfD_E50 |	chips to build up a system so lumos is
EDL	00:21:37,440	00:21:39,840	| VfD_E50 |	saying how do we put lasers directly
EDL	00:21:39,840	00:21:42,000	| VfD_E50 |	directly on these wafers and so the
EDL	00:21:42,000	00:21:43,760	| VfD_E50 |	teams are doing various things they're
EDL	00:21:43,760	00:21:46,159	| VfD_E50 |	they're growing compound semiconductors
EDL	00:21:46,159	00:21:47,840	| VfD_E50 |	right on top of silicon they're
EDL	00:21:47,840	00:21:49,919	| VfD_E50 |	integrating tiny little chiplets on
EDL	00:21:49,919	00:21:52,159	| VfD_E50 |	silicon they're doing non-linear
EDL	00:21:52,159	00:21:54,720	| VfD_E50 |	wavelength conversion so that we can
EDL	00:21:54,720	00:21:56,799	| VfD_E50 |	create new wavelengths maybe in the
EDL	00:21:56,799	00:22:00,320	| VfD_E50 |	visible for quantum or atomic systems
EDL	00:22:00,320	00:22:02,480	| VfD_E50 |	and looking at how do you amplify light
EDL	00:22:02,480	00:22:04,799	| VfD_E50 |	to get to sort of watts of power on
EDL	00:22:04,799	00:22:06,720	| VfD_E50 |	these on these wafers
EDL	00:22:06,720	00:22:08,799	| VfD_E50 |	well so it sounds like tremendous amount
EDL	00:22:08,799	00:22:10,799	| VfD_E50 |	of versatility both kind of in the
EDL	00:22:10,799	00:22:13,919	| VfD_E50 |	spectrum element and also power
EDL	00:22:13,919	00:22:15,280	| VfD_E50 |	you know when you think of two or three
EDL	00:22:15,280	00:22:16,880	| VfD_E50 |	applications that would just tickle you
EDL	00:22:16,880	00:22:18,720	| VfD_E50 |	if you saw them getting out there in the
EDL	00:22:18,720	00:22:19,440	| VfD_E50 |	in
EDL	00:22:19,440	00:22:21,919	| VfD_E50 |	real life what comes to mind well so I
EDL	00:22:21,919	00:22:23,440	| VfD_E50 |	think that there's going to be a lot of
EDL	00:22:23,440	00:22:25,600	| VfD_E50 |	new applications beyond just moving data
EDL	00:22:25,600	00:22:27,200	| VfD_E50 |	around which is what photonics is used
EDL	00:22:27,200	00:22:28,880	| VfD_E50 |	for today so
EDL	00:22:28,880	00:22:30,799	| VfD_E50 |	so sensors for
EDL	00:22:30,799	00:22:32,559	| VfD_E50 |	positioning navigation and timing that's
EDL	00:22:32,559	00:22:34,480	| VfD_E50 |	a big thing that we care about in in the
EDL	00:22:34,480	00:22:36,559	| VfD_E50 |	dod but understanding where you are and
EDL	00:22:36,559	00:22:38,159	| VfD_E50 |	navigating in the world
EDL	00:22:38,159	00:22:40,640	| VfD_E50 |	often we make precision sensors with
EDL	00:22:40,640	00:22:42,720	| VfD_E50 |	with quantum systems or atomic systems
EDL	00:22:42,720	00:22:45,280	| VfD_E50 |	and you have to interface with atoms
EDL	00:22:45,280	00:22:46,559	| VfD_E50 |	every atom might be different it might
EDL	00:22:46,559	00:22:49,280	| VfD_E50 |	be a rubidium atom or a cesium atom
EDL	00:22:49,280	00:22:51,520	| VfD_E50 |	and lumos is trying to address this by
EDL	00:22:51,520	00:22:53,280	| VfD_E50 |	making a flexible platform that can
EDL	00:22:53,280	00:22:56,720	| VfD_E50 |	create really narrow line width lasers
EDL	00:22:56,720	00:22:58,559	| VfD_E50 |	at just about any wavelength that you
EDL	00:22:58,559	00:23:01,600	| VfD_E50 |	care about on a chip right and is this
EDL	00:23:01,600	00:23:04,240	| VfD_E50 |	where the optical frequency combs come
EDL	00:23:04,240	00:23:06,480	| VfD_E50 |	in which I've been hearing about and
EDL	00:23:06,480	00:23:08,159	| VfD_E50 |	actually had a little bit of a challenge
EDL	00:23:08,159	00:23:10,400	| VfD_E50 |	with a public affairs colleague of mine
EDL	00:23:10,400	00:23:12,960	| VfD_E50 |	uh to see if we could uh just if you
EDL	00:23:12,960	00:23:14,559	| VfD_E50 |	could describe that in a way that most
EDL	00:23:14,559	00:23:16,000	| VfD_E50 |	people would understand
EDL	00:23:16,000	00:23:18,159	| VfD_E50 |	well sure I can I can give it a try so
EDL	00:23:18,159	00:23:20,880	| VfD_E50 |	uh yeah optical frequency combs have
EDL	00:23:20,880	00:23:24,400	| VfD_E50 |	seen sort of a huge explosion of advance
EDL	00:23:24,400	00:23:27,679	| VfD_E50 |	in the last few years the idea is
EDL	00:23:27,679	00:23:30,400	| VfD_E50 |	typically using non-linear techniques we
EDL	00:23:30,400	00:23:32,720	| VfD_E50 |	go from a single optical frequency if
EDL	00:23:32,720	00:23:34,480	| VfD_E50 |	you think of a laser it's sort of one
EDL	00:23:34,480	00:23:38,080	| VfD_E50 |	single color and we create a number of
EDL	00:23:38,080	00:23:40,000	| VfD_E50 |	different frequencies that are all
EDL	00:23:40,000	00:23:42,799	| VfD_E50 |	equally spaced in the frequency spectrum
EDL	00:23:42,799	00:23:45,600	| VfD_E50 |	if you think of them looking like a comb
EDL	00:23:45,600	00:23:47,039	| VfD_E50 |	that you would you know comb your hair
EDL	00:23:47,039	00:23:49,200	| VfD_E50 |	with each one of these tones equally
EDL	00:23:49,200	00:23:51,840	| VfD_E50 |	spaced this essentially becomes a very
EDL	00:23:51,840	00:23:54,559	| VfD_E50 |	precise ruler and it can be used in many
EDL	00:23:54,559	00:23:56,720	| VfD_E50 |	different applications can be used for
EDL	00:23:56,720	00:23:59,360	| VfD_E50 |	frequency metrology it can be used for
EDL	00:23:59,360	00:24:01,679	| VfD_E50 |	spatial metrology
EDL	00:24:01,679	00:24:04,559	| VfD_E50 |	and it's really created a whole new area
EDL	00:24:04,559	00:24:06,799	| VfD_E50 |	of science and applications including
EDL	00:24:06,799	00:24:09,600	| VfD_E50 |	some of my other programs uh like dodos
EDL	00:24:09,600	00:24:11,919	| VfD_E50 |	and griffin okay we'll get to that just
EDL	00:24:11,919	00:24:13,440	| VfD_E50 |	in one minute but some I was thinking
EDL	00:24:13,440	00:24:14,720	| VfD_E50 |	about these
EDL	00:24:14,720	00:24:16,480	| VfD_E50 |	optical frequency combs the other day
EDL	00:24:16,480	00:24:18,240	| VfD_E50 |	sitting back on my deck and I was
EDL	00:24:18,240	00:24:21,440	| VfD_E50 |	wondering like if in addition to
EDL	00:24:21,440	00:24:23,360	| VfD_E50 |	kind of specifying
EDL	00:24:23,360	00:24:24,400	| VfD_E50 |	this
EDL	00:24:24,400	00:24:26,960	| VfD_E50 |	you know range of frequencies if if you
EDL	00:24:26,960	00:24:28,880	| VfD_E50 |	can individually
EDL	00:24:28,880	00:24:32,480	| VfD_E50 |	also determine and specify the intensity
EDL	00:24:32,480	00:24:34,640	| VfD_E50 |	of each of those frequencies because
EDL	00:24:34,640	00:24:36,480	| VfD_E50 |	with that then you'd be able to kind of
EDL	00:24:36,480	00:24:37,760	| VfD_E50 |	simulate
EDL	00:24:37,760	00:24:38,720	| VfD_E50 |	the
EDL	00:24:38,720	00:24:39,600	| VfD_E50 |	color
EDL	00:24:39,600	00:24:42,159	| VfD_E50 |	experience of any particular thing like
EDL	00:24:42,159	00:24:45,039	| VfD_E50 |	a leaf or wood and the way each of those
EDL	00:24:45,039	00:24:47,679	| VfD_E50 |	absorbs and emits a different
EDL	00:24:47,679	00:24:50,159	| VfD_E50 |	portfolio of light frequencies can you
EDL	00:24:50,159	00:24:51,919	| VfD_E50 |	do that with an optical frequency comb
EDL	00:24:51,919	00:24:53,760	| VfD_E50 |	or are all of those component
EDL	00:24:53,760	00:24:56,400	| VfD_E50 |	frequencies the teeth of the comb as it
EDL	00:24:56,400	00:24:58,880	| VfD_E50 |	were or tones as you refer to them
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:01,279	| VfD_E50 |	are they all the same intensity well so
EDL	00:25:01,279	00:25:03,360	| VfD_E50 |	typically they start out maybe similar
EDL	00:25:03,360	00:25:05,120	| VfD_E50 |	in intensity but you can certainly
EDL	00:25:05,120	00:25:08,080	| VfD_E50 |	modulate each one of them and and create
EDL	00:25:08,080	00:25:10,480	| VfD_E50 |	just about any spectrum that you want
EDL	00:25:10,480	00:25:11,679	| VfD_E50 |	and so
EDL	00:25:11,679	00:25:13,279	| VfD_E50 |	you know one of the
EDL	00:25:13,279	00:25:15,200	| VfD_E50 |	clear uses for optical frequency combs
EDL	00:25:15,200	00:25:18,240	| VfD_E50 |	would be for spectral sensing and so you
EDL	00:25:18,240	00:25:20,880	| VfD_E50 |	could imagine creating thousands of of
EDL	00:25:20,880	00:25:23,200	| VfD_E50 |	tones at different frequencies
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:26,480	| VfD_E50 |	and sensing maybe a gas plume and
EDL	00:25:26,480	00:25:28,960	| VfD_E50 |	understanding exactly which molecules
EDL	00:25:28,960	00:25:31,520	| VfD_E50 |	are present at what concentration by
EDL	00:25:31,520	00:25:33,679	| VfD_E50 |	detecting the relative intensity of each
EDL	00:25:33,679	00:25:35,840	| VfD_E50 |	one of those we also have
EDL	00:25:35,840	00:25:37,360	| VfD_E50 |	under the pipes program that I talked
EDL	00:25:37,360	00:25:39,760	| VfD_E50 |	about some teams that are using optical
EDL	00:25:39,760	00:25:41,360	| VfD_E50 |	frequency combs
EDL	00:25:41,360	00:25:44,880	| VfD_E50 |	with each each comb tooth being sort of
EDL	00:25:44,880	00:25:47,600	| VfD_E50 |	an independent source almost like
EDL	00:25:47,600	00:25:50,799	| VfD_E50 |	how systems today are built with
EDL	00:25:50,799	00:25:52,720	| VfD_E50 |	individual lasers at different colors
EDL	00:25:52,720	00:25:55,520	| VfD_E50 |	wavelength division multiplexing or wdm
EDL	00:25:55,520	00:25:58,240	| VfD_E50 |	instead you could have one comb laser
EDL	00:25:58,240	00:26:00,720	| VfD_E50 |	that creates hundreds of lines
EDL	00:26:00,720	00:26:02,480	| VfD_E50 |	and then modulate each one and now you
EDL	00:26:02,480	00:26:04,720	| VfD_E50 |	have hundreds of of optical channels
EDL	00:26:04,720	00:26:07,520	| VfD_E50 |	each carrying their own data
EDL	00:26:07,520	00:26:09,120	| VfD_E50 |	yeah astonishing
EDL	00:26:09,120	00:26:11,600	| VfD_E50 |	so let's finish out your
EDL	00:26:11,600	00:26:14,799	| VfD_E50 |	tour of programs with with two that are
EDL	00:26:14,799	00:26:16,159	| VfD_E50 |	related
EDL	00:26:16,159	00:26:18,240	| VfD_E50 |	and one preceded the other I'm referring
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:21,679	| VfD_E50 |	here to the two programs known as dodos
EDL	00:26:21,679	00:26:23,600	| VfD_E50 |	and griffin
EDL	00:26:23,600	00:26:27,039	| VfD_E50 |	and I'll let you spell those out and
EDL	00:26:27,039	00:26:28,240	| VfD_E50 |	tell me
EDL	00:26:28,240	00:26:30,880	| VfD_E50 |	the technology trajectory that they
EDL	00:26:30,880	00:26:32,559	| VfD_E50 |	amount to
EDL	00:26:32,559	00:26:33,840	| VfD_E50 |	sure so
EDL	00:26:33,840	00:26:37,919	| VfD_E50 |	dodos is uh the direct on-chip digital
EDL	00:26:37,919	00:26:40,720	| VfD_E50 |	optical synthesizer this is a program I
EDL	00:26:40,720	00:26:42,799	| VfD_E50 |	inherited also when I arrived back in
EDL	00:26:42,799	00:26:46,320	| VfD_E50 |	2017 it's a fantastic program and it's a
EDL	00:26:46,320	00:26:48,080	| VfD_E50 |	little esoteric so for people that
EDL	00:26:48,080	00:26:51,279	| VfD_E50 |	aren't in the optical physics space
EDL	00:26:51,279	00:26:53,679	| VfD_E50 |	it'll take just a minute to explain but
EDL	00:26:53,679	00:26:55,840	| VfD_E50 |	if you're familiar with microwave and
EDL	00:26:55,840	00:26:59,120	| VfD_E50 |	radio frequency technologies the direct
EDL	00:26:59,120	00:27:02,080	| VfD_E50 |	digital synthesizer or dds
EDL	00:27:02,080	00:27:05,360	| VfD_E50 |	is commonplace today in a radio in your
EDL	00:27:05,360	00:27:08,000	| VfD_E50 |	car you no longer have a tuning knob
EDL	00:27:08,000	00:27:10,480	| VfD_E50 |	that you kind of have to tweak and find
EDL	00:27:10,480	00:27:12,240	| VfD_E50 |	the right frequency
EDL	00:27:12,240	00:27:14,000	| VfD_E50 |	instead you just hit a button and your
EDL	00:27:14,000	00:27:16,480	| VfD_E50 |	radio goes there it generates the right
EDL	00:27:16,480	00:27:19,679	| VfD_E50 |	frequency optics today is kind of still
EDL	00:27:19,679	00:27:22,640	| VfD_E50 |	stuck in the microwave world of the 60s
EDL	00:27:22,640	00:27:24,799	| VfD_E50 |	where we build a laser
EDL	00:27:24,799	00:27:26,480	| VfD_E50 |	and then we measure what the output
EDL	00:27:26,480	00:27:28,480	| VfD_E50 |	wavelength is or the frequency you might
EDL	00:27:28,480	00:27:30,399	| VfD_E50 |	be able to lock it to something but you
EDL	00:27:30,399	00:27:33,039	| VfD_E50 |	don't really just tell it where to go
EDL	00:27:33,039	00:27:35,760	| VfD_E50 |	and dodos which is looking to make an
EDL	00:27:35,760	00:27:38,640	| VfD_E50 |	optical analog of the dds
EDL	00:27:38,640	00:27:40,559	| VfD_E50 |	is trying to do that we just finished
EDL	00:27:40,559	00:27:42,559	| VfD_E50 |	dodos this year and made enormous
EDL	00:27:42,559	00:27:45,279	| VfD_E50 |	strides and the idea is if you use
EDL	00:27:45,279	00:27:47,919	| VfD_E50 |	optical frequency combs as your ruler
EDL	00:27:47,919	00:27:50,320	| VfD_E50 |	and some microwave techniques where we
EDL	00:27:50,320	00:27:52,559	| VfD_E50 |	know frequencies very well hopefully you
EDL	00:27:52,559	00:27:54,559	| VfD_E50 |	can create
EDL	00:27:54,559	00:27:57,039	| VfD_E50 |	optical frequencies with incredible
EDL	00:27:57,039	00:27:59,919	| VfD_E50 |	precision and accuracy and so in fact
EDL	00:27:59,919	00:28:02,399	| VfD_E50 |	under dodos we've we've seen many many
EDL	00:28:02,399	00:28:04,000	| VfD_E50 |	orders of magnitude improvement in the
EDL	00:28:04,000	00:28:06,640	| VfD_E50 |	accuracy of of optical frequencies and
EDL	00:28:06,640	00:28:07,919	| VfD_E50 |	this is all using chip scale
EDL	00:28:07,919	00:28:10,320	| VfD_E50 |	technologies so again trying to to take
EDL	00:28:10,320	00:28:12,480	| VfD_E50 |	technologies that today look like a a
EDL	00:28:12,480	00:28:15,039	| VfD_E50 |	room or a rack and put it into the size
EDL	00:28:15,039	00:28:17,200	| VfD_E50 |	of a sugar cube right and just to help
EDL	00:28:17,200	00:28:19,279	| VfD_E50 |	listeners who might be impressed that
EDL	00:28:19,279	00:28:21,600	| VfD_E50 |	you can get the highest precision on a
EDL	00:28:21,600	00:28:23,600	| VfD_E50 |	frequency might be impressed by that
EDL	00:28:23,600	00:28:25,520	| VfD_E50 |	capability but it doesn't know why what
EDL	00:28:25,520	00:28:27,760	| VfD_E50 |	do we get from that well sort of again
EDL	00:28:27,760	00:28:30,720	| VfD_E50 |	like changing the paradigm the way that
EDL	00:28:30,720	00:28:33,840	| VfD_E50 |	digital synthesis did for radios we also
EDL	00:28:33,840	00:28:35,120	| VfD_E50 |	use optical frequencies for
EDL	00:28:35,120	00:28:36,480	| VfD_E50 |	communications
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:38,720	| VfD_E50 |	and so you could imagine incredible
EDL	00:28:38,720	00:28:40,640	| VfD_E50 |	improvements in
EDL	00:28:40,640	00:28:42,880	| VfD_E50 |	optical communications by having
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:44,880	| VfD_E50 |	precision control of frequencies at both
EDL	00:28:44,880	00:28:45,679	| VfD_E50 |	ends
EDL	00:28:45,679	00:28:47,840	| VfD_E50 |	essentially doing coherent
EDL	00:28:47,840	00:28:50,159	| VfD_E50 |	communications where both sides know
EDL	00:28:50,159	00:28:52,480	| VfD_E50 |	what wavelengths are being communicated
EDL	00:28:52,480	00:28:55,679	| VfD_E50 |	very precisely or you could do precision
EDL	00:28:55,679	00:28:58,640	| VfD_E50 |	uh lidar where maybe you have one source
EDL	00:28:58,640	00:29:00,240	| VfD_E50 |	emitting and a different source
EDL	00:29:00,240	00:29:02,640	| VfD_E50 |	receiving it's also important for for
EDL	00:29:02,640	00:29:04,960	| VfD_E50 |	doing optical sensing where you perhaps
EDL	00:29:04,960	00:29:06,000	| VfD_E50 |	know
EDL	00:29:06,000	00:29:07,679	| VfD_E50 |	the precise wavelength of different
EDL	00:29:07,679	00:29:10,480	| VfD_E50 |	transitions for different molecules or
EDL	00:29:10,480	00:29:13,600	| VfD_E50 |	again quantum anatomic sensors
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,440	| VfD_E50 |	okay and then just one more point on
EDL	00:29:15,440	00:29:16,799	| VfD_E50 |	this one because as you were talking
EDL	00:29:16,799	00:29:20,000	| VfD_E50 |	about you know if I know and can produce
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,240	| VfD_E50 |	an extremely um you know precise
EDL	00:29:22,240	00:29:23,440	| VfD_E50 |	frequency
EDL	00:29:23,440	00:29:25,440	| VfD_E50 |	for communication and I want my
EDL	00:29:25,440	00:29:27,840	| VfD_E50 |	recipient to be able to do that same
EDL	00:29:27,840	00:29:30,080	| VfD_E50 |	thing or if my recipient can that sounds
EDL	00:29:30,080	00:29:31,600	| VfD_E50 |	like it would open up kind of you know
EDL	00:29:31,600	00:29:34,080	| VfD_E50 |	privacy and security channels
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:35,679	| VfD_E50 |	yeah that's a great point you could
EDL	00:29:35,679	00:29:39,039	| VfD_E50 |	certainly do that so dodos was the prior
EDL	00:29:39,039	00:29:41,120	| VfD_E50 |	program that led into griffin talk about
EDL	00:29:41,120	00:29:43,200	| VfD_E50 |	griffin right so as we got near the end
EDL	00:29:43,200	00:29:46,720	| VfD_E50 |	of dodos we saw this this great advance
EDL	00:29:46,720	00:29:49,200	| VfD_E50 |	in technology in fact I should say that
EDL	00:29:49,200	00:29:50,799	| VfD_E50 |	under dodos
EDL	00:29:50,799	00:29:52,960	| VfD_E50 |	perhaps the biggest outcome here was
EDL	00:29:52,960	00:29:55,360	| VfD_E50 |	seeing the whole community
EDL	00:29:55,360	00:29:58,320	| VfD_E50 |	get excited about non-linear photonics
EDL	00:29:58,320	00:29:59,760	| VfD_E50 |	we had
EDL	00:29:59,760	00:30:01,760	| VfD_E50 |	from the the performers under dodos we
EDL	00:30:01,760	00:30:04,240	| VfD_E50 |	had well over a hundred peer-reviewed
EDL	00:30:04,240	00:30:05,840	| VfD_E50 |	journal submissions
EDL	00:30:05,840	00:30:08,399	| VfD_E50 |	and we had more than 25
EDL	00:30:08,399	00:30:10,720	| VfD_E50 |	high impact journals in in the nature
EDL	00:30:10,720	00:30:12,880	| VfD_E50 |	and science suite of journals
EDL	00:30:12,880	00:30:15,279	| VfD_E50 |	this is really changing the field and
EDL	00:30:15,279	00:30:16,880	| VfD_E50 |	there's whole sessions at conferences
EDL	00:30:16,880	00:30:18,960	| VfD_E50 |	now on dodo's technology
EDL	00:30:18,960	00:30:21,120	| VfD_E50 |	now on to griffin
EDL	00:30:21,120	00:30:23,679	| VfD_E50 |	which stands for generating rf with
EDL	00:30:23,679	00:30:26,080	| VfD_E50 |	photonic oscillators for low noise it's
EDL	00:30:26,080	00:30:27,440	| VfD_E50 |	a little bit of a stretch but we like
EDL	00:30:27,440	00:30:29,360	| VfD_E50 |	the name the griffin program is a
EDL	00:30:29,360	00:30:30,640	| VfD_E50 |	recognition that if you can make
EDL	00:30:30,640	00:30:32,480	| VfD_E50 |	extremely precise frequencies in the
EDL	00:30:32,480	00:30:34,080	| VfD_E50 |	optical domain
EDL	00:30:34,080	00:30:36,320	| VfD_E50 |	and then divide those frequencies down
EDL	00:30:36,320	00:30:39,120	| VfD_E50 |	from these sort of 100 terahertz
EDL	00:30:39,120	00:30:41,600	| VfD_E50 |	frequencies down to the microwave
EDL	00:30:41,600	00:30:43,360	| VfD_E50 |	you actually reduce noise when you do
EDL	00:30:43,360	00:30:45,039	| VfD_E50 |	that and that means you can get
EDL	00:30:45,039	00:30:46,480	| VfD_E50 |	incredibly
EDL	00:30:46,480	00:30:49,200	| VfD_E50 |	precise low phase noise oscillators in
EDL	00:30:49,200	00:30:50,799	| VfD_E50 |	the microwave regime
EDL	00:30:50,799	00:30:51,679	| VfD_E50 |	so
EDL	00:30:51,679	00:30:53,520	| VfD_E50 |	oscillators
EDL	00:30:53,520	00:30:55,760	| VfD_E50 |	are important in our entire world right
EDL	00:30:55,760	00:30:57,039	| VfD_E50 |	they
EDL	00:30:57,039	00:31:00,000	| VfD_E50 |	they form the clock that drives every
EDL	00:31:00,000	00:31:02,000	| VfD_E50 |	piece of digital electronics your phone
EDL	00:31:02,000	00:31:04,320	| VfD_E50 |	your computer microwave oscillators in
EDL	00:31:04,320	00:31:06,640	| VfD_E50 |	particular are important for
EDL	00:31:06,640	00:31:10,080	| VfD_E50 |	communications and for radar and so the
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:12,320	| VfD_E50 |	dod cares a lot about making very
EDL	00:31:12,320	00:31:15,360	| VfD_E50 |	precise microwave oscillators
EDL	00:31:15,360	00:31:17,039	| VfD_E50 |	and they try and make them very low
EDL	00:31:17,039	00:31:18,399	| VfD_E50 |	noise very quiet
EDL	00:31:18,399	00:31:21,039	| VfD_E50 |	essentially a pure tone if you think of
EDL	00:31:21,039	00:31:23,600	| VfD_E50 |	ringing a bell and just maybe you know a
EDL	00:31:23,600	00:31:26,320	| VfD_E50 |	crystal wine glass that's a pure tone at
EDL	00:31:26,320	00:31:28,000	| VfD_E50 |	microwave frequencies
EDL	00:31:28,000	00:31:29,600	| VfD_E50 |	it is something that's sort of an
EDL	00:31:29,600	00:31:32,799	| VfD_E50 |	exquisite oscillator and it gets used in
EDL	00:31:32,799	00:31:35,360	| VfD_E50 |	again exquisite systems but using
EDL	00:31:35,360	00:31:37,760	| VfD_E50 |	griffin kinds of techniques or dodo's
EDL	00:31:37,760	00:31:39,200	| VfD_E50 |	kinds of techniques
EDL	00:31:39,200	00:31:41,760	| VfD_E50 |	you can imagine making these exquisite
EDL	00:31:41,760	00:31:44,880	| VfD_E50 |	oscillators not with rf electronics
EDL	00:31:44,880	00:31:47,360	| VfD_E50 |	which are often sort of hand-tuned
EDL	00:31:47,360	00:31:48,799	| VfD_E50 |	hand-built
EDL	00:31:48,799	00:31:51,279	| VfD_E50 |	expensive bulky things but putting them
EDL	00:31:51,279	00:31:53,760	| VfD_E50 |	on a chip and you use optics and
EDL	00:31:53,760	00:31:56,240	| VfD_E50 |	photonics on this chip
EDL	00:31:56,240	00:31:58,320	| VfD_E50 |	but it's a case where we don't really
EDL	00:31:58,320	00:32:00,640	| VfD_E50 |	care that there's there's optics inside
EDL	00:32:00,640	00:32:02,640	| VfD_E50 |	the package what we want to do is
EDL	00:32:02,640	00:32:04,159	| VfD_E50 |	generate a microwave signal that
EDL	00:32:04,159	00:32:06,880	| VfD_E50 |	ultimately comes out so griffin again
EDL	00:32:06,880	00:32:09,279	| VfD_E50 |	with sort of this sugar cube idea in
EDL	00:32:09,279	00:32:10,480	| VfD_E50 |	mind has
EDL	00:32:10,480	00:32:13,279	| VfD_E50 |	has goals of making very very quiet rf
EDL	00:32:13,279	00:32:16,320	| VfD_E50 |	or microwave signals with optics inside
EDL	00:32:16,320	00:32:18,080	| VfD_E50 |	the the tiny box
EDL	00:32:18,080	00:32:18,960	| VfD_E50 |	and
EDL	00:32:18,960	00:32:21,279	| VfD_E50 |	the idea would be we make we make better
EDL	00:32:21,279	00:32:24,240	| VfD_E50 |	radars better communication systems
EDL	00:32:24,240	00:32:27,360	| VfD_E50 |	and we can make them small
EDL	00:32:27,360	00:32:29,919	| VfD_E50 |	low power and low cost
EDL	00:32:29,919	00:32:31,679	| VfD_E50 |	there's a lot of commercial applications
EDL	00:32:31,679	00:32:32,960	| VfD_E50 |	as well like
EDL	00:32:32,960	00:32:35,440	| VfD_E50 |	imaging radar say for a autonomous
EDL	00:32:35,440	00:32:38,000	| VfD_E50 |	vehicle or if you make it small enough
EDL	00:32:38,000	00:32:41,120	| VfD_E50 |	maybe it goes in in every cell phone
EDL	00:32:41,120	00:32:43,039	| VfD_E50 |	wow okay well gordon
EDL	00:32:43,039	00:32:44,960	| VfD_E50 |	that was kind of an amazing tour of all
EDL	00:32:44,960	00:32:47,679	| VfD_E50 |	of these programs I mean when I think of
EDL	00:32:47,679	00:32:50,559	| VfD_E50 |	the technical challenges when I think of
EDL	00:32:50,559	00:32:52,720	| VfD_E50 |	the probably dozens of research
EDL	00:32:52,720	00:32:55,120	| VfD_E50 |	performers who are working across these
EDL	00:32:55,120	00:32:57,600	| VfD_E50 |	half dozen or so programs and you
EDL	00:32:57,600	00:32:59,760	| VfD_E50 |	keeping track of all of them and
EDL	00:32:59,760	00:33:02,080	| VfD_E50 |	and seeing how they can all integrate
EDL	00:33:02,080	00:33:05,039	| VfD_E50 |	and synthesize uh you have really got a
EDL	00:33:05,039	00:33:07,440	| VfD_E50 |	lot on your shoulders I uh give you some
EDL	00:33:07,440	00:33:09,200	| VfD_E50 |	pats on the back for doing all that and
EDL	00:33:09,200	00:33:10,320	| VfD_E50 |	it's exciting to think about the
EDL	00:33:10,320	00:33:12,320	| VfD_E50 |	technologies that will move forward so
EDL	00:33:12,320	00:33:14,240	| VfD_E50 |	before we kind of come in for a landing
EDL	00:33:14,240	00:33:16,080	| VfD_E50 |	here I just want to see was there
EDL	00:33:16,080	00:33:18,559	| VfD_E50 |	anything that you thought of afterwards
EDL	00:33:18,559	00:33:20,880	| VfD_E50 |	from any of these programs that you know
EDL	00:33:20,880	00:33:22,399	| VfD_E50 |	you'd like to just share with listeners
EDL	00:33:22,399	00:33:24,320	| VfD_E50 |	before I do take you in for a landing
EDL	00:33:24,320	00:33:27,279	| VfD_E50 |	and liberate you so I think that there's
EDL	00:33:27,279	00:33:29,519	| VfD_E50 |	a whole lot of unknowns as to where this
EDL	00:33:29,519	00:33:31,840	| VfD_E50 |	technology could go and there's a lot of
EDL	00:33:31,840	00:33:35,120	| VfD_E50 |	potential and so you know I worry about
EDL	00:33:35,120	00:33:37,440	| VfD_E50 |	occasionally on our DARPA programs which
EDL	00:33:37,440	00:33:39,440	| VfD_E50 |	are very focused right we're trying to
EDL	00:33:39,440	00:33:42,080	| VfD_E50 |	solve one particular problem that that
EDL	00:33:42,080	00:33:44,320	| VfD_E50 |	we're missing things there's
EDL	00:33:44,320	00:33:45,919	| VfD_E50 |	there's other things like you know
EDL	00:33:45,919	00:33:48,720	| VfD_E50 |	biosensing or medical applications
EDL	00:33:48,720	00:33:51,360	| VfD_E50 |	and so we need to to kind of look at the
EDL	00:33:51,360	00:33:53,120	| VfD_E50 |	big picture and always keep looking for
EDL	00:33:53,120	00:33:55,600	| VfD_E50 |	new opportunities I would say that one
EDL	00:33:55,600	00:33:56,960	| VfD_E50 |	thing I want to make sure that the
EDL	00:33:56,960	00:33:58,320	| VfD_E50 |	listeners hear
EDL	00:33:58,320	00:33:59,519	| VfD_E50 |	is that
EDL	00:33:59,519	00:34:02,799	| VfD_E50 |	good ideas come from everywhere and
EDL	00:34:02,799	00:34:04,880	| VfD_E50 |	you mentioned the limited tenure that we
EDL	00:34:04,880	00:34:06,480	| VfD_E50 |	have at DARPA we're always looking for
EDL	00:34:06,480	00:34:09,520	| VfD_E50 |	new people and so if you've got ideas I
EDL	00:34:09,520	00:34:11,119	| VfD_E50 |	care a lot about
EDL	00:34:11,119	00:34:12,960	| VfD_E50 |	optical microsystems so for sure come
EDL	00:34:12,960	00:34:14,879	| VfD_E50 |	see me if you've got ideas in this area
EDL	00:34:14,879	00:34:17,440	| VfD_E50 |	but you know get involved DARPA is not
EDL	00:34:17,440	00:34:19,199	| VfD_E50 |	one person or one place it's a
EDL	00:34:19,199	00:34:21,040	| VfD_E50 |	collection of people that are excited
EDL	00:34:21,040	00:34:23,440	| VfD_E50 |	about moving technology forward and so
EDL	00:34:23,440	00:34:25,040	| VfD_E50 |	you know maybe you want to be a program
EDL	00:34:25,040	00:34:26,960	| VfD_E50 |	manager maybe you want to work as a ceda
EDL	00:34:26,960	00:34:28,800	| VfD_E50 |	maybe you want to be a performer and
EDL	00:34:28,800	00:34:31,760	| VfD_E50 |	keep doing research but uh reach out and
EDL	00:34:31,760	00:34:33,599	| VfD_E50 |	get involved with DARPA
EDL	00:34:33,599	00:34:35,199	| VfD_E50 |	all right you hear that listeners it's a
EDL	00:34:35,199	00:34:37,280	| VfD_E50 |	pitch for you guys to get in touch and I
EDL	00:34:37,280	00:34:40,000	| VfD_E50 |	should point out that the acronym aceta
EDL	00:34:40,000	00:34:42,719	| VfD_E50 |	stands for the scientific technical and
EDL	00:34:42,719	00:34:44,639	| VfD_E50 |	engineering assistants
EDL	00:34:44,639	00:34:45,520	| VfD_E50 |	who
EDL	00:34:45,520	00:34:47,440	| VfD_E50 |	work with program managers like you
EDL	00:34:47,440	00:34:49,199	| VfD_E50 |	gordon to take
EDL	00:34:49,199	00:34:50,800	| VfD_E50 |	programs through their entire life
EDL	00:34:50,800	00:34:52,239	| VfD_E50 |	cycles
EDL	00:34:52,239	00:34:54,159	| VfD_E50 |	so as I see it you're kind of in the
EDL	00:34:54,159	00:34:56,239	| VfD_E50 |	business of turning science fiction or
EDL	00:34:56,239	00:34:59,280	| VfD_E50 |	at least sort of visions of technology
EDL	00:34:59,280	00:35:02,320	| VfD_E50 |	into reality we've talked about a num a
EDL	00:35:02,320	00:35:04,240	| VfD_E50 |	number of the ways you're trying to do
EDL	00:35:04,240	00:35:06,880	| VfD_E50 |	that but I'm wondering if as a kind of a
EDL	00:35:06,880	00:35:08,720	| VfD_E50 |	technophile and a technology developer
EDL	00:35:08,720	00:35:11,280	| VfD_E50 |	yourself do you dream about non-existent
EDL	00:35:11,280	00:35:12,560	| VfD_E50 |	technologies
EDL	00:35:12,560	00:35:14,480	| VfD_E50 |	not yet hear technologies that you wish
EDL	00:35:14,480	00:35:18,560	| VfD_E50 |	were real things yeah well
EDL	00:35:18,720	00:35:20,400	| VfD_E50 |	you know right now
EDL	00:35:20,400	00:35:21,680	| VfD_E50 |	time travel
EDL	00:35:21,680	00:35:24,240	| VfD_E50 |	or maybe slowing time down
EDL	00:35:24,240	00:35:25,839	| VfD_E50 |	there's so much
EDL	00:35:25,839	00:35:27,119	| VfD_E50 |	that I want to do
EDL	00:35:27,119	00:35:29,040	| VfD_E50 |	and you know sometimes it's at work
EDL	00:35:29,040	00:35:31,119	| VfD_E50 |	sometimes it's it's being at home with
EDL	00:35:31,119	00:35:32,800	| VfD_E50 |	the family sometimes it's it's going and
EDL	00:35:32,800	00:35:34,560	| VfD_E50 |	doing other things and there's just not
EDL	00:35:34,560	00:35:36,960	| VfD_E50 |	enough time that would be it
EDL	00:35:36,960	00:35:38,800	| VfD_E50 |	right so that would be a technology that
EDL	00:35:38,800	00:35:40,960	| VfD_E50 |	would kind of end the lament that we all
EDL	00:35:40,960	00:35:43,760	| VfD_E50 |	have you know so many books not enough
EDL	00:35:43,760	00:35:46,079	| VfD_E50 |	time you know so so many careers to
EDL	00:35:46,079	00:35:47,680	| VfD_E50 |	pursue not enough somebody might want to
EDL	00:35:47,680	00:35:49,440	| VfD_E50 |	climb not enough time gordon I think if
EDL	00:35:49,440	00:35:50,720	| VfD_E50 |	you can actually solve that problem
EDL	00:35:50,720	00:35:52,480	| VfD_E50 |	that's the one you will be most uh
EDL	00:35:52,480	00:35:54,480	| VfD_E50 |	remembered for though I don't think
EDL	00:35:54,480	00:35:55,839	| VfD_E50 |	that's going to be a DARPA program as
EDL	00:35:55,839	00:35:57,359	| VfD_E50 |	far as I know who knows
EDL	00:35:57,359	00:35:59,280	| VfD_E50 |	but you might be able to pitch that to
EDL	00:35:59,280	00:36:01,200	| VfD_E50 |	close I just want to thank you for
EDL	00:36:01,200	00:36:03,280	| VfD_E50 |	taking us on a tour of your life as a
EDL	00:36:03,280	00:36:04,880	| VfD_E50 |	technology developer
EDL	00:36:04,880	00:36:07,839	| VfD_E50 |	as a program manager at DARPA
EDL	00:36:07,839	00:36:09,599	| VfD_E50 |	thanks evan it's been a pleasure and
EDL	00:36:09,599	00:36:11,599	| VfD_E50 |	thanks listeners for sharing this time
