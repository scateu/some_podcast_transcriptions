00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:32,227
Stealth technology, the Internet,GPS in the column of your hand alternative operation technologies, a driver of our, since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, doubt that offended that research project agency has been a driver of technology.

3
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:36,750
Welcome to voices a window entitled with core of program managers.

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,530
Their job to redefine was possible.

5
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,990
My name is Tyler McQuade since 2013, I've been a program manager in DARPA's.

6
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,950
Defence Sciences' Office, and I'm your DARPA host.

7
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,381
Tyler, I'd like to start out, which is sort of learning a little bit about you as a program manager.

8
00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:03,292
So maybe you could tell us something about your background and how that relates to the kinds of programs you've been developing.

9
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:13,560
Ivan, I've been a molecular guy, I love molecules I have since I was in high school and even beyond high schools are earlier.

10
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,200
you know, I'm a sort of a, nova junky.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,560
Cosmos, billions and billions of stars.

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,481
Well,I was more interested in the billions of molecules.

13
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:31,531
I've always wanted to be an explorer, but the time I got the age, yeah,I might explore something all the year charted.

14
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:35,395
the lands that have been charted, and there were no more uncharted land.

15
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,122
So I looked at kind of frontiers that

16
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:43,203
you couldn't see and molecules fit that look more defined in physics,

17
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:49,890
'cause you can put it in a bottle all at times, especially in the area that I am very comfortable in organic synthesis.

18
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,300
You can make stuff and see it.

19
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,940
You can test the properties, and you can play with the combination of items that are together.

20
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,430
And in really, it was sort of,

21
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,490
This palette that I could play with.

22
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,800
I really like that.

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,331
It was exploring the world in a totally different way,

24
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:20,460
always been amazed that how just putting together items and certain geometries, certain bonding patterns and can come together in two materials with all kinds of different properties in a skin and bone at the crazy rate.

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:33,940
I mean, you go from having something they can buy to something that explodes to something that makes beautiful colors to something that makes your cookie smell great and taste great events, all chemistry

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:41,210
You're a molecules guy, yeah. They're actually not that many molecules people, like you at DARPA, which is interesting.

27
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:47,542
So as a wrap of this minority, how are you taking that interesting in the form of programs

28
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:56,678
in the defense scientist office, one of the things that is going on right now, one of the ziggy's is revolutionizing science.

29
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:08,873
science but faster, better. and one of the things that is interesting about chemistry, especially when we're talking about the makers, the people who make materials, make small molecules, make medicines.

30
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,741
It is , uh, really slow process.

31
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:16,870
I really like the idea of reinventing science, and in chemistry, there is a lot of opportunity to reinvent the science.

32
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:25,240
So let me just ask, when you say we inventing science, maybe you mean the actual process that we were asking questions that we were trying to answer those questions.

33
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,333
Can you be a little more detailed about, what would you have in mind?

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,152
Men, chemistry is a tough subject.

35
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:46,920
We have lots of parameters that we don't often know how are controlling them, but if we did all of the chemistry in much more controlled environment, where the environment was being monitored, we might come up with much, much more reproducible chemistry, which will then mean it can be transportation.

36
00:03:46,920 --> 00:04:00,030
So in other words, if I have a machine that is doing the chemical reaction, recording how it does the net code that record can be sent from one love to another, so you could accelerate the same way to the end.

37
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,999
Internet allows you to accelerate how information was transport, what if you could do that with molecules.

38
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:15,830
Tyler, this might be a good time to talk a little bit about the two of the programs that you're working on, and what I have in mind is the full effect program, and they Make-It program.

39
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:37,840
So why don't we start with fold effect, full effects, that's a program, it stands for a full, did non natural with biological function in the photo, fact, program were making polymers that meet natural polymers so that we might biotherapeutics moral bust.

40
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:47,451
So right now, if you get one of the more modern drugs right now, a good portion of them are made from proteins, and some people like it,I entire bodies.

41
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:53,125
So, for example, humana or installing those are examples of protein biotherapeutics.

42
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,488
The problems they are not heat stable.

43
00:04:55,488 --> 00:05:00,471
And if something is in heat stable, it's not going to end up in a except.

44
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:04,240
So our soldiers are a very place, rather than to be most.

45
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:22,656
Bono's boomer don't have access to the most banks, medicines, as many of them are just gradual, and so we have to transport them back to an environment where you have refrigerators, you have a handling equipment that can allow you to control that the environment around the medicine.

46
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,953
What if you want to make an unnatural?

47
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:32,761
There are lots of natural fibers that we used to use, and we've replaced them with non natural fivers, because they're more robust.

48
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,430
Do you mean like silk to?

49
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,387
So what if he wanted to take the same?

50
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:44,870
So the beneficial properties are yet from plastics, and you were emerging with the beneficial properties of the biological balloons, like proteins in DNA.

51
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,000
The full effect program that is a platform.

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,150
It's about how we make those in and how we discover them.

53
00:05:50,570 --> 00:06:17,190
So in a way, if you think about all of the possible molecules that one could make the small ones, you know, like, like an aspirin or the below larger ones like these protein based medicines you're talking about, they're really sort of being infinitive to possibilities, like an infinite space that you could possibly search an example which you say here is your trying to develop some tools, even just a few people took to go explore some of the regions of this influenced space.

54
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,980
They just have not been looked at before.

55
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,620
I'm getting on my own track.

56
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,780
Oh, you're so on track.

57
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,260
It gets back to my whole desire to explore that.

58
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:33,543
I talked about, you know, but it is really about giving researchers a capability to be able to explore these, these universes.

59
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:39,690
It's almost like a hubble telescope for this particular galaxy or universal regular space.

60
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,830
So that was full of effects.

61
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,570
Young, I'm also interested in the makeup program.

62
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,300
Can you say little bit about what you're doing there Make-It is a platform technology for making small.

63
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,390
And in this particular case, we're trying to do is we're trying to democratize chemistry.

64
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:22,640
So what if you could have a system that biologists or any scientists came up and type, and the machine figured out how to Make-It, even if there was no recipe available so that the machine would figure out a possible set of ways to make something, and then we'll go about testing each one of those ways and tell it on the solution, and it would log that solution in a cloud or in its data bank.

65
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,810
And now that molecule could be made any time.

66
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:33,000
In addition, the system would also be able to have to make more of so that initially,I would do really small scale sympathies.

67
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,380
That means milligrams.

68
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,820
And then once it figured out a solution, it would also automatically scale it up.

69
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,960
Can you offer to us a concrete example?

70
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,490
maybe you could think of a, problem or a particular receptor for example on a cell that you might want as a target

71
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:58,870
Then explain how... The Make-It Framework would go about Interacting with that The receptor in prep solving a medical or other biological problem

72
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:07,610
Yeah, you know, for example, one very popular target for the heart disease is PCSKnine.

73
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,410
And so there's probably many papers that come out every year.

74
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,122
They describe inhibitors that have been discovered against that target.

75
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,123
The structures are available.

76
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:28,740
Let's say that I am a researcher, and I want to study some aspect of a complex soil system and having access to the PC inhibitor would be really useful.

77
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:39,700
But maybe I wanted one selective in a certain way that is commercially available, but somebody is reported now,I might contact that researcher who is made it before.

78
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,490
Maybe they ran out, and it can take them three months to Make-It.

79
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,575
But if I have access to Make-It device,

80
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:52,340
I could just go type in the structure and have the material, maybe the next day, or at the end of the week.

81
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,580
And in addition to that, I have it memorized.

82
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:03,107
The machine has kept that in his memory banks, university environment, for example, wants to make that they

83
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:18,600
typed it in a little bit out that day, because the solution would be, it's a way of saying chemistry has been documented since its inception, especially synthetic chemistry, through what are called experimental.

84
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,760
These are documents that the researcher is using to try to capture what they didn't.

85
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
A laboratory to make something, writing it down like a recipe

86
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:34,330
So a lot of times will leave out that we think are not necessary, but are necessary.

87
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,600
And sometimes we didn't even know there were necessary.

88
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:44,890
So when another researcher comes in and try to read that cookbook like a experimental, it might take the month to reproduce it, and it may never.

89
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:55,760
Why should we waste our human effort by not making sure that we document that outcome, that experiment in a way that can guarantee production.

90
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,030
So you're talking about capturing procedural knowledge.

91
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:09,040
Correct, yes, the Make-It system is not just the artificial intelligence system or a cloud system that's archiving.

92
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,896
It's a machine that's doing the chemistry so that the machine will be reproducible.

93
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:31,118
You'll be able to recreate that machine in any lab you want, as long as you replicate that machine faithfully(如实地), and it runs the routines that you recorded one lab versus another faithfully, you're going to reproduce chemistry everywhere you want to

94
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:41,760
one of the things that I find fascinating about DARPA, is that it is perhaps, in its place in the overall technology development ecosystem.

95
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,840
And as a program manager and someone who has been an academy,I think, also an industry.

96
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:58,625
And now here at DARPA, can you talk to us a little bit about how DARPA might be playing some interesting or perhaps even unique roles in the overall technology ecosystem.

97
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,950
And yeah, it is a very exciting role.

98
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:12,110
DARPA is that one place where we are thinking about innovation unconstraint(无拘无束), like, where can we go?

99
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,370
in my mind, the way remember doing that is because it fits our mission space.

100
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,435
If you want to create or prevent surprise, it's best to get to that new universe of chemistry sooner rather than later.

101
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:30,929
And so we take innovations from all of the other funding agencies in other words

102
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:37,508
they're seeding it, and we look for one wave with the beginning, and we pushed hard and let it across fast

103
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:55,790
DARPA is critical because we are structuring what I consider to be that crescendo(渐强) investment, as we are trending towards something amazing, and the Internet is an example, and I am really emulating that with, Make-It.

104
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,580
I want to create the Internet of molecules.

105
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:05,650
How do you change for molecules from one place to another in the same way is a 3D printing concept?

106
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,940
You have a design.

107
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,460
You could put that design on a cloud.

108
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,410
And then if you have 3D printer, you could transfer that design from one place to.

109
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,640
So they are related.

110
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,040
And I have been no, constantly inspired by what dark has done.

111
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:31,640
Is there a question, tyler, that you wish I had asked you during the discussion that I didn't, even so ask the question yourself and answer, what's my favorite aspect of chemistry?

112
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,727
The answer for most cameras?  What, what's the answer for?

113
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:42,627
Most cabinet cameras dive, and you know,I love that the structure of molecule relates to the function.

114
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,680
Now I love them.

115
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,020
Yeah, most of my friends media is for the crowd magnets, I guess

116
00:12:47,020 --> 00:13:11,790
everybody likes explosions, but I actually like the smell of organic chemistry, so pretty much amongst all actors like people going to like one flavors are thinking of, maybe it omit chocolate cheap, but actually smelling all of the esters and wondering,I wonder if that's disaster, or that I strength and tell the fluctuations, and also an astronaut refers to a particular chemical motive.

117
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,260
If I recall of my own organization must be part of it.

118
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:24,600
There's a carbon with the oxygen job, abandon a few other things we don't have to go into the details, except to say that is a particular kind of molecular motivated and variations.

119
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,130
Yeah, classic compounds.

120
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:36,720
So I,Ireally like the class of compounds that are associated with flavourings, and I don't mean just not a natural flavorings and natural unnaturally a coconut.

121
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,970
It smells the way it does because of chemistry, and that that always just really makes me excited.

122
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,780
So Tyler, I really enjoyed talking with you today about the your programs by chemistry, by dark.

123
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,180
So thanks for being here.

124
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:59,930
Ivan, it's always a pleasure to be with you, and thanks for having me and really glad to relate my thoughts about chemistry and and thank you listeners for sharing this time with us.

125
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:18,390
Tune in, next time for another Voice from DARPA.
