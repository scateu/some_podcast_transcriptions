EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:36,352	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	A window at the DARPA score of program managers
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:37,888	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Their job
EDL	00:00:38,400	00:00:39,936	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	To redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:40,960	00:00:42,240	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	My name is Ivan Amato

EDL	00:00:50,432	00:00:54,784	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	2012 he has been in that office overseeing a portfolio of projects
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:01:00,416	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	All of them with the goal of pushing Electronics into smaller faster and generally more capable territory
EDL	00:01:00,928	00:01:02,464	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The welcome Deb two voices
EDL	00:01:03,488	00:01:04,256	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Thank you Ivan
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:11,168	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Semi truck to start by just finding out a little bit about you and that's what maybe you can tell us something about your back
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:11,680	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Compound interest
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:14,240	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And how you became a program manager
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:21,664	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Well like every red-blooded American teenage boy I started playing Electric
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:22,176	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Guitar
EDL	00:01:22,688	00:01:23,456	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Back then
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:26,016	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You play through an amplifier that use vacuum
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:32,672	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And there was some cash today with the soft glow of the vacuum tubes in the warm sound that you get
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:34,720	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	When you play your guitar through them
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:38,304	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But that being naturally curious so
EDL	00:01:38,304	00:01:39,584	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Started to wonder
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:44,448	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	How they worked and how does the guitar take the motion of the strings and turn it into an electric
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,472	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Signal
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,264	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That led me a day
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,800	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Studying electromagnetics
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:53,664	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	I ended up pursuing engineering electrical engineering as a career
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:58,272	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And started working as a government program manager for the Army research office about
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:59,296	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	15 years ago
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:01,088	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Until I ended up here
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:05,184	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Let's talk a little bit about some of the programs then since
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:05,952	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The 2012
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:07,744	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That you have been overseeing
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:12,608	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And I'm thinking perhaps we can start with the terahertz electronics program
EDL	00:02:12,608	00:02:16,448	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And I'm going to try to steal your thunder slightly here by telling
EDL	00:02:16,448	00:02:22,336	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Our listeners that in 2014 that garnered a Guinness World Record but I'm going to let you talk about the programming
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:25,152	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And what that does superlative moment was
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:25,664	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Cuz when you were
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:29,248	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That was a lot of fun
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,784	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Indeed
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:34,880	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You can think about transistors like you think about guitar strings
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:39,488	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The low-frequency guitar strings can be heavy and
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:40,768	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Loose
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:46,144	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But as you move up in frequency the strings get thinner and you have to wind them tighter
EDL	00:02:46,912	00:02:52,032	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It's kind of the same with transistors when you're working at low frequencies you can get away with large dimensions
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:53,312	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And
EDL	00:02:53,312	00:02:55,104	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	As you move up in frequency
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:56,640	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Does Dimensions have to shrink
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:03:01,248	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So the terahertz electronics program we really took that to an extreme
EDL	00:03:01,760	00:03:02,784	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It's like when you're
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:05,344	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Put new strings on your guitar in your tuning it up
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:08,416	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And you're winding the strings Tighter and Tighter you think they can
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:10,976	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Get any tighter in there about to break
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:14,304	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But you still keep whining and finally you hit the note you want
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,888	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It works kind of the same way in the terrorist electronics pro
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:21,984	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So they let me just stop you a little bit before you say more about the program
EDL	00:03:21,984	00:03:24,800	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Because I'm not sure all of our listeners would have heard the
EDL	00:03:24,800	00:03:25,824	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The term terahertz
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,360	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	I know the a above middle C
EDL	00:03:27,872	00:03:31,200	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	On a guitar vibrates at 440
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,224	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Hertz at 4.
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:33,760	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	40 vibrations
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,272	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Prosecco
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,088	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Tell us what one
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,368	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Terahertz isn't
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:38,880	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Comparison to that
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,928	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	1 terahertz is
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,208	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	10 to the 12th
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,488	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Vibrations per second
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,512	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Which is one
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:51,424	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:51,936	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Cycles per second
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:54,496	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That's one trillion
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:59,360	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That's correct 1 trillion cycles per second so that's very hard to achieve
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:00,896	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In an electronic circuit right
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,176	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Yes very hard
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:07,040	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In fact when the program started none of the performers believed it could be done
EDL	00:04:07,808	00:04:10,624	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And during the program there were many instances when
EDL	00:04:12,160	00:04:15,744	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	We were thinking that maybe we should just circle the wagons and try to make the
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:18,815	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Electronics work better in a lower frequency
EDL	00:04:19,583	00:04:21,375	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But one of my colleagues Bruce Wallace
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,399	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Said that
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:25,215	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Chuck Yeager didn't get famous
EDL	00:04:25,215	00:04:27,519	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	For flying 85% of the speed of sound
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:30,847	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So if we were going to have a terahertz Electronics program
EDL	00:04:30,847	00:04:32,127	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	We were going to have
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:33,919	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Electronics at work at 1 terahertz
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:38,527	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So everybody found a new knobs to twist
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,063	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,879	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Kept working on it and finally we did hit that Mark
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:48,255	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Right okay in the end at that time that what if perhaps it is now you can
EDL	00:04:48,255	00:04:49,279	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Please let me know what the status is
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:51,327	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But it did it actually was
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:54,143	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The fastest switching electronic circuit on the planet
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:57,983	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It's the fastest Linear Amplifier on the planet
EDL	00:04:58,495	00:05:02,335	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	At the time and still is and I imagine it will be for some time to come
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:08,223	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Okay so it took you in a few hundred Inspire your performers those
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:10,783	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Groups that work on this to to wax
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:11,551	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Achieve this
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:14,111	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You went to Great pains to do this
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:16,927	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	What what what what do you get by having a terahertz
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,231	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	There's two things you get
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:21,791	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Removing transistor performance up in freak
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:25,119	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	One is you access much wider bandwidth
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:27,679	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Which is like having a bigger pipe
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,471	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	How to push your data through in a communication
EDL	00:05:30,495	00:05:31,519	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And the other is
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:34,335	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	If you work on a transistor enough to
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:35,871	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	To make it
EDL	00:05:35,871	00:05:37,663	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Capable of working at a terahertz
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:42,783	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You have to eliminate all the parasitic capacitances resistances inductance
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,831	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That limited
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:45,599	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Performance
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:48,415	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And then when you take that same transistor and operate down
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,487	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	At lower frequencies saying the millimeter wave
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:54,047	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The performance of the transistor is much better
EDL	00:05:54,815	00:05:56,095	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You get lower noise
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,375	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Better linearity
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:00,703	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Better dynamic range and maybe most importantly better power a fish
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:03,263	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Interesting soda get this
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,287	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Circuitry that that
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,055	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That can switch it
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,079	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It hurts
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:12,479	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	I got that has additional benefits just because you push the technology for it and you can apply it elsewhere
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:13,759	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Electronic space
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,527	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Exactly right
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:17,343	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Let's move to another program that
EDL	00:06:17,343	00:06:18,879	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Bully gets back
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:19,903	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That's what we were talking about
EDL	00:06:19,903	00:06:21,439	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	For which is vacuum line
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,463	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Electronics
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:27,327	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Ice-cold invest in that stands for Innovative vacuum Electronics
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,375	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Science and Technology Program
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,679	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	I'd love you to tell us a little bit about
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:36,287	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The origin of that program what problems and where what technologies is it is
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,823	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Designs to create
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:39,871	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And what its status is at the mall
EDL	00:06:41,407	00:06:46,015	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Terahertz Electronics program pushed solid-state Electronics up to an extremely high frequency
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:51,647	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But if you're trying to get extremely high frequency and extremely high power at the same time
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:54,207	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Vacuum tubes are pretty much her only option
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:57,535	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The problem is that vacuum tubes scale
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:04,191	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Without braiding frequency the dimensions get smaller and smaller as you go up in frequency and so at some point you just can't build
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:07,519	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So the invest program is exploring
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:11,359	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Several different areas one is
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:14,175	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Advanced manufacturing for example using
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,455	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	3D printing
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:16,991	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Additive Manufacturing
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:23,903	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Division there is to be able to draw the tube in a CAD program ship the cad file to the printer and ended
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:25,695	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	End up with a millimeter wave tube
EDL	00:07:26,719	00:07:33,119	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	While I write out of the machine to computer aided design
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:35,679	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You have to make the cavities in which
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,727	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The frequency
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:41,311	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Occurring really small smaller than ever
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,103	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	4 for the frequency
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:51,295	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The cavity Dimensions get smaller in the alignment requirements get more critical so if you could build the whole tube at once
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,111	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Do you have the dimensions and the alignment
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,879	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In one shot
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:00,767	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	There's another thrust in the program that's looking at modeling because as you move up in frequency
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:06,655	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Small variations in the manufacturing process can produce large variations in device performance
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:08,959	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And you'd like to be able to know
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,775	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Which of the dimensional parameters is most important
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,335	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So you need a modeling program to do that
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,383	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Then there are
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:18,431	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Other components of the tube
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The cathode
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:23,807	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In the beam wave interaction structure where we just went out looking for
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,111	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	New and interesting ideas
EDL	00:08:26,623	00:08:28,671	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Maybe that would just blow away the current
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:33,791	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Way of building tubes and eliminate the problem with manufacturing all together
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:36,607	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Okay so let's say the program
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:40,191	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Ends up being successful and why shouldn't we think otherwise
EDL	00:08:40,191	00:08:42,495	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So you end up having
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:46,335	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	A new kind of family of Technologies where you've got
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,359	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Does high frequency
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,895	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And you got the high power
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:54,015	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Where do you imagine these Technologies of finding an important place
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So you hear a lot about
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:00,415	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	5G is the next generation of cell phone communication
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:03,999	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You're talking about using frequencies are in the millimeter wave
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:05,023	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Region of the spectrum
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,303	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But still
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,839	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Hard to get
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Devices
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,631	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That operate in that
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:14,495	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Range especially with enough power to close a Communications link over a long distance
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,055	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So that's where the invest program comes in
EDL	00:09:17,823	00:09:20,127	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You get millimeter wave operation
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:21,151	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Anti power
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,943	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In an affordable
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,967	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Power efficient
EDL	00:09:23,967	00:09:28,063	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Device using your pipe metaphor which I really like you have your
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,599	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Will have bigger pipes on it
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,647	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Connecting our cell phones to the system
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,927	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	With this technology that
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,439	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Might come out of
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:35,231	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Yes absolutely
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,815	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You're not going to find a vacuum tube in your handset
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:43,423	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	I'm pretty sure but it could see some using base stations and definitely military communicate
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:48,799	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	All right. So let's talk about just one more program and if this is one of your latest
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:54,175	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Which is a mouthful to say I wanted to the short forms I like is
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,943	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	M cubic
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:57,503	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	He actually write that out that's m
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:10:00,575	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	3 IC but the wheel long form
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:01,087	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Alce
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:05,439	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It'll take 2 seconds or 3 magnetic miniaturized
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:10,303	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And monolithically integrated components program did I actually say that right
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,887	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Yes that's exactly how I feel like I've accomplished something
EDL	00:10:14,399	00:10:20,799	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Okay well the primary goal of the program is to be able to integrate magnetic materials with the semiconductor
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:23,103	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Doctor devices that everybody knows and loves
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:23,615	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Today
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	If you
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:28,735	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Dive a little deeper into it weave
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:32,831	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Achieved an incredible degree of integration of electronic components like
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:34,879	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Resistors transistors and capacitors
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,415	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Largely because
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:38,207	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You have a large
EDL	00:10:38,207	00:10:40,255	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Pallet of materials to work with
EDL	00:10:40,255	00:10:43,071	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That have properties that are relevant to electronic components
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:45,119	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	With Magnetic components
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:47,167	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You're only three elements
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,215	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That have intrinsic
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:49,983	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Magnetic properties
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,799	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So we've been very difficult
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:55,871	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	To find a way to integrate those with semiconductor process
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:00,479	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	What we're trying to do with the program is leverage some work that
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,295	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It's been done in Material Science on magnetic materials
EDL	00:11:03,807	00:11:05,343	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Over the last decade or so
EDL	00:11:06,111	00:11:08,159	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	With microwave engineering
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,207	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	To produce integrated components
EDL	00:11:10,719	00:11:13,535	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Where you can actually access that magnetic physics
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:15,071	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In an electronic circuit
EDL	00:11:15,071	00:11:16,607	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In a very compact
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,119	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Form factor
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:21,215	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So let me ask you this because I'm already Amazed by the chips in Arlo
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,799	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	They can do so many things they have
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:27,359	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	First part of somebody Technologies
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:30,943	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	What more are you going to get by by taking
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:35,551	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Small magnetic components now and integrating them into those those ubiquitous chip
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:40,927	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	From the user point of view you probably won't see anything much different
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:46,815	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But from the technologist point of view lower frequency systems use magnetic components all the time
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,631	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But they're large and heavy and
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:50,399	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Tend to be
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:56,287	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Difficult to integrate so you kind of push that functionality out to the edges of the circuits
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:58,847	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And use it in a non-ideal way
EDL	00:11:59,359	00:12:03,711	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Give me an example or two though of a specific technology where these magnetic
EDL	00:12:03,711	00:12:04,735	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Components
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:07,039	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Are Central to it even though they're not
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:13,439	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Yet integrated onto the ships themselves but they're somehow in the overall system to what might be an overall system that has the electronic
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And some of these
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:15,231	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Magnetic components
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:18,303	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Wall picture of walkie-talkie for example
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:21,631	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You've got a transmitter and receiver
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,911	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But you've only got one in ten
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:25,215	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	There's a magnetic component
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,751	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That isolates
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,847	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The transmitter from the receiver and connect both of them TV antenna at the same time
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:34,175	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	If you didn't have that you have to have two antennas
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:36,479	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	No weapon higher frequencies
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:38,527	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You can still
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Do that
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,831	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But the
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,647	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Performance of the components drops off some
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:44,927	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Substantially because
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:47,231	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	They're separate from the electronics
EDL	00:12:47,999	00:12:50,815	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	What we're hoping to do with in cubic
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:51,583	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Is bring
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,631	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That functionality back into
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,727	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Interaction with the electronic circuit so you can have that same kind of
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,799	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Ease of operation at the higher frequency
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:03,103	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Right now you have to
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:07,711	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Try to mimic that magnetic physics with electronic components and there's really nothing that
EDL	00:13:08,223	00:13:09,247	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Does quite the same
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:10,271	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Job
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,855	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And for those engineer types
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:18,463	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Out there who are listening I think the component you were referring to just now is that known as a circulator
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:21,535	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Wow I've been this great yes it is
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:27,423	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	I guess I just impressed you and Jessica you mentioned three complaints were not going to talk about them but I'm just now intrigued by what they are
EDL	00:13:27,423	00:13:29,471	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The circulator is one of them at one of the other two
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:32,287	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Well in the program we're looking at
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,335	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Frequency selective limiter
EDL	00:13:34,847	00:13:35,615	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Which
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:36,383	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Can
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:39,455	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Through the natural physical process
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:40,223	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Cancel out
EDL	00:13:40,735	00:13:43,551	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Interfering signals whether there intentional or not
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:46,623	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And also at a degraded inductors which
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:51,231	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Have been kind of a holy grail for a millimeter wave circuits for a long time
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,511	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And just
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:54,047	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Give Me One Reason Why
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,071	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	There they've been soaked up
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:14:02,239	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Well right now since you don't have access to Magnetic materials on chip the inductors 10 to take up
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:04,799	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	A substantial percentage of the circuit
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,311	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Hbase
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:09,407	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	If you have a magnetic material you can shrink goes down substantially
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,199	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Make a hole chip smaller
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:13,503	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That means it works better and it's also cheaper
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,551	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Can can you say in a sentence or two what
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:16,575	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Function inductor
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:19,391	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The inductor
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:21,183	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Smoothes out
EDL	00:14:21,183	00:14:25,023	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	High frequency signals it tends to pass lower frequency signals
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:26,815	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And stops higher freaking
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:28,351	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:33,215	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	A very low frequencies there used to filter power supplies make noise Quiet power supplies
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,031	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	At higher frequencies are used is part of
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:39,871	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Filter circuits to select out the frequencies you want and the frequency she don't want
EDL	00:14:40,639	00:14:45,247	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	So text me or talk about all of those programs there others that you

EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:48,575	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	We're not going to talk about all of them now
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:55,231	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But what I would like to talk about is these programs and you as a program manager in a place like DARPA
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:15:00,863	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And what I'm getting at here is going to drop it is it's just part of it ate the overall innovation
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:07,263	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Ecosystem you've been here since 2012 you got these programs we've talked about what is it like to be
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,287	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Be here in end
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:10,591	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	How do you think DARPA is unique
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:14,175	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In The Innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:15:16,223	00:15:17,503	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Coming to DARPA is like
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:20,831	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Grabbing the nose cone of a rocket and holding on for dear life
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,647	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It's a fast-moving place
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:26,719	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That has a significant impact on the trajectory of
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:28,511	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Technology for the nation
EDL	00:15:29,023	00:15:30,815	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And being part of that is an incredible
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,327	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Thrill
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:33,887	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	The idea that you can
EDL	00:15:34,655	00:15:36,703	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Come up with a technical idea that
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:37,727	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Interesting to you
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:39,263	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,543	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Create a community
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:42,335	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	To pursue that ideas is
EDL	00:15:42,847	00:15:44,639	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Add experience you won't get anywhere else
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:49,759	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	You can take flyer bets on crazy things like integrated magnetics with semiconductors
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,271	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	End
EDL	00:15:50,783	00:15:53,343	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	People will actually Soldier up and tell you how they're going to do it
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:57,439	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Right so what you just said about creating communities is just something that
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:16:00,767	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That I and II guess I've observed here to in the short time I've been here
EDL	00:16:01,279	00:16:04,351	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	And I think maybe press one of the most valuable things that happens here
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:05,119	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Sword art by which is
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:09,215	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Is it true that you are the program managers do bring together
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:11,775	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Handfuls of research groups
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:14,079	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That otherwise probably would not have gotten together
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:15,871	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But in getting together now
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:21,503	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Create event bring together mindset skillsets toolsets ways of doing ways of thinking
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,831	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That are unique and therefore can push into new
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,367	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Technological Terror
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:29,695	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Did I overstate things are that about right
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,231	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Now that's about right it's very exciting
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:35,327	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Can you name one science fiction technology that you just
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:35,839	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Wish
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,167	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Live
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:42,495	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Since I commute weekly between DARPA and my home in North Carolina
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:44,799	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	That would be teleportation of course
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:50,175	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	But I don't think we'll ever get there we don't have any wireless communication technology that can
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,711	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Can transfer the amount of information
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:52,991	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	It would take you
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,783	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Completely disassembled Enrique
EDL	00:16:54,783	00:16:55,551	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Construct a human
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,599	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In any reasonable amount of time
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:17:00,927	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Imagine having to encode the information that
EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:03,487	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	In every strand of DNA in every cell of your
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Your body
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,303	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Every memory you've ever had

EDL	00:17:07,839	00:17:08,351	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Scene
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,143	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Take that apart
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:10,911	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Turn it into beds
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:13,727	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Send it somewhere and then rebuild it in
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,495	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Physical world
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:15,775	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Driving might be
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:23,711	| Episode 04 The Terahertzian |	Dev I do hope that teleportation does become a reality at some point in the future is a very least to make your
