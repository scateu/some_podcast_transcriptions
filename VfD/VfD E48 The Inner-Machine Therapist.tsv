EDL	00:00:11,800	00:00:30,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Step of technology, the internet, GPS in the column of your hand are tonight technologies, a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, doubt this offensive best research projects agency has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:30,730	00:00:38,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Welcome to Voices from darker a window on the dark as core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:39,320	00:00:42,810	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	My name is, I went a motto, and I am your dog by host today
EDL	00:00:42,810	00:01:17,554	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I am pleased to be talking with mr john francisco margin, though I will call him at the rest of a cyber security technology developer, jail dark as a program manager in the agencies, information invasion office in january twenty twenty, just as the cold front end up with getting under way, his previous job was with raising on BBMtechnologies, where he was chief scientist in a senior racial fellow before that, he worked for a number of companies among the verizon general and SAIC, and roads centered on communications and information management
EDL	00:01:17,554	00:01:35,440	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I should point out the BBMtechnologies, which was acquired by brazil in two thousand nine as an important historical connection with urban in nineteen sixty nine, is delivered four inch interface message processors, which were pivotal components, enabling the birth of opponent and ultimately the internet
EDL	00:01:35,880	00:01:48,260	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Moreover, beyond vice president for engineering psychology, from one thousand nine hundred and fifty sixty two, JCare late later, was one of darkest, most visionary research managers and leaders in its early years
EDL	00:01:48,570	00:01:49,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, back to john
EDL	00:01:49,490	00:01:53,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	France is back to jail as an undergraduate year university
EDL	00:01:53,060	00:01:56,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	He double major in electrical engineering and operations research
EDL	00:01:56,790	00:02:08,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	He builds on that foundation by earning a master of science as the green management with the concentration and information systems from m, it is slowing school of management, a few other details to share
EDL	00:02:08,500	00:02:14,866	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Jail is a private pilot and a ham radio operator, and has more than forty patterns to his name
EDL	00:02:14,866	00:02:24,119	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They've titles like wireless vehicle, slash journalist and public announcement system, malware and temporary system, computer architecture
EDL	00:02:24,119	00:02:30,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And this one, a bit of an space debris using upper atmosphere and more text generated
EDL	00:02:30,990	00:02:40,205	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Jia, thanks for joining me in the studio today and to share with me a tale about your ongoing adventure in technology development
EDL	00:02:40,205	00:02:51,314	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I'm really happy to, so we'll get your life as a program manager soon enough, and also to those patterns at the angels briefly, but let's go straight to those hobbies
EDL	00:02:51,314	00:02:53,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You fly plans, and you are a ham radio
EDL	00:02:53,690	00:02:55,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So just briefly tell me about those interests
EDL	00:02:55,530	00:02:56,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And how is the party of your life now? 
EDL	00:02:57,380	00:03:00,000	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Flying has been part of my life about twenty six years
EDL	00:03:00,000	00:03:24,985	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Here's at this point, my wife came home from a business trip announced that she wanted to learn to fly, and I take along and got my pilot license, along with incidents have gone on to get multi engine and instrument ratings and conflict lighters and seaplanes, well, but so it's a two pilot households, which makes a discussions with the budget committee on changes to the airplane
EDL	00:03:24,985	00:03:25,970	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Ma said, much easier
EDL	00:03:27,060	00:03:30,100	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Ham radio has been part of my life for much longer
EDL	00:03:30,100	00:03:42,270	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I've been a handwritten operator for over fifty years, and during that time, have operated outside the us and really got involved with packet radio when the truth came up. 
EDL	00:03:42,920	00:03:50,080	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Written for those who are not in account in that world of hamburger, just give us a little bit of flavor of the kind of content that flows over the
EDL	00:03:50,080	00:03:51,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are ways when you are buying the controls. 
EDL	00:03:51,850	00:04:00,000	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It has jokingly been said that ham radio is one of the few hobbies where you build equipment so you can talk about your hobby
EDL	00:04:00,000	00:04:03,373	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's really set into several different communities
EDL	00:04:03,373	00:04:05,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There were experimenters
EDL	00:04:05,060	00:04:14,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are people who like to do public service and public support, such as emergency communications during floods and hurricanes
EDL	00:04:14,530	00:04:18,450	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And there those who enjoy handling traffic and. 
EDL	00:04:18,450	00:04:21,267	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Just right, actually uses code now, very interesting
EDL	00:04:21,267	00:04:25,897	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The european european community resilience is becoming so much more important
EDL	00:04:25,897	00:04:28,550	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so being a position to really be part of that solution. 
EDL	00:04:28,550	00:04:38,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you really get to see and work with first responders, and those who have to deal with with those that get hurt
EDL	00:04:38,340	00:04:50,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it really affected my whole way of thinking about what the role communications was in our society and what it could do for good in terms of helping people when they are need help. 
EDL	00:04:50,650	00:04:52,762	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So i'm beginning to hear it hints from that
EDL	00:04:52,762	00:04:54,522	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Interesting, what are you doing now
EDL	00:04:54,522	00:04:56,635	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so we'll get to that just a little bit
EDL	00:04:56,635	00:05:04,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I do like my discussion partners in the partners in the park, some sense of society of the original story of your interest and patients
EDL	00:05:04,490	00:05:16,840	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so if there were people or teachers or parents, are some a pipeline or some failure, just whatever in your earlier years, we're important in the development of your interest in the industry, professional integrity. 
EDL	00:05:16,840	00:05:33,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Whether there were a couple of people I grew up in a university town with, with teaching parents, and my dad was a was a professor yell, and I remembered an early meeting with one with his ph address
EDL	00:05:33,880	00:05:44,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Professor looks, and he would always bring me a trickett of a piece of patrick would have an eggs, something
EDL	00:05:44,190	00:05:45,450	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And we talk about it
EDL	00:05:45,450	00:05:50,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I learned a little bit from it, and one day I was really proud
EDL	00:05:50,720	00:05:56,580	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had gotten a four hundred power microscope for my birthday, and I wanted to show this to professor louds
EDL	00:05:56,580	00:06:00,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And he said, oh, you know, I can
EDL	00:06:00,030	00:06:10,550	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The four hundred power microscope because I have, these are techniques magnifier that I wear around my neck, and I can see more through that than I can understand
EDL	00:06:10,550	00:06:15,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I could never understand what comes from a foreign repair microscope
EDL	00:06:15,340	00:06:17,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I was crushed as a little kid
EDL	00:06:17,120	00:06:17,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had this thing
EDL	00:06:17,830	00:06:18,940	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I was really proud of
EDL	00:06:19,390	00:06:31,140	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And then he gave me the techniques manufacturer, and I still have, it is hanging on a book in my home and what he really made me do was realized
EDL	00:06:31,140	00:06:45,520	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Observation is incredibly important for doing science, and that the power of tool, the, the speed of a tool is not as important as really thinking about what you're trying to see and what you are trying to see him
EDL	00:06:45,870	00:06:50,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so that really affected me as I, as I grow up. 
EDL	00:06:50,690	00:06:53,700	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	HMM, it sounds like a lesson you continued to embrace. 
EDL	00:06:53,700	00:06:54,520	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Yeah, it's, it's
EDL	00:06:54,520	00:06:58,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I try to think it's simply about things as I possibly can. 
EDL	00:06:58,830	00:07:00,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Such transformative
EDL	00:07:00,030	00:07:01,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Yeah, thanks for that story
EDL	00:07:01,320	00:07:05,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what's now, can I move into your dark experience
EDL	00:07:05,830	00:07:07,750	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And let's start from the beginning
EDL	00:07:07,750	00:07:09,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you have been here for more than you
EDL	00:07:09,710	00:07:11,050	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You want to be a second europe
EDL	00:07:11,440	00:07:24,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I arrived in january twenty twenty, which was just two months before the world health organization and declared south korea too, in the spirit of it, to have a kind of ascended to pandemic
EDL	00:07:24,240	00:07:26,832	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what was the course of events that got you
EDL	00:07:26,832	00:07:29,425	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Your job here is an it ULprogram manager
EDL	00:07:29,425	00:07:35,043	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	This is a manager in the information innovation offers one of darkness, executive offices
EDL	00:07:35,043	00:07:36,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And then what was it like
EDL	00:07:36,340	00:07:40,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Get hearing and just very shortly after, you know, this sort of being this covered status. 
EDL	00:07:40,720	00:07:47,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Well, i've been a performer, which is the dark of violence for somebody who who executes on the program
EDL	00:07:47,240	00:07:53,980	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I've been a performer and PIfor daughter for about twenty years on and off through that period of time
EDL	00:07:54,450	00:08:09,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And some of the people like work with headband, explorer managers and another people who I formed good friendships with went off to become program managers, a deputy of structures and obstructors
EDL	00:08:09,320	00:08:18,540	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I had a good long affiliation with dark, but doing research, working with the PMto develop new program, ideas and alike
EDL	00:08:19,070	00:08:26,550	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it was coming to dark with something I always wanted to do, but I needed to wait for the right time in my career
EDL	00:08:26,550	00:08:30,810	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I wanted to be sure my son had graduated from college
EDL	00:08:31,130	00:08:40,420	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I wanted to to achieve certain milestones and also get some people in place at my old employer to make sure that the research could carry out
EDL	00:08:41,200	00:08:51,290	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I also wanted to have the right set of ideas for programs I didn't show and went around for a year trying to come up with an idea for a program
EDL	00:08:51,660	00:08:56,110	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I had my low basket of program ideas, and I came in the door
EDL	00:08:56,110	00:08:57,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I was all excited
EDL	00:08:57,400	00:08:58,930	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I started up
EDL	00:08:58,930	00:09:01,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And part of the reason for coming to dark days
EDL	00:09:01,790	00:09:15,407	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are several neat things that dark program managers get to do one they get to talk with other people who are, who are in the organization and get their ideas and get them completely unfiltered
EDL	00:09:15,407	00:09:20,672	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But the other one is, you can tap into researchers all across the globe
EDL	00:09:20,672	00:09:27,417	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You call up and say, hi, I am from DARPA, and I was wondering what you were thinking about something
EDL	00:09:27,417	00:09:34,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And usually the conversation will run far longer than you ever anticipated, or you ever even planned
EDL	00:09:35,100	00:09:46,857	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But you're sorry, when it's over, i've been able to talk with a cow attack at my tea, and they'll call back with another idea afterwards
EDL	00:09:46,857	00:09:49,953	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That is unbelievably exciting
EDL	00:09:49,953	00:10:02,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And for someone having a kind of access is the great destination when I could ever hope for the other big piece about this is you get to go see their lab, and you got to go see stuff happening
EDL	00:10:03,160	00:10:10,220	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And as you can guess, from being a pilot, from being a ham radio operator, i'd love to touch the technology
EDL	00:10:10,220	00:10:11,200	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I love to play with that
EDL	00:10:11,200	00:10:12,390	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I love to do things
EDL	00:10:12,990	00:10:27,220	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so two months after I arrive, I cannot go see the lab anymore, and I can't see my coworkers, because it will doing our part to trying, and it be safe and keep other people safe
EDL	00:10:27,690	00:10:30,390	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so it was a little bit maddening
EDL	00:10:30,390	00:10:39,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You know, it's sort of like going to a giant technological toy store, but you can only see through the windows. 
EDL	00:10:39,410	00:10:40,200	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What's there
EDL	00:10:40,880	00:10:43,750	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it says clothes indefinitely. 
EDL	00:10:43,750	00:10:54,310	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly that has been my single big frustration since coming here is I cannot go as fast as the organization normally would let me go
EDL	00:10:54,890	00:11:00,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And i'm seeing a substantial difference with the real. 
EDL	00:11:00,030	00:11:00,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	我不能。
EDL	00:11:01,370	00:11:02,350	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Boys are exciting
EDL	00:11:02,350	00:11:12,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They are interesting to hear, just in the the kind of specific laws that a program manager we can experience in a, in a situation like copyright
EDL	00:11:12,660	00:11:16,623	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I mean, cooper just brought a thousand million different kinds of losses
EDL	00:11:16,623	00:11:24,880	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So interesting to hear you express the specific sort of loss that program just loves to be miss the performance of researchers working with you need to be private
EDL	00:11:24,880	00:11:25,860	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That connection
EDL	00:11:25,860	00:11:34,960	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Let's now talk about your, the programs that you run, one of them, you develop from scratch and just got the green light will be talking a little bit about that
EDL	00:11:34,960	00:11:38,899	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What started by talking about one of the programs, jewellery, heritage
EDL	00:11:38,899	00:11:45,624	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So this was called search late that had been up and running for about a year or more before you check it over from an outgoing program
EDL	00:11:45,624	00:11:49,640	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Manager is often that often happens the end of the course between program
EDL	00:11:49,640	00:11:54,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So in brief, what absent capability was the importance for the program
EDL	00:11:54,340	00:11:59,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What is the invasion and pointed at this point, and what is it said? 
EDL	00:12:00,000	00:12:05,730	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	First, I want to comment on the idea of the hand off from one program manager to another
EDL	00:12:05,730	00:12:11,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I was extremely lucky in that I knew the PM, who quite well, who I was taking over from
EDL	00:12:11,710	00:12:13,816	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so, and I was bad
EDL	00:12:13,816	00:12:24,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Jonathan smith, james, and he, he has been a visionary in the communications area for a number of years
EDL	00:12:24,060	00:12:38,820	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I, Iwant to have long double gamest tell you that, but he really does tend to lead in the in the digital networking area, and so is very nice
EDL	00:12:38,820	00:12:52,880	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had an understanding of his vision going forward, and I was able to wrap some of my own, my own experiences inside of tokyo to be able to to bring it forward
EDL	00:12:52,880	00:13:03,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So it certainly, yes, he is evolved into is a need solution to a very thorny problem
EDL	00:13:03,610	00:13:21,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And one of the things that I think many people listening to this experience of recovery was live on zoom or life on teams, and occasionally really will have the all I can see your pictures breaking up
EDL	00:13:22,210	00:13:23,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's getting jealous
EDL	00:13:25,280	00:13:54,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The one of the reasons that this occurs are actually doesn't occur all the time is because of a service on networks called QOSor quality, which allows certain streams of data that are very time critical to be given priority, or to have their cheater, or the variability in a packet delivery reduced, and that allows for good video, good audio
EDL	00:13:54,760	00:14:08,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And if you're doing things like transferring a file or uploading a new version of your system or book, transferring a thousand pictures from your vacation, those can have a little bit of general
EDL	00:14:08,150	00:14:16,020	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They can have a little bit of bouncing back and forth, but also, fortunately, people are also starting to become more security country
EDL	00:14:16,020	00:14:26,201	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What that means is they're traffic where the data coming in and out of their houses or another businesses is wrapped in an incredible group
EDL	00:14:26,201	00:14:35,502	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And what this does is, it prevents the networks from really understanding what the traffic is that they're carrying
EDL	00:14:35,502	00:14:37,874	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So it'll see upstanding, you
EDL	00:14:37,874	00:14:39,980	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	All the pictures of my
EDL	00:14:39,980	00:14:43,310	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It was also having a phone conversation over the same network connection
EDL	00:14:44,100	00:14:45,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's all equipped it
EDL	00:14:45,650	00:14:53,760	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So therefore our voice gets the same priority as the picture of the fish record, not particularly useful
EDL	00:14:53,760	00:15:15,840	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So with such like those is one of the things inside the search light is that it's able to understand what those traffic clothes are, even though they are increased, and it lets the network provide priority, and I need to be very careful in explaining how this technology works
EDL	00:15:16,530	00:15:29,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It can understand with the flowers it cannot underscore, cannot be see what the flow is carrying, right or not, examine the content, not examining the content
EDL	00:15:29,490	00:15:39,590	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is looking at the behavior of the floor and then moderating the movement of that flow based on the need for priority for that type of traffic
EDL	00:15:39,590	00:15:42,110	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what it does is it preserves privacy
EDL	00:15:42,570	00:15:54,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It preserves confident reality, but it also preserves the flow improvement capabilities of the network, so that is really a new way of doing it
EDL	00:15:55,370	00:16:08,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the other thing that it does is, it allows for moderating other traffic flows, slowing the loading of the fish pictures of access so it can be done not directly in the path
EDL	00:16:08,430	00:16:13,810	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So it gives carriers a lot more flexibility to use the band with that they have
EDL	00:16:14,440	00:16:23,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And as we saw a journey of it, managing a band with is important mechanism for allowing us to cope with problems
EDL	00:16:23,950	00:16:30,560	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the game goes back to how can communications be improved or moderated to make people life better? 
EDL	00:16:30,930	00:16:38,500	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	If we register to give people a concrete sense of what this technology delivers, I say it fulfills the vision that you had
EDL	00:16:38,500	00:16:42,680	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The previous program manager had, maybe the access to reach these metrics
EDL	00:16:42,680	00:16:48,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But how does it make life better for either, you know, a civilian, or perhaps in it is offensive. 
EDL	00:16:48,610	00:16:55,009	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In any place where there is, let's bend with them could potentially be used
EDL	00:16:55,009	00:16:58,875	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It provides a better mechanism for sharing APP
EDL	00:16:58,875	00:17:02,210	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So we get that hi priority gets the high priority
EDL	00:17:02,580	00:17:11,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So i'll use the home example on this, both my wife and I working hard during coffee, both on zoom calls
EDL	00:17:12,530	00:17:16,606	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I am also downloading a copy of the operating system
EDL	00:17:16,606	00:17:32,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had to stop downloading the copy of the operating system because I consumed all of the coming into the house, just doing that, that file transfer, if I had a certified enabled system, I wouldn't even thought about it
EDL	00:17:33,410	00:17:35,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Calls would have gone through without any problem
EDL	00:17:35,710	00:17:36,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They would not have been dropped
EDL	00:17:36,830	00:17:39,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They would not have been jealousy or blocky
EDL	00:17:39,890	00:17:46,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And my operating system copy my copy of the would have arrived a minute and half later
EDL	00:17:47,020	00:17:49,350	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Then it, then the otherwise would have
EDL	00:17:49,350	00:17:53,350	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's an example of how it can make things better
EDL	00:17:53,350	00:17:57,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Another example is uh in telemedicine eye
EDL	00:17:57,850	00:18:05,100	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And this is important to both do d and civil, because we can get the medical personnel into the field
EDL	00:18:05,100	00:18:06,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Words needed at all time
EDL	00:18:06,790	00:18:14,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So telemedicine is a very important mechanism for first round of care to everyone have no field
EDL	00:18:14,360	00:18:27,826	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It means that if somebody is downloading a minute manual for truck, it's not, it'll take a little bit longer to get there, but the telemedicine session goes on on in a rapid
EDL	00:18:27,826	00:18:29,730	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's another example of it. 
EDL	00:18:30,300	00:18:35,860	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Right you now cannot be, want to be in the middle of either a procedure or giving instructions for seizure
EDL	00:18:35,860	00:18:42,760	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you freeze, and then you leave people on the other end wondering what they should do in medical situation. 
EDL	00:18:42,760	00:18:49,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly, you don't want the media to be seen and be certain too, and then just died. 
EDL	00:18:50,390	00:18:58,960	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So now let's move on to another program that you're inherited in this one, actually, really, I think, will be relevant
EDL	00:18:58,960	00:19:20,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Many people who buying more and more internet connected technologies, which is scheduled when you think of all of these things, they are collectively known as the internet of things i'm referring to the program called configuration, security or concept for short, had its beginnings in the twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen time frame
EDL	00:19:20,490	00:19:33,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You took the pattern in twenty twenty again, soon after you start suddenly, unlike many program managers, you, you are shepherding two programs and certainly thinking about the third one that will talk about just a little bit
EDL	00:19:33,790	00:19:45,100	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So some of this technology already is getting adopted in places as the USnavy and also the federal railroad administration, on other places
EDL	00:19:45,100	00:19:51,230	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Before we talk about the program in some detail, i'd like just to hear what your definition is of internet things. 
EDL	00:19:51,710	00:19:56,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Internet of things has a whole bunch of different conditions to it
EDL	00:19:57,240	00:19:58,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In my household
EDL	00:19:58,830	00:20:06,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I have a internet connected rabbits and include internet connected piggy bank, as well as weather stations
EDL	00:20:06,500	00:20:12,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	As a matter of fact, several hundred devices are sitting on my home. 
EDL	00:20:12,040	00:20:19,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, now you don't want to ask the interruption of talking about the definition here, but you just have to explain what is an internet connected rabbit. 
EDL	00:20:19,240	00:20:23,580	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	This is something called the neighbor's technique out of friends
EDL	00:20:23,970	00:20:26,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It has years that vehicle back and forth
EDL	00:20:27,100	00:20:31,170	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And right now, all the servers around by volunteers around the world
EDL	00:20:31,490	00:20:58,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But it was a very, very early incentive of what would be something like the amazon legs, and it now evolves too, basically telling you things like you look really good today, or that it's nervous, and people have made, nevertheless attack or*****ras with several hundred of these things
EDL	00:20:59,070	00:21:10,000	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	My son found it when he was studying overseas and and brought it back, and it's become part of a petting zoo of internet of things, devices. 
EDL	00:21:10,000	00:21:15,727	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, so I no longer have a very longer animal in mind when you say that, and you will clarify it
EDL	00:21:15,727	00:21:23,770	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Sometimes it seems a little bit in some homework in character, though you always be so you do have animals in your life. 
EDL	00:21:23,770	00:21:28,050	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And and I actually have an internet of things behalf
EDL	00:21:28,050	00:21:33,099	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I get to limit me back from the behalf that helps me manage and understand
EDL	00:21:33,099	00:21:34,681	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And health bees are doing
EDL	00:21:34,681	00:21:44,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I can take the temperature of the humidity and away the hive remotely, which gives me some indication, is to changes in the amount of brutal, the amount of money. 
EDL	00:21:45,480	00:21:50,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, so you are richly connected through various internet of things in your own personal life
EDL	00:21:50,320	00:21:53,960	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In some ways, you already define maybe what you need to do
EDL	00:21:53,960	00:21:58,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Things is that I didn't rub to you so finish that definition, then talk about concert. 
EDL	00:21:58,040	00:22:12,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So internet of things is when mechanical or or cyber activators and sensors are connected to the, to the internet versus people
EDL	00:22:12,120	00:22:14,203	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So we have an internet
EDL	00:22:14,203	00:22:30,133	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We have a worldwide web, which connects people, internet of things, connects the stuff that were working with, and part of the challenges with doing is these are usually traditionally
EDL	00:22:30,133	00:22:34,195	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They've been very traditionally ten years
EDL	00:22:34,195	00:22:39,458	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They're in very simple low, and I had a connected thermostat
EDL	00:22:39,458	00:22:58,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I found out when I was writing software to control the house to energy management, the house that if you asked what temperature more than a few times a minute, you deplete the capacitor that was used to parrot, and it would just give you garbage information back
EDL	00:22:59,110	00:23:02,630	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So these are dead, very, very simple devices
EDL	00:23:02,630	00:23:11,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And as such, don't have very much protection building to them, so they have to be protected, the networks that they are on have to protect them
EDL	00:23:11,530	00:23:17,270	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They have to be set in a way that is useful, but not in a way that can be used
EDL	00:23:17,750	00:23:35,711	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So not as a way that somebody could go in caused my hot water heater to explode, or cause my furnace to shut down, or in industrial setting, cause a certain agreement to be put into a foot supply that shouldn't be
EDL	00:23:35,711	00:23:38,464	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There should be there in that volume
EDL	00:23:38,464	00:23:44,500	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So how do you protect these devices that starts to become a really interesting thing
EDL	00:23:44,500	00:23:54,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Interesting question, and it's also not just preventing them from doing something malicious, but they also can be used as a launch point for another attack
EDL	00:23:54,470	00:24:18,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So if my thermostat not jury brought thermostat, but somebody can connect, and then once they are connected to the thermos that get to all the other devices in my house, that becomes a real issue, because everything on the normally one thinks oil trust that a little bit more than something on the outside, but that may not necessarily be the case
EDL	00:24:19,590	00:24:23,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You can have an insider attack from an internet things device
EDL	00:24:23,610	00:24:30,640	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what concept attempts to do is let you use my house as an example hundred plus
EDL	00:24:31,650	00:24:42,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	All of them, slightly different, all of them, a little eye ball and a number of rounders, a number of modems to connect all these things up
EDL	00:24:42,800	00:24:49,890	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	How can you configure them in such a way that they will be secure, but they will still work
EDL	00:24:50,610	00:25:00,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so what concept does is it goes from a human riddle, human britain set of documents that specify how you want to do security
EDL	00:25:01,030	00:25:10,810	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Francis, if you come to my house, the rule would be, that would be written down, would be your allowed on the gas network
EDL	00:25:10,810	00:25:19,968	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But i'm allowed on the internal network to make sure that all the access points around the house are configured correctly to do that
EDL	00:25:19,968	00:25:22,057	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So concept will read documents
EDL	00:25:22,057	00:25:32,959	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It'll look at the diagrams, look at the drawings of the network and digest them and figure out all these are what the security requirements are
EDL	00:25:32,959	00:25:41,920	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	No little girl is that for the, and it will read the manuals, and this is something I know very few people ever do
EDL	00:25:41,920	00:25:44,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The manual is always something that comes
EDL	00:25:44,720	00:25:45,670	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You look at it
EDL	00:25:46,540	00:25:48,700	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	This is recycle above, and it's gone
EDL	00:25:48,700	00:25:58,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It concept, what, sit down and read the manuals, figure out what the configurations are based on what the requirements were
EDL	00:25:58,760	00:26:02,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And then it will put play them directly to the. 
EDL	00:26:03,200	00:26:04,135	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	To the device
EDL	00:26:04,135	00:26:06,005	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, just let me stop you for me
EDL	00:26:06,005	00:26:11,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so when you say the concept will read the menu, so it is interesting information
EDL	00:26:11,150	00:26:19,597	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I presume these are probably identifies that I would like to do some electronic form of of the kind of paper manuals that I have a huge photo of
EDL	00:26:19,597	00:26:25,160	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you're right, I didn't read them, but is that how exactly, it just needs to read the PDF, read the PDF. 
EDL	00:26:25,160	00:26:30,137	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Read the pdas, and it can read images in the PDF
EDL	00:26:30,137	00:26:40,670	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So if you can get something skiing in the end, in its in entertaining wish, it will make an attempt to read it
EDL	00:26:41,260	00:26:49,440	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It doesn't always get it right, and because of that, it will also explain why it can figure something the way it has
EDL	00:26:49,840	00:26:52,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So you get a human riddled document that comes out
EDL	00:26:53,790	00:26:59,050	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I set up a gas network, because guests need to be on the gasoline at work
EDL	00:26:59,600	00:27:01,233	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I, Ican read this
EDL	00:27:01,233	00:27:01,849	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's not
EDL	00:27:01,849	00:27:02,774	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is not
EDL	00:27:02,774	00:27:04,623	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is not hemingway
EDL	00:27:04,623	00:27:17,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is very much computer generated text, but it is completely reasonable and understandable, and explains why the system elected to configure in the way that it did
EDL	00:27:17,490	00:27:19,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is really, really cool
EDL	00:27:19,400	00:27:30,606	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And given that french students today, a variety engine is a connected piece of the internet, its its performance is being monitored
EDL	00:27:30,606	00:27:34,330	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's part of the positive train control system
EDL	00:27:34,330	00:27:36,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is out there getting it
EDL	00:27:36,950	00:28:00,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Configure properly is, is a real challenge and are providing tools to athens is a um same thing you for the navy, a modern naval vessel has thousands of computers on it would be really nice if they were configured in a way, according to guidance that also made them useful
EDL	00:28:01,200	00:28:18,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the final stabbed concept is when the ship comes back, it can be read, and we can see why the changes occurred, and those can then either be undone or controlled into best practice and incorporated into the next round
EDL	00:28:18,660	00:28:19,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's. 
EDL	00:28:19,690	00:28:39,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Concept in natural, right, and due excellent vision, some of the tools and protocols and practices coming out of concept to be available, said to a whole manner, in addition, because you are, as you are speaking, it became clear to me that you are internet of things in a military setting
EDL	00:28:40,430	00:28:58,080	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Clearly, there are security concerns there and then, and so consequently, aboriginal there, but the threat space, the vulnerability space is really everywhere, because we can have a railroad system attacked through the internet of things, portals, for example, that that becomes the securities, but as well. 
EDL	00:28:58,080	00:29:20,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Well, for me, the most exciting trend coming out of concept is one of the performers, and I won't steal their press release under, but they are looking at two product roles for one, which would do automatic configuration of docker containers for virtual machines and moving virtual machines
EDL	00:29:21,130	00:29:39,136	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the second is to do automatic configuration of the windows registry, and they're seeing of a strong market and providing this to small and medium sized enterprises as a as a commercial lawfully
EDL	00:29:39,136	00:30:04,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So the answer is, if, if you look, you'll probably see this technology available in a shrink wrapped or download of forms in a year or so, and it should make an difference in and how we can do security and buy small and medium enterprise that also include households that have several hundred internet things. 
EDL	00:30:04,640	00:30:15,765	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Quartering that that, and you did you see the example of a inner neighborhood just before, so I on its way, or maybe already has made some transitions into the services. 
EDL	00:30:15,765	00:30:27,900	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We're in some clouds right now to understand behavior and to understand reliability, because we don't wanted to play something and then have it blown up
EDL	00:30:28,650	00:30:33,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But we are, we're actually an exercise as we speak. 
EDL	00:30:33,430	00:30:41,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	To see how this overall, okay, i'm sure you are excited to see you the results of those and learn lessons from those that you can take the programme
EDL	00:30:41,740	00:30:43,697	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I don't know it for a learning
EDL	00:30:43,697	00:30:46,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I don't know how much more time is available for the program
EDL	00:30:46,830	00:30:50,942	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	At this point, we have about six months to six month we have been considered
EDL	00:30:50,942	00:30:51,334	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And air
EDL	00:30:51,334	00:31:07,931	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Sounds like if you got some real transitions that you'll be, which they say, that's kind of the trophy for programs is when the technology comes out in action to get sort of views operationally or with its points, companies or something of that kind of those are all kind of positive results
EDL	00:31:07,931	00:31:13,505	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Actually, an appointment, though, even even failures for doubt, our lessons and we learn from
EDL	00:31:13,505	00:31:18,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So uh, you know, successes and negatively is always good. 
EDL	00:31:18,120	00:31:26,270	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And and I just like to comment, there was a system called bomber ring that was a shoulder detection system
EDL	00:31:27,380	00:31:30,440	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	My former employer had developed you and had developed
EDL	00:31:30,790	00:31:37,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It went to be shellfire because it wasn't a need after it was initially developed
EDL	00:31:37,180	00:31:47,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They're suddenly became a great need for it, and it was able to be filled within ninety days because the technology had been ahead of time
EDL	00:31:47,740	00:31:51,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Then when the time came, it was able to be brought out and run. 
EDL	00:31:51,340	00:32:01,800	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are european, european great example, you know, just about how context is all important as to whether or technology makes sense or not at a so fascinating to share that
EDL	00:32:01,800	00:32:02,480	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	thanks
EDL	00:32:02,480	00:32:04,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So now let's talk about one more program, though
EDL	00:32:04,690	00:32:10,420	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I guess this is sort of still in the innovation phase, in the sense that is just been approved
EDL	00:32:10,780	00:32:16,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You have been received proposals from performers, which is to say the research results will in my work on this
EDL	00:32:16,520	00:32:44,312	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You call this one learning, interested in control project or a link for short from the little, I know about a sense of director developed a kind of machine learning account of our official intelligence that will enable military assets, whether it was a ground vehicle weapons system to effectively self discover relevant capabilities it might actually have in the context in which it is placed, even though the original designers and might not afford of that
EDL	00:32:44,312	00:32:46,974	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Initially, I don't know from getting that right
EDL	00:32:46,974	00:32:53,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I wanted to correct me farming, and this gave me a sense of what you hope to ultimately deliver with this program. 
EDL	00:32:53,470	00:32:56,840	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's actually a little bit broader, in some senses
EDL	00:32:56,840	00:33:21,700	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It, because it's looking beyond just systems, because there are all for a lot of commercial systems that are needed by the us military, but also infrastructure resilience, operational resilience and ugly addressing climate change are incredibly important issues that were trying to prevent strategic. 
EDL	00:33:21,700	00:33:24,960	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	God coming to the coming to the documentation right there. 
EDL	00:33:24,960	00:33:33,369	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the idea behind link is systems live a long time, and they're living longer and longer and longer
EDL	00:33:33,369	00:33:39,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	If you look at military vehicles, they have lifespans of thirty to fifty years
EDL	00:33:39,790	00:33:43,770	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Some of the aircraft will have lives of hundred years
EDL	00:33:44,130	00:33:45,910	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You look at private vehicles
EDL	00:33:45,910	00:33:56,090	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are on the road much longer than they have been, and it's because they are good, usable systems through that period
EDL	00:33:56,390	00:34:02,362	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	If one hazard system and lets lets the dream take a pickup truck is an example
EDL	00:34:02,362	00:34:03,779	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Take a pick up truck
EDL	00:34:03,779	00:34:17,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You put a tunnel and fifty gallon water tank on the back of it and errors not going to do too great with that water can be filled, the water tank paying empty oats can be fine with the water tank half full
EDL	00:34:17,580	00:34:21,200	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's unbelievably dangerous. 
EDL	00:34:21,200	00:34:22,370	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	你是哪个部门？
EDL	00:34:23,410	00:34:24,910	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Thank you for writing。
EDL	00:34:24,910	00:34:26,219	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly exactly
EDL	00:34:26,219	00:34:34,676	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so the idea is a modern pickup truck has a platform sensors in a several hundred of them
EDL	00:34:34,676	00:34:41,110	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It also has a collection of relatively powerful computer sitting in slideshow
EDL	00:34:41,580	00:35:05,560	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so the idea is the system is designed, and it's exclusively designed before leaves the factory to encounter the circumstances that are limited in the users handbook, and unlike network configuration manuals, I know everyone reads there, ultimately, a hamburger and nervously did cover to cover
EDL	00:35:05,560	00:35:06,540	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Where is the fuse
EDL	00:35:06,540	00:35:08,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That's the first time somebody will open it
EDL	00:35:08,570	00:35:09,750	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Or where is the tire jack
EDL	00:35:10,790	00:35:17,290	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So the idea is cars are modified trucks and modify the laws are different
EDL	00:35:17,290	00:35:27,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Everything is different over the life of the car or over the life of the truck and the ideas to have the control system adapt in correct itself to keep, to keep on going
EDL	00:35:28,670	00:35:30,800	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And there is a great deal
EDL	00:35:30,800	00:35:33,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Skepticism is to how this actually could work
EDL	00:35:34,470	00:35:44,865	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But there's, i'll tell you a story of an existence proof that stunned me when I thought there are some researchers who are an imperial college london
EDL	00:35:44,865	00:35:48,590	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And again, this is the beauty of being a dark PM
EDL	00:35:48,590	00:35:58,380	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You can call them up and say, hi, can I talk to you, and they will help me talk to, and they were doing some work with hacks upon robots where they would break a leg
EDL	00:35:58,380	00:35:59,380	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They did naturally break
EDL	00:35:59,380	00:36:02,020	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It takes turn off the power to it
EDL	00:36:02,020	00:36:19,010	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And with these old hacks apart, they would sit there and kind of wrapped around for a minute or two, and suddenly they be up and hoping along on just a couple of lakes and be almost as movable as they were before him
EDL	00:36:19,010	00:36:30,160	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	because they, 我想看小猪佩奇第一季的综艺节目有什么好看的电视剧，有什么好看的电视剧吗？
EDL	00:36:30,460	00:36:33,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	我想要一个美人鱼公主裙子。
EDL	00:36:33,430	00:36:40,663	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And that small child is taking a backpack to school, and they want to take everything they have in the backpack
EDL	00:36:40,663	00:36:46,510	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They put it on, and they'll stick around the little bit in front, and then they will get their footing
EDL	00:36:46,900	00:37:11,920	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And thereafter the race, that's what we're trying to get machines to do is to do that same, learning that that small child does when they take on the noon and heavy load and have them be able to make newer, safely, efficiently in a useful way, just by using what they have internally not having to go to a big cloud server, not to have to have some engineer
EDL	00:37:12,260	00:37:19,290	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We do the design, but rather have them customized how they react to something and handle off
EDL	00:37:19,290	00:37:24,327	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's the idea behind the real benefit that i'm seeing behind
EDL	00:37:24,327	00:37:30,814	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That is by allowing systems to operate much longer, the energy requirements to manufacturers
EDL	00:37:30,814	00:37:33,310	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	These systems goes down dramatically
EDL	00:37:33,630	00:37:35,020	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so that's what i'm saying
EDL	00:37:35,020	00:37:37,065	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	One of the big benefits of. 
EDL	00:37:37,065	00:37:43,670	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Oh, maybe one of the million solutions we need for mitigating climate change, and it is effective
EDL	00:37:43,670	00:38:03,156	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There's also a little thing that I see you with this program and configuration security, in the sense that it seems like you like you are out to help the anonymity world and the, the world of things, world of technologies, whether we're talking about vehicles, but also all like china technology census, the IOT technology
EDL	00:38:03,156	00:38:08,770	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You want them to be able to learn about themselves and make themselves better, more given. 
EDL	00:38:08,770	00:38:15,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly right, and a big part of this also comes from growing and reading the golden age of science fiction
EDL	00:38:16,110	00:38:34,140	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Highline of the camp campbell as a clark, where there was an internal hopelessness that technology could be bent to do good
EDL	00:38:34,490	00:38:40,285	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And that's really what IIstill am trying to do that
EDL	00:38:40,285	00:38:48,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And if I can have IOT systems internalize doing good stuff, I, Ithink it would just be. 
EDL	00:38:48,360	00:38:49,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Better place, right
EDL	00:38:49,320	00:38:50,020	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Well, jail
EDL	00:38:50,020	00:38:52,210	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I want you to succeed at that
EDL	00:38:52,210	00:38:53,750	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And this is a sexy, cool secretary
EDL	00:38:53,750	00:38:54,820	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	To another question I have
EDL	00:38:54,820	00:39:02,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And this is just coming from the forty summer pattern titles of that was some really interesting reading
EDL	00:39:02,300	00:39:08,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So we can talk about all those, obviously, but, but one is certainly just reflect that you can help yourself
EDL	00:39:08,400	00:39:11,010	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You are an inventor of you been doing in all kinds of ways
EDL	00:39:11,010	00:39:12,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Now you do with your dog
EDL	00:39:12,550	00:39:18,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Are there any of those patterns that just really stand out for you either, because they were most rewarding
EDL	00:39:18,400	00:39:21,680	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You think the technology, we're a good idea that there would be
EDL	00:39:21,980	00:39:25,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It would do the most good as we are just talking about yet, or just been doing
EDL	00:39:25,490	00:39:27,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It fascinates you for some reason. 
EDL	00:39:27,710	00:39:31,928	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Too, that just made me happy when they, when they were all metrics
EDL	00:39:31,928	00:39:36,428	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So go with those aren't so and dark is all about metrics
EDL	00:39:36,428	00:39:52,350	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So the, the first one originally had a working title of tooth and come on, or two towns, and um at the time I was involved with the technology board for the natural federation of the blind
EDL	00:39:52,840	00:40:05,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And there was a real question of how electric vehicles, the tournaments vehicles to affect the blind as they navigate throughout a city
EDL	00:40:05,840	00:40:09,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In some respect, economic vehicles would be marvelous
EDL	00:40:09,660	00:40:20,034	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The black and white, that is just a wonderful thing, but the other side of it is that it was concerned that electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles would sneak up on people
EDL	00:40:20,034	00:40:23,506	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They wouldn't hear them, and they would cause accidents
EDL	00:40:23,506	00:40:28,607	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I noticed this myself, I was driving a hybrid hybrid in the parking lot
EDL	00:40:28,607	00:40:33,880	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And if you have a car with engine running, people will just transplant walk to the side
EDL	00:40:33,880	00:40:36,930	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But with the hybrid, they will just keep walking in the center
EDL	00:40:36,930	00:40:38,280	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you don't want to blow your heart
EDL	00:40:38,280	00:40:41,210	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You don't want to be the guy who blows his orange of pedestrian
EDL	00:40:41,210	00:40:42,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I think it was not right
EDL	00:40:42,750	00:40:45,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so what I was thinking was, why not a gentle cough
EDL	00:40:46,270	00:40:46,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You know, something
EDL	00:40:46,950	00:40:48,280	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We're somebody know
EDL	00:40:48,280	00:40:50,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Excuse me, you know, so they know your hair
EDL	00:40:50,960	00:40:52,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And that is that what, why not
EDL	00:40:52,550	00:40:55,280	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	This was at the time of download of all rain tones
EDL	00:40:55,820	00:40:59,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I thought why I have tones that you can double
EDL	00:41:00,380	00:41:03,980	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I went ahead and worked up the system
EDL	00:41:04,280	00:41:18,380	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The pen was filed, and I very pleased that many states now require supplemental alert exactly to protect those who are sighting paired
EDL	00:41:18,380	00:41:20,000	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you're also around the globe
EDL	00:41:20,000	00:41:23,260	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And because of that, that patterns actually found real
EDL	00:41:23,720	00:41:25,330	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that was, that was a fun one. 
EDL	00:41:25,330	00:41:27,439	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Sounds like a good technology to get out there
EDL	00:41:27,439	00:41:29,872	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Oh, I will have patched you here for more time than your party
EDL	00:41:29,872	00:41:31,332	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Future can be set down here with me
EDL	00:41:31,332	00:41:34,415	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I just want to ask you, is there are question that didn't come up
EDL	00:41:34,415	00:41:37,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There's anything that didn't come up to you think, would be eventually. 
EDL	00:41:37,690	00:41:38,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	我是。
EDL	00:41:38,850	00:41:49,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What is the thing that worries me the most wonderful here is that we have a clock that is running every dark program manager has a date on their bed
EDL	00:41:50,360	00:42:04,200	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And that is our final day here, and we feel an incredible urgency to get things done before that date and covered, really make me feel more because I. 
EDL	00:42:04,200	00:42:05,230	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Didn't want to lose time
EDL	00:42:05,810	00:42:12,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That is actually one of the most interesting institutional characteristics of dark to me
EDL	00:42:12,430	00:42:13,410	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it is that you come in here
EDL	00:42:13,410	00:42:27,620	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We all do right with that cell by date, as a, you hear the open over again, how that does turn up that dialogue, urgency and is thought to be one of the reasons why darker has such a track record of producing so much so interesting to bring that up
EDL	00:42:28,550	00:42:35,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What out of time may you and your research performers, those who let us to say, the researchers were working on your programs
EDL	00:42:35,650	00:42:40,170	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	May you all succeed and maybe learn much from that work
EDL	00:42:40,780	00:42:45,070	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Thanks for being with me, my pleasure and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us
EDL	00:42:45,450	00:42:53,310	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dark thanks also to TOM shortage for his partnership in producing this program
