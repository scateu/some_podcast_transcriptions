In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, John-Francis Mergen (https://www.darpa.mil/staff/mr-john-francis-mergen), a program manager since 2020 in the agency’s Information Innovation Office (https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/offices/BTO), recounts how his interest in science took off as a child when he received a gift of a low-power magnifier from a family friend who was a geologist. 
From that gift, Mergen says, he learned about the power of observation and of the mindset one brings into that elemental component of the scientific enterprise. 
For his part, Mergen has spent a lot of time observing the complex ebbs and flows of data packets, which are mobile portions of information that race every which way through the internet and then get reassembled on your computer into a web page, a picture, or an email message. 
One of the first DARPA programs Mergen started to run last year aims to optimize the efficiency of packet traffic and management based on dynamic prioritization of information categories, such as text, voice or images, while preserving privacy and confidentiality for the sender and recipient of those packets. 

Another program Mergen runs is anticipating emerging threats associated with the exploding population of internet-connected-devices—the Internet-of-Things (IoT)—with an eye on security-enhancing communications protocols. 
Mergen has skin in the game: he says he has several hundred devices (including an internet-connected beehive!) at home that are connected to the Internet. 
One of his newest programs, if successful, will deliver technology that applies artificial intelligence to manage IoT devices so that they automatically and securely configure themselves, in his words, “in a way that is useful but not in a way that can be used” by adversaries, criminals, and others seeking to do harm. 
In a program just getting underway, Mergen envisions vehicles, manufacturing tools, and other technologies with a kind of self-awareness, which would be based on the many sensors, actuation devices, and computers in their designs, along with the ability to leverage this gadget-based self-awareness into automatic adjustments of operations. 
The payoff? Mergen says it could lead to more capable and longer-lasting technologies that could bring out their own best in changing circumstances. 
One possibility is that already-deployed technologies would “discover” capabilities they have in specific situations that not even their designers had in mind.

EDL	00:00:11,800	00:00:30,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Stealth technology, the internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation. technologies is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, doubt this offensive best research projects agency has been a driver of technology. 

EDL	00:00:30,730	00:00:38,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA a window on the DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible. 
EDL	00:00:39,320	00:00:42,810	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	My name is, Ivan Amato, and I am your DARPA host today. 

EDL	00:00:42,810	00:01:17,554	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I am pleased to be talking with Mr. John-Francis Mergen, though I will call him J-F through the rest of this podcast. As a cyber security technology developer, J-F joined DARPA as a program manager in the agencies, Information Innovation Office in January 2020, just as the Covid pandemic end up with getting under way, his previous job was with Raytheon BBMtechnologies, where he was chief scientist and a senior Raytheon fellow. Before that, he worked for a number of companies among them, Verizon, General Electrics, and SAIC and Roll's centered on communications and information management. 
EDL	00:01:17,554	00:01:35,440	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I should point out the BBMtechnologies, which was acquired by brazil in two thousand nine as an important historical connection with urban in nineteen sixty nine, is delivered four IMPs (interface message processors), which were pivotal components, enabling the birth of ARPAnet and ultimately the internet. 
EDL	00:01:35,880	00:01:48,260	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Moreover, beyond vice president for engineering psychology, from 1956 too, JCare late later, was one of DARPAest, most visionary research managers and leaders in its early years. 
EDL	00:01:48,570	00:01:53,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, back to John-Francis, back to J-F. As an undergraduate year university

EDL	00:01:53,060	00:01:56,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	He double majored in electrical engineering and operations research. 
EDL	00:01:56,790	00:02:08,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	He builds on that foundation by earning a master of science degree in management with a concentration and information systems from MIT's Slogan School of Management, a few other details to share. 
EDL	00:02:08,500	00:02:14,866	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	J-F is a private pilot and a HAM radio operator, and has more than 40 patents to his name. 
EDL	00:02:14,866	00:02:24,119	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They have titles like wireless vehicle, slash journalist and public announcement system, malware and temporary system, computer architecture. 
EDL	00:02:24,119	00:02:30,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And this one, a bit of an space debris using upper atmosphere and more text generated. 
EDL	00:02:30,990	00:02:40,205	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	J-F, thanks for joining me in the studio today and to share with me a tale about your ongoing adventure in technology development.

[Guest]
EDL	00:02:40,205	00:02:51,314	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I'm really happy to be here. So we'll get your life as a program manager soon enough, and also to those patents at the end briefly, but let's go straight to those hobbies. 
EDL	00:02:51,314	00:02:53,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You fly planes, and you are a HAM radio. 
EDL	00:02:53,690	00:02:55,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So just briefly tell me about those interests. 
EDL	00:02:55,530	00:02:56,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And how is that part of your life now? 

* Hobbies: Flying

EDL	00:02:57,380	00:03:00,930	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Flying has been part of my life about 26 years at this point,
EDL	00:03:01,000	00:03:25,970	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	my wife came home from a business trip announced that she wanted to learn to fly, and I tagged along and got my pilot license along with her. And since I've gone on to get multi engine and instrument ratings and con[..] lighters and seaplanes, well, but so it's a two pilot households, which makes a discussions with the budget committee on changes to the airplane much easier. 

* Ham Radio
EDL	00:03:27,060	00:03:30,100	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Ham radio has been part of my life for much longer. 
EDL	00:03:30,100	00:03:42,270	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I've been a handwritten operator for over fifty years, and during that time, have operated outside the us and really got involved with packet radio when that first came up. 

EDL	00:03:42,920	00:03:49,880	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Right, for those who are not in that, a kind of, in the world of HAM radio(业余无线电), just give us a little bit of flavor of the kind of content that flows over the airways
EDL	00:03:50,080	00:03:51,730	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	, the airways when you are behind the controls. 

** Joke about Ham Radio

EDL	00:03:51,850	00:03:59,920	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It has jokingly been said that HAM radio is one of the few hobbies where you build equipment so you can talk about your hobby. 

EDL	00:04:00,000	00:04:03,373	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's really set into several different communities. 
EDL	00:04:03,373	00:04:05,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There were experimenters. 
EDL	00:04:05,060	00:04:14,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are people who like to do public service and public support, such as emergency communications during floods and hurricanes. 
EDL	00:04:14,530	00:04:18,370	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And there those who enjoy handling traffic and. 
EDL	00:04:18,450	00:04:21,267	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Just right, actually uses code now, very interesting. 
EDL	00:04:21,267	00:04:25,897	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Cause, you know, community resilience is becoming so much more important. 
EDL	00:04:25,897	00:04:28,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so you would, be in a position to really be part of that solution. 


EDL	00:04:28,550	00:04:38,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you really get to see and work with first responders, and those who have to deal with with those that get hurt. 
EDL	00:04:38,340	00:04:50,450	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it really affected my whole way of thinking about what the role communications was in our society and what it could do for good in terms of helping people when they are in need of help. 

EDL	00:04:50,650	00:04:52,762	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Haha, So i'm beginning to hear it hints from that. 
EDL	00:04:52,762	00:04:54,522	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Interesting, what are you doing now ? 
EDL	00:04:54,522	00:04:56,635	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so we'll get to that just a little bit. 

* Origin Story

EDL	00:04:56,635	00:05:04,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I do like my discussion partners in the partners in the podcast, some sense of society of the original story of your interest and patients. 
EDL	00:05:04,490	00:05:16,780	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so if there were people or teachers or parents, are some a pipeline or some failure, just whatever in your earlier years, we're important in the development of your interest in the industry, professional integrity. 

** Response

EDL	00:05:16,840	00:05:33,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Whether there were a couple of people I grew up in a university town with, with teaching parents, and my dad was a was a professor yell, and I remembered an early meeting with one with his ph address. 
EDL	00:05:33,880	00:05:44,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Professor looks, and he would always bring me a trickett of a piece of patrick would have an eggs, something. 
EDL	00:05:44,190	00:05:45,450	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And we talk about it. 
EDL	00:05:45,450	00:05:50,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I learned a little bit from it, and one day I was really proud. 
EDL	00:05:50,720	00:05:56,580	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had gotten a four hundred power microscope for my birthday, and I wanted to show this to professor louds. 
EDL	00:05:56,580	00:05:59,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And he said, oh, you know, I can. 
EDL	00:06:00,030	00:06:10,550	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The four hundred power microscope because I have, these 10x magnifier that I wear around my neck, and I can see more through that than I can understand. 
EDL	00:06:10,550	00:06:15,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I could never understand what comes from a 400W-power microscope. 
EDL	00:06:15,340	00:06:17,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I was crushed as a little kid. 
EDL	00:06:17,120	00:06:17,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had this thing. 
EDL	00:06:17,830	00:06:18,940	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I was really proud of. 
EDL	00:06:19,390	00:06:30,860	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And then he gave me the techniques manufacturer, and I still have, it is hanging on a book in my home and what he really made me do was realized. 
EDL	00:06:31,140	00:06:45,520	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Observation is incredibly important for doing science, and that the power of tool, the, the speed of a tool is not as important as really thinking about what you're trying to see and what you are trying to see him. 
EDL	00:06:45,870	00:06:50,510	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so that really affected me as I, as I grow up. 
EDL	00:06:50,690	00:06:53,670	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	HMM, it sounds like a lesson you continued to embrace. 
EDL	00:06:53,700	00:06:54,520	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Yeah, it's, it's. 
EDL	00:06:54,520	00:06:58,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I try to think it's simply about things as I possibly can. 
EDL	00:06:58,830	00:06:59,930	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Such transformative. 
EDL	00:07:00,030	00:07:01,220	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Yeah, thanks for that story. 


* Joining DARPA

EDL	00:07:01,320	00:07:05,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what's now, can I move into your DARPA experience ? 
EDL	00:07:05,830	00:07:07,630	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And let's start from the beginning. 
EDL	00:07:07,750	00:07:09,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you have been here for more than you. 
EDL	00:07:09,710	00:07:11,050	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You want to be a second europe. 
EDL	00:07:11,440	00:07:24,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I arrived in january twenty twenty, which was just two months before the world health organization and declared south korea too, in the spirit of it, to have a kind of ascended to pandemic. 
EDL	00:07:24,240	00:07:26,832	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what was the course of events that got you ? 
EDL	00:07:26,832	00:07:29,425	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Your job here is an it ULprogram manager. 
EDL	00:07:29,425	00:07:35,043	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	This is a manager in the information innovation offers one of DARPAness, executive offices. 
EDL	00:07:35,043	00:07:36,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And then what was it like ? 
EDL	00:07:36,340	00:07:40,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Get hearing and just very shortly after, you know, this sort of being this Covid status. 

** RESPONSE

EDL	00:07:40,720	00:07:47,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Well, i've been a performer, which is the DARPA of violence for somebody who who executes on the program. 
EDL	00:07:47,240	00:07:53,980	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I've been a performer and PI for DARPA for about twenty years on and off through that period in time. 
EDL	00:07:54,450	00:08:09,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And some of the people I've work with had been, ex program managers and another people who I formed good friendships with went off to become program managers, uh, deputy of directors and office directors. 
EDL	00:08:09,320	00:08:18,540	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I had a long affiliation with DARPA doing research, working with the PMs to develop new program, ideas and alike. 
EDL	00:08:19,070	00:08:26,410	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it was coming to DARPA with something I always wanted to do, but I needed to wait for the right time in my career. 
EDL	00:08:26,550	00:08:30,810	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I wanted to be sure my son had graduated from college. 
EDL	00:08:31,130	00:08:40,420	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I wanted to to achieve certain milestones and also get some people in place at my old employer to make sure that the research could carry out. 
EDL	00:08:41,200	00:08:51,290	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I also wanted to have the right set of ideas for programs I didn't show and went around for a year trying to come up with an idea for a program. 
EDL	00:08:51,660	00:08:56,110	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I had my low basket of program ideas, and I came in the door. 
EDL	00:08:56,110	00:08:57,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I was all excited. 
EDL	00:08:57,400	00:08:58,930	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I started up. 
EDL	00:08:58,930	00:09:01,540	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And part of the reason for coming to DARPA is. 

** DARPA PM可以access到很多研究者，聊天沟通

EDL	00:09:01,790	00:09:15,407	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are several neat things that DARPA program managers get to do 1) they get to talk with other people who are, who are in the organization and get their ideas and get them completely unfiltered. 
EDL	00:09:15,407	00:09:20,672	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But the other one is, you can tap into researchers all across the globe. 

*** MIT, CalTech

EDL	00:09:20,672	00:09:27,417	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You call up and say, hi, I am from DARPA, and I was wondering what you were thinking about something. 
EDL	00:09:27,417	00:09:34,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And usually the conversation will run far longer than you ever anticipated, or you ever even planned. 
EDL	00:09:35,100	00:09:46,857	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But you're sorry, when it's over, i've been able to talk with researchers at CalTech, and MIT, and they'll call back with another idea afterwards. 
EDL	00:09:46,857	00:09:49,953	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That is unbelievably exciting. 
EDL	00:09:49,953	00:10:02,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And for someone like me, having that kind of access is the great entertainment I could ever hope for the other big piece about this is you get to go see their lab, and you got to go see stuff happening. 

*** Pilot, HAM: love to touch the tech
EDL	00:10:03,160	00:10:10,220	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And as you can guess, from being a pilot, from being a HAM radio operator, i'd love to touch the technology. 
EDL	00:10:10,220	00:10:11,200	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I love to play with that. 
EDL	00:10:11,200	00:10:12,390	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I love to do things. 


*** Fuck the pandemic

EDL	00:10:12,990	00:10:27,220	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so two months after I arrive, I cannot go see the lab anymore, and I can't see my coworkers, because it will doing our part to trying, and it be safe and keep other people safe. 
EDL	00:10:27,690	00:10:30,390	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so it was a little bit maddening. 
EDL	00:10:30,390	00:10:39,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You know, it's sort of like going into a giant technological toy store, but you can only see through the windows. 

EDL	00:10:39,410	00:10:40,200	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What's there ? 
EDL	00:10:40,880	00:10:43,560	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it says "Close Indefinitely". 
EDL	00:10:43,750	00:10:54,310	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly that has been my single big frustration since coming here is I cannot go as fast as the organization normally would let me go. 
EDL	00:10:54,890	00:10:59,930	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And i'm seeing a substantial difference with the reopening.
EDL	00:11:00,030	00:11:00,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	[inaudible]
EDL	00:11:01,370	00:11:02,350	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Boys are exciting. 
EDL	00:11:02,350	00:11:12,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	[Host] interesting to hear, just in the the kind of specific loss that a program manager we can experience in a, in a situation like Covid. 
EDL	00:11:12,660	00:11:16,623	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I mean, Covid just brought a thousand million different kinds of losses. 


EDL	00:11:16,623	00:11:24,880	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So interesting to hear you express the specific sort of loss that program just loves to be in the midst of the performers of researchers working with you need to be [primed] into 
EDL	00:11:24,880	00:11:25,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	that connection. 

* Programs that you run

** Intro: Searchlight, inherited

EDL	00:11:25,860	00:11:34,960	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Let's now talk about your, the programs that you run, one of them, you develop from scratch and just got the green light will be talking a little bit about that. 
EDL	00:11:34,960	00:11:38,899	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What started by talking about one of the programs, jewellery, heritage. 
EDL	00:11:38,899	00:11:45,624	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So this was called 'Searchlight' that had been up and running for about a year or more before you check it over from an outgoing program. 
EDL	00:11:45,624	00:11:49,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Manager is often that often happens the end of the course between PMs. 
EDL	00:11:49,640	00:11:54,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So in brief, what absent capability was the importance for the program. 
EDL	00:11:54,340	00:11:59,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What is the invasion and pointed at this point, and what is its status? 

** about handoff

EDL	00:12:00,000	00:12:05,730	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	First, I want to comment on the idea of the hand off from one program manager to another. 
EDL	00:12:05,730	00:12:11,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I was extremely lucky in that I knew the PM, who quite well, who I was taking over from. 
EDL	00:12:11,710	00:12:13,816	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so, [Host] and that was?
EDL	00:12:13,816	00:12:24,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Jonathan Smith, JMS, and he, he has been a visionary in the communications area for a number of years.

EDL	00:12:24,060	00:12:38,820	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I, won't say how long. How about JMS tell you that, but he really does tend to lead, in the uh, in the digital networking area, and so is very nice. 
EDL	00:12:38,820	00:12:52,880	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had an understanding of his vision going forward, and I was able to wrap some of my own, my own experiences inside of Telcos? to be able to to bring it forward. 
EDL	00:12:52,880	00:13:03,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So it certainly, yes, he is evolved into is a need solution to a very thorny(棘手的) problem. 

** Zoom, QoS

EDL	00:13:03,610	00:13:21,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And one of the things that I think many people listening to this experience of recovery was live on zoom or life on teams, and occasionally really will have the all I can see your pictures breaking up. 
EDL	00:13:22,210	00:13:23,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's getting jealous. 
EDL	00:13:25,280	00:13:54,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The one of the reasons that this occurs are actually doesn't occur all the time is because of a service on networks called QoS, or quality, which allows certain streams of data that are very time critical to be given priority, or to have their cheater, or the variability in a packet delivery reduced, and that allows for good video, good audio. 
EDL	00:13:54,760	00:14:08,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And if you're doing things like transferring a file or uploading a new version of your system or book, transferring a thousand pictures from your vacation, those can have a little bit of general. 
EDL	00:14:08,150	00:14:15,840	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They can have a little bit of bouncing back and forth, but also, fortunately, people are also starting to become more security country. 
EDL	00:14:16,020	00:14:26,201	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What that means is they're traffic where the data coming in and out of their houses or another businesses is wrapped in an incredible group. 
EDL	00:14:26,201	00:14:35,502	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And what this does is, it prevents the networks from really understanding what the traffic is that they're carrying. 
EDL	00:14:35,502	00:14:37,874	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So it'll see upstanding, you. 
EDL	00:14:37,874	00:14:39,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	All the pictures of my. 
EDL	00:14:39,980	00:14:43,310	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It was also having a phone conversation over the same network connection. 
EDL	00:14:44,100	00:14:45,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's all equipped it. 
EDL	00:14:45,650	00:14:53,560	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So therefore our voice gets the same priority as the picture of the fish record, not particularly useful. 
EDL	00:14:53,760	00:15:15,840	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So with such like those is one of the things inside the search light is that it's able to understand what those traffic clothes are, even though they are increased, and it lets the network provide priority, and I need to be very careful in explaining how this technology works. 
EDL	00:15:16,530	00:15:29,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It can understand with the flowers it cannot underscore, cannot be see what the flow is carrying, right or not, examine the content, not examining the content. 
EDL	00:15:29,490	00:15:39,340	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is looking at the behavior of the floor and then moderating the movement of that flow based on the need for priority for that type of traffic. 
EDL	00:15:39,590	00:15:42,110	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what it does is it preserves privacy. 
EDL	00:15:42,570	00:15:54,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It preserves confident reality, but it also preserves the flow improvement capabilities of the network, so that is really a new way of doing it. 
EDL	00:15:55,370	00:16:08,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the other thing that it does is, it allows for moderating other traffic flows, slowing the loading of the fish pictures of access so it can be done not directly in the path. 
EDL	00:16:08,430	00:16:13,810	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So it gives carriers a lot more flexibility to use the band with that they have. 
EDL	00:16:14,440	00:16:23,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And as we saw a journey of it, managing a band with is important mechanism for allowing us to cope with problems. 
EDL	00:16:23,950	00:16:30,560	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the game goes back to how can communications be improved or moderated to make people life better? 
EDL	00:16:30,930	00:16:38,500	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	If we register to give people a concrete sense of what this technology delivers, I say it fulfills the vision that you had. 
EDL	00:16:38,500	00:16:42,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The previous program manager had, maybe the access to reach these metrics. 
EDL	00:16:42,680	00:16:48,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But how does it make life better for either, you know, a civilian, or perhaps in it is offensive. 
EDL	00:16:48,610	00:16:55,009	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In any place where there is, let's bend with them could potentially be used. 
EDL	00:16:55,009	00:16:58,875	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It provides a better mechanism for sharing APP. 
EDL	00:16:58,875	00:17:02,210	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So we get that hi priority gets the high priority. 
EDL	00:17:02,580	00:17:11,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So i'll use the home example on this, both my wife and I working hard during coffee, both on zoom calls. 
EDL	00:17:12,530	00:17:16,606	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I am also downloading a copy of the operating system. 
EDL	00:17:16,606	00:17:32,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I had to stop downloading the copy of the operating system because I consumed all of the bandwidth that coming into the house, just doing that, that file transfer, if I had a certified enabled system, I wouldn't even thought about it. 
EDL	00:17:33,410	00:17:35,710	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Calls would have gone through without any problem. 
EDL	00:17:35,710	00:17:36,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They would not have been dropped. 
EDL	00:17:36,830	00:17:39,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They would not have been jittery or blocky. 
EDL	00:17:39,890	00:17:46,650	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And my operating system copy, my copy of Linux would have arrived a minute and half later. 
EDL	00:17:47,020	00:17:49,160	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Then it, then the otherwise would have. 
EDL	00:17:49,350	00:17:53,350	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's an example of how it can make things better. 

*** Another example: Tele Medicine

EDL	00:17:53,350	00:17:57,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Another example is uh in telemedicine. 
EDL	00:17:57,850	00:18:04,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And this is important to both DoD and civil, because we can get the medical personnel into the field. 
EDL	00:18:05,100	00:18:06,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	where it's needed at all time. 
EDL	00:18:06,790	00:18:14,090	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So telemedicine is a very important mechanism for getting that first round of care to everyone have no field. 
EDL	00:18:14,360	00:18:27,826	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It means that if somebody is downloading a maintainence manual for truck, it's not, it'll take a little bit longer to get there, but the telemedicine session goes on on in a rapid. 
EDL	00:18:27,826	00:18:29,730	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's another example of it. 


EDL	00:18:30,300	00:18:35,860	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Right you now cannot be, want to be in the middle of either a procedure or giving instructions for procedure. 
EDL	00:18:35,860	00:18:42,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you freeze, and then you leave people on the other end wondering what they should do in medical situation. 
EDL	00:18:42,760	00:18:49,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly, you don't want the media to be seen and be certain too, and then just dead. 


NOTE: 给QoS找场景 //laugh

* IoT

EDL	00:18:50,390	00:18:58,960	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So now let's move on to another program that you're inherited in this one, actually, really, I think, will be relevant. 
EDL	00:18:58,960	00:19:20,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Many people who are buying more and more internet connected technologies, which is scheduled when you think of all of these things, they are collectively known as the internet of things i'm referring to the program called configuration, security or concept for short, had its beginnings in the twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen time frame. 
EDL	00:19:20,490	00:19:33,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You took the batton in 2020 again, soon after you start suddenly, unlike many program managers, you, you are shepherding two programs and certainly thinking about the third one that will talk about just a little bit. 
EDL	00:19:33,790	00:19:45,100	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So some of this technology already is getting adopted in places as the USnavy and also the federal railroad administration, on other places. 
EDL	00:19:45,100	00:19:51,230	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Before we talk about the program in some detail, i'd like just to hear what your definition is of internet things. 

** Your definition?

EDL	00:19:51,710	00:19:56,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Internet of things has a whole bunch of different conditions to it. 
EDL	00:19:57,240	00:19:58,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In my household. 
EDL	00:19:58,830	00:20:06,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I have a internet connected rabbits and include internet connected piggy bank, as well as weather stations. 
EDL	00:20:06,500	00:20:11,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	As a matter of fact, several hundred devices are sitting on my home Internet.

wow: 上百个设备?

EDL	00:20:12,040	00:20:19,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, now you don't want to ask the interruption of talking about the definition here, but you just have to explain what is an internet connected rabbit. 
EDL	00:20:19,240	00:20:23,580	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	This is something called the neighbor's technique out of friends. 
EDL	00:20:23,970	00:20:26,530	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It has years that vehicle back and forth. 
EDL	00:20:27,100	00:20:31,170	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And right now, all the servers around by volunteers around the world. 
EDL	00:20:31,490	00:20:58,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But it was a very, very early incentive of what would be something like the amazon alexa, and it now evolves too, basically telling you things like you look really good today, or that it's nervous, and upset. And people have made, nevertheless attack or*****ras with several hundred of these things. 
EDL	00:20:59,070	00:21:10,000	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	My son found it when he was studying overseas and and brought it back, and it's become part of a petting zoo of internet of things, devices. 


** 养蜂 bee hive

EDL	00:21:10,000	00:21:15,727	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	[Host] Okay, so I no longer have a very longer animal in mind when you say that, and you will clarify it. 
EDL	00:21:15,727	00:21:23,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Sometimes it seems a little bit in some homework in character, though you raise bees so you do have animals in your life. 

EDL	00:21:23,770	00:21:28,050	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And and I actually have an internet of things bee hive. 
EDL	00:21:28,050	00:21:33,099	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I get telemetry back from the bee hive(蜂巢) that helps me manage and understand
EDL	00:21:33,099	00:21:34,681	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	how the bees are doing. 
EDL	00:21:34,681	00:21:44,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I can take the temperature of the humidity and weigh the hive remotely, which gives me some indication, as to changes in the amount of brutal, the honey of the hive. 

** 
EDL	00:21:45,480	00:21:50,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	[Host] Okay, so you are richly connected through various internet of things in your own personal life. 
EDL	00:21:50,320	00:21:53,960	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In some ways, you already define maybe what Inter of Things is.
EDL	00:21:53,960	00:21:57,920	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	but I didn't interrupt you. So finish that definition, then we talk about concept. 

EDL	00:21:58,040	00:22:11,890	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	[Guest] So Internet of Things is when mechanical or or cyber actuators and sensors are connected to the, to the internet versus people. 
EDL	00:22:12,120	00:22:14,203	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So we have an internet. 
EDL	00:22:14,203	00:22:30,133	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We have a worldwide web, which connects people, Internet of Things, connects the stuff that were working with, and part of the challenges with doing is these are usually traditionally. 
EDL	00:22:30,133	00:22:34,195	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	they've been very traditionally ten years. 
EDL	00:22:34,195	00:22:39,458	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	very simple low-end computers, and I had a connected thermostat(恒温器). 
EDL	00:22:39,458	00:22:58,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I found out when I was writing software to control the house to energy management in the house that if you asked what temperature was more than a few times a minute, you deplete the capacitor that was used to power it, and it would just give you garbage information back. 
EDL	00:22:59,110	00:23:02,410	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So these are dead, very, very simple devices. 
EDL	00:23:02,630	00:23:11,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And as such, don't have very much protection building to them, so they have to be protected, the networks that they are on have to protect them. 
EDL	00:23:11,530	00:23:17,270	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They have to be set in a way that is useful, but not in a way that can be used. 
EDL	00:23:17,750	00:23:35,711	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So not as a way that somebody could go in caused my hot water heater to explode, or cause my furnace to shut down, or in industrial setting, cause a certain agreement to be put into a foot supply that shouldn't be. 
EDL	00:23:35,711	00:23:38,464	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There should be there in that volume. 
EDL	00:23:38,464	00:23:44,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So how do you protect these devices that starts to become a really interesting thing ? 
EDL	00:23:44,500	00:23:54,260	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Interesting question, and it's also not just preventing them from doing something malicious, but they also can be used as a launch point for another attack. 
EDL	00:23:54,470	00:24:18,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So .... if my thermostat not jury brought thermostat, but somebody can connect to it, and then once they are connected to the thermostat that get to all the other devices in my house, that becomes a real issue, because everything on the inside normally one thinks, oh, I'll trust that a little bit more than something on the outside, but that may not necessarily be the case. 
EDL	00:24:19,590	00:24:23,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You can have an insider attack from an internet things device. 
EDL	00:24:23,610	00:24:30,640	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So what concept attempts to do is let you use my house as an example hundred plus. 
EDL	00:24:31,650	00:24:42,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	All of them, slightly different, all of them, a little eye ball and a number of rounders, a number of modems to connect all these things up. 
EDL	00:24:42,800	00:24:49,890	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	How can you configure them in such a way that they will be secure, but they will still work. 
EDL	00:24:50,610	00:25:00,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so what concept does is it goes from a human riddle, human britain set of documents that specify how you want to do security. 

EDL	00:25:01,030	00:25:10,600	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	For instance, if you come to my house, the rule would be, that would be written down, would be your allowed on the gas network. 
EDL	00:25:10,810	00:25:19,968	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But I'm allowed on the internal network to make sure that all the access points around the house are configured correctly to do that. 
EDL	00:25:19,968	00:25:22,057	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So concept these documents. 
EDL	00:25:22,057	00:25:32,959	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It'll look at the diagrams, look at the drawings of the network and digest them and figure out all these are what the security requirements are. 
EDL	00:25:32,959	00:25:41,760	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Then it'll go a step further, and it'll read the manuals, and this is something I know very few people ever do. 
EDL	00:25:41,920	00:25:44,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The manual is always something that comes. 
EDL	00:25:44,720	00:25:45,670	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You look at it. 
EDL	00:25:46,540	00:25:48,620	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Ah.. This is recycleable, and it's gone. 
EDL	00:25:48,700	00:25:58,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It concept, what, sit down and read the manuals, figure out what the configurations are, based on what the requirements were. 
EDL	00:25:58,760	00:26:02,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And then it will put play them directly to the. 
EDL	00:26:03,200	00:26:04,135	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	To the device. 


[Host]

EDL	00:26:04,135	00:26:06,005	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Okay, just let me stop you for a minute. 

EDL	00:26:06,005	00:26:11,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so when you say the concept will read the menu, so it is interesting information. 
EDL	00:26:11,150	00:26:19,597	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I presume these are probably identifies that I would like to do some electronic form of of the kind of paper manuals that I have a huge folder of. 
EDL	00:26:19,597	00:26:25,160	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you're right, I didn't read them, but is that how exactly, it just needs to read the PDF, read the PDF. 
EDL	00:26:25,160	00:26:30,137	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Read the pdas, and it can read images in the PDF. 
EDL	00:26:30,137	00:26:40,670	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So if you can get something scanned in, and it's eligible, and it's in English, it will make an attempt to read it. 
EDL	00:26:41,260	00:26:49,440	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It doesn't always get it right, and because of that, it will also explain why it can figure something the way it has. 
EDL	00:26:49,840	00:26:52,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So you get a human-readable document that comes out. 
EDL	00:26:53,790	00:26:59,050	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I set up a gas network, because guests need to be on the gasoline at work. 
EDL	00:26:59,600	00:27:01,233	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I, Ican read this. 
EDL	00:27:01,233	00:27:01,849	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's not. 
EDL	00:27:01,849	00:27:02,774	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is not. 
EDL	00:27:02,774	00:27:04,623	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is not hemingway. 
EDL	00:27:04,623	00:27:17,290	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is very much computer generated text, but it is completely reasonable and understandable, and explains why the system elected to configure in the way that it did. 
EDL	00:27:17,490	00:27:19,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is really, really cool. 
EDL	00:27:19,400	00:27:30,606	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And given that french students today, a variety engine is a connected piece of the internet, its its performance is being monitored. 
EDL	00:27:30,606	00:27:34,120	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's part of the positive train control system. 
EDL	00:27:34,330	00:27:36,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It is out there getting it. 
EDL	00:27:36,950	00:28:00,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Configure properly is, is a real challenge and are providing tools to athens is a um same thing you for the navy, a modern naval vessel has thousands of computers on it would be really nice if they were configured in a way, according to guidance that also made them useful. 
EDL	00:28:01,200	00:28:18,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the final stabbed concept is when the ship comes back, it can be read, and we can see why the changes occurred, and those can then either be undone or controlled into best practice and incorporated into the next round. 
EDL	00:28:18,660	00:28:19,480	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's. 
EDL	00:28:19,690	00:28:39,360	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Concept in natural, right, and due excellent vision, some of the tools and protocols and practices coming out of concept to be available, said to a whole manner, in addition, because you are, as you are speaking, it became clear to me that you are internet of things in a military setting. 
EDL	00:28:40,430	00:28:57,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Clearly, there are security concerns there and then, and so consequently, aboriginal there, but the threat space, the vulnerability space is really everywhere, because we can have a railroad system attacked through the internet of things, portals, for example, that that becomes the securities, but as well. 
EDL	00:28:58,080	00:29:20,610	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Well, for me, the most exciting trend coming out of concept is one of the performers, and I won't steal their press release under, but they are looking at two product roles for one, which would do automatic configuration of docker containers for virtual machines and moving virtual machines. 
EDL	00:29:21,130	00:29:39,136	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the second is to do automatic configuration of the windows registry, and they're seeing of a strong market and providing this to small and medium sized enterprises as a as a commercial lawfully. 
EDL	00:29:39,136	00:30:04,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So the answer is, if, if you look, you'll probably see this technology available in a shrink wrapped or download of forms in a year or so, and it should make an difference in and how we can do security and buy small and medium enterprise that also include households that have several hundred internet things. 
EDL	00:30:04,640	00:30:15,680	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Quartering that that, and you did you see the example of a inner neighborhood just before, so I on its way, or maybe already has made some transitions into the services. 
EDL	00:30:15,765	00:30:27,900	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We're in some clouds right now to understand behavior and to understand reliability, because we don't wanted to play something and then have it blown up. 
EDL	00:30:28,650	00:30:33,140	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But we are, we're actually an exercise as we speak. 
EDL	00:30:33,430	00:30:41,580	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	To see how this overall, okay, i'm sure you are excited to see you the results of those and learn lessons from those that you can take the programme. 
EDL	00:30:41,740	00:30:43,697	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I don't know it for a learning. 
EDL	00:30:43,697	00:30:46,830	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I don't know how much more time is available for the program. 
EDL	00:30:46,830	00:30:50,942	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	At this point, we have about six months to six month we have been considered. 
EDL	00:30:50,942	00:30:51,334	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And air. 
EDL	00:30:51,334	00:31:07,931	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Sounds like if you got some real transitions that you'll be, which they say, that's kind of the trophy for programs is when the technology comes out in action to get sort of views operationally or with its points, companies or something of that kind of those are all kind of positive results. 
EDL	00:31:07,931	00:31:13,505	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Actually, an appointment, though, even even failures for doubt, our lessons and we learn from. 
EDL	00:31:13,505	00:31:18,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So uh, you know, successes and negatively is always good. 
EDL	00:31:18,120	00:31:26,270	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And and I just like to comment, there was a system called bomber ring that was a shoulder detection system. 
EDL	00:31:27,380	00:31:30,440	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	My former employer had developed you and had developed. 
EDL	00:31:30,790	00:31:36,890	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It went to be shellfire because it wasn't a need after it was initially developed. 
EDL	00:31:37,180	00:31:47,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They're suddenly became a great need for it, and it was able to be filled within ninety days because the technology had been ahead of time. 
EDL	00:31:47,740	00:31:51,260	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Then when the time came, it was able to be brought out and run. 
EDL	00:31:51,340	00:32:01,800	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are european, european great example, you know, just about how context is all important as to whether or technology makes sense or not at a so fascinating to share that. 
EDL	00:32:01,800	00:32:02,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	thanks. 
EDL	00:32:02,480	00:32:04,690	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So now let's talk about one more program, though. 
EDL	00:32:04,690	00:32:10,420	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I guess this is sort of still in the innovation phase, in the sense that is just been approved. 
EDL	00:32:10,780	00:32:16,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You have been received proposals from performers, which is to say the research results will in my work on this. 
EDL	00:32:16,520	00:32:44,312	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You call this one learning, interested in control project or a link for short from the little, I know about a sense of director developed a kind of machine learning account of our official intelligence that will enable military assets, whether it was a ground vehicle weapons system to effectively self discover relevant capabilities it might actually have in the context in which it is placed, even though the original designers and might not afford of that. 
EDL	00:32:44,312	00:32:46,974	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Initially, I don't know from getting that right. 
EDL	00:32:46,974	00:32:53,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I wanted to correct me farming, and this gave me a sense of what you hope to ultimately deliver with this program. 
EDL	00:32:53,470	00:32:56,760	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's actually a little bit broader, in some senses. 
EDL	00:32:56,840	00:33:21,470	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It, because it's looking beyond just systems, because there are all for a lot of commercial systems that are needed by the us military, but also infrastructure resilience, operational resilience and ugly addressing climate change are incredibly important issues that were trying to prevent strategic. 
EDL	00:33:21,700	00:33:24,720	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	God coming to the coming to the documentation right there. 
EDL	00:33:24,960	00:33:33,369	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And the idea behind link is systems live a long time, and they're living longer and longer and longer. 
EDL	00:33:33,369	00:33:39,790	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	If you look at military vehicles, they have lifespans of thirty to fifty years. 
EDL	00:33:39,790	00:33:43,770	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Some of the aircraft will have lives of hundred years. 
EDL	00:33:44,130	00:33:45,910	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You look at private vehicles. 
EDL	00:33:45,910	00:33:56,090	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There are on the road much longer than they have been, and it's because they are good, usable systems through that period. 
EDL	00:33:56,390	00:34:02,362	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	If one hazard system and lets lets the dream take a pickup truck is an example. 
EDL	00:34:02,362	00:34:03,779	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Take a pick up truck. 
EDL	00:34:03,779	00:34:17,190	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You put a tunnel and fifty gallon water tank on the back of it and errors not going to do too great with that water can be filled, the water tank paying empty oats can be fine with the water tank half full. 
EDL	00:34:17,580	00:34:21,000	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It's unbelievably dangerous. 
EDL	00:34:21,200	00:34:22,370	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	[.....]
EDL	00:34:23,410	00:34:24,910	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Thank you for writing。
EDL	00:34:24,910	00:34:26,219	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly exactly. 
EDL	00:34:26,219	00:34:34,676	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so the idea is a modern pickup truck has a platform sensors in a several hundred of them. 
EDL	00:34:34,676	00:34:41,110	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It also has a collection of relatively powerful computer sitting in slideshow. 
EDL	00:34:41,580	00:35:05,560	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so the idea is the system is designed, and it's exclusively designed before leaves the factory to encounter the circumstances that are limited in the users handbook, and unlike network configuration manuals, I know everyone reads there, ultimately, a HAMburger and nervously did cover to cover. 
EDL	00:35:05,560	00:35:06,540	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Where is the fuse ? 
EDL	00:35:06,540	00:35:08,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That's the first time somebody will open it. 
EDL	00:35:08,570	00:35:09,750	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Or where is the tire jack ? 
EDL	00:35:10,790	00:35:17,150	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So the idea is cars are modified trucks and modify the laws are different. 
EDL	00:35:17,290	00:35:27,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Everything is different over the life of the car or over the life of the truck and the ideas to have the control system adapt in correct itself to keep, to keep on going. 
EDL	00:35:28,670	00:35:30,730	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And there is a great deal. 
EDL	00:35:30,800	00:35:33,850	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Skepticism is to how this actually could work. 
EDL	00:35:34,470	00:35:44,865	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But there's, i'll tell you a story of an existence proof that stunned me when I thought there are some researchers who are an imperial college london. 
EDL	00:35:44,865	00:35:48,480	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And again, this is the beauty of being a DARPA PM. 
EDL	00:35:48,590	00:35:58,380	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You can call them up and say, hi, can I talk to you, and they will help me talk to, and they were doing some work with hacks upon robots where they would break a leg. 
EDL	00:35:58,380	00:35:59,380	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They did naturally break. 
EDL	00:35:59,380	00:36:02,020	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It takes turn off the power to it. 
EDL	00:36:02,020	00:36:19,010	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And with these old hacks apart, they would sit there and kind of wrapped around for a minute or two, and suddenly they be up and hoping along on just a couple of lakes and be almost as movable as they were before him. 
xxx	00:36:19,010	00:36:30,160	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	because they, 我想看小猪佩奇第一季的综艺节目有什么好看的电视剧，有什么好看的电视剧吗？
xxx	00:36:30,460	00:36:33,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	我想要一个美人鱼公主裙子。
EDL	00:36:33,430	00:36:40,663	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And that small child is taking a backpack to school, and they want to take everything they have in the backpack. 
EDL	00:36:40,663	00:36:46,510	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They put it on, and they'll stagger(蹒跚) around the little bit in front, and then they will get their footing. 
EDL	00:36:46,900	00:37:11,920	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And there're the races, that's what we're trying to get machines to do is to do that same, learning that that small child does when they take on the noon and heavy load and have them be able to make newer, safely, efficiently in a useful way, just by using what they have internally not having to go to a big cloud server, not to have to have some engineer. 
EDL	00:37:12,260	00:37:19,060	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We do the design, but rather have them customized how they react to something and handle off. 
EDL	00:37:19,290	00:37:24,327	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that's the idea behind the real benefit that i'm seeing behind. 
EDL	00:37:24,327	00:37:30,814	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That is by allowing systems to operate much longer, the energy requirements to manufacturers. 
EDL	00:37:30,814	00:37:33,310	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	These systems goes down dramatically. 
EDL	00:37:33,630	00:37:35,020	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so that's what i'm saying. 
EDL	00:37:35,020	00:37:36,990	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	One of the big benefits of. 
EDL	00:37:37,065	00:37:43,485	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Oh, maybe one of the million solutions we need for mitigating climate change, and it is effective. 
EDL	00:37:43,670	00:38:03,156	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	There's also a little thing that I see you with this program and configuration security, in the sense that it seems like you like you are out to help the anonymity world and the, the world of things, world of technologies, whether we're talking about vehicles, but also all like china technology census, the IOT technology. 
EDL	00:38:03,156	00:38:08,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You want them to be able to learn about themselves and make themselves better, more given. 
EDL	00:38:08,770	00:38:15,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Exactly right, and a big part of this also comes from growing and reading the golden age of science fiction. 
EDL	00:38:16,110	00:38:34,140	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Highline of the camp campbell as a clark, where there was an internal hopelessness that technology could be bent to do good. 
EDL	00:38:34,490	00:38:40,285	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And that's really what IIstill am trying to do that. 
EDL	00:38:40,285	00:38:48,030	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And if I can have IOT systems internalize doing good stuff, I, Ithink it would just be. 
EDL	00:38:48,360	00:38:49,320	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Better place, right ? 
EDL	00:38:49,320	00:38:50,020	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Well, J-F. 
EDL	00:38:50,020	00:38:51,920	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I want you to succeed at that. 
EDL	00:38:52,210	00:38:53,750	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	[..]And this is a sexy, cool secretary. 

EDL	00:38:53,750	00:38:54,820	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	To another question I have. 
EDL	00:38:54,820	00:39:02,040	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And this is just coming from the forty summer patent titles of that was some really interesting reading. 
EDL	00:39:02,300	00:39:08,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So we can talk about all those, obviously, but, but one is certainly just reflect that you can help yourself. 
EDL	00:39:08,400	00:39:11,010	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You are an inventor of you been doing in all kinds of ways. 
EDL	00:39:11,010	00:39:12,180	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Now you do with your dog. 
EDL	00:39:12,550	00:39:18,400	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Are there any of those patents that just really stand out for you either, because they were most rewarding. 
EDL	00:39:18,400	00:39:21,680	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You think the technology, we're a good idea that there would be. 
EDL	00:39:21,980	00:39:25,490	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It would do the most good as we are just talking about yet, or just been doing. 
EDL	00:39:25,490	00:39:27,660	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	It fascinates you for some reason. 
EDL	00:39:27,710	00:39:31,928	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Too, that just made me happy when they, when they were all metrics. 
EDL	00:39:31,928	00:39:36,428	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So go with those aren't so and DARPA is all about metrics. 
EDL	00:39:36,428	00:39:52,350	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So the, the first one originally had a working title of tooth and come on, or two towns, and um at the time I was involved with the technology board for the natural federation of the blind. 
EDL	00:39:52,840	00:40:05,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And there was a real question of how electric vehicles, the tournaments vehicles to affect the blind as they navigate throughout a city. 
EDL	00:40:05,840	00:40:09,440	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	In some respect, economic vehicles would be marvelous. 
EDL	00:40:09,660	00:40:20,034	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The black and white, that is just a wonderful thing, but the other side of it is that it was concerned that electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles would sneak up on people. 
EDL	00:40:20,034	00:40:23,506	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	They wouldn't hear them, and they would cause accidents. 
EDL	00:40:23,506	00:40:28,607	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I noticed this myself, I was driving a hybrid hybrid in the parking lot. 
EDL	00:40:28,607	00:40:33,670	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And if you have a car with engine running, people will just transplant walk to the side. 
EDL	00:40:33,880	00:40:36,740	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	But with the hybrid, they will just keep walking in the center. 
EDL	00:40:36,930	00:40:38,280	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you don't want to blow your heart. 
EDL	00:40:38,280	00:40:41,210	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You don't want to be the guy who blows his orange of pedestrian. 
EDL	00:40:41,210	00:40:42,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I think it was not right. 
EDL	00:40:42,750	00:40:45,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And so what I was thinking was, why not a gentle cough. 
EDL	00:40:46,270	00:40:46,950	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	You know, something. 
EDL	00:40:46,950	00:40:48,080	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We're somebody, you know. 
EDL	00:40:48,280	00:40:50,300	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Excuse me, you know, so they know your're here.
EDL	00:40:50,960	00:40:52,240	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And then I thought, well, why not ? 

EDL	00:40:52,550	00:40:55,280	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	This was at the time of downloadable ringtones.

EDL	00:40:55,820	00:40:59,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	I thought why not have tones that you can download. 
EDL	00:41:00,380	00:41:03,980	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And I went ahead and worked up the system. 
EDL	00:41:04,280	00:41:18,380	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	The patent was filed, and I very pleased to say that many states now require supplemental alert tones exactly to protect those who are sighting paired. 
EDL	00:41:18,380	00:41:20,000	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And you're also around the globe. 
EDL	00:41:20,000	00:41:23,260	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And because of that, that patents actually found real. 
EDL	00:41:23,720	00:41:25,270	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So that one, that one was a fun one. 

EDL	00:41:25,330	00:41:27,439	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	Sounds like a good technology to get out there.

EDL	00:41:29,872	00:41:33,332	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	the time you probably thought you gonna be sitting down here with me. 

EDL	00:41:33,332	00:41:34,415	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	So I just want to ask you, is there a question that didn't come up.

** clock that is running

EDL	00:41:38,850	00:41:46,260	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	What is the thing that worries me the most when I'm here is that we have a clock that is running 

EDL	00:41:46,260	00:41:49,570	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	every DARPA program manager has a date on their badge(徽章)
EDL	00:41:50,360	00:41:58,843	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And that is our final day here, and we feel an incredible urgency to get things done before that date 
EDL	00:41:58,843	00:42:02,972	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	and Covid, really make me feel more.
EDL	00:42:02,972	00:42:05,230	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	'cause I didn't want to lose time. 

EDL	00:42:05,810	00:42:12,430	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	That is actually one of the most interesting institutional characteristics of DARPA to me. 
EDL	00:42:12,430	00:42:13,410	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	And it is that you come in here. 
EDL	00:42:13,410	00:42:19,884	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	We all do right with that cell by date, as a, you hear the open over again, how that does turn up that dialogue, urgency 
EDL	00:42:19,884	00:42:27,620	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	and is thought to be one of the reasons why DARPA has such a track record of producing so much. so interesting to bring that up. 
EDL	00:42:28,550	00:42:29,565	| VfD E48 The Inner-Machine Therapist |	we're out of time.
