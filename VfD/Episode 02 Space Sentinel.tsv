EDL	00:00:58,368	00:00:59,648	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Welcome NC to Voices from.
EDL	00:01:00,416	00:01:01,184	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Thank you so much
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:02,720	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Much for having me I'm really excited
EDL	00:01:03,744	00:01:04,768	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I'm excited to have you
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:09,888	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And before we dive in and talk about the space surveillance telescope
EDL	00:01:09,888	00:01:12,704	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Which packs some really amazing technology that I'm
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:13,728	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Eager to hear about
EDL	00:01:14,240	00:01:15,520	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Let's talk a little bit
EDL	00:01:15,520	00:01:16,800	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	About you
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:19,872	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What I'd like to know is something about your background and interests and
EDL	00:01:20,384	00:01:22,432	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	How you became a program manager
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:27,552	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Sure so a while ago actually started as a photography major
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,832	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	At the University Michigan
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:32,160	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What you might think is a little bit odd start for a scientist
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:36,768	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I was always inspired by these images I would see and astronomy magazine
EDL	00:01:37,280	00:01:39,840	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And at that time I thought I was that means I should be a
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:40,352	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Photography made
EDL	00:01:41,120	00:01:45,984	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	But after learning a little bit more my time there I I drifted over to aerospace engineering
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:51,104	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I got my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering there and a masters as well
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:53,664	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And I went to Purdue where did some graduate work
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:55,968	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Like the naval to NASA mission called the terrestrial planet
EDL	00:01:56,992	00:01:58,528	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Which of the new design for a space
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:03,136	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	After that I had some work I did in policy
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:07,232	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Actually met a fellow program manager here at DARPA who introduced me
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:08,768	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To the house charcoal work
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:10,048	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And the DARPA program
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:11,328	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I was very exciting to me
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:12,864	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And that's how I ended up a
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:16,960	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And before we do really talk about the
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:19,520	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Advanced Technologies that come together into the
EDL	00:02:19,520	00:02:20,288	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Is too low
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,312	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The space surveillance
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,080	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Telescope
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:26,176	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Maybe you can talk to us a little bit about the problem that really
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:30,528	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Beckon the scream 4 something like an SST and what I'm referring to here is
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:31,552	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Is the
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:32,320	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Relentless growth
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:33,856	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	A boat
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:35,392	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Maggie's human-made and
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:37,952	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Cosmos made degree so
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:40,000	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I guess that's really the beginning of the Space Age
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,048	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah absolutely I mean
EDL	00:02:42,048	00:02:45,376	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Where are uses space is becoming increasingly critical to daily life
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:47,680	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I think a lot of people don't know
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,216	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	When space is even involved
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:49,728	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What's really anymore
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:53,824	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And in order to do that we are launching increasing numbers
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,104	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Man-made objects
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:02:55,616	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Into space
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,176	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Are there tens of thousands of these objects
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:02:59,200	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In space right now
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:03,040	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so we have to be very careful that they don't come near each other and
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:04,320	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And sometimes even collide with each
EDL	00:03:05,344	00:03:07,648	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And on top of that we also have debris
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,952	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Get some from man-made object
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:11,232	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	But also just natural
EDL	00:03:12,000	00:03:14,048	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	SST is really focused on
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:17,376	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Tracking and identifying debris and object
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:19,168	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In an orbit called Geo
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:20,704	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Geosynchronous orbit
EDL	00:03:21,472	00:03:23,264	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That's about 22000 miles
EDL	00:03:23,264	00:03:24,032	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The Earth
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:25,056	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The really far away
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:28,384	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Why did I differs from Leo right which is low earth orbit
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:30,688	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	A lot of satellites are there as well
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,480	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That's absolutely right
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,296	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Leo's much closer so it's a little easier
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:36,320	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To tusayan
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:40,416	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Go has a volume of tens of thousands of ocean
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,976	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So not only is it far away
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:43,744	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It's gigantic
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:51,168	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so building a telescope that can handle both of those challenges seeing things very far away over a very wide
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,936	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Area
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,960	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It's really what I see
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,728	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	He is
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:57,824	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Okay let I love that kind of image you just gave us
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,128	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	With all of these oceans above that needs
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,176	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Looked at in
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:03,200	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And monitored
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:05,248	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So you have that sounds to me like like
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:07,552	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You need some old wow
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:10,880	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Technology and maybe this is a good time for you to
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,392	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Talk about
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:13,952	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Those boys really Advanced and unique Tech
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:15,488	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Help
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:17,024	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Nurture to come together
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:20,607	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah absolutely still
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,167	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I think about a digital camera that you have at home
EDL	00:04:23,679	00:04:25,471	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	When you use your zoom lens
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:31,359	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You see the field of view on your camera narrow in on the thing that you're looking at it as you get closer
EDL	00:04:31,359	00:04:32,127	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And that is
EDL	00:04:32,127	00:04:36,991	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	How a traditional telescope works as you change the design that the field of view Narrows
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:40,831	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	With SST we actually had a Unique Auto
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,647	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I were use a curved
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:44,159	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Focal plane
EDL	00:04:44,927	00:04:50,815	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So again I think about your digital camera there is a small focal point focal plane in your camera call the CCD
EDL	00:04:51,327	00:04:52,351	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And that's dance for
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:55,679	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Charge-coupled device if I recall
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,447	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What does the acronym
EDL	00:04:56,447	00:04:57,215	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Mccd
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,727	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Thank you
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:05:04,383	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Well as T obtains that very very wide field-of-view but still relatively very high resolution
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:08,223	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Is actually instead of having a flat fee CD or a flat vocal play
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:09,759	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Eye is curved
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:13,599	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	An SST had the first working curved book
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,903	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That we know of in the world
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:17,695	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And what what's so special about the curved
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:18,975	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Format versus
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:23,583	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	As liquor format allows you to actually Focus the light
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:25,887	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It's a little bit better towards the edges of the
EDL	00:05:25,887	00:05:26,399	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	CCD
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,215	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It's also very very challenging to
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,983	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Build
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,543	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In fact mit lincoln Labs who built the
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,847	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The focal plane had to come up with a completely new process
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,639	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Unable to
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,919	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To enable that curvature
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,199	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Over the over the
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:45,087	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Writing for those who might not know the Lincoln lags Labs is a really fascinating place with a
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:47,903	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	History that goes back really to World War
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,695	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	2 with a task
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:50,719	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Skip that time to
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,999	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Work on what really
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,023	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Was some of the original
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:53,535	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Radar
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:57,119	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It's been really involved in objects among other
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:57,887	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Who sings ever
EDL	00:05:57,887	00:05:58,399	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Ever since
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,191	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So it's a really interesting
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:01,471	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Partner in this case
EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:03,775	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What are some of the other Technologies.
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:05,055	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The Devon really tough
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:07,359	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	DARPA DARPA worthy type of Technologies
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,407	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The processing power
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:11,455	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Telescope
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:11,967	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Quite impressive
EDL	00:06:12,479	00:06:15,295	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And the speed at which it can scan over the
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:18,879	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so we can actually
EDL	00:06:18,879	00:06:21,183	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	View objects / 1/4
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,487	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Of the entire go belt over
EDL	00:06:23,487	00:06:25,023	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Imagine it is 1/4 of the Earth
EDL	00:06:25,791	00:06:26,815	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I eat tonight
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,327	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	From New Mexico
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:33,215	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And that is just incredibly fast drivetrain on the telescope and requires incredibly fast
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,519	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And those are two things that
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,287	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	But we also develop
EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:40,895	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Grandma's coming to standing volume
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,175	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Not to be thinking about
EDL	00:06:42,175	00:06:44,735	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	How does in the field of view of this instrument
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:45,759	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And it's in a
EDL	00:06:46,271	00:06:50,111	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Kind of an amazing perch right this is at the White Sands
EDL	00:06:50,623	00:06:51,903	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Missile Range
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:55,743	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In New Mexico which I guess most people there now is Whismur
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:07:00,863	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	But it's on top of a fantastically name
EDL	00:07:00,863	00:07:02,143	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	A peak called Adam Peak
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:06,239	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Admit you've been there so maybe you can just sort of paint this a little bit of a
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,543	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	A picture what it's like to be there at night by the
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:10,335	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Telescoping and while you're doing that
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:11,103	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Describe the telescope
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:15,711	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Sure did the atom tickets self is very high and very dry
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:18,015	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I am in a very dark location
EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:22,623	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So you can stand up on the peak and actually see the sunset out over the range
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:24,415	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Beautiful
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,231	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And you're also looking right over a site called Trinity
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:31,327	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Trinity site is actually where the United States exploded its
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,119	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	First atomic weapon
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:37,215	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I was just kind of interesting to be standing on the edge of two areas where technology
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,727	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	He was developed
EDL	00:07:38,239	00:07:42,847	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	After Sunset again it's incredibly dark you can actually see the edge of the Galaxy
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:44,127	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	When you're standing
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:47,199	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And after Nightfall
EDL	00:07:47,199	00:07:49,503	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I walk inside the telescope Dome
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:54,879	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The facility itself looks like a very flat Square building with a giant Dome on one
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Decide
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:08:01,279	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	When you get inside that dome which is elevated even higher above Adam Peak and they will open up the door
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,327	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Off of the telescope down
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:07,935	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	At and almost every time I've been there at the wind is just blowing
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:13,567	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And it's freezing cold but everyone wants to stay in that down because it just so neat
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,615	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	All the stars in the
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:16,127	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Telescope
EDL	00:08:16,895	00:08:19,199	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The telescope moving itself is completely silent
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,759	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	They're just sitting there looking at the stars
EDL	00:08:24,063	00:08:28,159	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Give people a sense of the scale of it and how fast it's moving because when you say
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:29,695	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	This instrument
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:32,255	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Is silent and I think about how big it is now
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:33,279	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Fastest moving its
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,303	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Almost impossible
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:35,071	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	For me to think about
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:37,375	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So the telescope itself weighs
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Several tons
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,679	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And it's sitting on it
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,959	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Top of many different
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,471	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Gimbels
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:45,055	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And what it's doing is the the shape of the
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:47,103	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Opening in the dome is rectangular
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:50,431	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so it starts at the top and the telescope movement
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,711	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Is going up and down
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:53,759	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Look up and down in a vertical and
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:55,551	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Autocross in a horizontal motion
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:09:00,927	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And again if it can survive the entire sky so 180° around the Dome
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:05,023	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In one single night again that you know volumes and volumes of ocean
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,559	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	A quarter of that in one night
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:10,399	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Right and some soda literally as it's moving from one spot
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,215	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Taking a snapshot moving to another
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Taking a snapshot
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:18,591	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I'd heard that there's some thousands of horsepower worth of
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,127	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Hydraulic
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:21,663	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Piston
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:24,735	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Other moving elements
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:26,015	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Good actually
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:26,783	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Can can
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,295	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Bring it from one
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,087	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To the next and yet
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:30,111	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The sound of something like
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,927	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I've heard this maybe you can correct it or will you have another metaphor
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,975	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	About as loud as a microwave oven
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:39,071	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I think that's right the only thing you can hear is the clicking of the shutter
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:40,607	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	On the camera
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,399	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Over the hum of a micro
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:48,031	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Right and then so when the shutter is open and it's gathering this light on with you through that curve.
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:49,055	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Element that you talked
EDL	00:09:49,055	00:09:49,823	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Too bad so I can look at such
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:51,103	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Huge
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,639	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Volume of space all at once
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:57,247	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The latest cell phone is going onto as I think you might have said Central like that in our cell phone
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,319	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Can you talk a little bit about that that censor play
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:05,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Yes I'll start with as the aperture is open the light actually comes in and and
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,743	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Hit several different mirrors
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:09,279	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Summer saying Schmidt
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,047	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Optical train
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:12,351	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And it's about a 3.6 m m e r
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:15,679	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So that gives you an idea of a sort of how big the the hole
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,447	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Old telescope
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:17,471	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Stop at several meters
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Text larger than that
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:22,847	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so the light will come in and bounce through that that mirror
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:26,175	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And actually be focused on to that curved focal plane
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:27,711	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Where
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,991	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You know the light hits
EDL	00:10:28,991	00:10:32,063	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The materials in that focal plane in that turns them into an elect
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,343	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Signal
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:35,647	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Which is then transferred into what we would
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:36,415	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Think of it
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,183	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Pixels
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:38,975	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Based on the strength of the Electra
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,535	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Cycle signal you're either seeing a brighter or fainter
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,375	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The longer the telescope is open and looking at a spa
EDL	00:10:45,375	00:10:46,911	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Pacific Place in the sky
EDL	00:10:46,911	00:10:48,959	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Defeater the object
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:50,239	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Might be able to see just like
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,263	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	If you are doing it at home
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:55,359	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Camera okay so now I'm imagining the camera staring out
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,407	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To geosynchronous
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:59,455	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	High altitudes roughly what 22000mah
EDL	00:11:00,735	00:11:02,527	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Our heads there
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,063	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And it's picking out
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:05,343	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Perhaps thousands
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,671	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	At one time thousands of even softball-sized
EDL	00:11:09,183	00:11:09,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Objects is that right
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:12,767	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah that's about right maybe the size of a whiskey bottle
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:15,839	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	If we focused in on one of those
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:20,703	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You waited with you Whiskey Bottle you just said now I'm wondering if there really are whiskey bottles
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,727	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Whirling around in orbit
EDL	00:11:22,239	00:11:24,543	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	One can only guess right we have at astronauts
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:28,895	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So let's assume it's not a whiskey bottle but it's some other kind of debris
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:31,711	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	How many pixels would that single
EDL	00:11:31,711	00:11:32,735	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Object
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:33,759	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Keep eye on that
EDL	00:11:33,759	00:11:34,271	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The sensor
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:39,647	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Shirts will be very few so SST cannot actually
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,463	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Take what we would think of as an image of
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:45,279	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Something in Chia what SSD doesn't really see
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:46,047	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Datsun Street
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,375	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So it is not resolved imagery of
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:53,471	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Of an object in Geo but really an indication of where that object is
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And how it's moving
EDL	00:11:55,007	00:11:57,823	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Okay that's really all important you really want another
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,335	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Trajectory
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:00,127	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Cuz then you can map that
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:01,663	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Projector onto the trajectories of
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,199	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What if all the
EDL	00:12:03,199	00:12:05,759	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Satellites that are out there whether it's for.
EDL	00:12:06,271	00:12:07,039	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Or other entities
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:08,575	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And you can then
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:09,855	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Calculate
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,879	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Where there might be a
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:12,159	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	A nun
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:13,183	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	An unwanted
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,463	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Intersection of those
EDL	00:12:14,463	00:12:14,975	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Trajectory
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:18,815	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Yes that's absolutely right and it also add that
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,631	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Primaries are the telescope right now is actually NASA
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:23,167	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We partnered with NASA to
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:26,751	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Try to identify a catalog new
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,519	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Near-earth
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:31,103	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	NSS is actually prolific at this
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:33,407	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	At finding what we call these Neos
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:34,943	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Primarily asteroids and comets
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,991	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Looking at
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:39,807	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Right right so that's been serving the test out phase
EDL	00:12:40,319	00:12:41,855	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In these earlier
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,623	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Years in a way
EDL	00:12:43,391	00:12:44,927	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Fence first light in
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,975	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	2011 if I recalled my reading
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,535	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Is that when it first went on top of Adam's peak
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:52,095	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Where was that somewhere else no that was on
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:54,399	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Okay so since then can you get a sense of
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,447	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Of the catalogue of observation
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:12:59,775	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Since then
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:00,287	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We work
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:02,079	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	At like a mansion with NASA
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:03,103	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To look at objects
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:03,871	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Near-earth objects
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:09,503	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We've also take some images of nebula and supernova
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:11,039	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Also for a Partners at NASA
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:14,111	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I work very closely with the United States are
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:14,879	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Force
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:17,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	For the Air Force we are observing very faint objects
EDL	00:13:18,719	00:13:19,999	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In geosynchronous orbit
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:21,791	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And I'm providing them information on that
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:26,399	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And that could be anything from a piece of debris to to a small satellite
EDL	00:13:26,911	00:13:30,751	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We also were quite a bit on developing what we call debris models
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:34,079	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I still know telescope is strong enough
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,895	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To see every piece of debris in space
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,199	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so what we do is we make estimate
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:42,015	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	About where that debris might be based on what we know
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:46,111	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	SOS St can see many more objects than other telescopes
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,159	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so we've been using our measurements
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:52,767	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To help develop models for what we think the reality of of the debris is
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:53,535	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Pangea
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:56,351	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Okay that you mentioned many more telescopes and that made me think
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:14:00,447	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Of the larger context to your eye which is the
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:02,751	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The largest of the space surveillance Network
EDL	00:14:03,519	00:14:08,383	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Sure so the United States Air Force operates we recall at the SSN everything has
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:10,175	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Have an acronym the space surveillance Network
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:14,527	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And there are several different types of optical and radar sensors in that Network
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:18,879	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	SSC is currently not one of those sensors even though we do provide
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:21,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Data on an ad-hoc basis to the Air Force
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,255	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I've been very shortly it is going to become
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,047	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	One of the sensors in that Network
EDL	00:14:26,047	00:14:30,143	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	SST is going to be transitioning over to you Air Force use
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:33,471	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I actually very soon on October 18th
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,543	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That is a
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,567	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Important
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,871	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Kind of success for DARPA
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:42,431	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	When we think of what we're trying to do here is
EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,199	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Developed
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:43,967	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Technologies
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:46,271	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To further the cause of of national
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:47,039	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Security
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:51,903	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We really do want this sort of transition ultimately that happened we do a lot of high risk
EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:55,743	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Kinds of Technology developments of the transition doesn't always happen but here is a case where a
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:56,511	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It is so
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:57,791	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Can you talk to me about
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:14:59,583	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Does Baton handoff
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,863	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Frightened
EDL	00:15:00,863	00:15:04,447	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Where we are now so that we we can make this hand off
EDL	00:15:04,447	00:15:05,983	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To the Air Force and then perhaps
EDL	00:15:06,495	00:15:09,823	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Also take us forward to the sequence of events that will
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,615	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Over the next few years
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:16,735	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Sure so I mentioned SST had for slight in 2011
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:23,135	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I was a demonstration system that's a weed developer
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Is wonderfully poetic
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,207	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Term in the telescope
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:26,719	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Community
EDL	00:15:27,231	00:15:33,631	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I would really refers to that moment when all of the conception is over in the development in the building
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:34,911	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Hanging you finally
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:38,239	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Open up this this wonderful instrument to
EDL	00:15:38,239	00:15:42,847	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	2 observation and you desperately want to see what that first observation is nuts
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:44,383	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Often referred to as
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:47,199	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Slight so excited Intrepid that what that was
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:49,759	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In February 2011 the first electricity
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:50,783	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Yes thank you
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:56,671	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So at that time it was a demonstration system in here Darby we try to really push Beyond
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:58,975	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The state-of-the-art Yuna revolutionary
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:15:59,743	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Technology
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:03,071	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And sometimes you always don't you don't always get it perfect the first time
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:07,935	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so with the camera that we had in there in 2011 we realized there were some improvements
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,447	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Could be made
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:12,543	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And so over the past year or so we've been developing a new
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,311	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Replacement
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,847	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Camera for the one that exists
EDL	00:16:14,847	00:16:15,359	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	There today
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:19,455	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So we're installing we finished the installation of that new camera
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:22,015	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And had a guy again first light
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,831	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	On August 18th of this year
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:28,415	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And we're currently demonstrated the approach improve capability
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Of SST
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:32,511	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Once a demonstration is done
EDL	00:16:32,511	00:16:36,607	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And we really a really certain that the technology is complete
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,911	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We are just really excited to give this
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:39,935	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The US Air Force
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:43,775	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It represents an order of magnitude
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:48,383	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Increasing capability from what they're able to see now with their existing opt
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:49,151	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Vehicle sensors
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:54,271	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I am so we are very excited to be able to give them that capability and have that actually
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:56,063	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Run into operational use
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:58,879	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Right so the Air Force will officially take Stewart
EDL	00:16:58,879	00:17:01,695	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Ship of SST in an official
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:03,743	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Ceremony that will be happening up on Adam Peak
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,023	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I'm in
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:05,791	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	New Mexico
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:07,583	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What's going to happen
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:08,095	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	After that
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:15,263	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I asked her that we are actually going to be leaving the United States are actually going to be moving
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,543	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Telescope to Australia
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:19,615	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Are we have some
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:23,711	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The planet is not an easy task for a very large telescope
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:27,807	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In 2013 the Secretary of Defense
EDL	00:17:28,319	00:17:31,135	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And also the Minister of Defense in Australia signed an agreement
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:37,279	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To actually move the telescope from White Sands Missile Range to you Harold e Holt Naval Air Station
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,303	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In Western Australia
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:42,399	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Until once we complete the technology demonstrated and
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,935	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Transition to the Air Force
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:48,799	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The Air Force is going to continue to work with our Australian Partners to physically move it
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:49,823	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Over to Western Australia
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:52,639	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That will be happening over the next
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,663	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Maybe two years
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:57,247	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I know that sounds like an enormous project
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:58,015	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Probably
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:18:00,063	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Worth its own engineering story
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:04,159	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Why take the great pains to move this
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,183	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Telescope
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:06,719	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Ihaveplanet
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:11,327	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I completely agree the movement is potentially a DARPA hard problem in and of itself
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:17,471	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The reason to do it is because that is a part of the world that were very interested in observing
EDL	00:18:17,471	00:18:19,775	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What's going on up in geosynchronous orbit
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:25,151	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We have a lot of very important that lives in that area to include communication
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:29,503	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I'd also it represents a great partnership with our Australian allies
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,575	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It's for the really those two reasons why we want to move
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:36,159	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	We've covered a fair amount for the time that we have
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:37,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	About
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:38,719	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The space
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:44,351	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	A surveillance telescope question that you really wish I would have asked here that I
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,631	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Did not and if so
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,423	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You got to ask it now.
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,263	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Well maybe not a question but I have a statement
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,079	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	My whole life
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:56,895	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I've been interested in swerve looking Beyond
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:18:58,431	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You know what we can really see
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:19:02,015	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And I think it's inspiring to work on an instrument
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:05,599	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It went to see other galaxies it makes it so real
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:09,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	In a way it's one thing to look sort of at a picture in a magazine
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:15,583	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	And it's another to be working with an instrument that can actually Imogen nebula and a supernova
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:18,143	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I said for me working on the program has
EDL	00:19:18,143	00:19:18,911	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Has been inspiring
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:24,031	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Not only from a science perspective but also because we get to contribute to two very important mission for
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,663	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You're at a place DARPA which is
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:30,431	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Kind of all about
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:31,967	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Reimagining what is
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:32,991	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Possible and actual
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,015	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Who taking steps to
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:36,063	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Change what you
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,087	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	To take what
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,623	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	My previously been considered in Paw
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:45,279	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Send a ways to places trying to make science fiction nonfiction I'm just wondering if
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:46,559	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	You have some
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,607	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What are now fictional
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,655	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Technologies in mines
EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,191	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I bet you think
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:53,215	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	What to be real
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:55,263	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	So I have a couple
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:56,287	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I want is
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,823	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	The universal translator
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,407	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	It might have been on Star Trek series
EDL	00:20:01,919	00:20:07,039	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That is a technology or perhaps a superpower that that I absolutely wish
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,063	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That that we had
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:13,951	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	I think the other one is to travel beyond the stars perhaps that's a
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:18,303	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That way he could have guessed it's not enough for me to just look I wish we could go there
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:20,607	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	That's a good place to end I think
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:23,935	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Tell Lindsey I just want to thank you for the great conversation
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:25,215	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Thank you very
