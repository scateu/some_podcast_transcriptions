EDL	00:00:11,870	00:00:31,390	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Delta technology , the internet GPS in the car of your hand on the most occupation technologies , a driver of our times since its founding a one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , the defence advanced research agency has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:31,940	00:00:38,820	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Welcome to Voices from double a window on the dark as a core of program managers , their job to read the fine . 
EDL	00:00:38,820	00:00:40,940	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	What is possible , my name is iphone . 
EDL	00:00:40,940	00:00:43,090	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	A motel went on your dark host today . 
EDL	00:00:43,090	00:00:46,570	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I am pleased to be talking with doctor william carter , a program manager . 
EDL	00:00:46,570	00:01:00,365	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Since the agencies defense science office , we are recording our conversations from our respective homes as we do our parts to slow the spread of covered nineteen , because we are not in a recording studio . 
EDL	00:01:00,365	00:01:02,850	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You met your ambient sounds like traffic and birds . 
EDL	00:01:06,260	00:01:07,440	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Party arriving at door 。
EDL	00:01:07,440	00:01:31,680	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But two years ago , bill , as I will refer to him here was the director of the materials and microsystems laboratory at each oil laboratory , which was founded in nineteen forty eight by the famous billionaire heritage in bill's role in natural , he focused on numerous for three deepening , including high strength metals and ceremonies , mechanical systems , for the stabilization of platforms . 
EDL	00:01:31,680	00:01:51,711	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Like once you might find in space , scalable approaches to high performance , anti failing and nano material coatings and micro electronic mechanical systems , or for months for position , navigation and timing applications , earning his PHUNapplied physics in nineteen ninety seven from harvard university bills . 
EDL	00:01:51,711	00:02:00,000	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Background also includes material science and mechanics , and is more than fifty years of experience managing government and industrial materials research . 
EDL	00:02:00,000	00:02:04,338	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And here's an accomplishment that reflects bills neck for innovation . 
EDL	00:02:04,338	00:02:13,063	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So far , he is accumulated some one hundred and one issued pants carrying new materials and devices for what amount and aerospace applications . 
EDL	00:02:13,063	00:02:20,865	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And now he is contributing his dry for innovation and dropped weighing carter bill , thanks for joining me in this conversation . 
EDL	00:02:20,865	00:02:21,980	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Great to be here . 
EDL	00:02:21,980	00:02:35,650	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So first , in the interests of transparency , I should let you know that I am a huge , huge fan material science , which I consider to be under appreciated foundation of essentially entire history of technology . 
EDL	00:02:35,650	00:02:47,140	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So i'm looking forward to hearing how you are taking materials research in new , and at times , spectacularly fast directions in the programs you are writing here at dark and will get to that in a bit . 
EDL	00:02:47,140	00:03:00,030	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But first I would like to know something about the influences and experiences in your life that turns you first for physics and from there into materials , central origin , industry and government. 
EDL	00:03:00,030	00:03:03,732	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	First really throw that you are a fan of material science . 
EDL	00:03:03,732	00:03:12,370	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I think it's one of the most exciting disciplines as very interesting , and it brings books together from all sorts of different perspectives . 
EDL	00:03:12,370	00:03:28,904	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And of course , we all have , and I need feels for materials , these engineered or natural materials that make up our world and allows to navigate in terms of my background , probably doesn't hurt that I grew up around the , the world of lost alarm . 
EDL	00:03:28,904	00:03:29,923	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Most new mexico . 
EDL	00:03:29,923	00:03:32,725	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	My father was a physicist at the love . 
EDL	00:03:32,725	00:03:35,782	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	My mother was a very adventurous person . 
EDL	00:03:35,782	00:03:51,830	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	She was nursed by background for the year , the public interests in the area , and so I grew up around not only this environment of science , in the public , interest in the public , interest in the national interests , as well as a wonderful adventure of spirit . 
EDL	00:03:52,150	00:03:55,660	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I can remember when I was probably seven or eight . 
EDL	00:03:55,660	00:04:01,080	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I was gifted a telescope and the skies in new mexico spectacular . 
EDL	00:04:01,760	00:04:16,620	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And you are just sitting there wondering and and exploring with that telescope is in relief , ignited it , the desire to go into science for me and spiritually didn't hurt that he was in the female wonderful . 
EDL	00:04:16,620	00:04:23,910	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And let's see , in terms of how I got into material central garden d and engaging with the government . 
EDL	00:04:23,910	00:04:25,980	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So I hand the opportunity . 
EDL	00:04:25,980	00:04:33,550	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And this is , and I don't take the opportunity for granted to do summer jobs at laboratory , and one of those laboratory jobs . 
EDL	00:04:33,550	00:04:37,960	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Summer jobs was with doctor , several adults owners . 
EDL	00:04:37,960	00:04:45,260	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And he was doing material science at hillary , high pressures and high temperatures in diamond cells . 
EDL	00:04:45,260	00:04:54,080	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so in high school into college , I was doing rose on it , and that connected me with the team of harvard that I joined , and the team at harvard . 
EDL	00:04:54,080	00:05:09,260	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Of course , you will allow me to look at that material science in a different way and want to the naval research and switched fields , stone material century , but went from solid state connectives and face transformations into surface and from an. 
EDL	00:05:09,260	00:05:14,010	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Again , that stands for naval research lab for those who were not definitely with the epidemic. 
EDL	00:05:14,010	00:05:30,510	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	The neighborhood , of course , is the corporate research laboratory for the navy and has that culture , and also was really natural transition for me to go to each other , all which was , of course , connected to the huge aircraft companies , and now is covered by boeing , general motors . 
EDL	00:05:30,510	00:05:35,440	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And that's essentially wearing my connection to materials for causing your. 
EDL	00:05:35,440	00:05:46,160	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Came from well , so that gets me to the next question I have , which is , and I usually ask this of those who joined me in his conversations is , it's the , how did I get the dark story ? 
EDL	00:05:46,160	00:05:51,430	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So I know that HRLhas extensive and historic connections with the dark . 
EDL	00:05:51,430	00:05:54,090	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But what specifically was your connection ? 
EDL	00:05:54,090	00:05:56,260	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There are that , and they are getting new to japan. 
EDL	00:05:56,990	00:06:19,290	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There was a particular program manager in defence science , the office about ten years ago , maybe a years ago , doctor , do the gold waster , who , very sadly , just passed away to the pandemic , and a digital doctor was disturbed , a real visionary and wanted to understand how we could really change our world . 
EDL	00:06:19,290	00:06:30,798	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We are around materials in searching for the next new hour , the next new way to to pull out of the period of table females , a strong material , adoptable material . 
EDL	00:06:30,798	00:06:33,324	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so far that can surpass themselves . 
EDL	00:06:33,324	00:06:33,830	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We have . 
EDL	00:06:34,400	00:06:42,600	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And he asked the question , what if we completely inverted that inside , let's try to teach today's materials , new tricks . 
EDL	00:06:43,080	00:06:57,470	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And I had been thinking along the same lines I was working with the colleague at the time , doctor alone checkers in thinking about architected materials , essentially poorest materials with designed architecture . 
EDL	00:06:57,800	00:07:01,250	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And these two visions were right in line . 
EDL	00:07:01,250	00:07:02,510	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so I started working. 
EDL	00:07:02,510	00:07:03,680	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Dark a gold waster . 
EDL	00:07:03,680	00:07:21,330	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And just a question about the what you mean by architecture , and in the scale there , so you talking about the liberate structure at the microsoft scale , and which is why sort of the scale elevator cells were below or or millimeter scale of suicides of puppies is what kind of future sizes are you talking about? 
EDL	00:07:21,690	00:07:28,020	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Probably the easiest analogy would be to tall buildings if you look as an example is my favorite example . 
EDL	00:07:28,020	00:07:30,339	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Architecture is the eiffel tower . 
EDL	00:07:30,339	00:07:41,040	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It is an absolutely astonishing structure in three hundred meters tall , and the relative density of that structure is on the order of a tenth of a percent . 
EDL	00:07:41,040	00:07:48,980	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	What that means is , if I took that three hundred meter tall structure , and I melted it down , but I kept the same footprint . 
EDL	00:07:48,980	00:07:54,690	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I would have a solid piece of metal , which about three hundred and fifty . 
EDL	00:07:54,690	00:07:58,657	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So that's an astonishing , efficient use of matter . 
EDL	00:07:58,657	00:08:03,321	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And when you do it , he looked at the architecture of the iphone tower . 
EDL	00:08:03,321	00:08:05,536	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It is organized as hierarchical . 
EDL	00:08:05,536	00:08:14,302	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You've got it , of course , the very familiar sweeping structure , but then when you zoom and you see that it is a that is composed itself of trust . 
EDL	00:08:14,302	00:08:49,730	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Initial , those trousers are composed of a third layer of process in some cases , and that architecture is what gives that structure , its massification saying , so we thought , okay , could we translate that idea that cool idea from architecture down into the materials level , and so you can look at architecture of many levels within the material nature does this phenomenally well , but when you look kind of where you can get the biggest if it , it is at that , serve micron and microsoft scale , and the key of all materials is that if you can't make enough of that material for an application really does . 
EDL	00:08:50,310	00:08:52,928	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so scalability is absolutely important . 
EDL	00:08:52,928	00:08:56,152	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So we were , we have the laboratory or chasing scalability . 
EDL	00:08:56,152	00:09:03,144	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	How can I make a really big structure that is composed of all these ministers of microsoft scale architectural features ? 
EDL	00:09:03,144	00:09:30,550	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That's where we connected , and then through that program , of course , we've got to no doubt the office got to know media so , and we've been engaged to long conversation about when I , and if I felt like I had really done what I could have data out to certainly explore the creative options there , but also to make an impact in different ways , you know , from a scientific , personal management business , engaging with our LC members of the time born in general motors . 
EDL	00:09:30,880	00:09:54,730	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And I felt like you , my next , really important , solid step would be to go to the other side of the table and understand from the government's perspective , what the driver , where are the really important opportunities , and how can materials help with those and involve able to come here and start working on some of the hardest and most impact form terrorist problems? 
EDL	00:09:54,730	00:09:57,520	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Validation , well and exciting turn . 
EDL	00:09:57,520	00:10:00,040	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I would think of a material scientist . 
EDL	00:10:00,040	00:10:02,460	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So thanks for sharing that story . 
EDL	00:10:03,050	00:10:15,031	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So bill , before we talk about the programs you oversee it doubt , but I want to dig a little bit into those one hundred and one patterns of yours before we know you have your hundred and second already . 
EDL	00:10:15,031	00:10:19,601	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But when we call , can only scratch the surface , I wanted to be pretty quick on this . 
EDL	00:10:19,601	00:10:27,080	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But please give me and our listeners a worldwide tour of perhaps a few of the patterns you personally think of the course of. 
EDL	00:10:28,010	00:10:31,020	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That's actually pretty hard to pick. 
EDL	00:10:31,020	00:10:34,740	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Whatever your children do you like them all , what it doesn't matter that they don't really need to. 
EDL	00:10:34,740	00:10:35,660	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Was just once you like . 
EDL	00:10:35,660	00:10:42,520	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Now , I think the ones are the most passionate about all or in the area of of safety . 
EDL	00:10:43,330	00:10:46,790	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And and safety is , it is not negotiable . 
EDL	00:10:46,790	00:10:51,570	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That's something that we really try hard to ensure and maximize cost . 
EDL	00:10:51,570	00:10:58,309	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You know , you can , you can , for see every contingency , but , but there are things we can do from ontario's perspective . 
EDL	00:10:58,309	00:11:05,850	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And this is in particular , safe for for vehicles , for automotive applications . 
EDL	00:11:05,850	00:11:13,220	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	One really important area that we doubt into about fifteen years ago , ten years ago is smart materials . 
EDL	00:11:13,220	00:11:15,030	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And these choose , I can adapt . 
EDL	00:11:15,740	00:11:43,900	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And the concept was could be enabled the vehicle to adapt to a , an incident , you know , a potential collision in a penalty and impact that kind of thing to prepare itself to be more effective in providing protection for the people involved , whether the pedestrian has been impacted or a person inside the vehicle of those in in its a category of safety that are most proud of . 
EDL	00:11:43,900	00:11:55,420	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And would you look back very finally on is around child safety , there was a particular problem to heart running problem of in our child trapped in a car , and our busy parents who is forgot them . 
EDL	00:11:55,420	00:12:23,350	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	and if we really looked hard at what are all the technologies solutions we could potentially bring to bear on that problem , and we developed the heartbeat sensor that could hear the heartbeat of a , you know , through all the layers are padding in the seat through the car seat and just meeting the people involved in safety and empty coach , child safety and iraq , and with them and engaging with them was just a 不是。
EDL	00:12:23,350	00:12:28,000	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Homely moving experience , but make my head time for one more pattern comes to mind that you. 
EDL	00:12:28,680	00:12:36,670	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	For while we worked on , of course , these architect materials , and we developed a process to make ultra light materials . 
EDL	00:12:37,100	00:12:38,660	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And this is under a dark program . 
EDL	00:12:38,660	00:12:40,960	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And it was really , really fun . 
EDL	00:12:40,960	00:12:44,100	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	The fundamental question was how , like the material . 
EDL	00:12:44,100	00:12:53,843	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And in , of course , we're intentionally putting proposed in , and in that case , we are able to make a material which was significantly later than a error . 
EDL	00:12:53,843	00:12:54,100	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	jail. 
EDL	00:12:54,100	00:12:55,540	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That's what I was just thinking of . 
EDL	00:12:55,540	00:12:57,690	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Which would you have a name called silent smoke ? 
EDL	00:12:57,690	00:13:00,000	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Yes , do you hold a piece of? 
EDL	00:13:00,000	00:13:03,002	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Okay okay , okay , and so we do have a few pounds on that . 
EDL	00:13:03,002	00:13:05,361	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That is a very interesting material . 
EDL	00:13:05,361	00:13:12,360	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It's potentially very good at a christopher and installation where you really want to have never wait maximum right? 
EDL	00:13:12,880	00:13:16,030	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	What is the actual sort of material categories of metal loops ? 
EDL	00:13:16,030	00:13:18,670	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And we're going to come on , can be anything. 
EDL	00:13:18,670	00:13:19,840	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It is more than architecture . 
EDL	00:13:19,840	00:13:22,066	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So we were , we used metals . 
EDL	00:13:22,066	00:13:23,464	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We also use polymers . 
EDL	00:13:23,464	00:13:26,260	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Really , really , really , very flexible concept. 
EDL	00:13:26,590	00:13:32,200	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Okay , and then when everything they came up in an earlier discussion , this goes back , actually more toward your earlier years . 
EDL	00:13:32,200	00:13:46,450	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And you said that you traveled around the world , I think , often with your mother , like just to describe in a briefly with something about those travels , and maybe what you might be drawing from that even now , in your science engineering device. 
EDL	00:13:47,160	00:13:54,880	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Crash , so I think what I draw from that experience just to start on that point is being open to serendipity . 
EDL	00:13:54,880	00:13:57,010	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Let me describe what we used to do . 
EDL	00:13:57,010	00:14:10,030	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We would buy a ticket to some part of the world and another britain ticket from a very , very distant part of the world and figure out how to get between those two places with no plan . 
EDL	00:14:10,030	00:14:17,340	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And it was an apple incredible experience at the first time , my mother and I traveled , we went from hosting . 
EDL	00:14:17,340	00:14:34,140	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	He fell in to hong kong the hard way through the old soviet union down in the china and pakistan in the , and it was just a profoundly lightning experience in every year , a couple of years , we are able to make a trip like that . 
EDL	00:14:34,510	00:14:39,660	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You get a of the world very different people . 
EDL	00:14:40,160	00:14:46,140	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And yet you can be in a part of the world where maybe they don't know very much about you . 
EDL	00:14:46,140	00:14:52,360	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And yet they are welcoming and engaging and with you as a person . 
EDL	00:14:52,360	00:15:14,510	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so I think being open and interested in engaging with people who are very different from myself , a certainly one major lesson , and another is to really learn , to listen to ideas that may be your outside of my experience and trying to understand them and and figure out how we can take those ideas and go from them. 
EDL	00:15:14,900	00:15:20,420	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Well , I mean , I know you got your PHDfrom harvard , but i'm beginning to think of the most valuable . 
EDL	00:15:20,420	00:15:23,450	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I learned a new date was , was on those trips with your mother . 
EDL	00:15:23,450	00:15:23,670	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	why ? 
EDL	00:15:23,670	00:15:31,800	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	What a gift that she gave you and many kinds of lessons at a merge realm , sure that you put those to use now , well , thanks for sharing . 
EDL	00:15:31,800	00:15:38,329	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Now , let us move into a discussion about your really interesting portfolio of programs . 
EDL	00:15:38,329	00:15:53,060	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So let's start with a program called metrics , or in its long form , the materials for transaction program , relevant material categories have intriguing names , similar electrics , multiple roads and face change materials . 
EDL	00:15:53,060	00:15:54,930	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And the applications also prompted years . 
EDL	00:15:54,930	00:16:07,401	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	They include control devices and tennis , migrant motors , energy harvesting and even refrigeration , which actually is quite interesting because we need a next generation refrigeration technology to knock down . 
EDL	00:16:07,401	00:16:09,933	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	What is the major sources of carbon emission ? 
EDL	00:16:09,933	00:16:19,230	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But that's probably story we want to get to hear if we tell me about this program , majority , the new materials , you hope it will lead to , and what you hope to achieve it. 
EDL	00:16:19,760	00:16:23,517	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Absolutely , so matrix is actually a program that I inherited . 
EDL	00:16:23,517	00:16:24,352	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Doctor , gym , gym . 
EDL	00:16:24,352	00:16:31,450	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Let start the program of a variety double , but it's really well aligned with my background and smart terrorism and structure . 
EDL	00:16:31,450	00:16:37,676	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	The core idea of the program was that we've been working on these transparent materials for a long time . 
EDL	00:16:37,676	00:16:47,000	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Female actress , female actress are materials that when you put a temperature grading to cross them , you can transduction that into due into electricity . 
EDL	00:16:47,620	00:16:50,200	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There's other materials you mentioned . 
EDL	00:16:50,200	00:17:03,570	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Faith , change materials , or if they all do this sort of transit doctor process and the frustration in the community for a long time has been , why have these materials benefits in pakistan as we would like them to be . 
EDL	00:17:03,570	00:17:13,230	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	They have this amazing capability , and you are completely revolutionizing thermal management and energy generation , and the core comes up on the program . 
EDL	00:17:13,230	00:17:22,220	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Was maybe it , because we have not called develop the materials along with the application , and you really do need to do that . 
EDL	00:17:22,220	00:17:24,720	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You need to think about what the application is . 
EDL	00:17:24,720	00:17:45,810	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It's trying to do , provide , and specifically in a private day , a few hundred watts for a four red operating base so that devices can be recharged and do so significantly lower masses of the emphasizing power contemporaries than what we can do today with the generator that you might find it home people . 
EDL	00:17:46,290	00:17:54,671	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So that's the core focus of the program , and I think that has really played out in several different aspects . 
EDL	00:17:54,671	00:18:00,030	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There's the energy generation that I talked about portable palace . 
EDL	00:18:00,030	00:18:05,460	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There are several projects that have been cold , developing some electric and then. 
EDL	00:18:05,460	00:18:23,670	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	A device to utilize those , those storm electrics just take me through one or two examples that some of the performers are working at the same research groups that are on contract on the metrics program it took to give listeners a sense of of , in fact , you know , what would such material look like . 
EDL	00:18:23,670	00:18:26,700	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And what would sort of the signal from the environment ? 
EDL	00:18:26,700	00:18:29,150	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I get translucent into something else that is useful. 
EDL	00:18:29,500	00:18:31,600	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Let's take the thermal electric example . 
EDL	00:18:31,600	00:18:39,410	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So in this case , the device would look something like a horrible gas candidate you might get for your girl , think something on that size . 
EDL	00:18:39,920	00:18:43,800	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And inside of that would be a reservoir fulfilled . 
EDL	00:18:43,800	00:18:54,750	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So think you can pour in japanese , japanese or some other type , and there is a burner insights , or converts that fill into heat . 
EDL	00:18:54,750	00:19:03,275	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There is a hut zone inside of this device around that hot zone would be a placed these thermal electric materials . 
EDL	00:19:03,275	00:19:08,187	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And the theological onside it would be exposed to the hot side . 
EDL	00:19:08,187	00:19:12,827	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And then there is a heat exchanger or a of a radiator . 
EDL	00:19:12,827	00:19:25,222	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Then couples to the outside in our two room temperature or weather temperatures in ambient that sets up the temperature gradient across the material and starts the floor electricity . 
EDL	00:19:25,222	00:19:37,110	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And then you can connect all of those their electric elements up to a parking order , and you know that it might have a set plugs like you would see , you know , for USB charging to buy something like that. 
EDL	00:19:37,110	00:19:40,643	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	On the outside , so it's like just a question about that . 
EDL	00:19:40,643	00:19:47,770	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	What is the advantage of doing that , you know , with these advanced materials were to say , burning fuel generator . 
EDL	00:19:47,770	00:19:48,740	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It's a base of generator . 
EDL	00:19:48,740	00:19:51,930	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Lots of people have in the pattern around the background. 
EDL	00:19:51,930	00:19:54,345	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I think there are two major ventures . 
EDL	00:19:54,345	00:19:57,565	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	One is that we would have a significantly lighter device . 
EDL	00:19:57,565	00:20:06,720	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So because there's no moving parts or not with a lot of the mechanics and mechanisms , and could also be potentially more reliable , potentially . 
EDL	00:20:06,720	00:20:13,863	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But I think the other other drainages is that it would be silent , and so do not generate us a lot . 
EDL	00:20:13,863	00:20:14,370	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	They are . 
EDL	00:20:14,370	00:20:18,610	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There's smelly , we could probably change a lot of that if we were able to. 
EDL	00:20:18,610	00:20:21,578	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Categorically , so you can get electricity without screaming . 
EDL	00:20:21,578	00:20:21,752	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	here . 
EDL	00:20:21,752	00:20:22,276	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I am here . 
EDL	00:20:22,276	00:20:24,720	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I am out there in a contested environment . 
EDL	00:20:24,720	00:20:25,360	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Yeah , great. 
EDL	00:20:25,360	00:20:28,656	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And they're potentially good of non natural applications . 
EDL	00:20:28,656	00:20:36,279	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Think one of my favorites is actually the media , if you have a portable station , where are you trying to interview somebody ? 
EDL	00:20:36,279	00:20:42,100	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	The last thing you want is this noise generator said , you interfering with the yet the audio signal. 
EDL	00:20:42,100	00:20:42,550	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	right ? 
EDL	00:20:42,550	00:20:49,540	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Well , i'll have to tell my journalism friends about about this potential new technology for when they're out in the field . 
EDL	00:20:49,900	00:20:53,180	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Another deep dive materials program under your wing . 
EDL	00:20:53,180	00:21:12,270	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And another one I think you inherited from a program manager , zhang , men who I got to know my first twelve to the european bank , twenty sixteen to twenty eighteen time frame , is called the atoms to protect program , or a to p catch me a briefly on the history of the program . 
EDL	00:21:12,270	00:21:14,250	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And where you are taking you. 
EDL	00:21:14,820	00:21:20,120	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So this was the program I actually connection to background done was formulating the program . 
EDL	00:21:20,120	00:21:31,171	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So as a real , a real pleasure to be alone here at the program and shepherded through its final , the core idea behind atoms to product was scalability of energy technology . 
EDL	00:21:31,171	00:21:38,270	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And at the time , john was looking at all of these different new techniques for developing ten materials . 
EDL	00:21:38,270	00:21:57,477	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Absolutely amazing properties and asking the question , why did we not then see a lot of applications for them , and one of the problems is that you need to be able to scale , you need to have a large capability for translating that none of material to the microscopic application . 
EDL	00:21:57,477	00:22:05,890	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You don't think the side of of a , or , you know , entire airplane , when , how do I get serious animated royal properties at that scale ? 
EDL	00:22:05,890	00:22:06,835	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so he developed. 
EDL	00:22:06,835	00:22:11,255	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Program , where you mean , somewhere , you might make a pigging outside sample in a lab . 
EDL	00:22:11,255	00:22:18,040	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But if you're gonna actually apply to something like the site of , how are you going to make enough material , ultimately that you can afford is practical. 
EDL	00:22:18,610	00:22:22,110	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Absolutely , so that was the core question in the program . 
EDL	00:22:22,110	00:22:43,503	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And when you dig into the science , what you realize is that there is , this is beautiful balance of forces at the nano scale that allow us to make these nanomaterials we have in our different , attractive and responsible forces , everything from korea lunch and ionic bonds up to hydrogen bonds up to prevent of all interactions . 
EDL	00:22:43,503	00:22:53,540	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And then we have replaced forces in hardware and reactions , materials that that repeat dramatically , and other forces that cause rearrangements like. 
EDL	00:22:53,540	00:23:05,600	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Brown , in motion , written in this list of force , I just wanted the leaders know who never heard what band of all forces are , those who just thought of very settle forces between molecules . 
EDL	00:23:05,600	00:23:14,010	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So not exactly as strong as they abandoned type of interaction , but a force that does influence the way molecules will interact with one another year. 
EDL	00:23:14,010	00:23:23,989	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Yes , I think the most famous , microscopic example of venezuela's interactions is the gago , of course , you know how the gaga actually can stick to the ceiling at the vendors in the russian . 
EDL	00:23:23,989	00:23:28,398	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But those forces are those forces kind of stop working about how to animate leaders . 
EDL	00:23:28,398	00:23:43,300	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And then we have a hard time then doing things with those materials at sizes greater than , say about my crown until we get a larger sizes where we can start to manipulate things in traditional ways , in a picking place in a different types of other free machining is certainly . 
EDL	00:23:43,700	00:23:52,040	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So the program was really about bridging those two worlds and enabling us to take advantage of those netscape properties at the market . 
EDL	00:23:52,370	00:24:07,340	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	One of the most stunning outcomes of the program is the scalability of college and production , nanoscale college action into a microscope product that could be a replacement , safe for attendant in the body . 
EDL	00:24:07,340	00:24:12,660	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There is a company that were working with right now that has received at the approval. 
EDL	00:24:12,660	00:24:17,095	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	To go into clinical trials , I take it , referring to employee and their work on. 
EDL	00:24:17,095	00:24:18,029	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Yeah , CCO , you got . 
EDL	00:24:18,029	00:24:29,530	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And what was really cool for them was developing processes that allowed them to have the nanoscale college , and , of course , but make them massively parallel and at scale , they did not. 
EDL	00:24:29,530	00:24:38,790	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Is this actually some kind of synthetic goodbye engineer collision , or is it a completely different materialists able to to serve the same function that the ACL normally does that? 
EDL	00:24:38,790	00:24:50,226	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	They've doubles , so leave they've done a mock accord , composite between biodiversity and a reinforcing fiber , a reinforcing element , which is more synthetic . 
EDL	00:24:50,226	00:24:52,978	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But they also have a pure college , important as well . 
EDL	00:24:52,978	00:25:01,600	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And these two , I think , are going to be very impactful , and I am a long time square economy filled my knees , my echoes getting ready to. 
EDL	00:25:01,600	00:25:13,832	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	One one of these , yeah , so there is a some degree of sale ventures in this trajectory of the program , which is really fine as lots of skills and soccer players and many other active people who would love to have a way of repairing of their sales . 
EDL	00:25:13,832	00:25:16,240	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So that sounds recorded that i've heard of another one . 
EDL	00:25:16,240	00:25:17,590	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I think this is europe's . 
EDL	00:25:17,590	00:25:19,250	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Parker is working on something called it by my. 
EDL	00:25:19,710	00:25:22,730	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Assembly printer , yeah , they turned an amazing job . 
EDL	00:25:22,730	00:25:28,532	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And of course , it looks like this amazing background in printing of all clients . 
EDL	00:25:28,532	00:25:44,980	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And they wanted to be able to take their core in one of their correct expertise areas in a skilled , skillful in a laser printing and apply to electronics and be able to produce electronic components. 
EDL	00:25:44,980	00:25:56,030	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Easily as you later print , I wanted to talk about one more program bill in this one is , is your materials architectures and acquaintances for hypersonically or mark program . 
EDL	00:25:56,030	00:26:13,450	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Very clever agreement , because mark refers to the speed of something , an error , but that hypersonic word in the program title indicates that your working materials for vehicles intended to travel at least five times a speed of sale , maybe ten , maybe of times . 
EDL	00:26:13,450	00:26:17,340	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	The speed of sound is this sort of thinking about , just have fast ideas . 
EDL	00:26:17,340	00:26:28,320	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so you calculate the LAto new york trip of a marketing vehicle , which would be travelling at seven hundred miles power , which is two miles , a second or so . 
EDL	00:26:28,670	00:26:34,280	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Then it would take about twenty two minutes to get two early from the new york . 
EDL	00:26:34,640	00:26:39,590	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So what are the materials challenges to building vehicles that can operate at those ? 
EDL	00:26:39,590	00:26:45,780	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And what are you doing in the mark program to try to realize those challenges? 
EDL	00:26:45,780	00:26:49,780	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Yeah , high personnel is a really fun technology area . 
EDL	00:26:49,780	00:26:54,095	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It is the very driven by the capability of the materials . 
EDL	00:26:54,095	00:27:01,842	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And there is one feature of hypersonic vehicle that is absolutely dependent on the possibilities of the materials . 
EDL	00:27:01,842	00:27:05,527	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And as the leading edge of the vehicle , this is the part of the vehicle . 
EDL	00:27:05,527	00:27:10,236	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That means the atmosphere first were flying through the atmosphere is both the space . 
EDL	00:27:10,236	00:27:21,896	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And when you're going , the arab thermal heating that occurs when you cross the air ahead of you , and to , fortunately against the vehicle is absolutely intense . 
EDL	00:27:21,896	00:27:40,460	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Just give your sense of how the heating rate at the front of vehicle skills as the cube of the volatility of the vehicle and also skills as the australia , the spring freestone pressure divided described of the feature size . 
EDL	00:27:40,460	00:27:42,900	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	In that case , the sharpness of that leading edge. 
EDL	00:27:43,320	00:27:45,290	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	But this is basically major to simplify . 
EDL	00:27:45,290	00:27:49,290	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	This mean that the faster you go , the faster and faster , you know. 
EDL	00:27:49,290	00:27:56,340	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You hit up , yes , and it's , it's a really hard wall in a focus in all , as they were developing faster , faster aircraft . 
EDL	00:27:56,340	00:28:04,002	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Talk about breaking the sound barrier once you get to about mark fire , we started talking about breaking the heat period . 
EDL	00:28:04,002	00:28:09,006	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	This is a thorough problem , in addition to a new dynamic leading edge . 
EDL	00:28:09,006	00:28:17,761	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It's a very tiny if you want your vehicle to be a dynamically efficient , it has to have a very sharp leading edge , as opposed to what you might see . 
EDL	00:28:17,761	00:28:20,012	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Say for an apollo entry caps or something . 
EDL	00:28:20,012	00:28:23,952	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You know , we're , we're coming back from space or trying to mediate that heating . 
EDL	00:28:23,952	00:28:24,890	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Those look favorite . 
EDL	00:28:24,890	00:28:28,445	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Don't know the very blanket , very large and very low coverture . 
EDL	00:28:28,445	00:28:30,667	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We're essentially trying to do . 
EDL	00:28:30,667	00:28:32,890	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You're cut through the air if you like . 
EDL	00:28:32,890	00:28:34,667	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So it's about dealing with that . 
EDL	00:28:34,667	00:29:13,313	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And but we've got back in the history as this is wonderful history of incredibly creative engineering solutions to dealing with that heat in the fifties , focused on trying to understand the , and they did not have great materials to work with enthusiasm and a lot of time , adding thermal management to that leading anger to the north column of vehicle , then sometimes in the sixties , we discovered a material rate will be developed material of carbon , carbon , a composite between carbon fivers and a poorest or lower density of north korean metrics . 
EDL	00:29:13,313	00:29:15,803	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And this is an absolutely amazing material . 
EDL	00:29:15,803	00:29:24,331	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	If you are going to imagine a single material for all the properties that you would want , this is that material , and it can handle very high temperatures . 
EDL	00:29:24,331	00:29:27,580	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	This comes to carbon , so it does degrade in the atmosphere . 
EDL	00:29:27,580	00:29:39,940	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You start to oxygen as the carbon thick enough , a glowing cold you would have in your fireplace , and you blow on their clothes , but it keeps the shape leads to some extent , but you can watch it road as your opposite . 
EDL	00:29:39,940	00:29:54,803	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That material took us a long way , and when using it in a variety of applications for leading edges in the bleeding edge of the shuttle , really look at the nose , and the black parts of the battle of carbon carbon . 
EDL	00:29:54,803	00:30:00,636	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It's again , a really good material , but it only takes you so far that blasted humid car , heat wall . 
EDL	00:30:00,636	00:30:09,967	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So what happens when you hit that wall when you start to hit somewhere around me , know twenty , two hundred and fifty and three or four hundred dollars percent of media . 
EDL	00:30:09,967	00:30:19,571	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And then what happens is the carbon starts to burn , and that leading it starts to blunt , and they are dynamic efficiency of the vehicle drops . 
EDL	00:30:19,571	00:30:39,752	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So you are not able to then have as much range or manufacturers like and switch and solve that problem is , how do we have a leading age , which , and also can take even greater heat , and we've gone back to that history , the pre carbon carbon history , and said , okay , we have new ways of handling heat . 
EDL	00:30:39,752	00:31:13,051	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Now you and you know , the cherry engineering industry look at the parallel training industry they're starting to deal with heat foxes that are on this order , but see if we can translate some of their solutions , new high temperature materials that we can produce in network with complex internal architectures going back to our architecture discussion that can allow us to have the structure of strengthens , difficult as well in viewing with thermal management capability . 
EDL	00:31:13,051	00:31:17,060	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So you can hit the heat exchanges transporation and face. 
EDL	00:31:17,060	00:31:34,000	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I love the way you describe all that , because it really helped me appreciate the role that materials will play in the future of hypersonic vehicles , technologies , weapons , in the sense that there are other huge challenges . 
EDL	00:31:34,000	00:31:48,454	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Just what think about proportion , but , but materials will have a certainly an important role in , I guess how one of a flight in any particular kind of vehicle might be expected to withstand . 
EDL	00:31:48,454	00:31:53,763	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And then , of course , that has all kinds of biggest technical and strategic consequences . 
EDL	00:31:53,763	00:31:58,630	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And another general fascinating that comes down to the way you put items together . 
EDL	00:31:58,630	00:32:00,920	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It's an interesting , continuing. 
EDL	00:32:00,920	00:32:07,510	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Indeed , it's a wonderful material problem in the community that are working with is really just energized . 
EDL	00:32:07,510	00:32:25,525	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	This is a really hard problem , and they're bringing your whole variety of potential new solutions and making great progress all about your roughly year into the program , and already showing results were developing new materials , as well as these new phone architectures . 
EDL	00:32:25,525	00:32:27,785	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And how many performers you have on us ? 
EDL	00:32:27,785	00:32:34,112	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We have nine , nine performance plus patterns of them on sort of on the government side , happens every year . 
EDL	00:32:34,112	00:32:40,290	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	They stand up partner for us in being able to connect the material developments with platform performance. 
EDL	00:32:40,690	00:32:47,570	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Just the fact that you said that there were nine performer groups that reminds me , one of the things about dark , but that I find amazing in the projects . 
EDL	00:32:47,570	00:32:55,088	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	In that way , AAproject like this , like mark , and that brings together a number of different performers , different research groups . 
EDL	00:32:55,088	00:33:03,443	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It sort of a way that that an orange community and innovation community gets created by way of the existence of the project is so fruit . 
EDL	00:33:03,443	00:33:15,080	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Yes , yes , absolutely , bill , before we leave mark as we're getting into the sort of the talent of our discussion , whether any other things about that program , or about a hypersonic technology that you like. 
EDL	00:33:15,430	00:33:24,951	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Yeah , just wanted to mention there was one vehicle in the deep , darkest called the most blind reentry vehicle , which flu a year before I was born . 
EDL	00:33:24,951	00:33:29,812	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And we've had one of these types of technologies on it . 
EDL	00:33:29,812	00:33:32,671	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So this is very much back to the future . 
EDL	00:33:32,671	00:33:41,510	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It had a nichol's coin , which was using transparent and had a few like twenty or thirty kilograms of water on board . 
EDL	00:33:41,510	00:33:42,700	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	The hopes to arrive. 
EDL	00:33:42,700	00:33:55,070	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Amazing , no , because what that means is that the engineers were stealing from the plant world trees rely on transparency and bring water up from the roots all the way up to the tops of their canopy . 
EDL	00:33:55,600	00:34:06,510	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So i'm happy to hear that engineers are honouring the biology to I bring into something even like hypersonic technology that is so cool to hear . 
EDL	00:34:06,510	00:34:11,760	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And I guess just one more question is there anything that didn't come up during our conversation ? 
EDL	00:34:12,120	00:34:16,100	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Are you apologized me for not asking up and questioned ? 
EDL	00:34:16,100	00:34:22,200	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I absolutely shoot up , and if you ask the question like that , let me know , and a new answer , if I was going to. 
EDL	00:34:22,200	00:34:36,370	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Add one thing to a conversation is that I have absolutely under the optimism about the potential for science to solve today's most important problems , and I think material science can contribute in others . 
EDL	00:34:36,370	00:34:44,970	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	There's a feeling that we , beneath material science , history of our species , and we've unlocked as much of the periodic tables . 
EDL	00:34:44,970	00:34:46,640	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We can potentially mock . 
EDL	00:34:46,990	00:34:49,268	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I don't think that's true at all . 
EDL	00:34:49,268	00:34:52,231	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I think we have barely scratched the surface . 
EDL	00:34:52,231	00:34:54,738	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We've looked at the one perspective . 
EDL	00:34:54,738	00:34:56,789	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	How do we put items together ? 
EDL	00:34:56,789	00:35:00,000	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	We have tried to look at it from another perspective . 
EDL	00:35:00,000	00:35:15,260	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	How do we have an application drives are up because the performance of the material that that we would like to produce , there's a whole new world of certain artificial intelligence , machine learning . 
EDL	00:35:15,680	00:35:20,550	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	These new tools can be applied to that very old problem . 
EDL	00:35:20,550	00:35:25,355	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I believe we will for fundamental impact for new solutions . 
EDL	00:35:25,355	00:35:26,686	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	That's , that's one . 
EDL	00:35:26,686	00:35:32,840	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I think the other is really about psychological sciences of wonderful field . 
EDL	00:35:32,840	00:35:45,300	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	It brings people together from chemistry , physics , engineering , the end user community in all the different engineering disciplines in a lot of engineering and engineering support . 
EDL	00:35:45,300	00:35:51,290	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And I think we have a honeymoon opportunity to rethink this field . 
EDL	00:35:51,290	00:36:09,473	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So instead of having our different silence , we have through some of these new tools , the ability to now get back together and work as the team I always want to leave you with that message that I really have unbounded optimism about the future materials and the future capabilities that will come out . 
EDL	00:36:09,473	00:36:12,290	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And the ability of these capabilities to solve. 
EDL	00:36:12,290	00:36:14,350	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Are hardest problems . 
EDL	00:36:14,350	00:36:18,320	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Well , we so badly need more and more optimism . 
EDL	00:36:18,320	00:36:31,121	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So thank you for giving me that that uplifting kind of finale , and I just have to say , love the way you're thinking , the periodic table , every material ever was , is or will be a sort of inheritance in that . 
EDL	00:36:31,121	00:36:35,025	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And yet what you say is , we were only minded in a very minor way . 
EDL	00:36:35,025	00:36:50,260	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	And so by bringing all these the central disciplinary sort of to it , in other news , skills and tools or addressed at the beginning of maybe bringing out materials , I can solve a lot of problems , and that is very optimistic message to me . 
EDL	00:36:51,300	00:36:52,820	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	I'm really happy that you run it . 
EDL	00:36:52,820	00:36:54,140	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	You run this task . 
EDL	00:36:54,140	00:36:57,010	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	A billion , and I think we're all better for it . 
EDL	00:36:57,510	00:37:08,724	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	Thanks william carter , because i've been calling it for letting me and listeners in on what the future of materials and the advances in technology to enable might look like . 
EDL	00:37:08,724	00:37:10,640	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	So , just thanks for the discussion. 
EDL	00:37:10,640	00:37:13,470	| VfD E36 The Hypersonic Materialist |	absolutely expand the expenditure, 大家可以扫码。
