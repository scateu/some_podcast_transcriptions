EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:00,832	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Let's start with how you got interested in science and
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:05,440	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What was was there a teacher that transformed you that turns you on to side
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:08,000	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Did you come from a scientific household
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:08,512	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What was
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:15,424	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This hurts me to think of a time when I didn't have science in mind even from a very young age so growing up in in Florida we always had
EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:21,824	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Access to a little critters on the beach or in little creeks in our backyard that we would play with and my sister of who
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:25,664	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Her name is Lisa she's 11 years older than me and she
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:27,200	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Had a career
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:33,600	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That was really on a trajectory to be a scientist until later in life she switched to be a lawyer but in there
EDL	00:02:33,600	00:02:36,928	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Early days I got to go to lab with her and kind of see what that world look
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:40,768	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Call me really interested in so from a very early age
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:46,656	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In high school I was a lab assistant to one of the teachers were I helped him and bomb
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:53,568	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Some of the animals that we would dissect in classes I think I was very lucky through Elementary School and High School
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:56,384	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	School and then going into college and Beyond I always had Opera
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,944	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Opportunities to be really Hands-On with the scientist to
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:00,480	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Understand
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:03,808	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What types of science I really liked him and what I didn't like and
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:05,856	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I remember in
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:07,136	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	High School
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:10,208	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	One of our teachers would take us to a local
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:14,304	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It was I think was a limestone mine and in Florida where they would
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:21,216	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Pump out dirt and rocks from really deep into the Earth and there's many fossils Mastodon teeth and things
EDL	00:03:21,216	00:03:24,544	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Like I said that you could find that really had an impression on me because that's where
EDL	00:03:25,056	00:03:27,360	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I first started to learn about Evolution and
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:30,688	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And then all through school I I did take the opportunity
EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:33,760	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Student work in the laboratory as an undergraduate
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:36,832	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Adored attacking that's why I came back to do a PCV
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:37,344	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Because I already had
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,880	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That you're a half under
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:42,208	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Justin for listening to it never seen a mastodon
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:44,256	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Actually have I mean they're like the size of
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:44,768	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Eraser
EDL	00:03:46,048	00:03:47,584	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Amazing things to see
EDL	00:03:48,096	00:03:49,632	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Obviously I was catalytic
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:52,448	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And when I look at you or your
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:53,984	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Degrees
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,008	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Both of them
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:57,312	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Are an Applied Biology which is to say your bachelors
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,080	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Rihanna Dior
EDL	00:03:58,080	00:03:58,592	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Your PhD
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:04,736	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	On the way but both and Applied Biology which tells me that from a very early age you were looking at
EDL	00:04:05,248	00:04:07,040	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Biology as
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:07,552	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Technology
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:10,880	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So how did that early inside
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:11,648	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I come to you
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:18,047	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	His estimated to think about it I hadn't thought about it that way but it but I did always see biology
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,071	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Piazza is a tool
EDL	00:04:19,071	00:04:25,215	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And I told understanding the world around us and later than in the University it's a tool to understand disease
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:31,871	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And then the integrated actually even with it person moving into the medical-device world at Georgia Tech I was
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,151	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In one of the early classes
EDL	00:04:33,663	00:04:34,431	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:36,479	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Was working with vial engineers
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:39,807	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	They're just watching a a bioengineering program at Georgia Tech
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:42,879	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So it was really interesting for me to interact with
EDL	00:04:42,879	00:04:45,183	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Did the engineers who would actually builds a device
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:47,487	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Based.on sings like
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:49,279	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Cellular mechanics and fluid
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:50,815	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Jackson and that was pretty mind-boggling
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:52,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You take that
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,143	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It actually turn it
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:55,167	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Intuit device
EDL	00:04:55,167	00:04:55,679	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	10 proof
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:59,519	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So for some years you worked as a contractor are you with booze

EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:09,503	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is that actually how you got to know DARPA
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:12,063	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	No actually I got to know DARPA
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:16,415	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	When I was working in the Biotech Industry appear in Rockville Maryland
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:23,327	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And the CEO of a small company I worked at call Dad life this is where we were developing Diagnostics

EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:34,079	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The CEO of that company Alan Rudolph used to be a DARPA program manager and I had not heard about DARPA
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:38,687	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I'm before meeting Alan so sometimes over lunch or just casually he would talk about this magical
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,967	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Call DARPA wear
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:45,855	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It really seemed that you can have a a wild idea and as long as you had a great Technica
EDL	00:05:45,855	00:05:47,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I plan to make it happen
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:51,999	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	There could be a password to try to implement that in the more I learned about DARPA
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:54,047	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The more I really
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:55,583	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Got interested in
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:58,655	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And when I was looking for the next step in my career

EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So you've actually warned both
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:10,591	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:14,943	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Those two categories of employees here the Sita and the program
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,015	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	As you just mentioned there there are
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:24,927	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Two categories of employees here there's that the government employee which is the program manager and in other supporting staff and
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:25,695	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Anicetus
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:29,791	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And the way I like to describe that model 2
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:36,191	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Two folks in biology especially their familiar with having a pi in the lab and then people that work with them to assist
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:39,007	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Principal investigator
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:42,847	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In a laboratory and they have a supporting staff of
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:45,151	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	They could be grad students they could be
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:47,967	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Staff scientist II to help them Implement division
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That pi and really
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:55,647	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	DARPA to me at the program manager and Cedar Villas is very much along those lines a program manager is responsible
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:59,999	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Buffer for the vision of the program and and the direction forward in the strategy
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,279	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Inesita team
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:04,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	There's various roles as they can provide technical content
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:06,911	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That's complementary to the program manager they may have to
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:07,423	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Strategic guidance
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:12,031	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Are they may have deep darpet experience because oftentimes Atascocita
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:16,127	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Maybe here for it for many years longer than than a program manager
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,151	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Of course we're here for
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,687	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Term appointment
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:20,479	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What's nicer get into your dark life
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,247	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	A little bit
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,807	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In 2016 who became a program manager
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,343	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	At that time you inherited
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	One program called
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:27,903	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Living

EDL	00:08:50,943	00:08:52,735	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And this is all about it
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:57,087	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Developing a tool kit to rain in limit and even reverse some of the
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:08:59,391	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Emerging extremely power
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Powerful

EDL	00:09:03,487	00:09:05,535	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I want you to talk about those but
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,303	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Before we do
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:08,863	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I just want to hear a little bit about how you
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,399	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Think about
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:11,167	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Biology
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:14,239	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Because as we look at some of these tools and we'll talk about
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,287	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Last night
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:19,103	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	To me they're sort of miraculous
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:20,639	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Little nanoscale
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:22,431	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Machine that it makes me

EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:28,831	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I don't mean to lead you that's not nice of me
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:31,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Talk to me about how you view
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:32,671	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Biology on these sort of Malay
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Skeleton
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:34,463	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And even higher
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:39,327	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The way I think about biology is really from it of an applied
EDL	00:09:39,327	00:09:40,607	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Approaching and that
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,887	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Has a lot to do with I think
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:43,423	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I'm having been
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:44,703	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Brought up scientifically

EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,335	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Emerson Donnelly biology but surrounded with engineering
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:52,383	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	When I look into biological
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:58,783	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This time I think about how that system could be manipulated in a programmable way of looking at some of the tools that synthetic bile
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:01,087	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Allergy bring saucer or genome editing like
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,623	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Crisper cast 9 witches
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:08,767	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Christopher is one of the biggest acronym so used today stands for a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
EDL	00:10:09,791	00:10:14,911	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What does protein does it's it's really interesting it at the origins are it was a bacterial immune
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,935	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Effectively wear
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:22,847	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Feed virus would insert his DNA into a bacteria that. Bacteria would would cut up that DNA
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:23,615	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Using crispr
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:24,127	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Caste system
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:29,503	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And take little pieces of that phage DNA and put it into its own genome as a memory
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:30,783	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Of that
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,063	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Infection so that if that
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:34,367	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Again to infect that cell
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:38,463	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I would say oh hey I have this information that I've seen this before I can now
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:44,607	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Sew-Vac in 2012 what researcher is Jennifer doudna and others
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:45,631	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Recognize where
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:48,191	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	He could actually program
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,959	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:49,727	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Cast nine
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:53,311	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Recognizes it doesn't have to be a phase but you can provide it within
EDL	00:10:53,311	00:10:55,359	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Information to say okay
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,895	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Go after the specific
EDL	00:10:56,895	00:10:58,687	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Piece of DNA and that was very
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:05,599	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Powerful I like what I like to think of from the darker perspective as a Sputnik moment and biology so we had a lot
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Innovation in DNA
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:10,207	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Sequencing and synthesis you could look over the decades that we
EDL	00:11:10,207	00:11:12,767	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	We kept improving that technology is very powerful now
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,815	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	But all of a sudden we had a toilet
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:15,839	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	How to be able to edit
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:16,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That DNA
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:20,191	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And that's that's really has changed a lot in the field now there's
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:21,983	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	There's very few organisms at
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I can't be edited
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:26,335	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I love the Sputnik moment partly because when you look at some phages
EDL	00:11:26,335	00:11:32,735	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	When one is named T4 they look like little spacecraft
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:37,855	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That's right yeah there's even microsatellites in DNA sometimes
EDL	00:11:38,367	00:11:43,999	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	But for me that's what created an urgency for this new tool in biology that that I say
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:44,767	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I think makes it national
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:48,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So let's let's talk about the two program
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,631	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	We'll start with the one that you inherited
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,191	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Living Founders tell me little bit
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,471	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	About the history of that and it's
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:58,591	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Sure so that original program manager who launched that effort Alicia Jackson
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:03,455	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	She had this Vision to start to create a tool bed where we could
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:06,271	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Distill biology to an engineering
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Where you could
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,367	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Take something like the design
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Build
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:15,743	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Test learn cycle of engineering and apply that to a biological system like a microbe
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,559	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And E coli or a yeast or other types
EDL	00:12:19,071	00:12:20,863	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Bacteria to make products in Mali
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,399	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Would be of value
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:24,703	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And
EDL	00:12:25,215	00:12:25,983	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Really
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:29,567	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Things that her inspiration came from looking at biology as
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,615	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This incredible system that
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:34,431	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I can make a real diversity of molecules that
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,967	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Extends well beyond what we can make
EDL	00:12:35,967	00:12:37,503	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Through traditional manufacturer
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,879	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So when you have access to that diversity of biology
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,927	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Can you start to manipulate that to make new
EDL	00:12:44,927	00:12:46,975	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Molecules things that have never been made
EDL	00:12:47,743	00:12:48,255	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Buy biology
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:50,047	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The most
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,071	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Ambition School
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:52,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The program
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,655	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Silver foundational Investments really
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:57,215	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Created the tools under each one of those
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,263	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Categories of design tools that you
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:00,543	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You can quickly in an automated way
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,335	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Design a biosynthetic
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:05,407	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Pathway to stitch jeans together to put into a microbe
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:08,479	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Build services that the DNA synthesis and
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:11,807	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Insertion of DNA into a living system
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:12,575	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Testing this
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:17,183	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The mass spectrometry and other measurement tools to look
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:19,231	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	If a product has been made and importantly
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:21,279	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Learning so this is
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:26,655	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Some of the designs you make or not going to work and programming that into your learning cycle to not use that design
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,167	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	How to make a better design
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:28,959	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Important
EDL	00:13:29,471	00:13:33,567	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So when I took over the program The Living foundries 1000 molecules
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:35,871	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Program was just taking
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:42,271	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	King of the first phase of the program was to build those individual components and tools and now the second phase is to really integrate them
EDL	00:13:42,271	00:13:43,295	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	As a platform
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,855	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	To create this boundary type capability that
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:52,255	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	U.s. military or a customer a business customer could go to a Foundry and say I would like
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You to make this molecule
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,327	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The pathway and the organ
EDL	00:13:56,863	00:13:57,887	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:14:02,495	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The ultimate demonstration of that capability that Foundry capability is to make
EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:06,847	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And we're 551 molecules
EDL	00:14:06,847	00:14:10,175	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And so our teams which are Amherst Simonton and MIT
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,711	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	T-bird Institute they've saved
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:13,247	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Collectively made five
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,831	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Can you just give listeners a sense of the
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:23,231	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The kinds of Molly the kinds of molecules so they're very diverse they can be anything from adhesive to Coatings to
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:27,583	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Paige might want to put on the outside of an aircraft all the way to a small molecule
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Kohl's that that could be used
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:32,959	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	For the medicines countermeasures cancel
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:35,263	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You name it the whole gamut of
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,799	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Set of small molecules are
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,823	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Being developed
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,847	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Under that program
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,175	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Now we're about two years into 4 year program
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:48,575	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The final two years is going to prioritize a small subset of those molecules that have been produced
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:52,159	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	They're very compelling that we'd like to scale-up so so far we've made
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:54,207	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Pretty much detectable amounts meaning
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:15:00,607	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You're very small amounts of each one of those molecules and we'd like to move to the kilogram level so that these are not
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:03,423	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Taxable amount that we can really Implement in enlarger
EDL	00:15:05,727	00:15:07,519	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Absol exciting area me when you just
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,799	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	We think about biology
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:10,335	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I think of things
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:15,711	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Sequoia Forest you know in Amazon forest diversity of
EDL	00:15:15,711	00:15:17,759	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Of creatures in an all of the tissues that
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,063	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	They're made of all the materials they are made of
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:22,623	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Hormones and neurotransmitters
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,159	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	There's all of these these powerful
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:25,439	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Names of substances
EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,463	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Come out of biology
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:28,255	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And now here bringing a different mindset
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:29,535	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That seem kind of
EDL	00:15:30,047	00:15:30,559	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Contacts
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:32,095	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Of synthesis
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:34,399	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Really kind of exciting
EDL	00:15:34,399	00:15:40,799	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I think it's a great point that you mentioned that that biological diversity across the globe because what many of the teams are doing art
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:41,567	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Are looking at
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:45,151	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Extreme environments across the globe looking at microbes looking at plants
EDL	00:15:45,151	00:15:50,015	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Even looking at some some human enzymes and you can stitch those together a plant enzyme human enzyme
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:56,159	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Extremophiles microbe enzyme all together in a in a Workhorse organism in the laboratory tutu
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,695	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That's so it is
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:00,511	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This program is very much dependent on biological
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:03,583	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	University and looking at the enzymes that that can be detected
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:04,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In the wild
EDL	00:16:04,351	00:16:06,655	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Doing their normal jobs that they do in the wild that we
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:10,495	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Laboratory so you're also leveraging
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:16,639	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The way Evolution has pushed biology to be Innovative in its biological context sort of seeing where you might find used
EDL	00:16:17,151	00:16:17,663	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Things are but then
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,199	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Further with human
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:20,223	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Absolutely
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,039	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So then let's go to
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:23,807	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Safe
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:27,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This is this was your first baby here right so
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,159	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Talk to us about
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:28,927	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	About that
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:30,463	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The origin of it in your mind and
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,255	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What the status of that
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:32,767	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Program is now
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:37,375	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	16 is a program that that's the part of my came to DARPA
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:38,655	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	To run in fur
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:43,775	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The listeners that they don't know the way that program is stood up at DARPA is it it's
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:44,799	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	If it's very grass
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:49,663	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	After each type of process where it comes from the program manager and an initial idea or concept
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,967	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That we can bring to our leadership
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:53,247	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Been to the director of DARPA that gets
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,039	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You into a pro
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:58,111	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So I came to darker with the idea
EDL	00:16:58,623	00:16:59,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	2
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:03,487	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Really try to harness the beneficent use of genome editing
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,255	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Technologies like Chris
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:06,559	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Best nine but to prevent
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:08,095	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Their potential for Miss
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:09,887	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So at this point these
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:10,911	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Stools have
EDL	00:17:10,911	00:17:12,191	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Really been democratized
EDL	00:17:12,959	00:17:19,103	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It's arguable that probably every molecular biology lab in the world has access to these tools and it's using these tools
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,175	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So the Genie's out of the bottle it's out there
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:28,575	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And there's a lot of power in these tools for for editing genomes and we can do a lot of relate
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:33,951	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Tremendous good with these tools but their potential for misuse both nefarious and accidental
EDL	00:17:33,951	00:17:34,719	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is a real
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:36,511	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That vulnerability that
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,535	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I came to
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:40,095	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The agency to try to address simile
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:45,727	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The ability to control editing activity if you want to use it in a given system to limit it only for you so much
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:46,495	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	System
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:47,519	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The counter
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	At the
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:54,687	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Start of the safety program there was no countermeasure available meaning no inhibitor of a genome editor that can shut down if it's activity
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:59,039	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is it should accidentally be misused or or in a more malicious
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:03,647	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And then finally if it changes made how come you restore a DM back to its base
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,183	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Find state to remediate then
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:10,815	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Yeah it's it's a remarkable set of tools
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	One of them
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:12,863	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I heard you talk
EDL	00:18:13,375	00:18:14,399	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Reminds me of
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:14,911	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Telomere
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:21,055	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Ticks off how many times a cell has replicated and there's only so many times that a cell can do that
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:24,383	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Before it dies off it sounds to me like you're something like that
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That you
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,455	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You are your performers and by that I mean the research
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:31,039	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Have contracts under the safe genes program
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:33,343	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	They might be working on some similar mechanism
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,367	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Limit
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,135	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Hey
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:35,903	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Genetically
EDL	00:18:35,903	00:18:37,183	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Edited cell
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:37,951	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And it's
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,231	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	How long you can be out there
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:45,631	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That would definitely be under the category of a controller that that we're developing our we do have some generation
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Encounters
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,703	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The one thing that I haven't mentioned is the
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,287	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	If there's derivative tools that are made from GM editors
EDL	00:18:52,799	00:18:55,615	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Called Dean drives and this is one of the most power
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,639	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Uses of these
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,175	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is because
EDL	00:18:58,175	00:19:00,991	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What Dean drives do is they ultimately biased the outcome
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,015	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Inheritance
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:03,295	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Where
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,319	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	When Mom and Dad gets
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,855	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Together you normally have a 50
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:09,439	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	50 chance of of a gene in an offspring coming from Mom or Dad
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:11,487	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	But through a gene drive when you
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,023	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Couple a gene or trait
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,559	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	With a genome editor
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:17,631	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That can force its inheritance to near 100
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:20,959	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Until when you can buy us the outcome
EDL	00:19:20,959	00:19:22,239	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Two levels that are about
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,543	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Reach up to 100%
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,591	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You want to be able to have a way to
EDL	00:19:26,591	00:19:27,871	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	To control that if you don't want
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:29,663	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Straight to go
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,991	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So one way you can do that is to
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,039	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	But if you want to keep
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:38,623	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Something like a gene Drive local you may say okay after
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:40,415	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	After five generations and reproductive
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,439	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Despite Cycles this
EDL	00:19:41,439	00:19:41,951	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Can shut down
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,231	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And so these are some of the Techno
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:47,583	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Write so clearly you you are
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:48,863	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Stick in an area of
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,399	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Powerful by Allah
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,239	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Some of those who
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:57,823	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Forbidden from the beginning of I'm thinking here of Jennifer doudna
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:04,223	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Who has been in on this from the beginning it's so she's written a book that I read recently and when you read
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:07,295	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That she is both utopian
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,063	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:08,831	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Thinking about
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:09,343	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The power of
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:12,927	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Tools like crispr cast 9 in

EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,023	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Good things but she also
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,071	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What is inside some
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:20,351	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Points in the book sort of dystopia
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:27,263	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You are in the middle of this is when you go go out to conferences the promise and the Peril of these Technologies are always part of that discussion
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:31,615	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	How are you thinking about that as someone who is in a position now to
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:33,151	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Direct to some degree
EDL	00:20:33,663	00:20:34,943	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	How this research
EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:35,711	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Ghost
EDL	00:20:36,479	00:20:39,039	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So somebody is once described me as
EDL	00:20:39,039	00:20:43,391	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Surprisingly upbeat for someone working on Gene editing and National Security
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:46,463	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	But I'm really excited about that the promise
EDL	00:20:46,463	00:20:51,327	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Of these tools not only for addressing an inherited genetic disorders but
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,863	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The potential for use of the
EDL	00:20:52,863	00:20:59,007	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	These tools to eliminate infectious disease in a way that's Superior to our current countermeasures that we use
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:01,055	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I look forward to the opportunity
EDL	00:21:03,359	00:21:04,383	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I think there's a lot
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:07,455	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	To be sad for for biodiversity as well
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,223	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In terms of
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,039	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	A tool like a gene Drive is going to have to
EDL	00:21:11,039	00:21:11,807	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The face
EDL	00:21:11,807	00:21:15,903	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Natural biodiversity of perfect Dean drive would only work in the system where

EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:18,976	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	All the way across
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:21,792	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Send in any
EDL	00:21:22,304	00:21:23,584	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Some so I think
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:24,352	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Reality
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:24,864	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Some of the
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,912	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Piece of these tools is
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:27,936	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is actually going to be.
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:32,800	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Challenging to achieve in as long as we're addressing those risks that while we developed the beneficent used
EDL	00:21:35,872	00:21:36,640	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Horse forward
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,920	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	When you think about the work
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,688	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That you are doing
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:39,712	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Now in the
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,736	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Biological
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	In DARPA's Institution
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,368	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What do you say about DARPA's
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:48,672	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Place in the overall kind of innovation
EDL	00:21:49,184	00:21:49,952	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,000	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Because you work in a number of parts of that
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,768	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Ecosystems
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:53,536	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So I think you might have been
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:58,912	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Having been at DARPA now in some capacity for about eight years I I can
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:01,728	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Absolutely say DARPA is it is Leading Edge and
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:06,848	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It's a place where you learn about new technologies new ideas we we have
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,152	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	From industry from Academia Reach Out
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:10,432	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Time with Swiss
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:13,248	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Concept so I I do feel that
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:19,136	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	DARPA is a special place where we have Early Access to these Technologies are at least information about
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,416	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	About these Technologies and
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,464	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Really responsibility to
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,768	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Look at that diamond and understand you know how could these
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:26,560	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is 4 good
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:31,936	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Use for bad and then really be ready for a to address both of those in and out
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:32,704	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Appropriate way
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,240	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And when you think
EDL	00:22:34,240	00:22:35,264	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	About tools like
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:36,544	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Forecast 9
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,336	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You spoke about
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,360	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This tool
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,384	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Within the context
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:41,408	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The program's you working on
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:42,944	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	But when you think of
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,480	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Maybe
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:45,504	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Best application
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:51,904	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The answer to that question
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:53,184	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Probably
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:56,000	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Varies depending on on who your speech
EDL	00:22:56,768	00:22:57,280	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So I'll
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:01,120	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Had the opportunity to be in meetings with patient
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:04,704	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	For a number of inherited genetic
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:08,544	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The ability to create a therapeutic
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,128	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	For an adult individual who has
EDL	00:23:12,128	00:23:13,152	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Suffered long-term
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:14,944	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	From a disease I think is it in
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:17,248	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Incredibly exciting if we can do something to
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:17,760	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Can prove that ended
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,320	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	There
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:22,112	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	They're desperate for those Technologies
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:22,624	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is and
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:24,928	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I think yours and an opportunity for
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,232	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	A lot of good
EDL	00:23:27,232	00:23:29,536	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So that's that's one of the things I'm most
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:30,048	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Excited about
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:32,608	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And many diseases that otherwise have no.
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,912	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Options at all the religious
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Treating symptoms
EDL	00:23:35,680	00:23:36,192	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I was trying to make peace
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,264	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And the other
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:44,896	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Is of course this is when a lot of people points to 44 Dean drive but is the ability to eliminate
EDL	00:23:44,896	00:23:45,920	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Factors that
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:46,688	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That carry disease
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:50,784	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Says things like malaria or Dengue or Chikungunya as we
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:53,600	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Have more and more emergent diseases that that
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:54,624	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Are spread through
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,696	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Actors this is beyond incredible
EDL	00:23:57,696	00:23:58,976	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Tool to implement to
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:23:59,488	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	To prevent their
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:05,376	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Right and again now we're talkin about such powerful technology so what
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,400	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	CNN debate here
EDL	00:24:06,912	00:24:08,704	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Has been in do we get rid of these
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:09,984	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Mosquitoes
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:11,008	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The vector is it actual
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,032	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	We carry these things
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:16,384	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Which sounds on the surface to be at sounds like a solution but on the other hand
EDL	00:24:16,384	00:24:22,784	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And I think you've talked about this yourself we are talking about very complex ecological environment and so even though we think about
EDL	00:24:22,784	00:24:24,576	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That mosquitoes is essentially bad things
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,624	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	We don't know if we got rid of them
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:28,672	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What would that do ecological
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:31,488	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Right yeah and that's that's something that we have to take a very
EDL	00:24:31,488	00:24:32,256	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Serious clothes
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:34,304	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Lookout because we could be opening up a new ecolodge
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:35,840	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It's right if we
EDL	00:24:35,840	00:24:37,376	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	1 species of mosquito
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:42,752	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And there are many P species of mosquito out there right so they say you can be inviting a new mask
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:45,568	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Needs to end
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:46,848	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Potentially bring in a different
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,920	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Really this is a
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:56,320	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Teachings of the short-term funding for four years there's no open released but we want to start to develop test beds for these systems
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:59,648	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Understand how they behave over Generations but it but I think this
EDL	00:24:59,648	00:25:00,160	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Question
EDL	00:25:00,672	00:25:02,720	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Of how this might work in the environment
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,256	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It won't be answered
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:07,328	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So we can roll
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:12,192	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What is it's interesting I often think about the history of Technology
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,776	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	As part of the solution becomes
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,288	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The problem
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:23,200	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	I'm taking care of things like CFC chlorofluorocarbons which were a great solution to a refrigeration problem
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:23,968	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Early last century
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:25,504	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	People are dying from The Reef
EDL	00:25:26,272	00:25:26,784	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That were being used
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,064	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Mcfcu
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:28,832	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Come in
EDL	00:25:28,832	00:25:30,112	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You're not flammable.
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,904	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Toxic then and they become
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:32,416	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Wunderkind
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:33,952	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	That purpose
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:36,256	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	But then is there made in massive amounts
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,584	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	The same stability and makes them great goes up to the Stratosphere in stores

EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,312	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What is in this context
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:51,616	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Next episode the solution canticum the problem
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:53,920	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What are the problems that keep you up at
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:59,808	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Before you go back to the dean Drive examples it is that retina what are the long-term
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:01,088	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Applications and so
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:03,392	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This would be a genetically modified organism

EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:48,704	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And even in the initial designs of the experiments you know what might this look like
EDL	00:26:48,704	00:26:49,472	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Like in 10 years

EDL	00:27:15,840	00:27:17,632	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Renee is there a
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:18,912	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Question that you
EDL	00:27:18,912	00:27:22,496	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Wish I had asked her you wish some of your other interviewers from other
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:26,336	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Interviews in the past had asked you that I haven't
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,360	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	So
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,384	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	You can ask it any vinance
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:33,504	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	One of the questions I I
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:37,856	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	People do ask me if I want to put a plug here for that item,
EDL	00:27:37,856	00:27:41,696	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Answer this is an international genetically engineered machines competition
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,488	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This is
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	A place
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:45,792	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Where a lot of
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:51,424	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Researchers and individuals amateurs interested in synthetic biology get there
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:56,544	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	This is a pretty low threshold way to get into
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,592	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Competition setting to say
EDL	00:27:59,360	00:28:01,152	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	What's something cool you can do with
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:02,176	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	With engineering biology

EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,536	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Didn't have to
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:18,816	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Address
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:23,680	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Safety and Security in all of their designs and it wouldn't that be a great thing for every
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:24,960	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Lab to be able to do
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:29,312	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	One of the things I've noticed since being a program manager is that
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:32,640	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	People are often blind to the potential
EDL	00:28:32,640	00:28:33,664	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Use of Their Own
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:37,504	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	It takes somebody from the outside to be able to look in
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:38,272	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	And
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:44,416	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	See where where those potential vulnerabilities are not only for just the system won't work in might break
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:46,720	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	To wow this could actually become
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:51,840	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	A problem you mentioned biotechnology becoming the problem I think if we had the ability to
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:52,864	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Really look
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:59,264	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Objectively at each other's work and try to identify those vulnerabilities and then mitigate the risk said that that are
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:01,824	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Are presented that would be much more excited about
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,360	| Episode 20 The Genomineer |	Forward for bios
