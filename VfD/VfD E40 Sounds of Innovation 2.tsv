EDL	00:00:05,110	00:00:10,590	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Going to a science or engineering laboratory , close your eyes and listen it a biomedical lab
EDL	00:00:10,590	00:00:17,461	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	You might hear an operation refuge spinning up as a separate the components of sample in a chemical analysis lab
EDL	00:00:17,461	00:00:25,066	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	You might hear the wind of a turban pump as it vacuously the chamber of a mass patronage in a missile proportion research facility
EDL	00:00:25,066	00:00:33,670	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	You might be aggressive , white noise from a test burn of a potential new jet fuel in exciting , you can hear a sonic fingerprint of what goes on there
EDL	00:00:34,220	00:00:40,163	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Welcome back to sounds of innovation and internal infrastructure of our Voices from dark or podcast
EDL	00:00:40,163	00:00:48,260	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	My name is iphone motel on your dark host , rather than hearing the voices of program managers , which is normally which you get in voices
EDL	00:00:48,260	00:00:50,850	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Of course , you need a sounds of innovation episode
EDL	00:00:50,850	00:01:14,425	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	You will hear some of the soundscapes of research and development and learn just a little bit about what new capabilities those sounds could lead to in this episode sounds harvested from research efforts under the wings of an fisher , a program manager in the agency's defence sciences office , and stacy williams , who finish her tour of duty as a program manager in the technical technology office at the january
EDL	00:01:14,425	00:01:18,790	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Let's get right to it with a sound of innovation that stacy sent my way. 
EDL	00:01:26,300	00:01:29,130	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Each one of those nothing sounds comes from a laser post
EDL	00:01:29,130	00:01:32,843	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	It's measures into the service of a senior woman and played
EDL	00:01:32,843	00:01:35,819	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	It's just one element of a motivated investigation
EDL	00:01:35,819	00:01:42,410	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Drop a sponsoring to understand , characterizing , ultimately better defend against lasers using the battlefield
EDL	00:01:42,410	00:02:02,388	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	This is the catalogue captures a few moments of study , which is measuring how laser lights scatters from different media that might be present in a battle situation and improved understanding of such scattering phenomenon should open door to new protective defensive systems that can detect and monitor in real time adversarial use of higher energy lasers
EDL	00:02:02,388	00:02:06,766	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Either photographic military assets were directly attacking war fighters
EDL	00:02:06,766	00:02:09,353	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	The sound clip comes away from laser scattering
EDL	00:02:09,353	00:02:15,290	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Field tests conducted by dr richard , president and colleagues with sensing strategy in painting to new jersey
EDL	00:02:15,810	00:02:29,980	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Now , I would like to treat you to a medley of laboratory sounds , a program manager , and fisher sent to me , given where these sounds are coming from , it would be defensible to say they depict advanced technologies that literally transform our world and elemental levels
EDL	00:02:30,360	00:02:31,970	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	The middle goes on for close to A. 
EDL	00:03:17,620	00:03:23,500	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Those were some exhibits of the future of chemistry emerging from the laboratory of league coroner at the university of glass
EDL	00:03:23,500	00:03:31,342	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	His group is working for an official under a research contract with her naked program , as well as her accelerated molecular discovery program
EDL	00:03:31,342	00:03:44,416	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Together , these programs aimed to expand access to the vast diversity of that could be technological useful , but that we might not know about yet or have yet to figure out how to make efficiently and cheaply to further , these causes
EDL	00:03:44,416	00:03:47,270	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	The chronic group is building digital chemistry
EDL	00:03:47,270	00:04:11,693	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	They call these digital chemical state machines , or , unless finally computers , these combined artificial intelligence of a molecule making algorithms and automated synthesis machinery into systems that by themselves , plan out , execute after my sequences of chemical reactions and procedures to yield valuable new molecules , including drugs for trading , covered nineteenth patients , new and avoided candidates and new pain to name
EDL	00:04:11,693	00:04:31,747	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	But if you , the five computer sounds that , but you heard correspond to a children turning on for a cooling , a chemical reaction to purify a chemical , a digital surround for moving chemicals around the background for the chronic team's computer equipment , occupy fractions , sampler for identifying chemical constituents
EDL	00:04:31,747	00:04:44,490	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	And finally , a mechanical component , it leaves a rotary evaporator or a role of APP and a heating bath into place for concentrating a solution and isolated the products of chemical reaction before final purification
EDL	00:04:45,690	00:04:49,010	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	We will close out this episode with a sound of innovation group
EDL	00:04:49,010	00:04:53,200	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	I saved until last , because it has a bit of that run from the room quality to it
EDL	00:04:53,200	00:04:55,430	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	And I wanted to stay with me to the end
EDL	00:05:08,090	00:05:17,770	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	What you just heard our detections of photos as they had an ultra sensitive obstacle detector in the laboratory of jonathan hobby at the university of southern california ã€‚
EDL	00:05:17,770	00:05:21,370	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	These detection events happen on a nano second time scale
EDL	00:05:21,370	00:05:35,765	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	So the USEteam adjusted the sampling frequency of the events to the much slower audio rains so that we can hear them , rather than just see them on laboratory at first , before the researchers turned on their laser , only deemed background letters
EDL	00:05:35,765	00:05:43,550	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Observe , that's why the detections of photos are spots in the audio texts are low when the researchers fleak on the detection rate skyrocket
EDL	00:05:43,550	00:05:48,783	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	That's when the sound resembles a photographic window scratching across an old vinal record
EDL	00:05:48,783	00:05:53,650	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	The sound comes down again once the lazy returned off , and all that is left is in background
EDL	00:05:53,650	00:06:05,353	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Hobby's team collects data like this is a developed normal way to detect laser light , even amid statement background , like the first clip you've heard in this sounds of innovation episode
EDL	00:06:05,353	00:06:10,447	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	This last one comes from research overseen by former program manager stacy williams
EDL	00:06:10,447	00:06:18,046	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	She's helping this research will help prepare our world fighters for a future in weapons are ever more present in the battlefield
EDL	00:06:18,046	00:06:25,152	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	There are now a few effective options for detecting , characterizing and locating sources of high energy laser weapons
EDL	00:06:25,152	00:06:30,970	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Yet that's just kind of technical data , our need to effectively and responsibly to play counter measures
EDL	00:06:32,080	00:06:36,399	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Thanks for listening to this episode of darkness , sounds of innovation series
EDL	00:06:36,399	00:06:42,290	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	We will be posting more puzzles in the series intermediately as a feature of the Voices from global partners
EDL	00:06:42,790	00:06:49,546	| VfD E40 Sounds of Innovation 2 |	Thanks also depends selected for his partnership and producing the program for more information about the programs
