00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:30,300
Stealth technology, the internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation. technologies is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, doubt this offensive best research projects agency has been a driver of technology.

3
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:38,720
Welcome to Voices from DARPA a window on the DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible.

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,810
My name is, Ivan Amato, and I am your DARPA host today.

5
00:00:42,810 --> 00:01:17,554
I am pleased to be talking with Mr. John-Francis Mergen, though I will call him J-F through the rest of this podcast. As a cyber security technology developer, J-F joined DARPA as a program manager in the agencies, Information Innovation Office in January 2020, just as the Covid pandemic end up with getting under way, his previous job was with Raytheon BBMtechnologies, where he was chief scientist and a senior Raytheon fellow. Before that, he worked for a number of companies among them, Verizon, General Electrics, and SAIC and Roll's centered on communications and information management.

6
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:35,440
I should point out the BBMtechnologies, which was acquired by brazil in two thousand nine as an important historical connection with urban in nineteen sixty nine, is delivered four IMPs (interface message processors), which were pivotal components, enabling the birth of ARPAnet and ultimately the internet.

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:48,260
Moreover, beyond vice president for engineering psychology, from 1956 too, JCare late later, was one of DARPAest, most visionary research managers and leaders in its early years.

8
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,060
Okay, back to John-Francis, back to J-F. As an undergraduate year university

9
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,610
He double majored in electrical engineering and operations research.

10
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:08,030
He builds on that foundation by earning a master of science degree in management with a concentration and information systems from MIT's Slogan School of Management, a few other details to share.

11
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,866
J-F is a private pilot and a HAM radio operator, and has more than 40 patents to his name.

12
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:24,119
They have titles like wireless vehicle, slash journalist and public announcement system, malware and temporary system, computer architecture.

13
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:30,660
And this one, a bit of an space debris using upper atmosphere and more text generated.

14
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:40,205
J-F, thanks for joining me in the studio today and to share with me a tale about your ongoing adventure in technology development.

15
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:51,314
I'm really happy to be here. So we'll get your life as a program manager soon enough, and also to those patents at the end briefly, but let's go straight to those hobbies.

16
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,660
You fly planes, and you are a HAM radio.

17
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,530
So just briefly tell me about those interests.

18
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,830
And how is that part of your life now?

19
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,930
Flying has been part of my life about 26 years at this point,

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:25,970
my wife came home from a business trip announced that she wanted to learn to fly, and I tagged along and got my pilot license along with her. And since I've gone on to get multi engine and instrument ratings and con[..] lighters and seaplanes, well, but so it's a two pilot households, which makes a discussions with the budget committee on changes to the airplane much easier.

21
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,100
Ham radio has been part of my life for much longer.

22
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:42,270
I've been a handwritten operator for over fifty years, and during that time, have operated outside the us and really got involved with packet radio when that first came up.

23
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,880
Right, for those who are not in that, a kind of, in the world of HAM radio(业余无线电), just give us a little bit of flavor of the kind of content that flows over the airways

24
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,730
, the airways when you are behind the controls.

25
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:59,920
It has jokingly been said that HAM radio is one of the few hobbies where you build equipment so you can talk about your hobby.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,373
It's really set into several different communities.

27
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,060
There were experimenters.

28
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:14,150
There are people who like to do public service and public support, such as emergency communications during floods and hurricanes.

29
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,370
And there those who enjoy handling traffic and.

30
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,267
Just right, actually uses code now, very interesting.

31
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:25,897
Cause, you know, community resilience is becoming so much more important.

32
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,470
And so you would, be in a position to really be part of that solution.

33
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:38,340
And you really get to see and work with first responders, and those who have to deal with with those that get hurt.

34
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:50,450
And it really affected my whole way of thinking about what the role communications was in our society and what it could do for good in terms of helping people when they are in need of help.

35
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,762
Haha, So i'm beginning to hear it hints from that.

36
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,522
Interesting, what are you doing now ?

37
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:56,635
And so we'll get to that just a little bit.

38
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:04,490
And I do like my discussion partners in the partners in the podcast, some sense of society of the original story of your interest and patients.

39
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:16,780
And so if there were people or teachers or parents, are some a pipeline or some failure, just whatever in your earlier years, we're important in the development of your interest in the industry, professional integrity.

40
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:33,470
Whether there were a couple of people I grew up in a university town with, with teaching parents, and my dad was a was a professor yell, and I remembered an early meeting with one with his ph address.

41
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:44,190
Professor looks, and he would always bring me a trickett of a piece of patrick would have an eggs, something.

42
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,450
And we talk about it.

43
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,720
And I learned a little bit from it, and one day I was really proud.

44
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,580
I had gotten a four hundred power microscope for my birthday, and I wanted to show this to professor louds.

45
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,790
And he said, oh, you know, I can.

46
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:10,550
The four hundred power microscope because I have, these 10x magnifier that I wear around my neck, and I can see more through that than I can understand.

47
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,150
I could never understand what comes from a 400W-power microscope.

48
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,120
And I was crushed as a little kid.

49
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,830
I had this thing.

50
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,940
I was really proud of.

51
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:30,860
And then he gave me the techniques manufacturer, and I still have, it is hanging on a book in my home and what he really made me do was realized.

52
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:45,520
Observation is incredibly important for doing science, and that the power of tool, the, the speed of a tool is not as important as really thinking about what you're trying to see and what you are trying to see him.

53
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,510
And so that really affected me as I, as I grow up.

54
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,670
HMM, it sounds like a lesson you continued to embrace.

55
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,520
Yeah, it's, it's.

56
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,300
I try to think it's simply about things as I possibly can.

57
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,930
Such transformative.

58
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,220
Yeah, thanks for that story.

59
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,830
So what's now, can I move into your DARPA experience ?

60
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,630
And let's start from the beginning.

61
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,710
And you have been here for more than you.

62
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,050
You want to be a second europe.

63
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:24,040
I arrived in january twenty twenty, which was just two months before the world health organization and declared south korea too, in the spirit of it, to have a kind of ascended to pandemic.

64
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,832
So what was the course of events that got you ?

65
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:29,425
Your job here is an it ULprogram manager.

66
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:35,043
This is a manager in the information innovation offers one of DARPAness, executive offices.

67
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:36,340
And then what was it like ?

68
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,660
Get hearing and just very shortly after, you know, this sort of being this Covid status.

69
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,240
Well, i've been a performer, which is the DARPA of violence for somebody who who executes on the program.

70
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,980
I've been a performer and PI for DARPA for about twenty years on and off through that period in time.

71
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:09,320
And some of the people I've work with had been, ex program managers and another people who I formed good friendships with went off to become program managers, uh, deputy of directors and office directors.

72
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:18,540
So I had a long affiliation with DARPA doing research, working with the PMs to develop new program, ideas and alike.

73
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:26,410
And it was coming to DARPA with something I always wanted to do, but I needed to wait for the right time in my career.

74
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,810
I wanted to be sure my son had graduated from college.

75
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:40,420
I wanted to to achieve certain milestones and also get some people in place at my old employer to make sure that the research could carry out.

76
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:51,290
And I also wanted to have the right set of ideas for programs I didn't show and went around for a year trying to come up with an idea for a program.

77
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,110
So I had my low basket of program ideas, and I came in the door.

78
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,340
I was all excited.

79
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,930
I started up.

80
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,540
And part of the reason for coming to DARPA is.

81
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:15,407
There are several neat things that DARPA program managers get to do 1) they get to talk with other people who are, who are in the organization and get their ideas and get them completely unfiltered.

82
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:20,672
But the other one is, you can tap into researchers all across the globe.

83
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:27,417
You call up and say, hi, I am from DARPA, and I was wondering what you were thinking about something.

84
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:34,650
And usually the conversation will run far longer than you ever anticipated, or you ever even planned.

85
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:46,857
But you're sorry, when it's over, i've been able to talk with researchers at CalTech, and MIT, and they'll call back with another idea afterwards.

86
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:49,953
That is unbelievably exciting.

87
00:09:49,953 --> 00:10:02,710
And for someone like me, having that kind of access is the great entertainment I could ever hope for the other big piece about this is you get to go see their lab, and you got to go see stuff happening.

88
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:10,220
And as you can guess, from being a pilot, from being a HAM radio operator, i'd love to touch the technology.

89
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,200
I love to play with that.

90
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,390
I love to do things.

91
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:27,220
And so two months after I arrive, I cannot go see the lab anymore, and I can't see my coworkers, because it will doing our part to trying, and it be safe and keep other people safe.

92
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,390
And so it was a little bit maddening.

93
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:39,040
You know, it's sort of like going into a giant technological toy store, but you can only see through the windows.

94
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,200
What's there ?

95
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,560
And it says "Close Indefinitely".

96
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:54,310
Exactly that has been my single big frustration since coming here is I cannot go as fast as the organization normally would let me go.

97
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,930
And i'm seeing a substantial difference with the reopening.

98
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,400
[inaudible]

99
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,350
Boys are exciting.

100
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:12,660
[Host] interesting to hear, just in the the kind of specific loss that a program manager we can experience in a, in a situation like Covid.

101
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,623
I mean, Covid just brought a thousand million different kinds of losses.

102
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:24,880
So interesting to hear you express the specific sort of loss that program just loves to be in the midst of the performers of researchers working with you need to be [primed] into

103
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,570
that connection.

104
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:34,960
Let's now talk about your, the programs that you run, one of them, you develop from scratch and just got the green light will be talking a little bit about that.

105
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,899
What started by talking about one of the programs, jewellery, heritage.

106
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:45,624
So this was called 'Searchlight' that had been up and running for about a year or more before you check it over from an outgoing program.

107
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:49,360
Manager is often that often happens the end of the course between PMs.

108
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,340
So in brief, what absent capability was the importance for the program.

109
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,530
What is the invasion and pointed at this point, and what is its status?

110
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,730
First, I want to comment on the idea of the hand off from one program manager to another.

111
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:11,710
I was extremely lucky in that I knew the PM, who quite well, who I was taking over from.

112
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,816
And so, [Host] and that was?

113
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:24,060
Jonathan Smith, JMS, and he, he has been a visionary in the communications area for a number of years.

114
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:38,820
I, won't say how long. How about JMS tell you that, but he really does tend to lead, in the uh, in the digital networking area, and so is very nice.

115
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:52,880
I had an understanding of his vision going forward, and I was able to wrap some of my own, my own experiences inside of Telcos? to be able to to bring it forward.

116
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:03,610
So it certainly, yes, he is evolved into is a need solution to a very thorny(棘手的) problem.

117
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:21,530
And one of the things that I think many people listening to this experience of recovery was live on zoom or life on teams, and occasionally really will have the all I can see your pictures breaking up.

118
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,430
It's getting jealous.

119
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:54,360
The one of the reasons that this occurs are actually doesn't occur all the time is because of a service on networks called QoS, or quality, which allows certain streams of data that are very time critical to be given priority, or to have their cheater, or the variability in a packet delivery reduced, and that allows for good video, good audio.

120
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:08,150
And if you're doing things like transferring a file or uploading a new version of your system or book, transferring a thousand pictures from your vacation, those can have a little bit of general.

121
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:15,840
They can have a little bit of bouncing back and forth, but also, fortunately, people are also starting to become more security country.

122
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:26,201
What that means is they're traffic where the data coming in and out of their houses or another businesses is wrapped in an incredible group.

123
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:35,502
And what this does is, it prevents the networks from really understanding what the traffic is that they're carrying.

124
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,874
So it'll see upstanding, you.

125
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:39,950
All the pictures of my.

126
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,310
It was also having a phone conversation over the same network connection.

127
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,650
It's all equipped it.

128
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:53,560
So therefore our voice gets the same priority as the picture of the fish record, not particularly useful.

129
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:15,840
So with such like those is one of the things inside the search light is that it's able to understand what those traffic clothes are, even though they are increased, and it lets the network provide priority, and I need to be very careful in explaining how this technology works.

130
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:29,490
It can understand with the flowers it cannot underscore, cannot be see what the flow is carrying, right or not, examine the content, not examining the content.

131
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:39,340
It is looking at the behavior of the floor and then moderating the movement of that flow based on the need for priority for that type of traffic.

132
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,110
So what it does is it preserves privacy.

133
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:54,990
It preserves confident reality, but it also preserves the flow improvement capabilities of the network, so that is really a new way of doing it.

134
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:08,430
And the other thing that it does is, it allows for moderating other traffic flows, slowing the loading of the fish pictures of access so it can be done not directly in the path.

135
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,810
So it gives carriers a lot more flexibility to use the band with that they have.

136
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:23,740
And as we saw a journey of it, managing a band with is important mechanism for allowing us to cope with problems.

137
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,560
And the game goes back to how can communications be improved or moderated to make people life better?

138
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:38,500
If we register to give people a concrete sense of what this technology delivers, I say it fulfills the vision that you had.

139
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,490
The previous program manager had, maybe the access to reach these metrics.

140
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,180
But how does it make life better for either, you know, a civilian, or perhaps in it is offensive.

141
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:55,009
In any place where there is, let's bend with them could potentially be used.

142
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:58,875
It provides a better mechanism for sharing APP.

143
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,210
So we get that hi priority gets the high priority.

144
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:11,320
So i'll use the home example on this, both my wife and I working hard during coffee, both on zoom calls.

145
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,606
I am also downloading a copy of the operating system.

146
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:32,690
I had to stop downloading the copy of the operating system because I consumed all of the bandwidth that coming into the house, just doing that, that file transfer, if I had a certified enabled system, I wouldn't even thought about it.

147
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,710
Calls would have gone through without any problem.

148
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,830
They would not have been dropped.

149
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,570
They would not have been jittery or blocky.

150
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,650
And my operating system copy, my copy of Linux would have arrived a minute and half later.

151
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,160
Then it, then the otherwise would have.

152
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,350
So that's an example of how it can make things better.

153
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,850
Another example is uh in telemedicine.

154
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,990
And this is important to both DoD and civil, because we can get the medical personnel into the field.

155
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,790
where it's needed at all time.

156
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:14,090
So telemedicine is a very important mechanism for getting that first round of care to everyone have no field.

157
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:27,826
It means that if somebody is downloading a maintainence manual for truck, it's not, it'll take a little bit longer to get there, but the telemedicine session goes on on in a rapid.

158
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,730
So that's another example of it.

159
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,860
Right you now cannot be, want to be in the middle of either a procedure or giving instructions for procedure.

160
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,610
And you freeze, and then you leave people on the other end wondering what they should do in medical situation.

161
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,830
Exactly, you don't want the media to be seen and be certain too, and then just dead.

162
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:58,960
So now let's move on to another program that you're inherited in this one, actually, really, I think, will be relevant.

163
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:20,490
Many people who are buying more and more internet connected technologies, which is scheduled when you think of all of these things, they are collectively known as the internet of things i'm referring to the program called configuration, security or concept for short, had its beginnings in the twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen time frame.

164
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:33,490
You took the batton in 2020 again, soon after you start suddenly, unlike many program managers, you, you are shepherding two programs and certainly thinking about the third one that will talk about just a little bit.

165
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:45,100
So some of this technology already is getting adopted in places as the USnavy and also the federal railroad administration, on other places.

166
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,230
Before we talk about the program in some detail, i'd like just to hear what your definition is of internet things.

167
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,720
Internet of things has a whole bunch of different conditions to it.

168
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,830
In my household.

169
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:06,190
I have a internet connected rabbits and include internet connected piggy bank, as well as weather stations.

170
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,830
As a matter of fact, several hundred devices are sitting on my home Internet.

171
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:19,240
Okay, now you don't want to ask the interruption of talking about the definition here, but you just have to explain what is an internet connected rabbit.

172
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,580
This is something called the neighbor's technique out of friends.

173
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,530
It has years that vehicle back and forth.

174
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,170
And right now, all the servers around by volunteers around the world.

175
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:58,740
But it was a very, very early incentive of what would be something like the amazon alexa, and it now evolves too, basically telling you things like you look really good today, or that it's nervous, and upset. And people have made, nevertheless attack or*****ras with several hundred of these things.

176
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:10,000
My son found it when he was studying overseas and and brought it back, and it's become part of a petting zoo of internet of things, devices.

177
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,727
[Host] Okay, so I no longer have a very longer animal in mind when you say that, and you will clarify it.

178
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:23,570
Sometimes it seems a little bit in some homework in character, though you raise bees so you do have animals in your life.

179
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,050
And and I actually have an internet of things bee hive.

180
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,099
I get telemetry back from the bee hive(蜂巢) that helps me manage and understand

181
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,681
how the bees are doing.

182
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:44,850
I can take the temperature of the humidity and weigh the hive remotely, which gives me some indication, as to changes in the amount of brutal, the honey of the hive.

183
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,320
[Host] Okay, so you are richly connected through various internet of things in your own personal life.

184
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,960
In some ways, you already define maybe what Inter of Things is.

185
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,920
but I didn't interrupt you. So finish that definition, then we talk about concept.

186
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:11,890
[Guest] So Internet of Things is when mechanical or or cyber actuators and sensors are connected to the, to the internet versus people.

187
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,203
So we have an internet.

188
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:30,133
We have a worldwide web, which connects people, Internet of Things, connects the stuff that were working with, and part of the challenges with doing is these are usually traditionally.

189
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:34,195
they've been very traditionally ten years.

190
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:39,458
very simple low-end computers, and I had a connected thermostat(恒温器).

191
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:58,720
I found out when I was writing software to control the house to energy management in the house that if you asked what temperature was more than a few times a minute, you deplete the capacitor that was used to power it, and it would just give you garbage information back.

192
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,410
So these are dead, very, very simple devices.

193
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:11,120
And as such, don't have very much protection building to them, so they have to be protected, the networks that they are on have to protect them.

194
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:17,270
They have to be set in a way that is useful, but not in a way that can be used.

195
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:35,711
So not as a way that somebody could go in caused my hot water heater to explode, or cause my furnace to shut down, or in industrial setting, cause a certain agreement to be put into a foot supply that shouldn't be.

196
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,464
There should be there in that volume.

197
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:44,470
So how do you protect these devices that starts to become a really interesting thing ?

198
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:54,260
Interesting question, and it's also not just preventing them from doing something malicious, but they also can be used as a launch point for another attack.

199
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:18,990
So .... if my thermostat not jury brought thermostat, but somebody can connect to it, and then once they are connected to the thermostat that get to all the other devices in my house, that becomes a real issue, because everything on the inside normally one thinks, oh, I'll trust that a little bit more than something on the outside, but that may not necessarily be the case.

200
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,040
You can have an insider attack from an internet things device.

201
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:30,640
So what concept attempts to do is let you use my house as an example hundred plus.

202
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:42,120
All of them, slightly different, all of them, a little eye ball and a number of rounders, a number of modems to connect all these things up.

203
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,890
How can you configure them in such a way that they will be secure, but they will still work.

204
00:24:50,610 --> 00:25:00,610
And so what concept does is it goes from a human riddle, human britain set of documents that specify how you want to do security.

205
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:10,600
For instance, if you come to my house, the rule would be, that would be written down, would be your allowed on the gas network.

206
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:19,968
But I'm allowed on the internal network to make sure that all the access points around the house are configured correctly to do that.

207
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:22,057
So concept these documents.

208
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:32,959
It'll look at the diagrams, look at the drawings of the network and digest them and figure out all these are what the security requirements are.

209
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:41,760
Then it'll go a step further, and it'll read the manuals, and this is something I know very few people ever do.

210
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,490
The manual is always something that comes.

211
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,670
You look at it.

212
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,620
Ah.. This is recycleable, and it's gone.

213
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:58,360
It concept, what, sit down and read the manuals, figure out what the configurations are, based on what the requirements were.

214
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,740
And then it will put play them directly to the.

215
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,135
To the device.

216
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,005
Okay, just let me stop you for a minute.

217
00:26:06,005 --> 00:26:11,150
And so when you say the concept will read the menu, so it is interesting information.

218
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:19,597
I presume these are probably identifies that I would like to do some electronic form of of the kind of paper manuals that I have a huge folder of.

219
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:25,160
And you're right, I didn't read them, but is that how exactly, it just needs to read the PDF, read the PDF.

220
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,137
Read the pdas, and it can read images in the PDF.

221
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:40,670
So if you can get something scanned in, and it's eligible, and it's in English, it will make an attempt to read it.

222
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:49,440
It doesn't always get it right, and because of that, it will also explain why it can figure something the way it has.

223
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,950
So you get a human-readable document that comes out.

224
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:59,050
I set up a gas network, because guests need to be on the gasoline at work.

225
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,233
So I, Ican read this.

226
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:01,849
It's not.

227
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:02,774
It is not.

228
00:27:02,774 --> 00:27:04,623
It is not hemingway.

229
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:17,290
It is very much computer generated text, but it is completely reasonable and understandable, and explains why the system elected to configure in the way that it did.

230
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,400
It is really, really cool.

231
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:30,606
And given that french students today, a variety engine is a connected piece of the internet, its its performance is being monitored.

232
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:34,120
It's part of the positive train control system.

233
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,850
It is out there getting it.

234
00:27:36,950 --> 00:28:00,470
Configure properly is, is a real challenge and are providing tools to athens is a um same thing you for the navy, a modern naval vessel has thousands of computers on it would be really nice if they were configured in a way, according to guidance that also made them useful.

235
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:18,030
And the final stabbed concept is when the ship comes back, it can be read, and we can see why the changes occurred, and those can then either be undone or controlled into best practice and incorporated into the next round.

236
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,480
So that's.

237
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:39,360
Concept in natural, right, and due excellent vision, some of the tools and protocols and practices coming out of concept to be available, said to a whole manner, in addition, because you are, as you are speaking, it became clear to me that you are internet of things in a military setting.

238
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:57,950
Clearly, there are security concerns there and then, and so consequently, aboriginal there, but the threat space, the vulnerability space is really everywhere, because we can have a railroad system attacked through the internet of things, portals, for example, that that becomes the securities, but as well.

239
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:20,610
Well, for me, the most exciting trend coming out of concept is one of the performers, and I won't steal their press release under, but they are looking at two product roles for one, which would do automatic configuration of docker containers for virtual machines and moving virtual machines.

240
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:39,136
And the second is to do automatic configuration of the windows registry, and they're seeing of a strong market and providing this to small and medium sized enterprises as a as a commercial lawfully.

241
00:29:39,136 --> 00:30:04,300
So the answer is, if, if you look, you'll probably see this technology available in a shrink wrapped or download of forms in a year or so, and it should make an difference in and how we can do security and buy small and medium enterprise that also include households that have several hundred internet things.

242
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:15,680
Quartering that that, and you did you see the example of a inner neighborhood just before, so I on its way, or maybe already has made some transitions into the services.

243
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:27,900
We're in some clouds right now to understand behavior and to understand reliability, because we don't wanted to play something and then have it blown up.

244
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,140
But we are, we're actually an exercise as we speak.

245
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:41,580
To see how this overall, okay, i'm sure you are excited to see you the results of those and learn lessons from those that you can take the programme.

246
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,697
I don't know it for a learning.

247
00:30:43,697 --> 00:30:46,830
I don't know how much more time is available for the program.

248
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,942
At this point, we have about six months to six month we have been considered.

249
00:30:50,942 --> 00:30:51,334
And air.

250
00:30:51,334 --> 00:31:07,931
Sounds like if you got some real transitions that you'll be, which they say, that's kind of the trophy for programs is when the technology comes out in action to get sort of views operationally or with its points, companies or something of that kind of those are all kind of positive results.

251
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:13,505
Actually, an appointment, though, even even failures for doubt, our lessons and we learn from.

252
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:18,030
So uh, you know, successes and negatively is always good.

253
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:26,270
And and I just like to comment, there was a system called bomber ring that was a shoulder detection system.

254
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,440
My former employer had developed you and had developed.

255
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:36,890
It went to be shellfire because it wasn't a need after it was initially developed.

256
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:47,180
They're suddenly became a great need for it, and it was able to be filled within ninety days because the technology had been ahead of time.

257
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,260
Then when the time came, it was able to be brought out and run.

258
00:31:51,340 --> 00:32:01,800
There are european, european great example, you know, just about how context is all important as to whether or technology makes sense or not at a so fascinating to share that.

259
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,180
thanks.

260
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,690
So now let's talk about one more program, though.

261
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,420
I guess this is sort of still in the innovation phase, in the sense that is just been approved.

262
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,190
You have been received proposals from performers, which is to say the research results will in my work on this.

263
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:44,312
You call this one learning, interested in control project or a link for short from the little, I know about a sense of director developed a kind of machine learning account of our official intelligence that will enable military assets, whether it was a ground vehicle weapons system to effectively self discover relevant capabilities it might actually have in the context in which it is placed, even though the original designers and might not afford of that.

264
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:46,974
Initially, I don't know from getting that right.

265
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:53,320
So I wanted to correct me farming, and this gave me a sense of what you hope to ultimately deliver with this program.

266
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,760
It's actually a little bit broader, in some senses.

267
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:21,470
It, because it's looking beyond just systems, because there are all for a lot of commercial systems that are needed by the us military, but also infrastructure resilience, operational resilience and ugly addressing climate change are incredibly important issues that were trying to prevent strategic.

268
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,720
God coming to the coming to the documentation right there.

269
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:33,369
And the idea behind link is systems live a long time, and they're living longer and longer and longer.

270
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:39,790
If you look at military vehicles, they have lifespans of thirty to fifty years.

271
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,770
Some of the aircraft will have lives of hundred years.

272
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,910
You look at private vehicles.

273
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:56,090
There are on the road much longer than they have been, and it's because they are good, usable systems through that period.

274
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:02,362
If one hazard system and lets lets the dream take a pickup truck is an example.

275
00:34:02,362 --> 00:34:03,779
Take a pick up truck.

276
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:17,190
You put a tunnel and fifty gallon water tank on the back of it and errors not going to do too great with that water can be filled, the water tank paying empty oats can be fine with the water tank half full.

277
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,000
It's unbelievably dangerous.

278
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,370
[.....]

279
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,910
Thank you for writing。

280
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,219
Exactly exactly.

281
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:34,676
And so the idea is a modern pickup truck has a platform sensors in a several hundred of them.

282
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:41,110
It also has a collection of relatively powerful computer sitting in slideshow.

283
00:34:41,580 --> 00:35:05,560
And so the idea is the system is designed, and it's exclusively designed before leaves the factory to encounter the circumstances that are limited in the users handbook, and unlike network configuration manuals, I know everyone reads there, ultimately, a HAMburger and nervously did cover to cover.

284
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,540
Where is the fuse ?

285
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,570
That's the first time somebody will open it.

286
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,750
Or where is the tire jack ?

287
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:17,150
So the idea is cars are modified trucks and modify the laws are different.

288
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:27,990
Everything is different over the life of the car or over the life of the truck and the ideas to have the control system adapt in correct itself to keep, to keep on going.

289
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,730
And there is a great deal.

290
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,850
Skepticism is to how this actually could work.

291
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:44,865
But there's, i'll tell you a story of an existence proof that stunned me when I thought there are some researchers who are an imperial college london.

292
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:48,480
And again, this is the beauty of being a DARPA PM.

293
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:58,380
You can call them up and say, hi, can I talk to you, and they will help me talk to, and they were doing some work with hacks upon robots where they would break a leg.

294
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,380
They did naturally break.

295
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,020
It takes turn off the power to it.

296
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:19,010
And with these old hacks apart, they would sit there and kind of wrapped around for a minute or two, and suddenly they be up and hoping along on just a couple of lakes and be almost as movable as they were before him.

297
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:30,160
because they, 我想看小猪佩奇第一季的综艺节目有什么好看的电视剧，有什么好看的电视剧吗？

298
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,180
我想要一个美人鱼公主裙子。

299
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:40,663
And that small child is taking a backpack to school, and they want to take everything they have in the backpack.

300
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:46,510
They put it on, and they'll stagger(蹒跚) around the little bit in front, and then they will get their footing.

301
00:36:46,900 --> 00:37:11,920
And there're the races, that's what we're trying to get machines to do is to do that same, learning that that small child does when they take on the noon and heavy load and have them be able to make newer, safely, efficiently in a useful way, just by using what they have internally not having to go to a big cloud server, not to have to have some engineer.

302
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:19,060
We do the design, but rather have them customized how they react to something and handle off.

303
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:24,327
So that's the idea behind the real benefit that i'm seeing behind.

304
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:30,814
That is by allowing systems to operate much longer, the energy requirements to manufacturers.

305
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,310
These systems goes down dramatically.

306
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,020
And so that's what i'm saying.

307
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,990
One of the big benefits of.

308
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:43,485
Oh, maybe one of the million solutions we need for mitigating climate change, and it is effective.

309
00:37:43,670 --> 00:38:03,156
There's also a little thing that I see you with this program and configuration security, in the sense that it seems like you like you are out to help the anonymity world and the, the world of things, world of technologies, whether we're talking about vehicles, but also all like china technology census, the IOT technology.

310
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:08,740
You want them to be able to learn about themselves and make themselves better, more given.

311
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:15,660
Exactly right, and a big part of this also comes from growing and reading the golden age of science fiction.

312
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:34,140
Highline of the camp campbell as a clark, where there was an internal hopelessness that technology could be bent to do good.

313
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:40,285
And that's really what IIstill am trying to do that.

314
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:48,030
And if I can have IOT systems internalize doing good stuff, I, Ithink it would just be.

315
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,320
Better place, right ?

316
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,020
Well, J-F.

317
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,920
I want you to succeed at that.

318
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,750
[..]And this is a sexy, cool secretary.

319
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,820
To another question I have.

320
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:02,040
And this is just coming from the forty summer patent titles of that was some really interesting reading.

321
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:08,400
So we can talk about all those, obviously, but, but one is certainly just reflect that you can help yourself.

322
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,010
You are an inventor of you been doing in all kinds of ways.

323
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,180
Now you do with your dog.

324
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:18,400
Are there any of those patents that just really stand out for you either, because they were most rewarding.

325
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,680
You think the technology, we're a good idea that there would be.

326
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,490
It would do the most good as we are just talking about yet, or just been doing.

327
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,660
It fascinates you for some reason.

328
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,928
Too, that just made me happy when they, when they were all metrics.

329
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:36,428
So go with those aren't so and DARPA is all about metrics.

330
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:52,350
So the, the first one originally had a working title of tooth and come on, or two towns, and um at the time I was involved with the technology board for the natural federation of the blind.

331
00:39:52,840 --> 00:40:05,240
And there was a real question of how electric vehicles, the tournaments vehicles to affect the blind as they navigate throughout a city.

332
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,440
In some respect, economic vehicles would be marvelous.

333
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:20,034
The black and white, that is just a wonderful thing, but the other side of it is that it was concerned that electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles would sneak up on people.

334
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:23,506
They wouldn't hear them, and they would cause accidents.

335
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:28,607
And I noticed this myself, I was driving a hybrid hybrid in the parking lot.

336
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:33,670
And if you have a car with engine running, people will just transplant walk to the side.

337
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,740
But with the hybrid, they will just keep walking in the center.

338
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,280
And you don't want to blow your heart.

339
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,210
You don't want to be the guy who blows his orange of pedestrian.

340
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,430
And I think it was not right.

341
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,430
And so what I was thinking was, why not a gentle cough.

342
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:46,950
You know, something.

343
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,080
We're somebody, you know.

344
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,300
Excuse me, you know, so they know your're here.

345
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,240
And then I thought, well, why not ?

346
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,280
This was at the time of downloadable ringtones.

347
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,570
I thought why not have tones that you can download.

348
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,980
And I went ahead and worked up the system.

349
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:18,380
The patent was filed, and I very pleased to say that many states now require supplemental alert tones exactly to protect those who are sighting paired.

350
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,000
And you're also around the globe.

351
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,260
And because of that, that patents actually found real.

352
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,270
So that one, that one was a fun one.

353
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,439
Sounds like a good technology to get out there.

354
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,872
Alright, well, I will have you here for more time than probably you thought you're gonna

355
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:33,332
the time you probably thought you gonna be sitting down here with me.

356
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:34,415
So I just want to ask you, is there a question that didn't come up.

357
00:41:34,415 --> 00:41:38,060
There's anything that didn't come up to you think, would be ... for listeners.

358
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:46,260
What is the thing that worries me the most when I'm here is that we have a clock that is running

359
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,570
every DARPA program manager has a date on their badge(徽章)

360
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:58,843
And that is our final day here, and we feel an incredible urgency to get things done before that date

361
00:41:58,843 --> 00:42:02,972
and Covid, really make me feel more.

362
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:05,230
'cause I didn't want to lose time.

363
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:12,430
That is actually one of the most interesting institutional characteristics of DARPA to me.

364
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,410
And it is that you come in here.

365
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:19,884
We all do right with that cell by date, as a, you hear the open over again, how that does turn up that dialogue, urgency

366
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:27,620
and is thought to be one of the reasons why DARPA has such a track record of producing so much. so interesting to bring that up.

367
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,565
we're out of time.

368
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:35,390
May you and your research performers, those who let us to say, the researchers were working on your programs.

369
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,170
May you all succeed and maybe learn much from that work.

370
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,070
Thanks for being with me, my pleasure and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us.

371
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,835
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from DARPA

372
00:42:49,835 --> 00:42:53,310
thanks also to TOM shortage for his partnership in producing this program.
