EDL	00:00:11,760	00:00:16,150	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Stuff technology, the internet, GPS in the palm of your hand. 
EDL	00:00:16,150	00:00:17,420	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Autonomous operation. 
EDL	00:00:19,870	00:00:40,280	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, DARPA, the defense advanced research projects agency, has been a driver of welcome to Voices from DARPA, a window onto dark as core a program managers their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:41,010	00:00:47,328	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	My name is ivan, a matter when I am your dark host, and today I am pleased to have with me in the studio
EDL	00:00:47,328	00:00:55,170	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Lin horse, a program manager since twenty twelve in darkness, strategic technology offers with a background and physics
EDL	00:00:55,170	00:00:56,640	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Lin spends a lot of this time
EDL	00:00:56,640	00:01:05,756	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I doubt thinking about a world without the global position system, a system which is all about physics, engineering and the management of complex systems
EDL	00:01:05,756	00:01:22,094	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And he thinks about bringing GPS functions under sea into other places where GPS signals cannot reach, in short, wednesday become one of the agencies go to guys in a technical area known as PNT, which stands for positioning, navigation
EDL	00:01:22,094	00:01:25,639	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And thank you for your spending some time with me today
EDL	00:01:25,639	00:01:27,613	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Well, thank you for inviting me
EDL	00:01:27,613	00:01:36,503	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So before we talk about some of your efforts to develop plan b for when GPS might not be available or to create a and underestimate version of GPS
EDL	00:01:36,503	00:01:37,751	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I just interested you
EDL	00:01:37,751	00:01:45,243	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I want to find a little bit about you, your background, and maybe something about how that background explains how you ended up
EDL	00:01:45,243	00:01:45,690	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Your read
EDL	00:01:45,690	00:01:46,630	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Start in twenty twelve
EDL	00:01:46,630	00:01:49,560	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Well, when I was growing up, I never. 
EDL	00:01:49,930	00:01:53,070	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Thought about when I grow up, I won't be a navigation engineer
EDL	00:01:53,590	00:01:57,560	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That was not something that was at the front of my mind
EDL	00:01:57,980	00:02:14,435	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	However, when I came out of grade school, my first job was a navigation flight controller for special operations, and I fell in love with the art and science of navigation, and it's been a common threat of my career ever said. 
EDL	00:02:14,435	00:02:19,580	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	What are an exciting entry, I mean to be working on the special program to say little bit more about that. 
EDL	00:02:19,580	00:02:34,870	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	But I was working on the space shuttle program that was we had GPS and saw the navigation system of the, the space shuttle used a variety of sensors to determine a vehicle was in space
EDL	00:02:35,300	00:02:48,650	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So we are, the navigation system was primarily critical on the introduction of the mission that is when it returns from space to the learning field, but also accent and or on. 
EDL	00:02:48,650	00:02:50,990	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	One word with operations, you can
EDL	00:02:50,990	00:02:52,540	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And what did you study in great school? 
EDL	00:02:52,540	00:03:02,660	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Physics and then I, Iquickly learn that theoretical physics was not my forty, but I still love physics
EDL	00:03:02,660	00:03:05,690	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So I, my graduate degree was an engineering. 
EDL	00:03:05,690	00:03:10,770	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Physics and is one of the things about your biography and sensor and interested in
EDL	00:03:10,770	00:03:14,450	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	This is your name, because I believe full first name is franklin
EDL	00:03:14,450	00:03:25,100	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Cool, you go by lin, the second ceiling bowl for short, when most people who have the name franklin and shortage will go with the first of all, frank, so what's up? 
EDL	00:03:25,100	00:03:27,160	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I think that my mother has a sense of humor
EDL	00:03:27,160	00:03:32,010	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I am a junior, and she did not want to, frankly running around the house
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,100	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So my father goes by frank. 
EDL	00:03:35,100	00:03:45,070	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	My girlfriend is so that indicates to me that there was a big dose of pregnancy in your home, and practice spilled over into where you work
EDL	00:03:45,070	00:03:48,511	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So let, let us know, talk about some of your programs
EDL	00:03:48,511	00:04:16,969	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I think we'll start with the adaptable and navigation systems programme, as do all programs that double this one goes by the acronym, in this case, ANSwhat intrigues me about this one, but I want you to say more about it is that you are trying to tap into a huge diversity of signals here, things like signals and cell towers or TV signals that are already out there candidates in constructed environment, but also other kinds of signals in the natural environment
EDL	00:04:16,969	00:04:20,472	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The one that just really stands out for me is lightning
EDL	00:04:20,472	00:04:28,620	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So let me stop there, just as you to tell me and listeners a little bit about the adaptability of navigation systems program. 
EDL	00:04:29,550	00:04:35,640	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, ANSis actually a portfolio of multiple programs
EDL	00:04:36,490	00:04:47,420	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	One of those programs under NShas called aspen ASPN, which is short for all sorts, positioning, navigation, and it addresses the topic you, you are reference to
EDL	00:04:47,420	00:04:58,310	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We like to think of it as developing a navigation, architecture and algorithm that can process what we call sensors of opportunity
EDL	00:04:58,310	00:05:04,341	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That is any sensor that has special or temporary information
EDL	00:05:04,341	00:05:23,014	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So consider an aircraft, primarily aircraft today use GPS are, and a either stand alone mode, or they will integrate a GPS receiver with what's called an initial measurement unit as basically a dead reckoning device has sensors in effort
EDL	00:05:23,014	00:05:26,865	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That sense, accelerations and will sense rotational rates
EDL	00:05:26,865	00:05:28,851	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And from that you can debt reckon
EDL	00:05:28,851	00:05:36,550	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the two GPS in an initial measurement unit combined for my very robust solution, but GPS sometime just not
EDL	00:05:36,940	00:05:41,380	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And then that system will rely primarily on the IMU. 
EDL	00:05:41,380	00:05:42,984	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And then let me just stop you there
EDL	00:05:42,984	00:05:46,550	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	What are the situations under which serve GPS might become unavailable? 
EDL	00:05:46,550	00:06:04,418	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	For ground users, GPS can become unavailable when you are in what we call urban canyons that is dense, ordinary skyscrapers constantly, you think of downtown chicago or downtown manhattan were the buildings are obstructing the signals, especially
EDL	00:06:04,418	00:06:08,837	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And this is on the context of maintaining very accurate navigation
EDL	00:06:08,837	00:06:13,566	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The aircraft is specially military aircraft when they roll over, turn upside down
EDL	00:06:13,566	00:06:21,367	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Now, the GPS santa has pointed to the ground signals are coming from the ground in case, or rely on the initial measurement unit to debt
EDL	00:06:21,367	00:06:25,370	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Reckon until the GPS reservoirs is exposed
EDL	00:06:25,370	00:06:34,740	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And because the GPS signal is so weak by design that it is very easy to interfere with a receivers of. 
EDL	00:06:34,740	00:06:35,800	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That's signal, okay
EDL	00:06:35,800	00:06:37,780	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So I should actually concept up the problem for us
EDL	00:06:37,780	00:06:44,960	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And let me get you back to what you're talking about, which is to use some senses of opportunity out there to make up for the school. 
EDL	00:06:44,960	00:06:56,640	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So what we recognized was that many platforms we have have centres owned them that are providing special information, but there are not being used by the navigation system
EDL	00:06:56,950	00:07:11,450	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the question we asked ourselves, let me come up with an algorithm and an architecture that can be rapidly reconfigured to use sensors that are already on board are platforms to navigate
EDL	00:07:12,047	00:07:21,770	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	When GPS is not available, or just as importantly, to provide redundancy and hence additional integrity to the GPS themselves. 
EDL	00:07:21,770	00:07:25,330	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, it's worth for a couple of examples of the kinds of sensing. 
EDL	00:07:25,330	00:07:30,710	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, so one, one that we have used very successfully
EDL	00:07:31,070	00:07:40,627	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	This injury, okay, consider aircraft with a camera looking at the ground with the advantage of satellite imagery
EDL	00:07:40,627	00:07:47,860	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Think of google earth, all all those pixels and image had have an associated ladder to the launch
EDL	00:07:48,260	00:08:03,120	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And if we can correlate the image that is being observed by the camera on the airplane with that satellite that will be called geo registered satellite were able to determine whether aircraft is that's part of the problem
EDL	00:08:03,120	00:08:04,140	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The other part of the promise
EDL	00:08:04,140	00:08:11,010	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Now, how do I get them to my navigation system such that I can continue and navigate with that, and that's what uh the. 
EDL	00:08:11,570	00:08:21,946	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Progress, that's where that you need that initial measurement unit and a sense of timing, combined with that imagery on the ground, you can then start to keep track of where you are now
EDL	00:08:21,946	00:08:24,400	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And where are you going on, software, interesting here. 
EDL	00:08:24,400	00:08:43,830	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	But in for ground users, for example, we are being bombarded with radio frequency signals where we're sitting right now, but we're not using them from navigation, but they have special information in them, whether they be TV circumstances, radio signals, or if we were outside receiving many signals from satellites
EDL	00:08:43,830	00:08:46,898	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And so we call those signals of opportunity
EDL	00:08:46,898	00:08:52,300	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And we've shown that you can navigate very well with those signals, as well as well. 
EDL	00:08:52,300	00:08:56,470	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So just drilling a little bit, and one of those signals of opportunity, white things
EDL	00:08:56,470	00:08:57,680	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So how, how does that finish? 
EDL	00:08:58,180	00:09:09,760	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That was a very fun signal for us when lightning strikes, it essentially lights up the entire electoral magnetic spectrum from DCto daylight and beyond
EDL	00:09:09,760	00:09:25,100	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Researchers have shown that they're even extraordinary potential event gamely is coming out of a lightning strike christmas for a very short period of time, were talking one to several million seconds of duration in time
EDL	00:09:26,120	00:09:35,530	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So huge positive energy that is in the spectrum that we call the very low frequency band, the elephant, which is the oil
EDL	00:09:36,010	00:09:38,540	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The ten killer hurts region tender
EDL	00:09:38,540	00:09:45,560	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Tony killers in general, that portion of the energy can travel around the world. 
EDL	00:09:46,380	00:09:52,320	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	It is almost like a wave guide right at between the earth and the ironic sphere, and those signals that tolerate. 
EDL	00:09:52,320	00:09:56,800	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That is correct in the reason that's the wave guide is because it ten killer hurts
EDL	00:09:57,420	00:10:00,627	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Your wave is now, oh columns
EDL	00:10:00,627	00:10:22,500	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, ten, twelve, fifteen kilometers are depending on what exactly exact frequency is, because there is only a few wave links between the yours and the bottom of the ionosphere, which is depending on the time of the around eighty coal, and you get a wave god effect, which has very low signal technologies, so the signal can be received at very high signal strength
EDL	00:10:22,810	00:10:27,830	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And so the question of us, can we navigate with us
EDL	00:10:27,830	00:10:37,510	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So we went outside and put a violent receiver on the street, or even in in the building, you would be picking up the tens of signals
EDL	00:10:37,510	00:10:43,810	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Prosecutor, the violent portion of a lightning strike is holiday spirit short for an atmosphere
EDL	00:10:43,810	00:10:46,850	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That's a fairly old term, but that's what we call it
EDL	00:10:46,850	00:10:51,220	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	You would be receiving dozens of physics per second. 
EDL	00:10:51,640	00:10:55,130	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Answer the questions, can you navigate with those
EDL	00:10:55,130	00:10:58,350	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	This is amazing to think about navigating by lightning strikes
EDL	00:10:58,350	00:11:00,030	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	You have to know where those lightning strikes are in. 
EDL	00:11:00,030	00:11:03,070	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	For this tool tool correct, that is absolutely correct
EDL	00:11:03,070	00:11:21,830	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And that is, in my opinion, one of the hardest parts of a lightning navigation system to detect those, we use a network of what we called monitoring stations or references located around the world that would geology
EDL	00:11:21,830	00:11:23,880	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Those lightning strikes, yes. 
EDL	00:11:23,880	00:11:25,148	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Right, and we've all seen
EDL	00:11:25,148	00:11:28,955	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	These are on whether reports were also shown in the lightning strikes from these. 
EDL	00:11:28,955	00:11:33,216	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Many of the many universities have lightning detection networks in place
EDL	00:11:33,216	00:11:37,140	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	There are commercial products for getting that information as well. 
EDL	00:11:37,660	00:11:39,460	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	No, I have applied fascinating
EDL	00:11:39,460	00:11:43,190	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So let's say the way okay to another program you are working on which was related to this one
EDL	00:11:43,620	00:11:47,430	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	This one is no, mercifully, in short form
EDL	00:11:47,820	00:11:59,070	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	STOIC, but directly short for the long form, a name of the program, which is a special temporal and orientation information in contested environments
EDL	00:11:59,070	00:12:04,700	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	But let's go with because it sees you to say, and this two is a deliverable of a backup GPS of sorts
EDL	00:12:04,700	00:12:10,817	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And it involves a number of interesting sounding components that I hope we can talk about briefly to that
EDL	00:12:10,817	00:12:18,260	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I mentioned our very low frequency signals, which we actually did touch upon already when we were talking about lightning
EDL	00:12:18,260	00:12:32,169	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	But another component here is the development of optical clocks, which rely on a quantum mechanical behaviors, and adams to keep a super accurate time and making the clocks are always a part of of these kinds of navigation systems
EDL	00:12:32,169	00:12:42,090	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We can go deeply into the weeds on these things, but let's, let's try to talk about a little bit, gives a flavor of what stocks about and what technologies you are hoping develop to make. 
EDL	00:12:42,090	00:12:44,290	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, let's talk about the the real life component
EDL	00:12:44,290	00:12:52,730	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	First, it's interesting to note that the first global positioning system was not called GPS. 
EDL	00:12:53,450	00:12:54,620	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	It was called omega
EDL	00:12:55,460	00:13:10,730	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	It operated back in the from the early seventies through the early ninth, and it was a real life broadcast system and provide a global coverage with only eight transmits located around the world
EDL	00:13:10,730	00:13:13,310	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	However, it was not accurate
EDL	00:13:13,310	00:13:24,155	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That system generally provided one tourist column levels of positioning accuracy, where, as GPS is generally below five meters
EDL	00:13:24,155	00:13:31,268	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the automatic system is clearly not accurate for what we now depend on today from GPS. 
EDL	00:13:31,268	00:13:49,160	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the primary challenge we have in stroke for the violent component ears, developing new models that can accurately replicate how that we all have signal, propagate from a transmit to receive
EDL	00:13:49,670	00:13:53,580	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Can I suggest that we can get our accuracies to? 
EDL	00:13:53,580	00:14:02,270	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Levels and and why the video left a very low, very exciting component of the full spectrum, many, many choices of frequency band steels. 
EDL	00:14:02,270	00:14:15,082	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So you mentioned the wave guide effect, and we talked about the fact that the wave got a fact has significantly less signal attenuation such that the signal can be received at longer distances
EDL	00:14:15,082	00:14:21,765	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So in the context of providing aim backup system to GPS that has global range
EDL	00:14:21,765	00:14:29,220	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Clearly, we don't want to put a position begin, if you will, every few miles around the earth
EDL	00:14:29,530	00:14:42,780	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the ability to provide a positioning system with only a few, let's say, less than ten video of transmitters is very appealing, especially when the signals can be received at very high levels of. 
EDL	00:14:42,780	00:14:49,050	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Right in this, thursday's pragmatic and cost issues that I believe we all have transmits often. 
EDL	00:14:49,050	00:14:59,389	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So they are not only are they very big, but they're also very old is, in general, they're using nineteen, fifty, ninety, sixty technology
EDL	00:14:59,389	00:15:05,170	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And so oh, using new technology, we are looking at ways of making them much smaller. 
EDL	00:15:05,170	00:15:07,420	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	More football and more portable
EDL	00:15:07,420	00:15:13,273	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, and then let's talk about the clock aspect during this case, obstacle clocks
EDL	00:15:13,273	00:15:16,335	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And before you actually talk about this specific
EDL	00:15:16,335	00:15:30,960	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So a quantum mechanical based collective technology, the europe, and here, just for those who do not talk a little bit about the role that accurate clocks play in systems like GPS, another geolocation and navigation systems. 
EDL	00:15:31,410	00:15:51,320	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So there is a common phrase used in the navigation community, which is time as position and position, is time that data is all the way back to the sixteen hundreds of not sooner the maritime days when we navigated, offered the SUN when you left the
EDL	00:15:51,660	00:16:02,810	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Whether we have to say, when you left the portrait london, you would such a clock at noon, and then add sailed across the atlantic ocean
EDL	00:16:03,110	00:16:14,650	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	You determine how many degrees launched to you had travelled by looking at the time on your watch, on at the point at which the song was directly overhead
EDL	00:16:14,650	00:16:26,160	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	In that way, you could quarrel the number of the hours off of new york said, when you like your watch, but your coroner, in this case, versus noon at the at london, where you. 
EDL	00:16:26,160	00:16:27,487	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	From there, get your degrees
EDL	00:16:27,487	00:16:35,071	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the more accurate you'll flag, the more competition you could be of your position and determination, and the rest accurate, more, more than all days
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:35,830	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	It was very true. 
EDL	00:16:35,830	00:16:39,938	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Position position is time with GPS, the same as also choose
EDL	00:16:39,938	00:16:44,561	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the key to GPS is indeed the clocks you're getting arranging
EDL	00:16:44,561	00:16:53,445	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So in love for the GPS satellite, can you receive determines you don't measure distance what you are actually measuring is time
EDL	00:16:53,445	00:16:58,472	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	How long did it take that signal to travel from the satellite to receiver
EDL	00:16:58,472	00:17:16,700	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the satellite tells this signal left my eye, and tonight, at time, one, you look at a receiver clock when that singer was received at two and time to manage time, one is the time of travel, time of travel times
EDL	00:17:16,700	00:17:19,680	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The speed of light gives distance of transactions
EDL	00:17:19,680	00:17:22,790	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The key that is where the range comes from, but it all goes back to the clock. 
EDL	00:17:22,790	00:17:27,340	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Let's speed of light, which we know in this concept, that sort of a kid here, right, all right
EDL	00:17:27,880	00:17:30,970	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Without that, you would be able to just from a measurement. 
EDL	00:17:30,970	00:17:35,199	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	No, with the range was that that is correct, and there are a lot of other things
EDL	00:17:35,199	00:17:36,575	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Your GPS receiver has been. 
EDL	00:17:36,575	00:17:43,540	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	To do as well, but that primarily drilling to it is remarkably complex and sort of every level by an image or cute
EDL	00:17:43,540	00:17:45,130	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	You can imagine applying to it
EDL	00:17:46,080	00:17:49,240	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So let's move now to a third program is with the last one
EDL	00:17:49,240	00:17:50,210	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I think we talk about
EDL	00:17:50,210	00:17:56,876	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	This one is known as president, and that stands for positioning system for deep ocean navigation
EDL	00:17:56,876	00:18:00,070	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So sounds like you're going for an underwater. 
EDL	00:18:00,070	00:18:06,140	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	A GPS system, yes, the bottom line, GPS does not work under water
EDL	00:18:06,140	00:18:16,680	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Actually, you can receive it very shallow depth in people have shown that, but that's not relevant to where we actually operate
EDL	00:18:16,680	00:18:21,140	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We want, we want to be able to navigate at much deeper levels
EDL	00:18:21,140	00:18:27,260	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Personnel about bringing a GPS like positioning capability. 
EDL	00:18:27,260	00:18:28,550	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Submerge users
EDL	00:18:29,190	00:18:44,750	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So when I think about the emerged users, I don't think about radio operation there, though I know there are some other real, interesting work in trying to bring radio with with violence and ultra low frequencies are down into into a underworld operation
EDL	00:18:44,750	00:18:48,227	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	But I hope I think of immediate, believe acoustic types of signals
EDL	00:18:48,227	00:18:51,080	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So I presume that that's part of what you are correct. 
EDL	00:18:51,080	00:19:07,160	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Climate research community has been using low frequency acoustic signals for several decades now to monitor the temperature of the ocean as a functional time in and by using low frequency signals
EDL	00:19:07,160	00:19:22,620	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	If, you know, again, the knowledge of justice, value of the time is key here, if you know, when the signal lefty transmitter and compared that to the time you received it at another location, you can get the time of flight of that signal
EDL	00:19:22,620	00:19:25,428	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Now, for underwater is so important for GPS
EDL	00:19:25,428	00:19:28,236	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The speed of lighters is, is constant
EDL	00:19:28,236	00:19:43,460	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That's not quite the case for under water, the speed of the sound of the underwater is a function of many things are primarily temperature, but also a depth and solidarity and some other terms as well
EDL	00:19:43,460	00:20:11,520	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So we have developed models that account for all that, in addition that the acoustic signals underwater don't travel in a single line between the transmitter and receiver, which radio frequencies typically occur signals, will take many pets on the way from the source to a receiver, because the signal is getting reflected due to temperature profiles uh in the ocean
EDL	00:20:11,520	00:20:22,810	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Pressure profile and things like that, when you hear in signal, low frequency signal at receiver that was admitted far away, you actually hear multiple instances of that is like an echo
EDL	00:20:23,150	00:20:25,810	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And there are four we call that multipass
EDL	00:20:25,810	00:20:28,820	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	There are multiple paths that is going to take. 
EDL	00:20:28,820	00:20:36,200	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So it sounds like with this multi path phenomenon going on that one of the big issues here is, is gonna
EDL	00:20:36,200	00:20:49,360	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Be had you been digging by all those signals coming in, and so that sounds like algorithms, that sounds like computational issues are just to make sense of what otherwise would be just my arrests of acoustic signals. 
EDL	00:20:49,360	00:21:10,790	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	You're correct, and that is exactly what we're focused on in the program initially is, can we improve current models, develop new models that can accurately account for all those pads that a signal take such that we can extract an accurate time of flight, and hence and accurate distance measurement
EDL	00:21:10,790	00:21:13,650	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Most we get the distance from that signal
EDL	00:21:13,650	00:21:17,580	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The navigation part is, is fairly easy, the hard part. 
EDL	00:21:17,580	00:21:26,808	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Is the signal measurement model, and just the GPS depends upon consultations of satellites and forgetting the number now
EDL	00:21:26,808	00:21:39,993	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	But as a couple of dozen, generally exact number as regular general is around thirty year, around thirty would perceive an undersea GPS system also rely on a consolidation of acoustic biggest distributed to the oceans
EDL	00:21:39,993	00:21:43,710	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Yes, falling out thirteen for a given area also in the ocean
EDL	00:21:43,710	00:22:02,750	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Is there a phenomenon like when we talked about for a very low frequency radio signals in the silver skirt in the air through the earth and the ironic spirit, that sort of long wave guide effect acoustic sounds can travel from many distances in the ocean, right, the wheat on taking care of how wealth communicate of great businesses. 
EDL	00:22:02,750	00:22:06,580	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That is cracking with, and that is the exact effect we're exploding
EDL	00:22:06,580	00:22:23,510	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	There is what is called a sound channel, the depth of a sound channel is in generally function of of temperature, but in general and depositions, it's about a columna deep and so low frequency acoustics will travel for very long distances
EDL	00:22:23,510	00:22:33,850	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	There is a seminar study in the nineties that showed a low frequency signals could be received in the sound channel, many thousands of kilometers
EDL	00:22:33,850	00:22:36,830	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I believe it was almost nine thousand kilometers. 
EDL	00:22:36,830	00:22:40,802	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Absolutely standing, and it also just brings another question to mind
EDL	00:22:40,802	00:22:52,140	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I don't know much about how these weekends working with their characteristics are other issues of concern for animals living in the ocean, where these signals will be will be a propaganda. 
EDL	00:22:52,140	00:23:02,790	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Absolutely, a key tenant of the program is we have to develop a system that complies with all the federal regular relations, protecting memory, memory, wife. 
EDL	00:23:02,790	00:23:13,080	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So when I take it, one of the things that drives you is the concern that we have become utterly dependent upon GPS, just the way we are utterly dependent on electrical grade
EDL	00:23:13,080	00:23:19,748	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We all know when electrical grid goes down that we become friends, given five minutes of power out
EDL	00:23:19,748	00:23:21,082	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We are going not
EDL	00:23:21,082	00:23:22,949	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So GPS has similar problem
EDL	00:23:22,949	00:23:23,780	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	rebellion
EDL	00:23:23,780	00:23:29,000	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Tell me about that aspect of how you think about technology and security. 
EDL	00:23:29,440	00:23:44,000	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Yeah, so there was a phrase that some people used to have fail, safe and fail operational and create your primary system fails, and is the failed to a safe models, or it fail first to, you are still operational
EDL	00:23:44,000	00:23:46,250	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And then if it fails again, you are still safe
EDL	00:23:46,680	00:23:51,840	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, so you have that built and redundancy so much in the paragraph one of the power goes down the building
EDL	00:23:51,840	00:23:55,780	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Come on, if you need to continue as well as a power in that building
EDL	00:23:55,780	00:23:59,760	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The same thing is, is happening in the navigation community
EDL	00:23:59,760	00:24:04,566	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The consider tonight's vehicles, which are on the horizon
EDL	00:24:04,566	00:24:16,221	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Clearly, they can't solely depend on GPS to tell the car where it is located, because some of the things we talk about, others, such as they're in urban canyon
EDL	00:24:16,221	00:24:18,346	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	The campaign of the GPS signal
EDL	00:24:18,346	00:24:39,160	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the artist, seeing more dependent on the other sensors for providing positioning information, whether the layer lazer raid are or or imagery, for example, or even the doubled sensors you have on the vehicle security scene, redundancy, starting to be built in two systems that are going to be dependent on navigation. 
EDL	00:24:39,160	00:24:39,918	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	In the future
EDL	00:24:39,918	00:24:55,320	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So when we think of the three programs that we've just talked about, and as so, I can decide, and I should point out that you just handed off the witch of this program to a colleague in the strategic technology offers, can you give us a sense of what the status of the victim is? 
EDL	00:24:55,320	00:24:57,560	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So analysts is ripping up
EDL	00:24:57,950	00:25:04,750	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Analysis is transitioning to the end users to the services are in various ways, and that's a good thing
EDL	00:25:05,210	00:25:12,050	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Storage is almost halfway through a three phase programs
EDL	00:25:12,050	00:25:23,440	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We're in faith to the store programs that we've demonstrated feasibility came up with an initial approach generated evidence to support that approach
EDL	00:25:23,440	00:25:31,660	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And in fact, we are now employment in that approach and doing higher federal data collection, but scientists just getting started
EDL	00:25:31,660	00:25:35,060	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We are in the middle of what we call. 
EDL	00:25:35,060	00:25:42,730	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	One of the sudden, just one more question for you, and that's what question do you really wish
EDL	00:25:43,460	00:25:45,850	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I would assume that I didn't
EDL	00:25:45,850	00:25:49,270	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And if such a question comes to mind, you can ask it. 
EDL	00:25:49,580	00:25:52,710	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Answer yourself, so you mention the article clerks. 
EDL	00:25:53,020	00:25:57,870	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Thanks for reminding me, I, Ishould push it as you like question earlier. 
EDL	00:25:57,870	00:26:01,320	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So enough to go clock, this is an atomic clock
EDL	00:26:01,320	00:26:12,230	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We have a thoma clocks today, such as a rebellion clock or a season being clocked both of the racism beam has been around since the fifteenth of the night. 
EDL	00:26:12,820	00:26:24,760	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Senior just one intermediate for a second, a simple way of thinking about these things when white atoms can be, clocks is because there are vibrations isolations associated with nuclear
EDL	00:26:24,760	00:26:29,587	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	But rather than that, the kinds of association do you think about it in our accountable fashion
EDL	00:26:29,587	00:26:37,560	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Clark, with a pendulum, I mean, some ways that was going on, but it's going on a billions and trillions, and of isolation is in what we consider duration of the second. 
EDL	00:26:38,140	00:26:46,220	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So in the atomic clocks of today, we are exploiting signals immediately by atoms in the microwave region
EDL	00:26:46,620	00:26:49,090	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Giga hurts level signals
EDL	00:26:49,400	00:26:54,810	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, google hurts is billion times per second
EDL	00:26:54,810	00:27:04,040	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	An optical clock is exploiting a time of energy level transition that have frequencies over four hundred
EDL	00:27:04,040	00:27:16,250	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Terror hurts another five waters of magnitude so that the clock at the ottawa clock takes five words of management faster than the atomic clocks of today
EDL	00:27:16,250	00:27:28,694	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And by virtue that that's more precise time, and we get much improved stability out of applicable clocks a day in general, are about the size of a small laboratory
EDL	00:27:28,694	00:27:31,241	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Universities had the optical clarks
EDL	00:27:31,241	00:27:53,500	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	At least the nationalism to for standards and technology has the world most table optical clock double in the past headache program that showed by making some trades in sized, weighing power and performance, you could reduce the size that optical clock down to the size of a shoe box from a laboratory sized down to a shoe box
EDL	00:27:53,500	00:27:57,120	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Yes, but that clock is still taking adult to call frequencies
EDL	00:27:57,480	00:28:06,616	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Another doctor program, should, you could make a very small and robust device colleagues, frequency come
EDL	00:28:06,616	00:28:19,410	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That acts like a set of years and transfers that very stable obstacle took in the four hundred terror hurts region down to all of frequencies, very frequently frequency
EDL	00:28:19,410	00:28:21,910	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Okay, then you can generate a timing
EDL	00:28:21,910	00:28:29,725	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Second, that is systems of the data, one post per second, ten mega hurts, referenced on one hundred meter hurt reference systems
EDL	00:28:29,725	00:28:49,260	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So the story project is integrating those separate technologies that develop into a single unit, such that I like to say, we want to pull out the season, being clock and plugging the stock obstacle clock, and your time stability has improved by, at least in order of one hundred and eighty
EDL	00:28:49,260	00:28:55,460	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So imagine by clock that they would keep GPS level time accuracy for over a year. 
EDL	00:28:55,460	00:29:01,780	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	With no GPS research, the best name, the thanks for giving us a favourite vote in africa
EDL	00:29:01,780	00:29:07,540	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	O'clock is, I know that its complexities go up the church, but I think it gave us a sense of what you have to do
EDL	00:29:07,540	00:29:08,340	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So, thanks a lot
EDL	00:29:08,810	00:29:14,010	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And then I started to understand that in another suggestion future, you're going to be
EDL	00:29:14,010	00:29:17,132	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	You've got him in twenty twelve, you'll be leaving this year
EDL	00:29:17,132	00:29:22,402	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	You've got this amazing sort of skill set in mind, said, particularly with the navigation technologies
EDL	00:29:22,402	00:29:28,620	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	We've been talking about a time, a clock, a lot of of abilities and skills in different areas
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:36,890	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Are you imagine that you're going to keep applying that particular set of interests in your post or professional life? 
EDL	00:29:37,940	00:29:45,579	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Absolutely, positioning and timing are built into so many systems we have today
EDL	00:29:45,579	00:29:48,636	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And it's because of the success of GPS
EDL	00:29:48,636	00:29:55,511	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Other nations are building their own satellite navigation systems as as well
EDL	00:29:55,511	00:29:57,745	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	And GPS is embarrassed
EDL	00:29:57,745	00:30:06,730	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	So many things, things you, you would even think about the eighteen young google cash from GPS is in there, but like trying to trading on the stock. 
EDL	00:30:06,730	00:30:09,031	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	GPS is, then I just occurred in that case
EDL	00:30:09,031	00:30:13,800	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	It's mostly the timing function like, as you need to know when those transactions have happened. 
EDL	00:30:13,800	00:30:22,704	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	Agricultural precision agriculture GPS is under power distribution to the electrical credit
EDL	00:30:22,704	00:30:24,940	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	GPS and GPS is provinces
EDL	00:30:24,940	00:30:49,090	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	I want to continue to enable systems today to provide that same level of positioning in timing with, with cafe villages that are redundant to GPS providing integrity, but also going beyond the level of positioning, attempting performance we get today with GPS such that we can enable new capabilities that we can even imagine today if we
EDL	00:30:49,090	00:30:51,690	| VfD E07 The Geolocator |	That much more accurate timing and position.
