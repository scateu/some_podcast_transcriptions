EDL	00:02:17,310	00:02:19,500	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	professional who embraces clinical and
EDL	00:02:19,500	00:02:21,810	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	field practice as well as leading-edge
EDL	00:02:21,810	00:02:24,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	research what are the origins of those
EDL	00:02:24,870	00:02:26,819	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	interests for you it started pretty

EDL	00:02:26,819	00:02:29,910	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	young I have this childhood memory of
EDL	00:02:29,910	00:02:32,190	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	being asked at my school a Catholic
EDL	00:02:32,190	00:02:33,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	school and that was meeting with one of
EDL	00:02:33,690	00:02:34,739	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the priests and they said well what do
EDL	00:02:34,739	00:02:36,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you really want to do and I said I
EDL	00:02:36,690	00:02:38,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	wanted to be a pediatrician(小儿科医师) and they
EDL	00:02:38,730	00:02:42,420	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	said why and and and I said well because
EDL	00:02:42,420	00:02:44,489	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I just want to take care of people and I
EDL	00:02:44,489	00:02:46,260	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	want to take care of children and I do
EDL	00:02:46,260	00:02:49,290	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	think it stems from my mom was a nurse
EDL	00:02:49,290	00:02:51,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and so I think less so from the
EDL	00:02:51,870	00:02:54,150	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	influence of being around someone in the
EDL	00:02:54,150	00:02:56,190	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	medical profession but more so just
EDL	00:02:56,190	00:02:57,299	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	being around someone that cares very
EDL	00:02:57,299	00:02:58,769	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	deeply about other people
EDL	00:02:58,769	00:03:00,930	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	again very early on and it but it's been
EDL	00:03:00,930	00:03:02,610	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it's been sort of a consistent part of
EDL	00:03:02,610	00:03:05,790	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	my life yeah this was in fourth grade
EDL	00:03:05,790	00:03:07,709	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	this whole like you know I wanted to be
EDL	00:03:07,709	00:03:09,600	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	a pediatrician(小儿科医师) and so as I was on this
EDL	00:03:09,600	00:03:11,430	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	trajectory and I didn't know of course
EDL	00:03:11,430	00:03:13,019	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what I was talking about you know I mean
EDL	00:03:13,019	00:03:14,850	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	even you make these decisions early in
EDL	00:03:14,850	00:03:17,310	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	your life but my parents and my family
EDL	00:03:17,310	00:03:20,070	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	always had this incredibly strong ethic
EDL	00:03:20,070	00:03:22,260	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of service and very deeply and
EDL	00:03:22,260	00:03:23,880	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	fundamentally because I reflect on this
EDL	00:03:23,880	00:03:26,489	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	often actually it's like Who am I and
EDL	00:03:26,489	00:03:28,370	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what am I supposed to be and I think
EDL	00:03:28,370	00:03:30,900	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what I do is I serve others and that's
EDL	00:03:30,900	00:03:32,970	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that's how I define myself maybe one of
EDL	00:03:32,970	00:03:35,040	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the greatest gifts from my parents was
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:38,940	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that my dad was active duty Navy officer

EDL	00:03:41,340	00:03:43,410	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	engineer on a Surface Warfare ship it
EDL	00:03:43,410	00:03:44,670	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	was active duty for five or six years
EDL	00:03:44,670	00:03:46,530	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	stayed in the Navy for another 20 plus
EDL	00:03:46,530	00:03:48,660	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	retired as a Navy captain in the

EDL	00:03:53,940	00:03:56,579	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	field with my dad's passion of serving
EDL	00:03:56,579	00:03:58,440	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	our country this was almost like all I
EDL	00:03:58,440	00:04:00,569	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	knew and so that trajectory has sort of
EDL	00:04:00,569	00:04:02,160	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	guided me through all of my decisions in


EDL	00:04:02,160	00:04:03,540	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	my okay well let's actually talk a

EDL	00:04:25,244	00:04:27,720	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I would start by saying what a privilege

EDL	00:04:33,630	00:04:35,880	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	again feeling that I'm serving my

EDL	00:04:49,620	00:04:53,760	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	really my role there was to engage their

EDL	00:05:04,740	00:05:07,290	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	capability that was those public health
EDL	00:05:07,290	00:05:09,060	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	systems were all part of the Soviet
EDL	00:05:09,060	00:05:10,890	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Union but when the Soviet Union fell
EDL	00:05:10,890	00:05:12,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	these countries were kind of left to
EDL	00:05:12,870	00:05:15,000	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	their own to recreate a public health
EDL	00:05:15,000	00:05:18,030	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	infrastructure and so the privilege was
EDL	00:05:18,030	00:05:20,940	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to work with those experts in the host
EDL	00:05:20,940	00:05:22,890	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	country to say how do we build that back
EDL	00:05:22,890	00:05:25,500	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	up again so that you can tell us that
EDL	00:05:25,500	00:05:27,330	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	there's an outbreak going on and then we
EDL	00:05:27,330	00:05:29,310	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	can collectively work together to
EDL	00:05:29,310	00:05:31,080	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	respond to that outbreak right so did
EDL	00:05:31,080	00:05:33,000	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you bring in models like the the Centers
EDL	00:05:33,000	00:05:35,130	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of Disease Control here we did yes we
EDL	00:05:35,130	00:05:36,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	did we work closely with the embassies
EDL	00:05:36,870	00:05:38,220	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we work closely with the State
EDL	00:05:38,220	00:05:40,050	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Department we work closely with the CDC
EDL	00:05:40,050	00:05:43,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	at the end of the day it was myself and
EDL	00:05:43,350	00:05:45,630	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	some of my DoD colleagues on the ground
EDL	00:05:45,630	00:05:48,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you know rolling our sleeves up helping
EDL	00:05:48,360	00:05:50,550	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	these countries develop those systems
EDL	00:05:50,550	00:05:52,640	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	developing laboratory capabilities
EDL	00:05:52,640	00:05:54,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	developing the ability to do clinical
EDL	00:05:54,870	00:05:57,030	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	research to ethical standards that would
EDL	00:05:57,030	00:05:58,710	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	be accepted all over the world and to
EDL	00:05:58,710	00:06:01,200	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	figure out how to do this you know again
EDL	00:06:01,200	00:06:03,300	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I look back what a privilege to be on
EDL	00:06:03,300	00:06:05,790	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the ground and at this point fairly
EDL	00:06:05,790	00:06:08,100	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	junior in my career and to help an
EDL	00:06:08,100	00:06:09,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	entire nation improve their public
EDL	00:06:09,870	00:06:12,450	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	health sound like a great privilege what
EDL	00:06:12,450	00:06:14,370	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	is the sequence of events Matt that
EDL	00:06:14,370	00:06:16,830	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	resulted in your current position here
EDL	00:06:16,830	00:06:19,229	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	at DARPA as a program manager throughout
EDL	00:06:19,229	00:06:21,300	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	my medical career I had heard about
EDL	00:06:21,300	00:06:25,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	DARPA and I had seen amazing technology
EDL	00:06:25,350	00:06:27,479	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that had come from DARPA that were aimed
EDL	00:06:27,479	00:06:28,919	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	at addressing infectious diseases
EDL	00:06:28,919	00:06:31,249	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	threats so I had always admired from afar 
EDL	00:06:31,249	00:06:33,390	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	before I joined DARPA I was over
EDL	00:06:33,390	00:06:34,800	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	at the White House National Security
EDL	00:06:34,800	00:06:37,740	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Council staff and in that role my job
EDL	00:06:37,740	00:06:41,559	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	was to identify what capabilities we do
EDL	00:06:41,559	00:06:43,959	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	have to respond to pandemics and then
EDL	00:06:43,959	00:06:45,579	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	how we can organize ourselves as a
EDL	00:06:45,579	00:06:47,739	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	government not just DoD but as an entire
EDL	00:06:47,739	00:06:50,169	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	government towards addressing those gaps
EDL	00:06:50,169	00:06:52,319	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	so we're ready for the next one and
EDL	00:06:52,319	00:06:54,429	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	while I was there I got tapped on the
EDL	00:06:54,429	00:06:58,089	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	shoulder and the concise phrase was
EDL	00:06:58,089	00:07:01,179	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you're doing all of this policy what we
EDL	00:07:01,179	00:07:04,059	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	should do as a government how would you
EDL	00:07:04,059	00:07:09,099	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	then like to implement and actually make
EDL	00:07:09,099	00:07:10,899	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	investments that are going to address
EDL	00:07:10,899	00:07:13,089	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	those gaps so method where you literally
EDL	00:07:13,089	00:07:15,969	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	tapped on the shoulder and so who was it
EDL	00:07:15,969	00:07:17,259	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that proposed this to you
EDL	00:07:17,259	00:07:20,439	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it was dr. Jeff Ling who was the deputy
EDL	00:07:20,439	00:07:24,159	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	director of DSO at the time and he we
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:27,119	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	met him for coffee one morning and he
EDL	00:07:27,119	00:07:29,289	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	didn't literally actually put his hand
EDL	00:07:29,289	00:07:32,589	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	on my shoulder but figuratively imagine
EDL	00:07:32,589	00:07:36,249	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	a hand on my shoulder saying Matt how
EDL	00:07:36,249	00:07:37,989	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	would you like to try at DARPA to
EDL	00:07:37,989	00:07:40,869	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	actually invest to make a difference for
EDL	00:07:40,869	00:07:42,159	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	all those things that you've been
EDL	00:07:42,159	00:07:43,959	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	talking about in terms of big policy
EDL	00:07:43,959	00:07:45,855	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	words for the last few years 
EDL	00:07:45,855	00:07:49,299	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	well and of course he provided a model of audacity
EDL	00:07:49,299	00:07:51,539	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	because he really took on from madison
EDL	00:07:51,539	00:07:53,799	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	prosthetics(修复学) and other other programs to
EDL	00:07:53,799	00:07:55,539	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	really help the warfighter why don't we
EDL	00:07:55,539	00:07:58,329	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	segue(继续) then into your life as a program
EDL	00:07:58,329	00:07:59,589	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	manager here in this tremendous
EDL	00:07:59,589	00:08:02,049	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	portfolio that you've developed which is
EDL	00:08:02,049	00:08:04,449	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I think a portfolio that also reflects
EDL	00:08:04,449	00:08:06,879	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	some kind of audacious point of view as
EDL	00:08:06,879	00:08:09,519	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	is of course reflected by that statement
EDL	00:08:09,519	00:08:12,279	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	earlier that you want to take the lethal
EDL	00:08:12,279	00:08:14,889	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	power out of infectious disease so the
EDL	00:08:14,889	00:08:16,689	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	names are fantastic some of them like
EDL	00:08:16,689	00:08:19,119	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Prometheus and Thor dialysis like
EDL	00:08:19,119	00:08:21,759	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	therapeutics in vivo nano platforms and
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,079	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we'll probably talk more about one of
EDL	00:08:23,079	00:08:24,969	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	them in particular the pandemic
EDL	00:08:24,969	00:08:27,159	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	prevention platform what I'm hoping to
EDL	00:08:27,159	00:08:28,989	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	do now is is if you could briefly take
EDL	00:08:28,989	00:08:31,839	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	us for a tour of your programs we can't
EDL	00:08:31,839	00:08:34,179	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	go in-depth about any of them at this
EDL	00:08:34,179	00:08:36,339	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	point but take me a little bit of a tour
EDL	00:08:36,339	00:08:37,719	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	on what's what you're hoping to achieve
EDL	00:08:37,719	00:08:39,429	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	with some of these programs and then
EDL	00:08:39,429	00:08:40,958	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we'll focus in a little bit more on the
EDL	00:08:40,958	00:08:42,720	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pandemic prevention platform 

EDL	00:08:42,720	00:08:45,879	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	yeah so the tour starts by saying what problems are
EDL	00:08:45,879	00:08:48,670	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we trying to solve and again at the
EDL	00:08:48,670	00:08:50,050	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	White House National Security Council
EDL	00:08:50,050	00:08:52,899	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	staff I got a chance to say look for
EDL	00:08:52,899	00:08:56,769	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	these major outbreaks pandemics or near
EDL	00:08:56,769	00:08:58,750	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pandemics how have we done as a
EDL	00:08:58,750	00:09:01,029	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	government think about the 2009 h1n1
EDL	00:09:01,029	00:09:03,579	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pandemic think about the West Africa
EDL	00:09:03,579	00:09:08,510	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Ebola crisis h1n1 that is h1n1 influenza

EDL	00:09:08,510	00:09:08,709	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	yeah
EDL	00:09:08,709	00:09:10,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	influenza think about the West Africa
EDL	00:09:10,690	00:09:12,130	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Ebola crisis think about how we've
EDL	00:09:12,130	00:09:13,959	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	recently responded to Zika there are
EDL	00:09:13,959	00:09:15,610	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	common themes throughout and some of
EDL	00:09:15,610	00:09:17,649	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	those common themes are we need to be
EDL	00:09:17,649	00:09:20,769	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	much better at diagnosing if someone has
EDL	00:09:20,769	00:09:22,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	an infection and we need to go a step
EDL	00:09:22,360	00:09:25,269	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	beyond that and imagine a world that if
EDL	00:09:25,269	00:09:28,240	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we could figure out if someone is going
EDL	00:09:28,240	00:09:30,910	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to be sick or is going to be contagious
EDL	00:09:30,910	00:09:33,430	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we can intervene and stop the outbreak
EDL	00:09:33,430	00:09:34,779	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	right in its tracks and that's
EDL	00:09:34,779	00:09:36,430	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Prometheus and that's the Prometheus
EDL	00:09:36,430	00:09:38,260	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	program but we also need to make
EDL	00:09:38,260	00:09:40,630	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	vaccines and treatments much faster than
EDL	00:09:40,630	00:09:43,149	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we currently can and that's one of the
EDL	00:09:43,149	00:09:44,829	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	examples as the pandemic prevention
EDL	00:09:44,829	00:09:46,839	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	platform we need to alternate ways of
EDL	00:09:46,839	00:09:48,940	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	how we treat infections and using
EDL	00:09:48,940	00:09:51,550	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	portable dialysis(透析) to filter the blood
EDL	00:09:51,550	00:09:53,529	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and remove any type of pathogen(病原体) is a
EDL	00:09:53,529	00:09:55,300	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	good example but that's just in that
EDL	00:09:55,300	00:09:57,310	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	case is does that mean I might I might
EDL	00:09:57,310	00:09:59,199	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	have been exposed to some kind of
EDL	00:09:59,199	00:10:01,269	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pathogenic(致病) agent(药剂) it's in my blood and
EDL	00:10:01,269	00:10:03,459	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	certain levels so with this kind of
EDL	00:10:03,459	00:10:05,800	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	technology remove that before it could
EDL	00:10:05,800	00:10:07,540	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	take hold and actually get me sick was
EDL	00:10:07,540	00:10:09,310	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that is that the idea of that yes and
EDL	00:10:09,310	00:10:13,389	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the idea would be again especially for
EDL	00:10:13,389	00:10:15,550	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pathogens where we don't have a vaccine
EDL	00:10:15,550	00:10:17,470	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	where we don't have a treatment
EDL	00:10:17,470	00:10:19,839	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	especially think about now with what
EDL	00:10:19,839	00:10:23,543	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we're seeing so much antimicrobial(抗菌剂) resistant bacteria 
EDL	00:10:23,543	00:10:25,329	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	imagine if we're we
EDL	00:10:25,329	00:10:27,670	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	can't use antibiotics(抗生素) so if we can
EDL	00:10:27,670	00:10:29,170	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	filter your blood and remove that
EDL	00:10:29,170	00:10:31,149	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pathogen what if it does is ultimately
EDL	00:10:31,149	00:10:32,860	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	gives a leg up for your own immune
EDL	00:10:32,860	00:10:35,649	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	response to ultimately make you well again
EDL	00:10:35,649	00:10:38,290	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we like that technology especially or in
EDL	00:10:38,290	00:10:40,779	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	those first days when we need to buy
EDL	00:10:40,779	00:10:42,880	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	some time to develop a vaccine and we
EDL	00:10:42,880	00:10:45,670	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	need to develop new treatments and so my
EDL	00:10:45,670	00:10:48,880	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	point across the portfolio is that we
EDL	00:10:48,880	00:10:50,740	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	have lots of investments in medical
EDL	00:10:50,740	00:10:53,529	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	diagnostics we're investing in modeling
EDL	00:10:53,529	00:10:55,600	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to forecast where infectious diseases
EDL	00:10:55,600	00:10:57,519	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	are going to go we have investments in
EDL	00:10:57,519	00:10:59,290	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	accelerating new treatments but they're
EDL	00:10:59,290	00:11:01,000	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	all connected together they are all
EDL	00:11:01,000	00:11:02,920	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	linked and let me give you an example
EDL	00:11:02,920	00:11:05,769	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	with our Prometheus program predicting
EDL	00:11:05,769	00:11:08,340	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	if someone is going to become contagious
EDL	00:11:08,340	00:11:11,500	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	well awesome right if we can do that but
EDL	00:11:11,500	00:11:14,019	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	once we predict and identify that person
EDL	00:11:14,019	00:11:17,230	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we still have to treat them and so we're
EDL	00:11:17,230	00:11:19,449	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	going to need treatments as fast as
EDL	00:11:19,449	00:11:21,879	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	possible with our pandemic prevention
EDL	00:11:21,879	00:11:24,850	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	platform and the beauty is is that those
EDL	00:11:24,850	00:11:26,709	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	treatments are probably going to be most
EDL	00:11:26,709	00:11:28,509	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	effective when they're given as early as
EDL	00:11:28,509	00:11:31,029	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	possible so I think of our whole
EDL	00:11:31,029	00:11:34,029	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	portfolio as interconnected that we
EDL	00:11:34,029	00:11:35,470	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	develop a lot of different specific
EDL	00:11:35,470	00:11:38,259	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	projects to get capabilities but that
EDL	00:11:38,259	00:11:40,789	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	they're ultimately going to intertwine(纠缠在一起)
EDL	00:11:40,789	00:11:43,217	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	so that we stop the outbreak in its tracks 

* HOST: lifecycle of a DARPA program

EDL	00:11:43,217	00:11:44,649	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	well when I think of programs
EDL	00:11:44,649	00:11:46,120	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	here at DARPA they all have a kind of
EDL	00:11:46,120	00:11:47,829	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	lifecycle to them right I mean they they
EDL	00:11:47,829	00:11:50,529	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	sort of start as a glimmer in the eye of
EDL	00:11:50,529	00:11:52,420	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	someone like you Matt a program manager
EDL	00:11:52,420	00:11:54,699	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	there's a period of vetting and working
EDL	00:11:54,699	00:11:56,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	with others here to really articulate
EDL	00:11:56,350	00:11:58,959	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and formulate the program as best it can
EDL	00:11:58,959	00:12:00,879	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	be so that it can be most effective and
EDL	00:12:00,879	00:12:02,860	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	then kind of smoke signals go out to the
EDL	00:12:02,860	00:12:04,660	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	world and seeking people who maybe think
EDL	00:12:04,660	00:12:06,129	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that they can pull off some of these
EDL	00:12:06,129	00:12:08,139	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	audacious tasks that we've put out of
EDL	00:12:08,139	00:12:09,459	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	course then the research is done and
EDL	00:12:09,459	00:12:11,920	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	hopefully in the end you succeed or if
EDL	00:12:11,920	00:12:14,470	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	not fully succeed you learn from all the
EDL	00:12:14,470	00:12:15,819	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	research that that's going on
EDL	00:12:15,819	00:12:18,220	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	so what is the status in that lifecycle
EDL	00:12:18,220	00:12:19,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of the pandemic
EDL	00:12:19,870	00:12:22,329	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	prevention platform the payment Demick
EDL	00:12:22,329	00:12:25,149	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	prevention platform just launched and so
EDL	00:12:25,149	00:12:26,889	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and by launch those who might not know
EDL	00:12:26,889	00:12:28,449	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what that means in the DARPA context
EDL	00:12:28,449	00:12:31,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	said that that means that completing the
EDL	00:12:31,360	00:12:33,129	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	contracting process so that our
EDL	00:12:33,129	00:12:35,589	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	performers that were selected in a very
EDL	00:12:35,589	00:12:38,319	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	rigorous(严密的) process can now accomplish the
EDL	00:12:38,319	00:12:40,899	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	goals of the program so they're just
EDL	00:12:40,899	00:12:43,089	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	starting in there for six months as part
EDL	00:12:43,089	00:12:45,329	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of the lifecycle these are early days
EDL	00:12:45,329	00:12:48,279	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	early days because the ultimate goal of
EDL	00:12:48,279	00:12:51,040	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that program is so difficult we have a
EDL	00:12:51,040	00:12:52,660	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	lot you know in some ways I feel like
EDL	00:12:52,660	00:12:54,339	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	while we have we have a long way to go
EDL	00:12:54,339	00:12:56,230	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	one of the the key points though of the
EDL	00:12:56,230	00:12:59,259	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pandemic prevention platform is that the
EDL	00:12:59,259	00:13:02,470	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	goal is incredibly ambitious but there
EDL	00:13:02,470	00:13:05,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	is foundational scientific evidence that
EDL	00:13:05,350	00:13:07,809	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	this can be done and that foundational
EDL	00:13:07,809	00:13:10,569	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	scientific evidence is derived from a
EDL	00:13:10,569	00:13:13,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	previous DARPA program and that previous

EDL	00:13:17,139	00:13:19,269	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	because when I looked over the program
EDL	00:13:19,269	00:13:20,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it's fascinating to me because it
EDL	00:13:20,690	00:13:23,120	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it looks like we're trying to rev up the

rev up: to become more active, or to make someone or something become more active

EDL	00:13:23,120	00:13:26,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	whole brilliant molecular world of
EDL	00:13:26,360	00:13:29,180	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antibodies and so I want you to sort of
EDL	00:13:29,180	00:13:30,440	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	go through this the sequence events
EDL	00:13:30,440	00:13:32,583	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	beginning with this earlier program at depth 

EDL	00:13:32,583	00:13:32,919	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	[GUEST] yeah 

EDL	00:13:32,919	00:13:34,670	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	but walk us through some of
EDL	00:13:34,670	00:13:36,650	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the steps because when I look antibodies
EDL	00:13:36,650	00:13:38,330	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to wear among my favorite proteins when
EDL	00:13:38,330	00:13:39,890	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I look at their just brilliant things
EDL	00:13:39,890	00:13:42,380	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	they just so selective and they find the
EDL	00:13:42,380	00:13:43,850	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	thing that we don't want our bodies like
EDL	00:13:43,850	00:13:46,790	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	glom any way you tell us the pieces of
EDL	00:13:46,790	00:13:47,546	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the program 

EDL	00:13:47,546	00:13:49,250	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you you know Ivan I couldn't
EDL	00:13:49,250	00:13:51,680	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	agree more I think all of us that are
EDL	00:13:51,680	00:13:53,810	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	fascinated by new yeah yeah DARPA right
EDL	00:13:53,810	00:13:55,970	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that's probably a common theme is we are
EDL	00:13:55,970	00:13:58,550	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	just amazed by the natural world and
EDL	00:13:58,550	00:13:59,960	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what the natural world has developed
EDL	00:13:59,960	00:14:02,660	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antibodies are a great example I mean
EDL	00:14:02,660	00:14:05,960	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	there are millions and millions of these
EDL	00:14:05,960	00:14:07,400	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	different versions of antibodies
EDL	00:14:07,400	00:14:08,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	circulating through your body at all
EDL	00:14:08,870	00:14:12,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	times and the mechanisms are so refined
EDL	00:14:12,350	00:14:16,250	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and intricate(错综复杂的) to select ok which are the
EDL	00:14:16,250	00:14:18,380	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antibodies that are most protective when
EDL	00:14:18,380	00:14:20,480	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you're exposed to an infection and your
EDL	00:14:20,480	00:14:21,740	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	body goes through the process of them
EDL	00:14:21,740	00:14:23,480	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	making a lot of those in a short period
EDL	00:14:23,480	00:14:23,900	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of time
EDL	00:14:23,900	00:14:27,020	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I think it's mind-boggling(令人惊异) how advanced
EDL	00:14:27,020	00:14:29,660	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that system is we've learned so much
EDL	00:14:29,660	00:14:31,400	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	about antibodies in the last 50 years
EDL	00:14:31,400	00:14:33,680	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you're absolutely right we want to
EDL	00:14:33,680	00:14:35,990	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	leverage all of that information that we
EDL	00:14:35,990	00:14:37,310	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	know how they work now and we know how
EDL	00:14:37,310	00:14:39,320	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	they know about their structure we know
EDL	00:14:39,320	00:14:41,300	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	how to make them in big vats(多样性) and why
EDL	00:14:41,300	00:14:43,250	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	can't we use that and you're seeing
EDL	00:14:43,250	00:14:45,530	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	incredible progress in medicine where we
EDL	00:14:45,530	00:14:46,850	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	are using that where you're seeing
EDL	00:14:46,850	00:14:50,180	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antibodies approved as products now for

EDL	00:14:53,000	00:14:55,370	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	disease or the category biologicals in
EDL	00:14:55,370	00:14:57,410	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the in the category of biologicals a
EDL	00:14:57,410	00:14:59,720	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	massive explosion in that space and we
EDL	00:14:59,720	00:15:01,820	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	want to use all of that knowledge and
EDL	00:15:01,820	00:15:04,010	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that technology to solve infectious
EDL	00:15:04,010	00:15:06,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	diseases problems what we do at DARPA
EDL	00:15:06,350	00:15:08,120	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	though is the fun part is we couple
EDL	00:15:08,120	00:15:10,700	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	different fields together and so as you
EDL	00:15:10,700	00:15:12,200	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	have correctly pointed out this
EDL	00:15:12,200	00:15:14,330	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	extraordinarily powerful tool of
EDL	00:15:14,330	00:15:16,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antibody engineering but can we couple
EDL	00:15:16,730	00:15:18,980	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that with the the revolution that we've
EDL	00:15:18,980	00:15:22,100	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	seen in in genetics and that's that's


* Highlight: DARPA is taking two different areas seeing if we can mix them together

EDL	00:15:22,100	00:15:24,080	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	DARPA right it's taking two different
EDL	00:15:24,080	00:15:26,170	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	areas seeing if we can mix them together

EDL	00:15:26,170	00:15:27,410	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	again
EDL	00:15:27,410	00:15:29,420	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	an antibody specialist might not think
EDL	00:15:29,420	00:15:32,150	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	about the opportunities with genetics
EDL	00:15:32,150	00:15:33,890	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the genetic specialist might not think

EDL	00:15:33,890	00:15:34,430	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	well
EDL	00:15:34,430	00:15:37,339	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	wonder if I couldn't use my use genetic
EDL	00:15:37,339	00:15:39,110	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	engineering to make an antibody you
EDL	00:15:39,110	00:15:40,850	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	bring the two fields together in a mold(模具)
EDL	00:15:40,850	00:15:43,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you know by our our magic of bringing
EDL	00:15:43,730	00:15:45,649	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	them the disciplines(学科) together we achieve
EDL	00:15:45,649	00:15:48,529	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that effect and so the proof of concept
EDL	00:15:48,529	00:15:51,800	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	which I find exhilarating(令人振奋的) it's and
EDL	00:15:51,800	00:15:55,130	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	chills up and down my spine is that we
EDL	00:15:55,130	00:15:59,060	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	can give you a piece of DNA or a piece
EDL	00:15:59,060	00:16:02,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of RNA and we can put that into your
EDL	00:16:02,870	00:16:05,180	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	muscle cells and that your muscle cells
EDL	00:16:05,180	00:16:06,980	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	say okay got it
EDL	00:16:06,980	00:16:09,709	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I am going to make this antibody that is
EDL	00:16:09,709	00:16:12,140	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	so protective that someone's not going
EDL	00:16:12,140	00:16:14,699	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to get that's encoded by these nucleic acids (核酸)
EDL	00:16:14,699	00:16:16,520	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the RNA tells that muscle
EDL	00:16:16,520	00:16:18,290	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	cell so the muscles I was doing what a
EDL	00:16:18,290	00:16:20,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	muscle cell does but once that RNA gets
EDL	00:16:20,690	00:16:22,580	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	inside that muscle cell the muscle cell
EDL	00:16:22,580	00:16:25,490	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	says right I'm gonna make a protective
EDL	00:16:25,490	00:16:26,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antibody that's gonna protect you from
EDL	00:16:26,870	00:16:29,330	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Ebola and to do that in a fairly short
EDL	00:16:29,330	00:16:32,750	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	period of time and that idea would sound
EDL	00:16:32,750	00:16:34,700	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	crazy ten years ago too many obstacles
EDL	00:16:34,700	00:16:36,649	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	can't be done the foundational
EDL	00:16:36,649	00:16:40,370	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	investment from DARPA proved that
EDL	00:16:40,370	00:16:42,260	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	concept in many different animal models
EDL	00:16:42,260	00:16:44,450	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	for many different infections but
EDL	00:16:44,450	00:16:46,130	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	because we're DARPA we said well great
EDL	00:16:46,130	00:16:48,050	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we prove the concept that wasn't good
EDL	00:16:48,050	00:16:49,610	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	enough it wasn't good enough for me and
EDL	00:16:49,610	00:16:50,990	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it wasn't good enough for the DARPA
EDL	00:16:50,990	00:16:53,900	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	leadership DARPA leadership said okay
EDL	00:16:53,900	00:16:55,490	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that's great but we need to birth the
EDL	00:16:55,490	00:16:58,970	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	baby if we're going to take pandemics
EDL	00:16:58,970	00:17:01,520	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	off the table and that's that's why I'm
EDL	00:17:01,520	00:17:04,459	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	here we need to be able to put this
EDL	00:17:04,459	00:17:08,630	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	together as a platform that can go start
EDL	00:17:08,630	00:17:11,599	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to finish from once a pathogen is
EDL	00:17:11,599	00:17:13,939	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	identified to making thousands of doses
EDL	00:17:13,939	00:17:19,069	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of this miraculous(不可思议的) antibody based
EDL	00:17:19,069	00:17:21,380	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antibody based treatment in an
EDL	00:17:21,380	00:17:23,359	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	incredibly short period of time right

* Timescale

EDL	00:17:23,359	00:17:24,859	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and let's let's talk about the timescale
EDL	00:17:24,859	00:17:25,970	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	for a minute because that's part of the
EDL	00:17:25,970	00:17:28,040	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	big deal here right what I've seen is
EDL	00:17:28,040	00:17:30,800	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	within 60 days of identifying the the
EDL	00:17:30,800	00:17:33,110	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pathogenic agent to actually have these
EDL	00:17:33,110	00:17:35,150	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	doses right in hand and in a
EDL	00:17:35,150	00:17:36,800	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	distributable form is that correct
EDL	00:17:36,800	00:17:38,390	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that's correct right that compares to
EDL	00:17:38,390	00:17:40,640	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what - what's the state of the art today
EDL	00:17:40,640	00:17:42,919	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the state of the art today depends on
EDL	00:17:42,919	00:17:45,410	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	infections but let's use some some
EDL	00:17:45,410	00:17:47,510	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	recent examples we currently have some
EDL	00:17:47,510	00:17:47,840	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Zeke(寨卡)
EDL	00:17:47,840	00:17:50,299	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	vaccines in clinical trials but we've
EDL	00:17:50,299	00:17:53,419	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	been working now for a few years and we
EDL	00:17:53,419	00:17:55,809	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	don't have a license to use Zeke vaccine
EDL	00:17:55,809	00:17:58,429	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you think about our [..] when we talk
EDL	00:17:58,429	00:18:00,110	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	about gaps you think about all of these
EDL	00:18:00,110	00:18:02,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	recent outbreaks and one of the
EDL	00:18:02,360	00:18:04,250	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	fundamental lessons is that we haven't
EDL	00:18:04,250	00:18:05,990	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	had vaccines and treatments that are
EDL	00:18:05,990	00:18:10,700	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	ready in time and we came up the the 60
EDL	00:18:10,700	00:18:15,770	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	day goal has been controversial when we
EDL	00:18:15,770	00:18:19,789	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	talk about audacity you know I have
EDL	00:18:19,789	00:18:21,770	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	professional colleagues who laugh at me
EDL	00:18:21,770	00:18:24,940	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I've been on I've been on panels(圆桌论坛) where
EDL	00:18:24,940	00:18:27,860	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	where I you know discuss the program and
EDL	00:18:27,860	00:18:29,899	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the other panelists joined with the
EDL	00:18:29,899	00:18:32,210	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	audience at laughing at me so I knew we
EDL	00:18:32,210	00:18:33,830	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	were in the right space the
EDL	00:18:33,830	00:18:35,899	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	counter-argument that I continually make
EDL	00:18:35,899	00:18:39,470	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to the critics(批评家) is 60 days is dictated(提出) by
EDL	00:18:39,470	00:18:43,070	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what we need to respond to pandemics so
EDL	00:18:43,070	00:18:45,140	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	if you don't agree that our approach is
EDL	00:18:45,140	00:18:47,299	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the right way then come up with an
EDL	00:18:47,299	00:18:49,250	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	alternative because we can't negotiate
EDL	00:18:49,250	00:18:51,500	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	with Mother Nature and say well we'd
EDL	00:18:51,500	00:18:53,000	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	like another six months if you don't
EDL	00:18:53,000	00:18:56,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	mind especially when you think about the
EDL	00:18:56,360	00:18:59,090	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	catastrophic consequences accordingly so
EDL	00:18:59,090	00:19:01,640	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you know we have to be we have to do
EDL	00:19:01,640	00:19:03,799	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	this within 60 days and I think again
EDL	00:19:03,799	00:19:05,750	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I'm profoundly excited because I think
EDL	00:19:05,750	00:19:08,149	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we found a way to do it so I want to try
EDL	00:19:08,149	00:19:09,590	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	to make this concrete for our listeners
EDL	00:19:09,590	00:19:11,750	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	which you've actually done fairly well
EDL	00:19:11,750	00:19:12,980	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	just now what I thought of another way
EDL	00:19:12,980	00:19:15,710	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we might do this and that's by combining

* Back in 1918 Spanish Flu?

EDL	00:19:29,710	00:19:33,260	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	let's say that you had that p3 ability
EDL	00:19:33,260	00:19:36,770	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	back in the 1918 Spanish flu which I've
EDL	00:19:36,770	00:19:38,419	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	seen different numbers I've heard 50
EDL	00:19:38,419	00:19:41,110	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	million people people died during that
EDL	00:19:41,110	00:19:44,510	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pandemic if this technology existed back
EDL	00:19:44,510	00:19:46,940	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	in the early part of the last century
EDL	00:19:46,940	00:19:49,610	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	how would that have unfolded do you
EDL	00:19:49,610	00:19:54,080	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	think well my hope is that 50 million
EDL	00:19:54,080	00:19:57,649	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	people don't die that we and again part
EDL	00:19:57,649	00:20:00,650	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	of this is you detect that we have a new virus
EDL	00:20:00,650	00:20:04,100	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	or a new version of influenza and we
EDL	00:20:04,100	00:20:06,200	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	detect very early on in the process when
EDL	00:20:06,200	00:20:07,580	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it's first starting out in a given
EDL	00:20:07,580	00:20:10,010	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	country that it's that that it's
EDL	00:20:10,010	00:20:13,010	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	happening we flip the switch and we say
EDL	00:20:13,010	00:20:17,990	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	for that new virus we need $20,000 that
EDL	00:20:17,990	00:20:20,600	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	have to be ready within 60 days and then
EDL	00:20:20,600	00:20:22,430	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we go to win that outbreak is first
EDL	00:20:22,430	00:20:26,300	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	starting we identify who's sick we treat
EDL	00:20:26,300	00:20:28,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	those people that are most likely to be
EDL	00:20:28,730	00:20:31,040	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	contagious and we stop the outbreak in
EDL	00:20:31,040	00:20:33,050	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	its tracks if we add it we could have
EDL	00:20:33,050	00:20:35,090	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	stopped the Spanish flu I think even
EDL	00:20:35,090	00:20:38,150	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	more importantly right now today you and
EDL	00:20:38,150	00:20:40,550	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I both know people who are getting very
EDL	00:20:40,550	00:20:42,710	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	sick with influenza we're seeing a
EDL	00:20:42,710	00:20:45,610	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	severe season and we're seeing
EDL	00:20:45,610	00:20:48,520	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	unfortunately children die we're seeing
EDL	00:20:48,520	00:20:51,860	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	unfortunately otherwise completely
EDL	00:20:51,860	00:20:53,450	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	healthy people having you know being
EDL	00:20:53,450	00:20:56,480	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	hospitalized and influenza does that to
EDL	00:20:56,480	00:20:58,820	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	us every year we imagine a world where
EDL	00:20:58,820	00:21:01,820	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	this platform could be used to take
EDL	00:21:01,820	00:21:04,150	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	seasonal influenza off the table as well
EDL	00:21:04,150	00:21:07,280	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	an amazing thought because I mean this
EDL	00:21:07,280	00:21:09,470	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	gets back to you to them several times
EDL	00:21:09,470	00:21:11,630	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you said what a privilege it is to do
EDL	00:21:11,630	00:21:13,550	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what you're doing because if you succeed
EDL	00:21:13,550	00:21:15,710	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you will know I know you won't take this
EDL	00:21:15,710	00:21:17,960	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it's not pumping you up personally it's
EDL	00:21:17,960	00:21:20,270	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it's more for what it's doing for you
EDL	00:21:20,270	00:21:22,310	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	know kind of humanity but you will know
EDL	00:21:22,310	00:21:24,140	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you've had a part in potentially saving
EDL	00:21:24,140	00:21:25,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	millions of people's lives by cutting
EDL	00:21:25,730	00:21:29,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	these pandemic experiences off before
EDL	00:21:29,690	00:21:32,500	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	they really get going and spread so a
EDL	00:21:32,500	00:21:35,270	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	really quite an amazing yeah and I would

* make 2 points

EDL	00:21:35,270	00:21:38,300	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	make two points the first is that DARPA
EDL	00:21:38,300	00:21:41,930	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	my team does not do this alone
EDL	00:21:41,930	00:21:46,280	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	DARPA does not do this alone we we work
EDL	00:21:46,280	00:21:49,310	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	incredibly closely with our colleagues
EDL	00:21:49,310	00:21:51,140	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and Health and Human Services with other
EDL	00:21:51,140	00:21:52,910	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	experts in the Department of Defense in
EDL	00:21:52,910	00:21:54,890	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the US government as well as
EDL	00:21:54,890	00:21:57,530	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	philanthropy(慈善事业) as well as the private
EDL	00:21:57,530	00:21:58,940	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	sector and as well as the global
EDL	00:21:58,940	00:22:02,030	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	community it's ultimately a global
EDL	00:22:02,030	00:22:04,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	teamwork that's going to take these
EDL	00:22:04,730	00:22:06,890	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	infectious diseases off the table but
EDL	00:22:06,890	00:22:09,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	make no mistake we can say it sounds
EDL	00:22:09,350	00:22:10,880	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	hard and it's ambitious and it's crazy
EDL	00:22:10,880	00:22:14,119	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	but I challenge you to say why not
EDL	00:22:14,119	00:22:16,009	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you know why aren't we as a society
EDL	00:22:16,009	00:22:19,519	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	putting incredible even more effort into
EDL	00:22:19,519	00:22:21,349	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	taking these infectious diseases off the
EDL	00:22:21,349	00:22:22,699	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	table if we have the if we have the
EDL	00:22:22,699	00:22:24,649	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	scientific know-how to do so this is
EDL	00:22:24,649	00:22:26,329	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what I think one should be focusing it's
EDL	00:22:26,329	00:22:29,209	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	a moonshot but why not go for a moonshot
EDL	00:22:29,209	00:22:31,719	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and why not go for a moonshot for
EDL	00:22:31,719	00:22:34,669	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	against something that could kill
EDL	00:22:34,669	00:22:36,799	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	another 50 million people why not take a
EDL	00:22:36,799	00:22:40,039	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	moonshot against infectious diseases
EDL	00:22:40,039	00:22:42,319	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	like malaria and tuberculosis(肺结核) I mean
EDL	00:22:42,319	00:22:44,449	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we've seen you know there's there's
EDL	00:22:44,449	00:22:46,309	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	effort in there there's global effort
EDL	00:22:46,309	00:22:48,876	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that's absolutely tremendous but why not more 

EDL	00:22:48,876	00:22:50,869	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	so Matt just a little while ago you
EDL	00:22:50,869	00:22:52,669	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and I were kind of gushing(滔滔不绝) about the
EDL	00:22:52,669	00:22:54,499	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	molecular beauty in the biological
EDL	00:22:54,499	00:22:56,149	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	beauty of antibodies and the
EDL	00:22:56,149	00:22:58,909	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	specificities those have to go out and
EDL	00:22:58,909	00:23:01,459	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	find whatever the health threatening
EDL	00:23:01,459	00:23:04,069	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	agent might be and kind of and the role
EDL	00:23:04,069	00:23:06,739	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that plays in our own bodies fight
EDL	00:23:06,739	00:23:11,599	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	against health compromising exposures so

* QUESTION:
EDL	00:23:11,599	00:23:14,749	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I guess I kind of want to ask you do you
EDL	00:23:14,749	00:23:17,719	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	have a favorite infectious disease in
EDL	00:23:17,719	00:23:20,059	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the sense that you admire what the
EDL	00:23:20,059	00:23:23,539	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	bacterium(细菌,单数) or what the virus does and has
EDL	00:23:23,539	00:23:25,009	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	learned how to do over the course of
EDL	00:23:25,009	00:23:26,146	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	evolution? 

* ANSWER

EDL	00:23:26,146	00:23:28,939	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	so I'll answer in a slightly
EDL	00:23:28,939	00:23:34,279	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	different way I think it's a when when
EDL	00:23:34,279	00:23:35,929	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	when we say we want to take infectious
EDL	00:23:35,929	00:23:38,659	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	diseases off the table in some ways it's
EDL	00:23:38,659	00:23:40,639	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	or it's ridiculous because we're always
EDL	00:23:40,639	00:23:43,479	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	gonna have we're always going to have
EDL	00:23:43,479	00:23:46,369	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	viruses and bacteria that are part of
EDL	00:23:46,369	00:23:51,169	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the natural world and we and we've
EDL	00:23:51,169	00:23:53,059	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	always seen them as the enemy or it's
EDL	00:23:53,059	00:23:56,599	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pathogens is the word that we use one of
EDL	00:23:56,599	00:23:58,279	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the interesting ways to think about the
EDL	00:23:58,279	00:24:02,659	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	problem though is that a part of it is
EDL	00:24:02,659	00:24:04,369	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that there are a pathogen but part of it
EDL	00:24:04,369	00:24:09,109	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	is how we respond and modulating how our
EDL	00:24:09,109	00:24:11,599	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	own body responds to pathogens is a
EDL	00:24:11,599	00:24:13,249	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	major theme of what we're trying to do
EDL	00:24:13,249	00:24:15,229	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	with antibodies being one of many
EDL	00:24:15,229	00:24:17,779	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	examples and so you know one of the
EDL	00:24:17,779	00:24:20,059	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	traditional attitudes of antibiotics is
EDL	00:24:20,059	00:24:21,769	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you know antibiotics that have been
EDL	00:24:21,769	00:24:23,329	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	wonderful and certainly profoundly
EDL	00:24:23,329	00:24:25,579	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	impactful in terms of our society as
EDL	00:24:25,579	00:24:28,270	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we've as we've come along but we've also discovered
EDL	00:24:28,270	00:24:30,190	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the unintended consequences of giving a
EDL	00:24:30,190	00:24:32,020	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	broad-spectrum antibiotic incurring(招致) my
EDL	00:24:32,020	00:24:34,540	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	antimicrobial(抗菌) resistance and things like
EDL	00:24:34,540	00:24:37,540	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that as well so the the world that I
EDL	00:24:37,540	00:24:41,679	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	imagine is that there is I guess like
EDL	00:24:41,679	00:24:43,540	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you said before an appreciation of
EDL	00:24:43,540	00:24:45,610	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	pathogens an appreciation of viruses and
EDL	00:24:45,610	00:24:48,309	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	bacteria understanding what they do and
EDL	00:24:48,309	00:24:50,830	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	what they don't do and it's not always
EDL	00:24:50,830	00:24:53,440	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	wiping them out but more about rendering
EDL	00:24:53,440	00:24:55,360	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	them harmless or figuring out ways to
EDL	00:24:55,360	00:24:58,120	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	kind of coexist with them is where I
EDL	00:24:58,120	00:24:59,470	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	would like our thinking to go in the
EDL	00:24:59,470	00:25:00,127	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	21st century. 

EDL	00:25:00,127	00:25:01,240	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:25:01,240	00:25:03,220	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	gonna I heard statistics about the
EDL	00:25:03,220	00:25:05,679	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	number of mammalian(哺乳动物的) cells in me and you
EDL	00:25:05,679	00:25:07,510	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and the number of bacterial cells and
EDL	00:25:07,510	00:25:10,090	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	there's we're almost from just a numbers
EDL	00:25:10,090	00:25:12,040	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	perspective way more bacterial than we
EDL	00:25:12,040	00:25:15,040	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	are mammalian we are but they're most of
EDL	00:25:15,040	00:25:16,600	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the time this is this is a symbiosis(共生)
EDL	00:25:16,600	00:25:18,130	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	this is this is a mutually beneficial
EDL	00:25:18,130	00:25:22,090	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	relationship and so it really we
EDL	00:25:22,090	00:25:23,860	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	shouldn't always think about these these
EDL	00:25:23,860	00:25:27,370	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	microbes(微生物) as things to consider them 
EDL	00:25:27,370	00:25:28,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	enemies we shouldn't consider them that's
EDL	00:25:28,690	00:25:30,309	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	right that's right and the other part is
EDL	00:25:30,309	00:25:32,710	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that we learn from them you know it's
EDL	00:25:32,710	00:25:35,830	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it's their evolution that also kind of
EDL	00:25:35,830	00:25:38,800	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	inspires us and so it's a that in some
EDL	00:25:38,800	00:25:40,480	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	ways there are adversary but in some
EDL	00:25:40,480	00:25:43,390	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	ways they're sort of that you know in
EDL	00:25:43,390	00:25:45,040	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the superhero novels and things like
EDL	00:25:45,040	00:25:47,679	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that this idea of the the the balance
EDL	00:25:47,679	00:25:49,630	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	between the hero and the villain(反派) and
EDL	00:25:49,630	00:25:51,820	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	sort of that strange relationship that
EDL	00:25:51,820	00:25:53,950	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	often and develops between the two and
EDL	00:25:53,950	00:25:55,929	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	if you will mutual appreciation is that
EDL	00:25:55,929	00:25:58,417	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	I think that's awesome pathogens 

* ENDING

EDL	00:25:58,417	00:25:58,870	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	so Matt
EDL	00:25:58,870	00:26:00,760	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we're coming toward the end of our time
EDL	00:26:00,760	00:26:03,990	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	here but I'm just wondering if there is
EDL	00:26:03,990	00:26:06,610	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	something that didn't come up during our
EDL	00:26:06,610	00:26:08,740	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	discussion that you think would be of
EDL	00:26:08,740	00:26:11,559	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	interest to our listeners given you know
EDL	00:26:11,559	00:26:15,550	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	your goal here of perhaps ridding us of
EDL	00:26:15,550	00:26:17,620	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	some of some of the concerns we have
EDL	00:26:17,620	00:26:20,500	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	about the pathogens in our environment

EDL	00:26:20,500	00:26:22,630	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	yeah one of our mantras at DARPA is this
EDL	00:26:22,630	00:26:26,230	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	idea of inspiring inspiring creativity
EDL	00:26:26,230	00:26:28,450	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and new solutions to problems and
EDL	00:26:28,450	00:26:32,200	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	oftentimes we say by sort of recruiting
EDL	00:26:32,200	00:26:33,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	in people who have not traditionally
EDL	00:26:33,730	00:26:37,270	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	thought about our problems to help us
EDL	00:26:37,270	00:26:40,090	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	with those solutions and so you know I
EDL	00:26:40,090	00:26:41,950	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	would love for the listeners
EDL	00:26:41,950	00:26:45,580	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	this podcast to be more inspired to
EDL	00:26:45,580	00:26:48,370	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	address the problems and Infectious
EDL	00:26:48,370	00:26:51,279	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	Diseases and what I mean by that is I
EDL	00:26:51,279	00:26:54,010	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	always say people like me have to you
EDL	00:26:54,010	00:26:56,409	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	know we've invested our entire careers
EDL	00:26:56,409	00:26:58,330	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and our life work into this and we have
EDL	00:26:58,330	00:27:01,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	deep knowledge of the subject but I love
EDL	00:27:01,690	00:27:03,399	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	the thought of people that have
EDL	00:27:03,399	00:27:05,860	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	expertise in computer science in
EDL	00:27:05,860	00:27:09,460	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	mathematics in what we would say well
EDL	00:27:09,460	00:27:10,990	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	maybe those fields aren't necessarily
EDL	00:27:10,990	00:27:13,659	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	obviously related that's who I think
EDL	00:27:13,659	00:27:15,850	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that's how we're gonna solve the
EDL	00:27:15,850	00:27:17,740	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	infectious diseases problems of the 21st
EDL	00:27:17,740	00:27:19,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	century and so when I speak on this it's
EDL	00:27:19,690	00:27:22,029	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	almost part it's one part recruiting and
EDL	00:27:22,029	00:27:24,340	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	it's especially recruiting those that
EDL	00:27:24,340	00:27:27,070	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	may not have all of the biases of the
EDL	00:27:27,070	00:27:28,809	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	traditional experts in infectious
EDL	00:27:28,809	00:27:30,730	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	disease to come up with a creative
EDL	00:27:30,730	00:27:34,779	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	solution to solve it so that makes me
EDL	00:27:34,779	00:27:37,480	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	think of a term that we hear a lot here
EDL	00:27:37,480	00:27:39,279	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	at DARPA you know the innovation
EDL	00:27:39,279	00:27:41,529	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	ecosystem because you just mentioned a
EDL	00:27:41,529	00:27:43,240	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	whole bunch of disciplines that you know
EDL	00:27:43,240	00:27:45,399	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	maybe on first when you first think
EDL	00:27:45,399	00:27:46,929	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	about infectious disease you might not
EDL	00:27:46,929	00:27:48,970	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	think some of those come together so it
EDL	00:27:48,970	00:27:51,340	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	is there something about you and being
EDL	00:27:51,340	00:27:54,570	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	here at DARPA that is conducive to
EDL	00:27:54,570	00:27:57,100	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	shaking up that innovation ecosystem in
EDL	00:27:57,100	00:27:58,659	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	ways that could maybe move toward the
EDL	00:27:58,659	00:28:01,299	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	goals that you have well DARPA enables
EDL	00:28:01,299	00:28:05,019	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	me to do that because again they are our
EDL	00:28:05,019	00:28:07,419	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	program announcements when we say okay
EDL	00:28:07,419	00:28:09,370	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we set the requirements solve this
EDL	00:28:09,370	00:28:12,309	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	problem make us a treatment in 60 days
EDL	00:28:12,309	00:28:14,830	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	we know that they can't do that alone
EDL	00:28:14,830	00:28:17,230	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	and it takes a multidisciplinary(多学科) team so
EDL	00:28:17,230	00:28:19,690	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	if if you want funding from DARPA you're
EDL	00:28:19,690	00:28:21,340	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	gonna have to work with people you're
EDL	00:28:21,340	00:28:23,019	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	gonna have to recruit it we design it so
EDL	00:28:23,019	00:28:24,519	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that you will have to recruit in people
EDL	00:28:24,519	00:28:26,260	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	that may not be the traditional subject
EDL	00:28:26,260	00:28:29,740	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	matter experts but furthermore every
EDL	00:28:29,740	00:28:32,049	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	time I get a chance to speak and to talk
EDL	00:28:32,049	00:28:35,679	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	about this problem like on this podcast

* Podcast: as a recruiting tool

EDL	00:28:35,679	00:28:38,320	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	you know again I see it as a recruiting
EDL	00:28:38,320	00:28:43,840	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	as a recruiting tool to inspire those to
EDL	00:28:43,840	00:28:45,100	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	help us address these infectious
EDL	00:28:45,100	00:28:47,350	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	diseases threats well what I'm realizing
EDL	00:28:47,350	00:28:49,840	| https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eT4y1X7qZ |	now is I do not want to prevent you for

* NOTE

In this episode of Voices from DARPA, COL Matthew Hepburn, a program manager
since 2013 with the Agency’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO), explains how
his urgent ambition to develop ways and means of disarming current and emerging
infectious and pandemic diseases—think here of Ebola, influenza, and
