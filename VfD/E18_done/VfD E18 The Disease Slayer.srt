35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,759
other positions matt is one of DARPA

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,439
program managers who comes to work in

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,780
his military attire in his case either

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,600
his army fatigues or a dress uniform

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,540
either way he always wears the smile of

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,820
someone who finds himself in a place

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,520
where he just might be able to realize a

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,920
dream and he has said publicly that he

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,049
wants to stop all infectious diseases

44
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,000
from killing people may it be so

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,570
Colonel Matt Hepburn though I will call you Matt from now on it is my pleasure

46
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,240
to have you in the studio today it's

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
fantastic to be here and and thank you

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,530
Ivan for inviting me to be on the

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,440
podcast and to tell my story and tell

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,239
you what I care so deeply about yes so

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,920
I've been greatly looking forward to

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,209
discussion so why don't we get right

53
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,310
into it and so you're a medical

54
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,500
professional who embraces clinical and

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,810
field practice as well as leading-edge

56
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,870
research what are the origins of those

57
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,819
interests for you it started pretty

58
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,910
young I have this childhood memory of

59
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,190
being asked at my school a Catholic

60
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,690
school and that was meeting with one of

61
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,739
the priests and they said well what do

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,690
you really want to do and I said I

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,730
wanted to be a pediatrician(小儿科医师) and they

64
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,420
said why and and and I said well because

65
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,489
I just want to take care of people and I

66
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,260
want to take care of children and I do

67
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,290
think it stems from my mom was a nurse

68
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,870
and so I think less so from the

69
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,150
influence of being around someone in the

70
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,190
medical profession but more so just

71
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,299
being around someone that cares very

72
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,769
deeply about other people

73
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,930
again very early on and it but it's been

74
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,610
it's been sort of a consistent part of

75
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,790
my life yeah this was in fourth grade

76
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,709
this whole like you know I wanted to be

77
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,600
a pediatrician(小儿科医师) and so as I was on this

78
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,430
trajectory and I didn't know of course

79
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,019
what I was talking about you know I mean

80
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,850
even you make these decisions early in

81
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,310
your life but my parents and my family

82
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,070
always had this incredibly strong ethic

83
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,260
of service and very deeply and

84
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,880
fundamentally because I reflect on this

85
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,489
often actually it's like Who am I and

86
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,370
what am I supposed to be and I think

87
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,900
what I do is I serve others and that's

88
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,970
that's how I define myself maybe one of

89
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,040
the greatest gifts from my parents was

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,940
that my dad was active duty Navy officer

91
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,340
did ROTC and served as a nuclear

92
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,410
engineer on a Surface Warfare ship it

93
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,670
was active duty for five or six years

94
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,530
stayed in the Navy for another 20 plus

95
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,660
retired as a Navy captain in the

96
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,109
reserves you couple my mom's passion for

97
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,940
helping other people in the medical

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,579
field with my dad's passion of serving

99
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,440
our country this was almost like all I

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,569
knew and so that trajectory has sort of

101
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,160
guided me through all of my decisions in

102
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,540
my okay well let's actually talk a

103
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,130
little bit about that before you came to

104
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,560
DARPA you spent almost 15 years in a

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,810
variety of segments that took you to for

106
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,579
example for - deitrick the military's

107
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,040
premiere facility for infectious disease

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,728
research it took you to Korea to UK the

109
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,579
Republic of Georgia Azerbaijan Iraq

110
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,039
Thailand other places I'm sure what did

111
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,244
you learn from all of that global experience

112
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:27,720
I would start by saying what a privilege

113
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,020
what a privilege to have those types of

114
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,630
life experiences all in the context of

115
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,880
again feeling that I'm serving my

116
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,770
country and making a difference some of

117
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,720
the work that I'm most proud of frankly

118
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,640
is work I did in the caucuses with

119
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,780
Georgia and Azerbaijan and the program

120
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,310
was under the auspices(赞助) was called the

121
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,620
Cooperative Threat Reduction program but

122
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,760
really my role there was to engage their

123
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,620
public health communities and their

124
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,750
medical research communities to

125
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,300
establish that capability of finding

126
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,880
infectious diseases diagnosing them and

127
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,740
ultimately treating them and it was a

128
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,290
capability that was those public health

129
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,060
systems were all part of the Soviet

130
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,890
Union but when the Soviet Union fell

131
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,870
these countries were kind of left to

132
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,000
their own to recreate a public health

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,030
infrastructure and so the privilege was

134
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,940
to work with those experts in the host

135
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,890
country to say how do we build that back

136
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,500
up again so that you can tell us that

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,330
there's an outbreak going on and then we

138
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,310
can collectively work together to

139
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,080
respond to that outbreak right so did

140
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,000
you bring in models like the the Centers

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,130
of Disease Control here we did yes we

142
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,870
did we work closely with the embassies

143
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,220
we work closely with the State

144
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,050
Department we work closely with the CDC

145
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,350
at the end of the day it was myself and

146
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,630
some of my DoD colleagues on the ground

147
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,360
you know rolling our sleeves up helping

148
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,550
these countries develop those systems

149
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,640
developing laboratory capabilities

150
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,870
developing the ability to do clinical

151
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,030
research to ethical standards that would

152
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,710
be accepted all over the world and to

153
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,200
figure out how to do this you know again

154
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,300
I look back what a privilege to be on

155
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,790
the ground and at this point fairly

156
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,100
junior in my career and to help an

157
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,870
entire nation improve their public

158
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,450
health sound like a great privilege what

159
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,370
is the sequence of events Matt that

160
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,830
resulted in your current position here

161
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,229
at DARPA as a program manager throughout

162
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,300
my medical career I had heard about

163
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,350
DARPA and I had seen amazing technology

164
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,479
that had come from DARPA that were aimed

165
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,919
at addressing infectious diseases

166
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,249
threats so I had always admired from afar

167
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:33,390
before I joined DARPA I was over

168
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,800
at the White House National Security

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,740
Council staff and in that role my job

170
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,559
was to identify what capabilities we do

171
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,959
have to respond to pandemics and then

172
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,579
how we can organize ourselves as a

173
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,739
government not just DoD but as an entire

174
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,169
government towards addressing those gaps

175
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,319
so we're ready for the next one and

176
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,429
while I was there I got tapped on the

177
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:58,089
shoulder and the concise phrase was

178
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,179
you're doing all of this policy what we

179
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:04,059
should do as a government how would you

180
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:09,099
then like to implement and actually make

181
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,899
investments that are going to address

182
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,089
those gaps so method where you literally

183
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,969
tapped on the shoulder and so who was it

184
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,259
that proposed this to you

185
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,439
it was dr. Jeff Ling who was the deputy

186
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,159
director of DSO at the time and he we

187
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,119
met him for coffee one morning and he

188
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:29,289
didn't literally actually put his hand

189
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,589
on my shoulder but figuratively imagine

190
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:36,249
a hand on my shoulder saying Matt how

191
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,989
would you like to try at DARPA to

192
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,869
actually invest to make a difference for

193
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,159
all those things that you've been

194
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,959
talking about in terms of big policy

195
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,855
words for the last few years

196
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:49,299
well and of course he provided a model of audacity

197
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,539
because he really took on from madison

198
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,799
prosthetics(修复学) and other other programs to

199
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,539
really help the warfighter why don't we

200
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:58,329
segue(继续) then into your life as a program

201
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,589
manager here in this tremendous

202
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,049
portfolio that you've developed which is

203
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,449
I think a portfolio that also reflects

204
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:06,879
some kind of audacious point of view as

205
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,519
is of course reflected by that statement

206
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,279
earlier that you want to take the lethal

207
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,889
power out of infectious disease so the

208
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,689
names are fantastic some of them like

209
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:19,119
Prometheus and Thor dialysis like

210
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,759
therapeutics in vivo nano platforms and

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,079
we'll probably talk more about one of

212
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,969
them in particular the pandemic

213
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,159
prevention platform what I'm hoping to

214
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,989
do now is is if you could briefly take

215
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:31,839
us for a tour of your programs we can't

216
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,179
go in-depth about any of them at this

217
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,339
point but take me a little bit of a tour

218
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,719
on what's what you're hoping to achieve

219
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,429
with some of these programs and then

220
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,958
we'll focus in a little bit more on the

221
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,720
pandemic prevention platform

222
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,879
yeah so the tour starts by saying what problems are

223
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,670
we trying to solve and again at the

224
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,050
White House National Security Council

225
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,899
staff I got a chance to say look for

226
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,769
these major outbreaks pandemics or near

227
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,750
pandemics how have we done as a

228
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,029
government think about the 2009 h1n1

229
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,579
pandemic think about the West Africa

230
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,510
Ebola crisis h1n1 that is h1n1 influenza

231
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:08,709
yeah

232
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,690
influenza think about the West Africa

233
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,130
Ebola crisis think about how we've

234
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,959
recently responded to Zika there are

235
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,610
common themes throughout and some of

236
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,649
those common themes are we need to be

237
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,769
much better at diagnosing if someone has

238
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,360
an infection and we need to go a step

239
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,269
beyond that and imagine a world that if

240
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,240
we could figure out if someone is going

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,910
to be sick or is going to be contagious

242
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,430
we can intervene and stop the outbreak

243
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,779
right in its tracks and that's

244
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,430
Prometheus and that's the Prometheus

245
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,260
program but we also need to make

246
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,630
vaccines and treatments much faster than

247
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,149
we currently can and that's one of the

248
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,829
examples as the pandemic prevention

249
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:46,839
platform we need to alternate ways of

250
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,940
how we treat infections and using

251
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,550
portable dialysis(透析) to filter the blood

252
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,529
and remove any type of pathogen(病原体) is a

253
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,300
good example but that's just in that

254
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,310
case is does that mean I might I might

255
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,199
have been exposed to some kind of

256
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,269
pathogenic(致病) agent(药剂) it's in my blood and

257
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,459
certain levels so with this kind of

258
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,800
technology remove that before it could

259
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,540
take hold and actually get me sick was

260
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,310
that is that the idea of that yes and

261
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,389
the idea would be again especially for

262
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,550
pathogens where we don't have a vaccine

263
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,470
where we don't have a treatment

264
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,839
especially think about now with what

265
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,543
we're seeing so much antimicrobial(抗菌剂) resistant bacteria

266
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,329
imagine if we're we

267
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:27,670
can't use antibiotics(抗生素) so if we can

268
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,170
filter your blood and remove that

269
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,149
pathogen what if it does is ultimately

270
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,860
gives a leg up for your own immune

271
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,649
response to ultimately make you well again

272
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,290
we like that technology especially or in

273
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,779
those first days when we need to buy

274
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,880
some time to develop a vaccine and we

275
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,670
need to develop new treatments and so my

276
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,880
point across the portfolio is that we

277
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,740
have lots of investments in medical

278
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,529
diagnostics we're investing in modeling

279
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,600
to forecast where infectious diseases

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
are going to go we have investments in

281
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,290
accelerating new treatments but they're

282
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,000
all connected together they are all

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,920
linked and let me give you an example

284
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,769
with our Prometheus program predicting

285
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,340
if someone is going to become contagious

286
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,500
well awesome right if we can do that but

287
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,019
once we predict and identify that person

288
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:17,230
we still have to treat them and so we're

289
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,449
going to need treatments as fast as

290
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,879
possible with our pandemic prevention

291
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,850
platform and the beauty is is that those

292
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,709
treatments are probably going to be most

293
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,509
effective when they're given as early as

294
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:31,029
possible so I think of our whole

295
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,029
portfolio as interconnected that we

296
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,470
develop a lot of different specific

297
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,259
projects to get capabilities but that

298
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,789
they're ultimately going to intertwine(纠缠在一起)

299
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:43,217
so that we stop the outbreak in its tracks

300
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:44,649
well when I think of programs

301
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,120
here at DARPA they all have a kind of

302
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,829
lifecycle to them right I mean they they

303
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,529
sort of start as a glimmer in the eye of

304
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,420
someone like you Matt a program manager

305
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,699
there's a period of vetting and working

306
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:56,350
with others here to really articulate

307
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,959
and formulate the program as best it can

308
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,879
be so that it can be most effective and

309
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,860
then kind of smoke signals go out to the

310
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,660
world and seeking people who maybe think

311
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,129
that they can pull off some of these

312
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,139
audacious tasks that we've put out of

313
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,459
course then the research is done and

314
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,920
hopefully in the end you succeed or if

315
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,470
not fully succeed you learn from all the

316
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,819
research that that's going on

317
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,220
so what is the status in that lifecycle

318
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,870
of the pandemic

319
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,329
prevention platform the payment Demick

320
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:25,149
prevention platform just launched and so

321
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,889
and by launch those who might not know

322
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,449
what that means in the DARPA context

323
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,360
said that that means that completing the

324
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,129
contracting process so that our

325
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,589
performers that were selected in a very

326
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,319
rigorous(严密的) process can now accomplish the

327
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,899
goals of the program so they're just

328
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,089
starting in there for six months as part

329
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,329
of the lifecycle these are early days

330
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,279
early days because the ultimate goal of

331
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,040
that program is so difficult we have a

332
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,660
lot you know in some ways I feel like

333
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,339
while we have we have a long way to go

334
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,230
one of the the key points though of the

335
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,259
pandemic prevention platform is that the

336
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:02,470
goal is incredibly ambitious but there

337
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,350
is foundational scientific evidence that

338
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,809
this can be done and that foundational

339
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:10,569
scientific evidence is derived from a

340
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:13,360
previous DARPA program and that previous

341
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
Starkel in other words prove the

342
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,139
concepts ADEPT that's the ADEPT program

343
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,269
because when I looked over the program

344
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,690
it's fascinating to me because it

345
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,120
it looks like we're trying to rev up the

346
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,360
whole brilliant molecular world of

347
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,180
antibodies and so I want you to sort of

348
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,440
go through this the sequence events

349
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,583
beginning with this earlier program at depth

350
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:32,919
[GUEST] yeah

351
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,670
but walk us through some of

352
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,650
the steps because when I look antibodies

353
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,330
to wear among my favorite proteins when

354
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,890
I look at their just brilliant things

355
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,380
they just so selective and they find the

356
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,850
thing that we don't want our bodies like

357
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,790
glom any way you tell us the pieces of

358
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,546
the program

359
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:49,250
you you know Ivan I couldn't

360
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,680
agree more I think all of us that are

361
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,810
fascinated by new yeah yeah DARPA right

362
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,970
that's probably a common theme is we are

363
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,550
just amazed by the natural world and

364
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,960
what the natural world has developed

365
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,660
antibodies are a great example I mean

366
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,960
there are millions and millions of these

367
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,400
different versions of antibodies

368
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,870
circulating through your body at all

369
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,350
times and the mechanisms are so refined

370
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,250
and intricate(错综复杂的) to select ok which are the

371
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,380
antibodies that are most protective when

372
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,480
you're exposed to an infection and your

373
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,740
body goes through the process of them

374
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,480
making a lot of those in a short period

375
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,900
of time

376
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,020
I think it's mind-boggling(令人惊异) how advanced

377
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,660
that system is we've learned so much

378
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,400
about antibodies in the last 50 years

379
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,680
you're absolutely right we want to

380
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,990
leverage all of that information that we

381
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,310
know how they work now and we know how

382
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,320
they know about their structure we know

383
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,300
how to make them in big vats(多样性) and why

384
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,250
can't we use that and you're seeing

385
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,530
incredible progress in medicine where we

386
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,850
are using that where you're seeing

387
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,180
antibodies approved as products now for

388
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,000
cancer treatment for treating autoimmune(自体免疫)

389
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,370
disease or the category biologicals in

390
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,410
the in the category of biologicals a

391
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,720
massive explosion in that space and we

392
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,820
want to use all of that knowledge and

393
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,010
that technology to solve infectious

394
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,350
diseases problems what we do at DARPA

395
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,120
though is the fun part is we couple

396
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,700
different fields together and so as you

397
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,200
have correctly pointed out this

398
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,330
extraordinarily powerful tool of

399
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,730
antibody engineering but can we couple

400
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,980
that with the the revolution that we've

401
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,100
seen in in genetics and that's that's

402
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,080
DARPA right it's taking two different

403
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,170
areas seeing if we can mix them together

404
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,410
again

405
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,420
an antibody specialist might not think

406
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,150
about the opportunities with genetics

407
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,890
the genetic specialist might not think

408
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,430
well

409
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,339
wonder if I couldn't use my use genetic

410
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,110
engineering to make an antibody you

411
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,850
bring the two fields together in a mold(模具)

412
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,730
you know by our our magic of bringing

413
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,649
them the disciplines(学科) together we achieve

414
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,529
that effect and so the proof of concept

415
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:51,800
which I find exhilarating(令人振奋的) it's and

416
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,130
chills up and down my spine is that we

417
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,060
can give you a piece of DNA or a piece

418
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,870
of RNA and we can put that into your

419
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,180
muscle cells and that your muscle cells

420
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,980
say okay got it

421
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,709
I am going to make this antibody that is

422
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,140
so protective that someone's not going

423
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,699
to get that's encoded by these nucleic acids (核酸)

424
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,520
the RNA tells that muscle

425
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,290
cell so the muscles I was doing what a

426
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,690
muscle cell does but once that RNA gets

427
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,580
inside that muscle cell the muscle cell

428
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,490
says right I'm gonna make a protective

429
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,870
antibody that's gonna protect you from

430
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,330
Ebola and to do that in a fairly short

431
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,750
period of time and that idea would sound

432
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,700
crazy ten years ago too many obstacles

433
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,649
can't be done the foundational

434
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,370
investment from DARPA proved that

435
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,260
concept in many different animal models

436
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,450
for many different infections but

437
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,130
because we're DARPA we said well great

438
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,050
we prove the concept that wasn't good

439
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,610
enough it wasn't good enough for me and

440
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,990
it wasn't good enough for the DARPA

441
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,900
leadership DARPA leadership said okay

442
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,490
that's great but we need to birth the

443
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,970
baby if we're going to take pandemics

444
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,520
off the table and that's that's why I'm

445
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,459
here we need to be able to put this

446
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,630
together as a platform that can go start

447
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,599
to finish from once a pathogen is

448
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,939
identified to making thousands of doses

449
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:19,069
of this miraculous(不可思议的) antibody based

450
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,380
antibody based treatment in an

451
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,359
incredibly short period of time right

452
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,859
and let's let's talk about the timescale

453
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,970
for a minute because that's part of the

454
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,040
big deal here right what I've seen is

455
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,800
within 60 days of identifying the the

456
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,110
pathogenic agent to actually have these

457
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,150
doses right in hand and in a

458
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,800
distributable form is that correct

459
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,390
that's correct right that compares to

460
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,640
what - what's the state of the art today

461
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,919
the state of the art today depends on

462
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,410
infections but let's use some some

463
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,510
recent examples we currently have some

464
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,840
Zeke(寨卡)

465
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,299
vaccines in clinical trials but we've

466
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:53,419
been working now for a few years and we

467
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,809
don't have a license to use Zeke vaccine

468
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,429
you think about our [..] when we talk

469
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,110
about gaps you think about all of these

470
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,360
recent outbreaks and one of the

471
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,250
fundamental lessons is that we haven't

472
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,990
had vaccines and treatments that are

473
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,700
ready in time and we came up the the 60

474
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,770
day goal has been controversial when we

475
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,789
talk about audacity you know I have

476
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,770
professional colleagues who laugh at me

477
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,940
I've been on I've been on panels(圆桌论坛) where

478
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,860
where I you know discuss the program and

479
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,899
the other panelists joined with the

480
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:32,210
audience at laughing at me so I knew we

481
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,830
were in the right space the

482
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,899
counter-argument that I continually make

483
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:39,470
to the critics(批评家) is 60 days is dictated(提出) by

484
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,070
what we need to respond to pandemics so

485
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,140
if you don't agree that our approach is

486
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,299
the right way then come up with an

487
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,250
alternative because we can't negotiate

488
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,500
with Mother Nature and say well we'd

489
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,000
like another six months if you don't

490
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,360
mind especially when you think about the

491
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,090
catastrophic consequences accordingly so

492
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,640
you know we have to be we have to do

493
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,799
this within 60 days and I think again

494
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,750
I'm profoundly excited because I think

495
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,149
we found a way to do it so I want to try

496
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:09,590
to make this concrete for our listeners

497
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,750
which you've actually done fairly well

498
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,980
just now what I thought of another way

499
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,710
we might do this and that's by combining

500
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,130
you know kind of almost the the gaming

501
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,299
out to the future where let's say you

502
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,580
are successful and may you be successful

503
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,700
with this p3 program the the pen jet

504
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,710
pandemic prevention platform program

505
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,260
let's say that you had that p3 ability

506
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,770
back in the 1918 Spanish flu which I've

507
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,419
seen different numbers I've heard 50

508
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:41,110
million people people died during that

509
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,510
pandemic if this technology existed back

510
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,940
in the early part of the last century

511
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,610
how would that have unfolded do you

512
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,080
think well my hope is that 50 million

513
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,649
people don't die that we and again part

514
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,650
of this is you detect that we have a new virus

515
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,100
or a new version of influenza and we

516
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,200
detect very early on in the process when

517
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,580
it's first starting out in a given

518
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,010
country that it's that that it's

519
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,010
happening we flip the switch and we say

520
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,990
for that new virus we need $20,000 that

521
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,600
have to be ready within 60 days and then

522
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,430
we go to win that outbreak is first

523
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,300
starting we identify who's sick we treat

524
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,730
those people that are most likely to be

525
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,040
contagious and we stop the outbreak in

526
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,050
its tracks if we add it we could have

527
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,090
stopped the Spanish flu I think even

528
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,150
more importantly right now today you and

529
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,550
I both know people who are getting very

530
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,710
sick with influenza we're seeing a

531
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,610
severe season and we're seeing

532
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,520
unfortunately children die we're seeing

533
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,860
unfortunately otherwise completely

534
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,450
healthy people having you know being

535
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,480
hospitalized and influenza does that to

536
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,820
us every year we imagine a world where

537
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,820
this platform could be used to take

538
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,150
seasonal influenza off the table as well

539
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,280
an amazing thought because I mean this

540
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,470
gets back to you to them several times

541
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,630
you said what a privilege it is to do

542
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,550
what you're doing because if you succeed

543
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,710
you will know I know you won't take this

544
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,960
it's not pumping you up personally it's

545
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,270
it's more for what it's doing for you

546
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,310
know kind of humanity but you will know

547
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,140
you've had a part in potentially saving

548
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,730
millions of people's lives by cutting

549
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,690
these pandemic experiences off before

550
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,500
they really get going and spread so a

551
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,270
really quite an amazing yeah and I would

552
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,300
make two points the first is that DARPA

553
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,930
my team does not do this alone

554
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,280
DARPA does not do this alone we we work

555
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,310
incredibly closely with our colleagues

556
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,140
and Health and Human Services with other

557
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,910
experts in the Department of Defense in

558
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,890
the US government as well as

559
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,530
philanthropy(慈善事业) as well as the private

560
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,940
sector and as well as the global

561
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,030
community it's ultimately a global

562
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,730
teamwork that's going to take these

563
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,890
infectious diseases off the table but

564
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,350
make no mistake we can say it sounds

565
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,880
hard and it's ambitious and it's crazy

566
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,119
but I challenge you to say why not

567
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,009
you know why aren't we as a society

568
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,519
putting incredible even more effort into

569
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,349
taking these infectious diseases off the

570
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,699
table if we have the if we have the

571
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:24,649
scientific know-how to do so this is

572
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:26,329
what I think one should be focusing it's

573
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:29,209
a moonshot but why not go for a moonshot

574
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:31,719
and why not go for a moonshot for

575
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:34,669
against something that could kill

576
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:36,799
another 50 million people why not take a

577
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,039
moonshot against infectious diseases

578
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,319
like malaria and tuberculosis(肺结核) I mean

579
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,449
we've seen you know there's there's

580
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,309
effort in there there's global effort

581
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:48,876
that's absolutely tremendous but why not more

582
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:50,869
so Matt just a little while ago you

583
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,669
and I were kind of gushing(滔滔不绝) about the

584
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,499
molecular beauty in the biological

585
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,149
beauty of antibodies and the

586
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:58,909
specificities those have to go out and

587
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:01,459
find whatever the health threatening

588
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,069
agent might be and kind of and the role

589
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:06,739
that plays in our own bodies fight

590
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:11,599
against health compromising exposures so

591
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,749
I guess I kind of want to ask you do you

592
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:17,719
have a favorite infectious disease in

593
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:20,059
the sense that you admire what the

594
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:23,539
bacterium(细菌,单数) or what the virus does and has

595
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,009
learned how to do over the course of

596
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,146
evolution?

597
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:28,939
so I'll answer in a slightly

598
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:34,279
different way I think it's a when when

599
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,929
when we say we want to take infectious

600
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,659
diseases off the table in some ways it's

601
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:40,639
or it's ridiculous because we're always

602
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:43,479
gonna have we're always going to have

603
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:46,369
viruses and bacteria that are part of

604
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:51,169
the natural world and we and we've

605
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:53,059
always seen them as the enemy or it's

606
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,599
pathogens is the word that we use one of

607
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,279
the interesting ways to think about the

608
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,659
problem though is that a part of it is

609
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:04,369
that there are a pathogen but part of it

610
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:09,109
is how we respond and modulating how our

611
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:11,599
own body responds to pathogens is a

612
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,249
major theme of what we're trying to do

613
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:15,229
with antibodies being one of many

614
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:17,779
examples and so you know one of the

615
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,059
traditional attitudes of antibiotics is

616
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,769
you know antibiotics that have been

617
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:23,329
wonderful and certainly profoundly

618
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,579
impactful in terms of our society as

619
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,270
we've as we've come along but we've also discovered

620
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,190
the unintended consequences of giving a

621
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,020
broad-spectrum antibiotic incurring(招致) my

622
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,540
antimicrobial(抗菌) resistance and things like

623
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,540
that as well so the the world that I

624
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,679
imagine is that there is I guess like

625
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,540
you said before an appreciation of

626
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,610
pathogens an appreciation of viruses and

627
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,309
bacteria understanding what they do and

628
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,830
what they don't do and it's not always

629
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,440
wiping them out but more about rendering

630
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,360
them harmless or figuring out ways to

631
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,120
kind of coexist with them is where I

632
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,470
would like our thinking to go in the

633
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,127
21st century.

634
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:01,240
it makes a lot of sense

635
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,220
gonna I heard statistics about the

636
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,679
number of mammalian(哺乳动物的) cells in me and you

637
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,510
and the number of bacterial cells and

638
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,090
there's we're almost from just a numbers

639
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,040
perspective way more bacterial than we

640
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,040
are mammalian we are but they're most of

641
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,600
the time this is this is a symbiosis(共生)

642
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,130
this is this is a mutually beneficial

643
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,090
relationship and so it really we

644
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,860
shouldn't always think about these these

645
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,370
microbes(微生物) as things to consider them

646
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,690
enemies we shouldn't consider them that's

647
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,309
right that's right and the other part is

648
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:32,710
that we learn from them you know it's

649
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,830
it's their evolution that also kind of

650
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,800
inspires us and so it's a that in some

651
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,480
ways there are adversary but in some

652
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,390
ways they're sort of that you know in

653
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,040
the superhero novels and things like

654
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,679
that this idea of the the the balance

655
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,630
between the hero and the villain(反派) and

656
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,820
sort of that strange relationship that

657
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,950
often and develops between the two and

658
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,929
if you will mutual appreciation is that

659
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,417
I think that's awesome pathogens

660
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:58,870
so Matt

661
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,760
we're coming toward the end of our time

662
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,990
here but I'm just wondering if there is

663
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,610
something that didn't come up during our

664
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,740
discussion that you think would be of

665
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,559
interest to our listeners given you know

666
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,550
your goal here of perhaps ridding us of

667
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,620
some of some of the concerns we have

668
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,500
about the pathogens in our environment

669
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,630
yeah one of our mantras at DARPA is this

670
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,230
idea of inspiring inspiring creativity

671
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,450
and new solutions to problems and

672
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,200
oftentimes we say by sort of recruiting

673
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,730
in people who have not traditionally

674
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,270
thought about our problems to help us

675
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,090
with those solutions and so you know I

676
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,950
would love for the listeners

677
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,580
this podcast to be more inspired to

678
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,370
address the problems and Infectious

679
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,279
Diseases and what I mean by that is I

680
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,010
always say people like me have to you

681
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,409
know we've invested our entire careers

682
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:58,330
and our life work into this and we have

683
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,690
deep knowledge of the subject but I love

684
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,399
the thought of people that have

685
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,860
expertise in computer science in

686
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,460
mathematics in what we would say well

687
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,990
maybe those fields aren't necessarily

688
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,659
obviously related that's who I think

689
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:15,850
that's how we're gonna solve the

690
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,740
infectious diseases problems of the 21st

691
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,690
century and so when I speak on this it's

692
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,029
almost part it's one part recruiting and

693
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:24,340
it's especially recruiting those that

694
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,070
may not have all of the biases of the

695
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,809
traditional experts in infectious

696
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,730
disease to come up with a creative

697
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,779
solution to solve it so that makes me

698
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,480
think of a term that we hear a lot here

699
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,279
at DARPA you know the innovation

700
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,529
ecosystem because you just mentioned a

701
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,240
whole bunch of disciplines that you know

702
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,399
maybe on first when you first think

703
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,929
about infectious disease you might not

704
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,970
think some of those come together so it

705
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,340
is there something about you and being

706
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,570
here at DARPA that is conducive to

707
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,100
shaking up that innovation ecosystem in

708
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,659
ways that could maybe move toward the

709
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:01,299
goals that you have well DARPA enables

710
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,019
me to do that because again they are our

711
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,419
program announcements when we say okay

712
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,370
we set the requirements solve this

713
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,309
problem make us a treatment in 60 days

714
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:14,830
we know that they can't do that alone

715
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,230
and it takes a multidisciplinary(多学科) team so

716
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,690
if if you want funding from DARPA you're

717
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,340
gonna have to work with people you're

718
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,019
gonna have to recruit it we design it so

719
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,519
that you will have to recruit in people

720
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,260
that may not be the traditional subject

721
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,740
matter experts but furthermore every

722
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,049
time I get a chance to speak and to talk

723
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:35,679
about this problem like on this podcast

724
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,320
you know again I see it as a recruiting

725
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,840
as a recruiting tool to inspire those to

726
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,100
help us address these infectious

727
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,350
diseases threats well what I'm realizing

728
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,840
now is I do not want to prevent you for

729
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,909
another minute going out there and

730
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:54,519
realizing your goal of taking the

731
