* INTRO

EDL	00:00:11,640	00:00:32,227	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Stealth technology, the Internet,GPS in the column of your hand alternative operation technologies, a driver of our, since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, doubt that offended that research project agency has been a driver of technology.
EDL	00:00:32,227	00:00:36,750	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Welcome to voices a window entitled with core of program managers.
EDL	00:00:36,750	00:00:39,530	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Their job to redefine was possible.

EDL	00:00:40,790	00:00:45,990	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	My name is Tyler McQuade since 2013, I've been a program manager in DARPA's.
EDL	00:00:45,990	00:00:48,950	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Defence Sciences' Office, and I'm your DARPA host.

EDL	00:00:51,050	00:00:56,381	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Tyler, I'd like to start out, which is sort of learning a little bit about you as a program manager.
EDL	00:00:56,381	00:01:03,292	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So maybe you could tell us something about your background and how that relates to the kinds of programs you've been developing.

EDL	00:01:03,292	00:01:13,560	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ivan, I've been a molecular guy, I love molecules I have since I was in high school and even beyond high schools are earlier.
EDL	00:01:13,560	00:01:16,200	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you know, I'm a sort of a, nova junky.
EDL	00:01:16,200	00:01:19,560	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Cosmos, billions and billions of stars.
EDL	00:01:19,560	00:01:23,481	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Well,I was more interested in the billions of molecules. 
EDL	00:01:23,481	00:01:31,531	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I've always wanted to be an explorer, but the time I got the age, yeah,I might explore something all the year charted.
EDL	00:01:31,531	00:01:35,395	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	the lands that have been charted, and there were no more uncharted land.

EDL	00:01:35,395	00:01:38,122	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So I looked at kind of frontiers that 
EDL	00:01:38,122	00:01:43,203	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	you couldn't see and molecules fit that look more defined in physics, 
EDL	00:01:43,203	00:01:49,890	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	'cause you can put it in a bottle all at times, especially in the area that I am very comfortable in organic synthesis.
EDL	00:01:50,210	00:01:52,300	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You can make stuff and see it.

EDL	00:01:52,300	00:01:57,940	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You can test the properties, and you can play with the combination of items that are together.
EDL	00:01:57,940	00:01:59,430	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And in really, it was sort of, 
EDL	00:01:59,430	00:02:01,490	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	This palette that I could play with.
EDL	00:02:01,490	00:02:02,800	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I really like that.

EDL	00:02:02,800	00:02:06,331	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It was exploring the world in a totally different way, 


EDL	00:02:06,331	00:02:20,460	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	always been amazed that how just putting together items and certain geometries, certain bonding patterns and can come together in two materials with all kinds of different properties in a skin and bone at the crazy rate.

EDL	00:02:20,460	00:02:33,940	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I mean, you go from having something they can buy to something that explodes to something that makes beautiful colors to something that makes your cookie smell great and taste great events, all chemistry



EDL	00:02:33,940	00:02:41,210	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You're a molecules guy, yeah. They're actually not that many molecules people, like you at DARPA, which is interesting.
EDL	00:02:41,210	00:02:47,542	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So as a wrap of this minority, how are you taking that interesting in the form of programs 

EDL	00:02:47,542	00:02:56,678	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	in the defense scientist office, one of the things that is going on right now, one of the ziggy's is revolutionizing science.
EDL	00:02:56,678	00:03:08,873	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	science but faster, better. and one of the things that is interesting about chemistry, especially when we're talking about the makers, the people who make materials, make small molecules, make medicines.
EDL	00:03:08,873	00:03:10,741	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It is , uh, really slow process.

EDL	00:03:10,741	00:03:16,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I really like the idea of reinventing science, and in chemistry, there is a lot of opportunity to reinvent the science.

* Question

EDL	00:03:16,870	00:03:25,240	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So let me just ask, when you say we inventing science, maybe you mean the actual process that we were asking questions that we were trying to answer those questions.
EDL	00:03:25,240	00:03:28,333	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can you be a little more detailed about, what would you have in mind?

EDL	00:03:28,333	00:03:30,152	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Men, chemistry is a tough subject.
EDL	00:03:30,152	00:03:46,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	We have lots of parameters that we don't often know how are controlling them, but if we did all of the chemistry in much more controlled environment, where the environment was being monitored, we might come up with much, much more reproducible chemistry, which will then mean it can be transportation.

EDL	00:03:46,920	00:04:00,030	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So in other words, if I have a machine that is doing the chemical reaction, recording how it does the net code that record can be sent from one love to another, so you could accelerate the same way to the end.
EDL	00:04:00,030	00:04:05,999	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Internet allows you to accelerate how information was transport, what if you could do that with molecules.

* programs

EDL	00:04:05,999	00:04:15,830	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Tyler, this might be a good time to talk a little bit about the two of the programs that you're working on, and what I have in mind is the full effect program, and they Make-It program.

** Fold effects

---	00:04:15,830	00:04:37,840	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So why don't we start with fold effect, full effects, that's a program, it stands for a full, did non natural with biological function in the photo, fact, program were making polymers that meet natural polymers so that we might biotherapeutics moral bust.
EDL	00:04:37,840	00:04:47,451	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So right now, if you get one of the more modern drugs right now, a good portion of them are made from proteins, and some people like it,I entire bodies.
EDL	00:04:47,451	00:04:53,125	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So, for example, humana or installing those are examples of protein biotherapeutics.
EDL	00:04:53,125	00:04:55,488	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The problems they are not heat stable.
EDL	00:04:55,488	00:05:00,471	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And if something is in heat stable, it's not going to end up in a except.
EDL	00:05:00,471	00:05:04,240	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So our soldiers are a very place, rather than to be most.
EDL	00:05:04,240	00:05:22,656	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Bono's boomer don't have access to the most banks, medicines, as many of them are just gradual, and so we have to transport them back to an environment where you have refrigerators, you have a handling equipment that can allow you to control that the environment around the medicine.
EDL	00:05:22,656	00:05:24,953	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What if you want to make an unnatural? 
EDL	00:05:24,953	00:05:32,761	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	There are lots of natural fibers that we used to use, and we've replaced them with non natural fivers, because they're more robust.
EDL	00:05:32,761	00:05:34,430	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Do you mean like silk to? 
EDL	00:05:34,430	00:05:36,387	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So what if he wanted to take the same? 
EDL	00:05:36,387	00:05:44,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So the beneficial properties are yet from plastics, and you were emerging with the beneficial properties of the biological balloons, like proteins in DNA.
EDL	00:05:44,870	00:05:47,000	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The full effect program that is a platform.
EDL	00:05:47,000	00:05:50,150	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It's about how we make those in and how we discover them.
EDL	00:05:50,570	00:06:17,190	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So in a way, if you think about all of the possible molecules that one could make the small ones, you know, like, like an aspirin or the below larger ones like these protein based medicines you're talking about, they're really sort of being infinitive to possibilities, like an infinite space that you could possibly search an example which you say here is your trying to develop some tools, even just a few people took to go explore some of the regions of this influenced space.
EDL	00:06:17,190	00:06:18,980	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	They just have not been looked at before.
EDL	00:06:18,980	00:06:20,620	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm getting on my own track.
---	00:06:20,620	00:06:21,780	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Oh, you're so on track.
EDL	00:06:21,780	00:06:24,260	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It gets back to my whole desire to explore that.
EDL	00:06:24,260	00:06:33,543	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I talked about, you know, but it is really about giving researchers a capability to be able to explore these, these universes.
EDL	00:06:33,543	00:06:39,690	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It's almost like a hubble telescope for this particular galaxy or universal regular space.
EDL	00:06:40,460	00:06:41,830	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So that was full of effects.
EDL	00:06:41,830	00:06:44,570	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Young, I'm also interested in the makeup program.
---	00:06:44,570	00:06:50,300	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can you say little bit about what you're doing there Make-It is a platform technology for making small.
---	00:06:50,900	00:06:56,390	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And in this particular case, we're trying to do is we're trying to democratize chemistry.
EDL	00:06:56,390	00:07:22,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So what if you could have a system that biologists or any scientists came up and type, and the machine figured out how to Make-It, even if there was no recipe available so that the machine would figure out a possible set of ways to make something, and then we'll go about testing each one of those ways and tell it on the solution, and it would log that solution in a cloud or in its data bank.
---	00:07:23,050	00:07:25,810	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And now that molecule could be made any time.
EDL	00:07:25,810	00:07:33,000	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	In addition, the system would also be able to have to make more of so that initially,I would do really small scale sympathies.
EDL	00:07:33,000	00:07:34,380	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That means milligrams.
EDL	00:07:34,380	00:07:38,820	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And then once it figured out a solution, it would also automatically scale it up.
EDL	00:07:38,820	00:07:41,960	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can you offer to us a concrete example? 
EDL	00:07:41,960	00:07:48,490	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	maybe you could think of a, problem or a particular receptor for example on a cell that you might want as a target
EDL	00:07:49,230	00:07:58,870	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Then explain how... The Make-It Framework would go about Interacting with that The receptor in prep solving a medical or other biological problem

** RESPONSE

EDL	00:07:59,490	00:08:07,610	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah, you know, for example, one very popular target for the heart disease is PCSKnine.
EDL	00:08:07,610	00:08:11,410	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And so there's probably many papers that come out every year.
EDL	00:08:11,410	00:08:16,122	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	They describe inhibitors that have been discovered against that target.
EDL	00:08:16,122	00:08:18,123	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The structures are available.

EDL	00:08:18,123	00:08:28,740	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Let's say that I am a researcher, and I want to study some aspect of a complex soil system and having access to the PC inhibitor would be really useful.
EDL	00:08:29,130	00:08:39,700	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But maybe I wanted one selective in a certain way that is commercially available, but somebody is reported now,I might contact that researcher who is made it before.
EDL	00:08:39,700	00:08:42,490	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Maybe they ran out, and it can take them three months to Make-It.

EDL	00:08:43,110	00:08:45,575	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But if I have access to Make-It device,
EDL	00:08:45,575	00:08:52,340	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I could just go type in the structure and have the material, maybe the next day, or at the end of the week.
EDL	00:08:52,750	00:08:55,580	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And in addition to that, I have it memorized.
EDL	00:08:55,580	00:09:03,107	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The machine has kept that in his memory banks, university environment, for example, wants to make that they 
EDL	00:09:03,107	00:09:18,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	typed it in a little bit out that day, because the solution would be, it's a way of saying chemistry has been documented since its inception, especially synthetic chemistry, through what are called experimental.
EDL	00:09:18,600	00:09:23,760	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	These are documents that the researcher is using to try to capture what they didn't.
EDL	00:09:23,760	00:09:26,560	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	A laboratory to make something, writing it down like a recipe

EDL	00:09:27,190	00:09:34,330	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So a lot of times will leave out that we think are not necessary, but are necessary.
EDL	00:09:34,330	00:09:36,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And sometimes we didn't even know there were necessary.
EDL	00:09:36,600	00:09:44,890	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So when another researcher comes in and try to read that cookbook like a experimental, it might take the month to reproduce it, and it may never.
EDL	00:09:45,250	00:09:55,760	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Why should we waste our human effort by not making sure that we document that outcome, that experiment in a way that can guarantee production.
EDL	00:09:55,760	00:10:00,030	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So you're talking about capturing procedural knowledge.

* Make-It system

EDL	00:10:00,030	00:10:09,040	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Correct, yes, the Make-It system is not just the artificial intelligence system or a cloud system that's archiving.
EDL	00:10:09,040	00:10:14,896	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It's a machine that's doing the chemistry so that the machine will be reproducible.
EDL	00:10:14,896	00:10:31,118	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You'll be able to recreate that machine in any lab you want, as long as you replicate that machine faithfully(如实地), and it runs the routines that you recorded one lab versus another faithfully, you're going to reproduce chemistry everywhere you want to 

EDL	00:10:31,118	00:10:41,760	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	one of the things that I find fascinating about DARPA, is that it is perhaps, in its place in the overall technology development ecosystem.
EDL	00:10:42,260	00:10:47,840	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And as a program manager and someone who has been an academy,I think, also an industry.
EDL	00:10:47,840	00:10:58,625	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And now here at DARPA, can you talk to us a little bit about how DARPA might be playing some interesting or perhaps even unique roles in the overall technology ecosystem.

EDL	00:10:58,625	00:11:01,950	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And yeah, it is a very exciting role.
EDL	00:11:02,840	00:11:12,110	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	DARPA is that one place where we are thinking about innovation unconstraint(无拘无束), like, where can we go? 
EDL	00:11:12,790	00:11:17,370	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	in my mind, the way remember doing that is because it fits our mission space.

* create or prevent surprise

EDL	00:11:17,370	00:11:25,435	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	If you want to create or prevent surprise, it's best to get to that new universe of chemistry sooner rather than later.
EDL	00:11:25,435	00:11:30,929	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And so we take innovations from all of the other funding agencies in other words
EDL	00:11:30,929	00:11:37,508	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	they're seeding it, and we look for one wave with the beginning, and we pushed hard and let it across fast
EDL	00:11:37,508	00:11:55,790	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	DARPA is critical because we are structuring what I consider to be that crescendo(渐强) investment, as we are trending towards something amazing, and the Internet is an example, and I am really emulating that with, Make-It.
---	00:11:55,790	00:11:58,580	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I want to create the Internet of molecules.
---	00:11:59,030	00:12:05,650	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	How do you change for molecules from one place to another in the same way is a 3D printing concept? 
---	00:12:05,650	00:12:06,940	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You have a design.
---	00:12:06,940	00:12:08,460	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You could put that design on a cloud.
---	00:12:08,460	00:12:12,410	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And then if you have 3D printer, you could transfer that design from one place to.
---	00:12:13,340	00:12:14,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So they are related.
EDL	00:12:14,640	00:12:19,040	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And I have been no, constantly inspired by what dark has done.
EDL	00:12:19,690	00:12:31,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Is there a question, tyler, that you wish I had asked you during the discussion that I didn't, even so ask the question yourself and answer, what's my favorite aspect of chemistry? 
EDL	00:12:32,150	00:12:35,727	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The answer for most cameras?  What, what's the answer for? 
EDL	00:12:35,727	00:12:42,627	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Most cabinet cameras dive, and you know,I love that the structure of molecule relates to the function.
EDL	00:12:42,627	00:12:43,680	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Now I love them.
EDL	00:12:43,680	00:12:47,020	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah, most of my friends media is for the crowd magnets, I guess

EDL	00:12:47,020	00:13:11,790	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	everybody likes explosions, but I actually like the smell of organic chemistry, so pretty much amongst all actors like people going to like one flavors are thinking of, maybe it omit chocolate cheap, but actually smelling all of the esters and wondering,I wonder if that's disaster, or that I strength and tell the fluctuations, and also an astronaut refers to a particular chemical motive.
EDL	00:13:11,790	00:13:14,260	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	If I recall of my own organization must be part of it.
EDL	00:13:14,260	00:13:24,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	There's a carbon with the oxygen job, abandon a few other things we don't have to go into the details, except to say that is a particular kind of molecular motivated and variations.
EDL	00:13:24,600	00:13:26,130	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah, classic compounds.

EDL	00:13:26,130	00:13:36,720	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So I,Ireally like the class of compounds that are associated with flavourings, and I don't mean just not a natural flavorings and natural unnaturally a coconut.
EDL	00:13:37,310	00:13:42,970	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It smells the way it does because of chemistry, and that that always just really makes me excited.

* Outro

EDL	00:13:43,290	00:13:48,780	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So Tyler, I really enjoyed talking with you today about the your programs by chemistry, by dark.
EDL	00:13:48,780	00:13:50,180	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So thanks for being here. 
---	00:13:50,180	00:13:59,930	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ivan, it's always a pleasure to be with you, and thanks for having me and really glad to relate my thoughts about chemistry and and thank you listeners for sharing this time with us.
---	00:14:00,820	00:14:03,390	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Tony, next time for another voice from double.
