EDL	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,191	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Chemistry has been documented
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:15,263	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Since its Inception especially some type of synthetic chemistry
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,287	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Through
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,335	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What are called experimentals


EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,407	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	These are documents that the researcher is
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:24,192	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Using to try to capture what they did in the laboratory 
EDL	00:09:24,192	00:09:26,271	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	make something to writing it down like a recipe
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So a lot of times we'll leave out details
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:32,415	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That we think are not necessary
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,951	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But are necessary
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:37,182	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And sometimes we didn't even know they were necessary so when 
EDL	00:09:37,182	00:09:40,351	| VfD E01 Molecule Mand tries to read that cookbook like it

EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:27,296	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	Sure so a while ago actually started as a photography major
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:28,832	| Episode 02 Space Sentinel |	At the University Michigan

EDL	00:02:56,678	00:03:08,873	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	science but faster, better. and one of the things that is interesting about chemistry, especially when we're talking about the makers, the people who make materials, make small molecules, make medicines.

EDL	00:04:15,830	00:04:37,840	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So why don't we start with fold effect, full effects, that's a program, it stands for a full, did non natural with biological function in the photo, fact, program were making polymers that meet natural polymers so that we might biotherapeutics moral bust.





EDL	00:06:20,620	00:06:21,780	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Oh, you're so on track.
EDL	00:06:44,570	00:06:46,432	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can you say little bit about what you're doing there 
EDL	00:06:46,432	00:06:56,390	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Make-It is a platform technology for making small. And in this particular case, we're trying to do is we're trying to democratize chemistry.
EDL	00:07:23,050	00:07:25,810	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And now that molecule could be made any time.
EDL	00:11:55,790	00:12:05,650	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I want to create the Internet of molecules. How do you change for molecules from one place to another in the same way is a 3D printing concept? 

EDL	00:12:05,650	00:12:08,460	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You have a design. You could put that design on a cloud.
EDL	00:12:08,460	00:12:12,410	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And then if you have 3D printer, you could transfer that design from one place to.
EDL	00:12:13,340	00:12:14,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So they are related.
EDL	00:13:50,180	00:14:03,390	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ivan, it's always a pleasure to be with you, and thanks for having me and really glad to relate my thoughts about chemistry and and thank you listeners for sharing this time with us. Tune in next time for another voice from double.
