EDL	00:00:30,720	00:00:31,488	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Welcome to
EDL	00:00:31,744	00:00:32,768	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Voices from DARPA
EDL	00:00:33,792	00:00:36,096	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	A window into DARPA's core of program manager
EDL	00:00:36,864	00:00:37,376	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Their job
EDL	00:00:38,144	00:00:40,704	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	To redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:40,704	00:00:41,984	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	My name is Tyler McQuade
EDL	00:00:42,496	00:00:46,592	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Since 2013 I've been a program manager and DARPA's defense science
EDL	00:00:46,848	00:00:47,360	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	's office
EDL	00:00:47,616	00:00:48,896	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And I'm your DARPA host
EDL	00:00:49,408	00:00:49,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ivan Amato
EDL	00:00:51,456	00:00:52,224	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Tyler I'd like to
EDL	00:00:52,480	00:00:52,992	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Start out with
EDL	00:00:53,504	00:00:54,784	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Learning a little bit about you as a PM
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:56,832	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So maybe you could tell us
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,880	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Something about your background and
EDL	00:00:59,136	00:00:59,904	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	How that relates to
EDL	00:01:00,160	00:01:00,928	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The kinds of programs
EDL	00:01:01,184	00:01:01,696	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You've been
EDL	00:01:01,952	00:01:02,720	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Developing and pursuing.
EDL	00:01:04,512	00:01:06,048	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I've been on the molecular
EDL	00:01:06,560	00:01:07,072	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I love molecules
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:09,632	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I have since I was in high school
EDL	00:01:10,656	00:01:11,680	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And even Beyond
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:12,960	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	High School too early
EDL	00:01:13,984	00:01:15,776	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm a Survivor Nova Junkie
EDL	00:01:16,800	00:01:17,312	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Cosmos
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:21,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Billions and billions of stars while I was more interested in the billions and billions of moloch
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:24,480	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I've always wanted to be in
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:25,248	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Explorer
EDL	00:01:25,760	00:01:26,528	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	By the time I
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:27,296	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Got to the edge
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yo I might explore some
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:30,880	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Aldi
EDL	00:01:31,136	00:01:31,904	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Charted land
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:34,208	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Charted and there were no more Uncharted
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:35,488	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,536	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I looked kind of Frontiers that
EDL	00:01:38,560	00:01:39,072	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You couldn't see
EDL	00:01:39,840	00:01:40,864	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And molecules fit
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,168	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Little more defined in physics
EDL	00:01:43,424	00:01:45,216	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Cuz you can put it in a bottle a lot of times
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,496	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Especially in the area of
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:48,032	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Berri Conker
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:49,312	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Organic Center
EDL	00:01:50,336	00:01:50,848	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You can make
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,128	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Stuff and see it.
EDL	00:01:52,896	00:01:53,664	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	 the properties
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:55,200	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You can play with
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:57,760	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The combination of atoms that are together
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:01:58,784	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Really it
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:01:59,552	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Was sort of this
EDL	00:02:00,064	00:02:00,576	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Pallet that I can play with
EDL	00:02:01,856	00:02:02,368	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I really like that
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:04,160	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Or in the world

* INTRO - Ivan
EDL	00:02:06,720	00:02:08,512	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Always been amazed at how
EDL	00:02:08,768	00:02:09,280	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	YouTube
EDL	00:02:09,536	00:02:10,816	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Just putting together atoms and
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:12,864	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Certain geometry certain bonding
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:15,680	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can come together into materials
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:16,448	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	With all kinds of
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,472	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Different properties
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:18,752	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Skin
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:21,056	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I mean
EDL	00:02:21,312	00:02:22,080	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Hugo from
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,384	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Having something that can form life
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:25,664	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	To something that is
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:26,432	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Explodes
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:27,712	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Do something to make
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:30,016	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It's beautiful colors to something that makes
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:31,040	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Is your cookie
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:32,064	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You smell great
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:32,832	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Taste great

* Molecules guy
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:34,880	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Your molecules
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:39,232	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Directions are not that many molecules people.
EDL	00:02:40,768	00:02:42,048	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So as a rep
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:43,584	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	This minority
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	How are you taking that info
EDL	00:02:46,144	00:02:46,656	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	In the form of
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:51,264	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	In the defense Sciences office one of the things that's going on right now one of the
EDL	00:02:51,520	00:02:52,288	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Zeitgeist
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:53,312	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Inside
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:55,104	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Revolutionising science
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:56,640	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	How do we do
EDL	00:02:56,896	00:02:57,920	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Science but faster
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:58,944	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Better
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:05,600	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And one of the things that is interesting about chemistry especially when we're talking about the makers the people who make meth
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:08,160	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Materials make small molecules make medicine
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:10,720	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It's a really slow process
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:16,864	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I really like the idea of Reinventing science and in chemistry there's a lot of opportunity to reinvent the science
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:19,424	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Somebody ask when you say Reinventing science
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:26,080	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Did you mean the actual process that we were asking questions that we were trying to answer those questions and if so can you be
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:27,872	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	No more details about what you have in mind
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:29,408	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Chemistry is a tough subject

EDL	00:03:29,920	00:03:36,064	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	We have lots of parameters that we don't often know how we're controlling them but if we did all of the chemistry in much more

EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:42,464	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Controlled environment where the environment was being constantly monitored we might come up with much much more reproducible
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:45,280	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Which will then mean if it
EDL	00:03:45,792	00:03:46,560	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Transportable
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:51,936	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So another words if I have a machine that's doing the chemical reaction recording how it's done
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,728	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The knock code
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:54,752	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That record
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,800	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can be sent from one laptop to another
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:03,968	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So you could accelerate it in the same way that the internet allows you to accelerate how information was transportable would if you could
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:04,736	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	To do that with
EDL	00:04:04,992	00:04:06,016	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	With molecules
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:09,088	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Tell her this might be a good time to talk a little bit about
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:13,696	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But you were the programs that you're working on and what I have in mind is the full defect program
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:15,232	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And the Make-It
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,280	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Program so why don't we start with
EDL	00:04:17,536	00:04:18,047	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Fold effects
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:19,583	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Fold effects
EDL	00:04:20,095	00:04:24,191	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That's a program that stands for folded non natural polymers
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,495	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	With biological function
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:28,543	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	In the fold effects program
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:29,823	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	We're making
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:32,895	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	A polymers that mimic natural polymers
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:34,175	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So that we might
EDL	00:04:34,431	00:04:35,199	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Make
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:37,503	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Biotherapeutics more Robux
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:39,039	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The right now if you
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,599	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'll get one of the more modern drugs right now
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,439	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	A good portion of them are made from proteins think
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,207	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Something like
EDL	00:04:47,231	00:04:50,303	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Entire bodies so for example Humira
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,631	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Or insulin those are examples of protein Biotherapeutics
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:55,935	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The problem is they are not heat stable
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:56,703	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:05:00,543	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	If it's something isn't heat Sable it's not going to end up in a medic bag
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:04,895	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	To our soldiers at the very place where they're going to be most vulnerable
EDL	00:05:05,407	00:05:09,759	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Don't have access to the most advanced medicine because many of them were just fragile
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:13,599	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And so we have to transport them back to an environment where
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:15,647	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You have refrigerators you have
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:19,743	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Handling equipment that can allow you to control that
EDL	00:05:19,999	00:05:21,791	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That environment around the medicine
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:23,327	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What if you were to make
EDL	00:05:23,583	00:05:24,607	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	An unnatural
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,679	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	There are lots of natural fibers that we used to use
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:32,031	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And we've replaced them with non natural fibers because there more robots to me like Silk
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:32,799	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Tonight
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:34,079	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah exactly
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:37,663	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So if you were to take those same sort of beneficial properties of yet
EDL	00:05:37,919	00:05:43,295	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Plastics in the word merge them with the beneficial properties of the biological polymers like proteins and DNA
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,319	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And so that's
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:47,391	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The full defect program but it's a platform it's about
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:50,207	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	How we make those and then how we discover them
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:52,255	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So anyway if you think about
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:58,911	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	All of the possible molecules that one could make the small ones you know like like an aspirin or the larger one
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ones like these
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:01,727	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Protein-based medicines you're talking about
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:08,127	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	They're really sort of an infinite to two possibilities like an infinite space that you could possibly search the app
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,711	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What you're saying here is your trying to develop some tools that will enable
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:14,015	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Even just a few people to 2
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:20,415	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Go explore some of the regions of this Infinite Space that just have not been looked at before am I getting them on track
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:26,047	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Oh you're so untrack you get back to my whole desire to explore that I talked about you know it's from my childhood
EDL	00:06:26,303	00:06:28,095	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It is really about giving
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:34,495	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Researchers a capability to be able to explore these these universes it's almost like a Hubble
EDL	00:06:34,751	00:06:35,263	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Horoscope for
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:39,359	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	This particular Galaxy or Universe of molecular space
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,175	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So that was fold effects yam
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:46,271	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I'm also interested in the Make-It program can you say a little bit about what you're doing there
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:50,367	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Make it is a platform technology for making small molecules
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:55,231	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And in this particular case were trying to do is we're trying to democratize
EDL	00:06:55,487	00:06:56,255	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Chemistry
EDL	00:06:56,511	00:06:57,535	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So what if you could have
EDL	00:06:57,791	00:06:59,071	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	A system
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:02,911	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Did a biologist or any scientist came up and typed in the target
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:05,471	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And the Machine figured out how to Make-It
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:08,031	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Even if there was no recipe available
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:12,127	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So that the machine would figure out a possible set of
EDL	00:07:12,639	00:07:18,271	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ways to make something and then would go about testing each one of those ways until it found a solution
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:22,623	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Then it would log that solution in a cloud or in its databank
EDL	00:07:23,135	00:07:26,975	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And now that molecule could be made anytime in addition the
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:29,279	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	System would also figure out how to make more of it
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:35,935	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So they usually it would do really small scale synthesis that means no mg and then once it figured out a solution
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:38,239	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Send it with an also automatically scale it up
EDL	00:07:38,751	00:07:43,103	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can you offer to us in a concrete example maybe you could think of a
EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:48,479	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Problem or a particular receptor for example on a cell that you might want as a Target
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:50,783	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And then explain how
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:59,231	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The Make-It Framework would go about Interacting with that The receptor in prep solving a medical or other biological problem
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,511	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:07,167	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You'll for example one very popular Target for the heart disease areas pcsk9
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,959	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And so there's probably
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:12,543	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Many papers that come out every year that describe
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:15,615	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Inhibitors that have been discovered against that
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:16,383	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Target
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,919	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The structures are available
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:24,831	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Let's say that I'm a researcher and I want to study some aspect of a complex cellular system and having access
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:27,391	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	To the pcsk9 inhibitor
EDL	00:08:27,647	00:08:28,671	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Would be really useful
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:33,535	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But maybe I want one that's selected in a certain way that isn't commercially available
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:35,071	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But somebody's reported it
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:42,495	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Now I might contact that researcher who's made it before and maybe they ran out and scan take them three months to Make-It
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:45,311	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But if I have access to a Make-It device
EDL	00:08:45,823	00:08:48,127	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I can just go type in the structure
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,919	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And have the material
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:52,223	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Maybe the next day or at the end of the week
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,015	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And in addition to that
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:55,039	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I have it memorized
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:56,575	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The machine has
EDL	00:08:56,831	00:08:59,391	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Kept that in his memory bank so if someone else in my
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:02,463	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	University environment for example wants to make that
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:05,023	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	They type it in and it'll be out that day
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:07,071	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Cuz the solution were already be there
EDL	00:09:08,095	00:09:09,375	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It's a way of saying
---	00:09:09,631	00:09:12,191	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Chemistry has been documented
---	00:09:12,447	00:09:15,263	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Since its Inception especially some type of synthetic chemistry
---	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,287	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Through
---	00:09:16,543	00:09:18,335	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What are called experimentals
---	00:09:18,591	00:09:21,407	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	These are documents that the researcher is
---	00:09:21,663	00:09:26,271	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Using to try to capture what they did in the laboratory make something to writing it down like a recipe
---	00:09:27,295	00:09:29,087	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So a lot of times we'll leave out details
---	00:09:29,855	00:09:32,415	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That we think are not necessary
---	00:09:32,927	00:09:33,951	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But are necessary
---	00:09:34,207	00:09:40,351	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And sometimes we didn't even know they were necessary so when another researcher comes in and tries to read that cookbook like it
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:43,423	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Experimental it might take them months to reproduce
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And I mean ever
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:46,239	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Why should we
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,543	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Waste our human effort
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:55,455	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	By not making sure that we document that outcome that experiment in a way that can guarantee reproduction
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:56,991	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So you're talking about
EDL	00:09:57,503	00:09:59,807	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Capturing procedural knowledge
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:00,575	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Correct
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:06,207	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yes the Make-It system is not just a artificial intelligence system Mora
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,743	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Cloud system that's
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,767	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Archiving
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:11,071	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It's a machine that's doing the chemistry
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:17,983	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So that the machine will be reproducible you'll be able to recreate that machine in any lab you want as long as
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:20,287	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You replicate that machine Faithfully
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:24,383	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And it runs the routines that you've recorded in one lab
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:26,175	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Versus another Faithfully
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:28,735	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You're going to reproduce chemistry
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:29,759	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Everywhere
EDL	00:10:30,271	00:10:30,783	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You want to
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,111	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What are the things that I find fascinating about DARPA is
EDL	00:10:34,367	00:10:40,511	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That it is perhaps unique in its place in the overall technology developed
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:41,791	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ecosystem
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:48,447	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And it's a program manager and someone who's been in academe and I think also an industry and now here
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,215	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Adorable
EDL	00:10:49,727	00:10:52,287	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Can you talk to us a little bit about
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:58,687	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	How dark I might be playing some interesting or breathy the unique roles in the overall technology ecosystem
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,223	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah I think it's a
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,015	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Very exciting role
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,319	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	DARPA is that one
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:05,599	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Place
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,367	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Where
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:07,903	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	We are thinking about
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:10,207	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Innovation unconstrained
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,999	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Like where can we go
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:18,143	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	In my mind the reason why we're doing that is because it fits our mission space if you want to
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:21,727	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Creator for been surprised it's best to get to that new
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,287	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Universe of chemistry sooner
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:25,567	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Rather than later
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,359	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And so we take
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:31,967	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Innovations from all of the other funding agencies in other words they're seeding it
EDL	00:11:32,223	00:11:37,087	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And we look for when a wave is beginning and we push it hard and let it crust fast
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,135	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	DARPA is
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:41,951	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Critical because we are
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,487	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Or structuring
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,535	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What I consider to be that
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,327	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Crescendo investment
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:50,911	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	As we are trending toward something amazing and no
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:57,567	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The internet is an example and I'm really emulating that with Make-It I want to create the internet
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:58,591	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Of molecules
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:02,431	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	How do you transfer molecules from one place to another
EDL	00:12:02,687	00:12:05,247	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	In the same way is a 3D printing concept
EDL	00:12:05,759	00:12:08,575	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	You have a design you can put that design in the cloud
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:12,415	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And then if you have a 3D printer you could transfer that design from one place to another
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,463	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So they're related
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:15,487	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And I'm
EDL	00:12:15,743	00:12:19,071	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Constantly inspired by what DARPA has done previously
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:25,471	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Is there a question Tyler that you wished I'd ask you during this discussion that I didn't end up so
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,519	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ask the question yourself and answer it
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,615	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	What's my favorite aspect of chemistry
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:37,247	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	The answer for most, what what's the answer for most of this chemist Ivan do you know
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:42,367	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I love that the structure of a molecule relates to its function
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,391	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I love that one
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:46,719	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah most of my friends maybe or Serta cro-magnons I guess
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,279	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Everybody likes explosions
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:51,327	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	But actually like the smell
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:57,983	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Of organic chemistry so pretty much almost all Asters like you know when people go into like 31 flavors
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:13:04,383	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Laborers are thinking of maybe in a mint chocolate chip I'm actually smelling all of the Esters and wondering I wonder if
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:10,271	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Is that this Ester or that after directly refers to a particular
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:14,623	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Chemical Motif if I work off my own organic chemistry part of it there's a
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:15,647	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Carbon with a
EDL	00:13:16,159	00:13:20,255	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Oxygen double bond and a few other things we don't have to go into the details except to say
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:22,047	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	That is a particular kind of
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,351	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Molecular motifs that can variation
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,887	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Yeah classic compound
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,959	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	So I really like the class of compounds that are
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:35,359	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Associated with flavorings and I don't mean just not natural flavorings I mean natural and non natural, like
EDL	00:13:35,871	00:13:36,639	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	A coconut
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:40,223	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	It smells the way it does because of chemistry
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:44,575	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Not that that always just really made me excited that's how it really enjoyed
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:48,671	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Talking with you today about that your programs about chemistry that DARPA
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:50,207	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	I said thanks for being here
EDL	00:13:50,463	00:13:56,607	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	Ivan it's always a pleasure to be with you and thanks for having me I'm really glad to relate my thoughts about chemistry and DARPA
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:00,191	| VfD E01 Molecule Man |	And thank you listeners for sharing this time with us
