EDL	00:00:11,540	00:00:17,740	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Self technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight with operation . 
EDL	00:00:21,700	00:00:32,540	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt that offends advanced research has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:33,230	00:00:35,040	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA . 
EDL	00:00:35,040	00:00:40,820	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	A window until dark is core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:41,750	00:00:43,230	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	My name is ivan a motto . 
EDL	00:00:43,230	00:00:45,120	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I am your doctor host today . 
EDL	00:00:45,120	00:01:02,060	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I am pleased to be talking with alexander wallen , a program manager since twenty seventeen in the technical technology , obviously , we are recording our conversations from our respective locations to comply with company restrictions , because we are not in a recording studio . 
EDL	00:01:02,060	00:01:05,170	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You might hear everything , sounds like traffic and birds . 
EDL	00:01:05,170	00:01:48,050	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And as it so happens , insect noises from this year's brood of seventeen years occasions , which are just everywhere here in my location , alzheimer's agenda , as he is more often known , brought it up , but his interests in developing and demonstrating advanced aircraft , rapid design and prototyping for moving concepts as quickly as possible to operational practicality are also parts of his modest surrounding zenda has had his hands on the challenge of a vertical landing and take off or vital technology and demos of later than aircraft are capable of being navigable and having extended flight at stratospheric altitudes of eleven twelve miles and above that , we have a lot of time . 
EDL	00:01:48,510	00:01:56,630	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	His main programmatic focus today is with the program known as queen , short for control of revolutionary aircraft , with novel effects . 
EDL	00:01:57,100	00:02:11,090	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Before joining japan's team of program managers , zander searched for twenty two years as an officer in the air force , beginning a nineteen ninety five and stretching all the way to twenty seventeen when he began his diaper years just before joining garbage . 
EDL	00:02:11,090	00:02:19,502	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Peter is the program manager at the research library , oversaw bright technology portfolio over seventy projects designed for transition to the war fighter . 
EDL	00:02:19,502	00:02:32,130	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	He also helped positions in the f thirty five joint program office and the combined joint task force parliament , which between two thousand and five and twenty thirteen , helped manage the threat of improvised explosive devices in the war in afghanistan . 
EDL	00:02:32,480	00:02:43,900	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	He also worked in the office of the assistant secretary of the air force for , and that he will tell you later , he has had quite the adventurer and getting close up looks at aircraft of other nations , including china . 
EDL	00:02:45,920	00:02:47,136	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Zenda , has four degrees . 
EDL	00:02:47,136	00:02:54,030	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Three of them are in ironic engineering , including a doctor of engineering degree from george washington university . 
EDL	00:02:54,030	00:02:57,780	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	His first degree is an NBA from the university of massachusetts . 
EDL	00:02:57,780	00:03:05,220	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	One more thing , zander is a new father with a ten week old baby girl , alexander valley , though I shall call you zander from here on out . 
EDL	00:03:05,520	00:03:10,190	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Thank you for joining me in this discussion and a huge congratulations on your new baby gear . 
EDL	00:03:10,190	00:03:11,397	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Well , thank you very much . 
EDL	00:03:11,397	00:03:16,226	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	It's great via the end before we talk about your technology development work at the dark . 
EDL	00:03:16,226	00:03:22,100	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But I would like to get some sense of how you became the sort of person ends up as a program manager . 
EDL	00:03:22,100	00:03:35,917	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I can tell from your three aeronautical engineering degrees that flying technologies were on your mind by the time you are under graduate of the university and soda , what can you tell me about the influences in your a weather at home or at school ? 
EDL	00:03:35,917	00:03:40,150	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I just think you had met towards that LED to the interest. 
EDL	00:03:40,150	00:03:42,500	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Well , thank you that a degree question . 
EDL	00:03:42,500	00:03:45,120	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I think I combine this by my father . 
EDL	00:03:45,800	00:03:58,470	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So growing up every year , my father's pilots and my three sisters and my brother and the car , when we go to the chicago air and water show and watch the blue angels of thunder bird and watch all the airplanes . 
EDL	00:03:59,110	00:04:05,280	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	My lesson about the time I was in faith , greater and beyond the only gifts I wanted for christmas on my birthday . 
EDL	00:04:05,280	00:04:11,680	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	War in cycle , pedia is a military airplanes , so I have always been interested in flight . 
EDL	00:04:11,680	00:04:17,930	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	My family to take me to go watch the world's land at the local air power when they do fly over the air shows . 
EDL	00:04:18,360	00:04:26,890	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so I really inherited from him a lot of their planes as I graduated high school in the college , I knew I wanted to be an engineer . 
EDL	00:04:26,890	00:04:33,380	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so I just put those two together and starting aircraft and flag in that sort of thing sense. 
EDL	00:04:33,380	00:04:35,169	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Now you're doing your education . 
EDL	00:04:35,169	00:04:38,350	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You also added in a masters in business administration . 
EDL	00:04:38,350	00:04:45,300	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I'm assuming that this is a clue to what you can have had in mind for the wrong holidays , and what you want to do professionally. 
EDL	00:04:45,300	00:04:54,633	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	As a young officer near force of managing road to be small programs , and I noticed my counterparts and industry , I was always interested in the technology . 
EDL	00:04:54,633	00:05:00,000	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But there are all these other concerns that had managed budgets that manage people they had worry about . 
EDL	00:05:00,000	00:05:06,505	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so I actually wanted to understand that side of the business side of it of running a program . 
EDL	00:05:06,505	00:05:13,654	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so I started my NBA and find out a lot of finance about the accounting aspect study economics , my spare time . 
EDL	00:05:13,654	00:05:13,854	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	now . 
EDL	00:05:13,854	00:05:28,449	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So I got into an initially understanding the other side of the table as I was married in programs , and then turned out that I love that part of it as well , and I think it helped inform higher craft programs to the contractor , understanding of what the contract are on . 
EDL	00:05:28,449	00:05:33,140	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	What my counterpart in industry has to deal with above and beyond just the technology challenges. 
EDL	00:05:33,140	00:05:39,930	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	When I saw that you had the NBAdegree with thinking , well , you know , that has got to be really hopeful in your world . 
EDL	00:05:39,930	00:06:03,684	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Adopt , because in sort of best , i've got no program managers and what that role is emitted is like you're running in a corporate energy of full fledged corporately , where the kinds of issues of just running businesses and staying on budget , and all of the logistics of that are particularly , it's not just finding people who do cool technology , but it's also managing all that . 
EDL	00:06:03,684	00:06:08,320	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So the NBA just seems like a perfect addition to the technical training. 
EDL	00:06:08,320	00:06:18,580	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I think it is , and also thinks like market research and marketing now is one thing to , I have a great idea , but developers sell it and get people excited about it and market research . 
EDL	00:06:18,580	00:06:31,102	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Understanding what else is going on and how you fit into a new weapon or a interesting piece technology to lose the type of things that I strive to learn , as well as the UMS. 
EDL	00:06:31,102	00:06:34,980	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I think i've tried to cooperate that background projects. 
EDL	00:06:34,980	00:06:37,700	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So now let's move to your dark adventure . 
EDL	00:06:37,700	00:06:42,240	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I always love to hear the how I got to double a story . 
EDL	00:06:42,240	00:06:46,540	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I guess that of almost all of the program managers that have spoken with for this particle . 
EDL	00:06:46,540	00:06:51,560	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So let me ask you mean that you seek out a job , a doctor , did someone a doctor seek ? 
EDL	00:06:51,560	00:06:53,020	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You will have to get here. 
EDL	00:06:53,750	00:06:55,000	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So little bit of boats . 
EDL	00:06:55,000	00:07:02,526	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So when I returned from afghanistan in two thousand and nine , it spent ten months corner influences opposed the device work . 
EDL	00:07:02,526	00:07:05,971	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We are feeling new technology with long hours with tiring . 
EDL	00:07:05,971	00:07:15,772	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	It was exciting , and it went back to my old job in the penalty after about a month and went to my boss and said , this job is a learn easier than I remember . 
EDL	00:07:15,772	00:07:17,339	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Do you have anything tougher ? 
EDL	00:07:17,339	00:07:22,824	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And he just got a call from double looking for a deputy program manager , and so I set up an interview . 
EDL	00:07:22,824	00:07:26,390	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And it turns out that david interviews there was a snowstorm . 
EDL	00:07:26,390	00:07:29,920	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I have to leave six blocks away from dark at the time . 
EDL	00:07:29,920	00:07:35,180	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So I watched six plus in a snowstorm to do an interview with the TTOoffice director . 
EDL	00:07:35,180	00:07:50,115	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And at the time it was , I was in interviewer for , but I was excited , and so I ended up being a deputy program manager for two years at the dark of duty transition when the work's mother for assignments finished on my career . 
EDL	00:07:50,115	00:07:53,210	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But from that point four , I knew that we want to come back . 
EDL	00:07:53,210	00:07:59,750	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So I had the opportunity to reach , in a view as a civilian and get higher line in twenty seventeen after my first dynamic. 
EDL	00:08:00,210	00:08:03,740	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Thanks for letting me know about that entry and into the agency . 
EDL	00:08:03,740	00:08:05,930	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Love the detail with the snowstorm . 
EDL	00:08:06,440	00:08:09,620	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So in twenty seventeen , as you just said , you joined darkness . 
EDL	00:08:09,620	00:08:19,790	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Tactical technology of now , more than any office that offers developed technologies that move in a way around the ground and see in the air space . 
EDL	00:08:19,790	00:08:24,100	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And in one of the now completed programs you work on . 
EDL	00:08:24,100	00:08:27,290	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So let's talk about the past a little bit first before we talk about cream . 
EDL	00:08:27,290	00:08:41,288	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You can't program that wants coffee adaptable later than aircraft program or autumn , and it did get some attention at twenty nine team when people across the country war crawling their necks , it and reporting strange white dots high overhead . 
EDL	00:08:41,288	00:08:56,360	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	The agency posted on facebook in late june of that year , twenty one thousand nine hundred and three test balloons have been to navigate from eastern cross country beginning cabinet maryland , and then ended with safe landings in northern california . 
EDL	00:08:56,360	00:09:15,730	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So can you prefer to explain the technology you need that altered was designed to meet and and tell me what you can't about what is achieved in the autumn , piling questions , and you are also interested what you were thinking when mere reports were coming in from around the country about these sightings . 
EDL	00:09:15,730	00:09:22,700	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Weight , let's start actually with what the program you know , was about , and what technology needs , you would hope it would deliver . 
EDL	00:09:22,700	00:09:23,870	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And then what is it sad is now? 
EDL	00:09:24,860	00:09:28,800	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Right to these variety of programming , I was , I was lucky enough to inherit that . 
EDL	00:09:28,800	00:09:31,790	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So previous program manager has started that . 
EDL	00:09:31,790	00:09:40,193	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And as what is the deputy for a few months and took their program over and what we are trying to do , there is doing a low cost strategic vehicle . 
EDL	00:09:40,193	00:09:47,706	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So strategist theoretically , above sixty thousand feet , there are big advantages of you going to get a flying vehicle up there . 
EDL	00:09:47,706	00:09:49,970	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Commercial airliners don't fly up there . 
EDL	00:09:49,970	00:09:56,340	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And as he gave from sixty to seventy nine thousand feet , you get a good to view a lot of the earth from up there . 
EDL	00:09:56,340	00:09:59,820	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So it , we call them suitor , satellites or suitor . 
EDL	00:09:59,820	00:10:00,000	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	late. 
EDL	00:10:00,000	00:10:04,840	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	This , for context , were , were probably talking here eleven , twelve miles and above , right? 
EDL	00:10:05,430	00:10:10,050	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Absolutely , yes , until the air is very thin upturn it , you build . 
EDL	00:10:10,050	00:10:26,310	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	These are lighter than their vehicles , almost more like a spacecraft , and you do an aircraft is there is , i'm so for a low cost in the occasion , processing , navigation and timing and a low cost of surveillance platform that was very appealing to the military . 
EDL	00:10:26,810	00:10:35,890	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So we , we did this program , and we actually did a test flight about a year before that that graduates , an exercise or full cross country for that flight . 
EDL	00:10:35,890	00:10:39,410	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We flew out of utah smaller port enough . 
EDL	00:10:39,410	00:10:53,633	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	The volunteer going to laugh , and we are taking pictures , and we began to notice that the brand and we appear and disappear based on the song , and there are very large vehicles , hundreds of feet across , but they're very far away . 
EDL	00:10:53,633	00:10:55,066	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So it's very disorienting . 
EDL	00:10:55,066	00:11:03,390	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And the copy engineers and I looked at each other and said , dramatically , think that you , so we sort of suspect those gonna happen . 
EDL	00:11:03,390	00:11:05,910	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So we were very trying to be very forthcoming . 
EDL	00:11:05,910	00:11:07,840	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We , we felt with the FA. 
EDL	00:11:07,840	00:11:10,910	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We did social media post thing we're gonna do . 
EDL	00:11:11,320	00:11:17,313	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And the really , the only bet was how far across the country wouldn't get before the first you are so excited . 
EDL	00:11:17,313	00:11:21,446	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I think we made it on the way that they know how before we get our first . 
EDL	00:11:21,446	00:11:31,990	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You'll so , so that was fun , but we actually participate in with the army , and that we are ground units to communication exercises while we are gone over the us . 
EDL	00:11:31,990	00:11:36,333	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And we are specific points we are navigating from a military technology . 
EDL	00:11:36,333	00:11:44,800	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I think we demonstrate a very low cost , reactive way to sort of supplement satellites and build a local network on western world world . 
EDL	00:11:44,800	00:11:49,580	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And you believe the flag constellation from one cotton it across . 
EDL	00:11:50,010	00:11:56,970	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So I think we are very successful in , and I know about the army in the navy to have activities that are building on our success and. 
EDL	00:11:57,860	00:12:03,410	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Great , so some chance of early degree of transition to potential and universe users . 
EDL	00:12:03,410	00:12:07,100	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	That's always the trophy that dropped ones with its programs . 
EDL	00:12:07,100	00:12:14,640	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I wanted to well out just a bit more , because there is one very cool aspect of the , the technology that just wanted to hear a little bit more about . 
EDL	00:12:14,640	00:12:20,420	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	That's just the navigation aspect , because of I recall one way that you achieve . 
EDL	00:12:20,420	00:12:31,970	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Navigation is by changing the of the balloons in order to take advantage of a university of different air currents and conditions at different attitudes . 
EDL	00:12:31,970	00:12:35,260	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I write about that , and if so , just tell us a little bit more headache. 
EDL	00:12:35,260	00:12:46,237	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Yes , of the fundamental theory of why you can navigate with these balloons that the winds in the strategic fear are a very catholic and turbulent . 
EDL	00:12:46,237	00:12:48,552	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so winds going one direction . 
EDL	00:12:48,552	00:12:53,706	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And at a few thousand fear bowler below , the letter began the other direction . 
EDL	00:12:53,706	00:13:00,660	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so you know what they're doing , you can kind of you can change out to by moving , basically pumping air under the balloon . 
EDL	00:13:00,660	00:13:02,300	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And it , you can make it go up or down . 
EDL	00:13:03,000	00:13:05,680	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And we got zero mass because we are not actually changing . 
EDL	00:13:05,680	00:13:09,320	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	The massive vehicle were bringing iran or venting it off . 
EDL	00:13:09,320	00:13:12,290	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And then the couple memory piece of advantage where you want to know the window . 
EDL	00:13:12,290	00:13:12,900	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So we are . 
EDL	00:13:12,900	00:13:24,570	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	She also a windsor of sensor , the user laser actually measures the molecule movement of the air at seventy five thousand feet above the . 
EDL	00:13:24,570	00:13:28,656	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And to do that , we took a piece of technology that NASA demonstrated that way . 
EDL	00:13:28,656	00:13:36,828	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	About fifteen hundred pounds and research for dinner or table and shrunk it down to something about the size of a coffee can await fifty pounds . 
EDL	00:13:36,828	00:13:51,550	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And we demonstrated a low power satellite thief , lazier to connect three measure wins at three , five thousand feet and above , and the direction that you wanted to figure out if you wanted to assign to send , depending which direction you want to go. 
EDL	00:13:51,550	00:14:01,531	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Well , it's amazing to think about the vehicle that says that can remove her up and down in the atmosphere column to take advantage of different wind conditions as they , it's really , truly amazing . 
EDL	00:14:01,531	00:14:03,501	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Now , let's move onto another program . 
EDL	00:14:03,501	00:14:13,390	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You had worked on this one that had the goal of delivering an aircraft prototype capable of vehicle that is worker takeoff and landing , like it has never been done before . 
EDL	00:14:13,970	00:14:16,160	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	They know what were you hoping to achieve this program? 
EDL	00:14:16,800	00:14:17,906	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Great question . 
EDL	00:14:17,906	00:14:40,074	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So we actually had a program called vital eggs or lightning strike that was supposed to be a high speed vertical take off learning aircraft and by high speed three hundred and three hundred and fifty nine , which is about one hundred and fifty , if it is not faster than a helicopter or something like AVtwenty two top roller at the end of the day , that program ended up not going to fly . 
EDL	00:14:40,074	00:15:13,798	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We ran into the challenges with electoral higher proportion and an enlightener that actually got a lot of active investment in both commercial government said , I think we , we advanced it to allow you a fair amount of that program , but that's a , that's a great example of a program that didn't end up complaining international media machine , but we actually discovered where the technology needed to events , and we spend the and work with industry to , to push some of the generator technology and some of the , some of the underlying technology that would enable that kind of aircraft in the future . 
EDL	00:15:13,798	00:15:32,660	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So , so we continue to work with folks and support the air force in their journey , prime and ever , but high speed fixed wing combines all the attributes like a helicopter , the efficiency of a traditional aircraft , and that's still something that there is altha to go do . 
EDL	00:15:32,660	00:15:42,530	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so we advanced some of the technology , but a legendary was still most of our configuration of what technologies have to mature before already for leaving capability. 
EDL	00:15:42,530	00:15:45,100	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Right , and you know what I love to buy your description . 
EDL	00:15:45,100	00:16:11,520	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	There was that it really is touch upon one of the signature aspects of the dark , but model , which is to take on extremely challenging a technology problems with the hope , you know , that you actually will get to the technology , finish line the generation ahead of time , but also with the understanding that if you don't , you learn all along the way that there is a value to that , and that helps you point in the direction or point away from what others be . 
EDL	00:16:11,920	00:16:18,150	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	That is so that in the end , it helps to work in accelerate a technology vision to to a good finish line . 
EDL	00:16:18,500	00:16:27,830	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Let me know there when on your current program , queen , control of revolutionary aircraft with novel effectives . 
EDL	00:16:27,830	00:16:32,080	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	In july , the agency and asked the first three words in the program . 
EDL	00:16:32,560	00:16:34,950	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And i'm gonna , let you talk about what I think . 
EDL	00:16:34,950	00:16:44,040	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	In short , the idea is a ploy was called active flow control , such that one can seal an aircraft without the need of movable services . 
EDL	00:16:44,410	00:16:50,750	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Tell us the story of the queen program , the problem , need or capability that you invasion it will address . 
EDL	00:16:51,080	00:16:53,180	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And what is the set of the program? 
EDL	00:16:53,790	00:17:02,324	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	When I was starting the cream program and installing it through my leadership , I used the example of an episode five versus award award aircraft . 
EDL	00:17:02,324	00:17:08,756	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I said he took an error in automatic engineer from one thousand nine hundred and forty and seventy five . 
EDL	00:17:08,756	00:17:19,732	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	He could do all the equations and tell you how to how far the move detail left , right , the rotters , how we control aeroplanes are not fundamentally changed in over one hundred years . 
EDL	00:17:19,732	00:17:26,180	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Now that engineer from nineteen fourteen would have no idea how the challenge and work you were understand , right , are in their . 
EDL	00:17:26,180	00:17:36,298	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But fundamentally , we are still designing airplanes the same way we did one hundred years ago , and that's by moving little bit of air foil open down or left and right , and that works pretty well . 
EDL	00:17:36,298	00:17:38,050	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But what you find is from a design . 
EDL	00:17:38,050	00:17:40,178	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	It really limits your imagination . 
EDL	00:17:40,178	00:18:10,400	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And and so what we wanted to do with crane was take a technology in this case at the flow control , just basically blowing little bit of air over the wind as strategic locations , and that technology between the wire , but in wind tunnels and bring an academy for over thirty years , we wanted to create program that the aircraft designers to think differently and to work on the tools and the methodology to develop new and other ideas and give them the time space to do that . 
EDL	00:18:10,400	00:18:17,640	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so that's what we try to do on crane is , is really given the designers the freedom to think outside the box . 
EDL	00:18:17,640	00:18:26,370	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And in one of the ways we did that , as we specifically said at the beginning of the program , don't come to us with an idea what they are planned look like . 
EDL	00:18:26,370	00:18:37,870	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We've been the first year doing experiments doing when tunnels doing high power computing , we want to examine in dozens of different ideas , and then , as a group , decide what's the most compelling . 
EDL	00:18:37,870	00:18:39,961	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Dama , what should the airplane look like ? 
EDL	00:18:39,961	00:18:41,242	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I , that was unusual . 
EDL	00:18:41,242	00:18:44,906	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I had a bit of my leadership to give me more time of friend . 
EDL	00:18:44,906	00:18:50,294	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I said , if we go slow in the beginning , we'll get in much better product , middle faster . 
EDL	00:18:50,294	00:18:50,550	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	the. 
EDL	00:18:50,550	00:19:06,720	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Zenda , so you are really just getting these programs momentum going , and it sounds like it said , the first years can be really gathering IDyes , then bring the teams together , performers together to think about what would be the good next steps it takes . 
EDL	00:19:06,720	00:19:13,120	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But as you just sort of game out , the entire program is dramatically what you expect will happen , how to learn for. 
EDL	00:19:13,120	00:19:15,400	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Right , let us get a great question . 
EDL	00:19:15,400	00:19:48,831	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So what about a year in the program that we're eleven months , and we've had three contractors who have started with over dozen different ideas and concepts of water prices should look like we have spent for last to eleven months doing winter and testing to on high park computing , building brand new tools , and in kind of working as a team to develop this new revolutionary concept of over the next month or so , we're going to start downstairs selecting to one or two ideas , and those who were going from what we are crawling , which we call face zero interface one . 
EDL	00:19:48,831	00:20:02,150	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And that is what will actually do the off the flying air vehicle will start doing , drawing your identify subsidies , and then you start to get an idea really of what is your look like , and what demonstrated . 
EDL	00:20:02,150	00:20:04,320	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And the things were going to demonstrate us . 
EDL	00:20:04,320	00:20:07,600	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We think , with this technology , we can make our plans to lighter . 
EDL	00:20:07,600	00:20:23,996	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We can potentially do new interesting and manufacturers , and that we can be changed the way we design them and the way they look , but we can actually show improvements and weight and range and take off capability by thinking outside the box and applying this new technology . 
EDL	00:20:23,996	00:20:25,310	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so what will do that ? 
EDL	00:20:25,310	00:20:30,112	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And then , from there were plenty downstairs , single airplane , and they will do that detail . 
EDL	00:20:30,112	00:20:39,090	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Design will start construction , and then in three to four years , we actually have flying prototype out of flying in demonstrating some these breathers. 
EDL	00:20:39,090	00:20:48,854	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Yeah , you know , this is also reminding me a little bit of hydrodynamics may be air dynamics in nature a little bit , you know of thinking of things like the like sharks . 
EDL	00:20:48,854	00:20:56,100	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Can I do that has these little denticles , you know , which are all the best throwing eddie flows and turbulence in a sort of thing . 
EDL	00:20:56,100	00:20:58,990	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	It makes the shark much more efficient . 
EDL	00:20:58,990	00:21:04,660	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Swimmer , biological analogies that some of your performers are bringing into the next. 
EDL	00:21:04,660	00:21:11,230	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Yeah , so that's really interesting , because that's one of the one of the things you find earlier on is early in aviation . 
EDL	00:21:11,230	00:21:13,022	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We try to mimic birds . 
EDL	00:21:13,022	00:21:30,003	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And it was until the right brother's basically broke out proportion suffered from lift that we are able to keep flight and then over the best hundred years where we found is that the projects , you know what they're doing , because they , they can very small changes to the wings , especially storing bird . 
EDL	00:21:30,003	00:21:32,352	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We've ever watched hawker eagle . 
EDL	00:21:32,352	00:21:34,178	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	It are very slight changes . 
EDL	00:21:34,178	00:21:47,800	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	They can begin to great removals with very , and so we have actually got some concepts that sort of borrow , that idea that that , rather than brute force , you're using big pieces of metal moving up . 
EDL	00:21:47,800	00:21:54,296	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But if you effectively just change the way the error appears , you'll make little changes . 
EDL	00:21:54,296	00:21:56,732	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	The error you can , you can remove . 
EDL	00:21:56,732	00:21:59,168	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And what I call more elegant manner . 
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:18,880	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so it's go from where we started trying to mimic birds to actually getting back to worry about the technology that computing resources actually model how to do that , because it is much more challenging when you try to try to do that , anyone would think , but there are really energies to the way nature is above that the wrong and how actually be able to sort of. 
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:24,619	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Okay , just a couple of more questions , and then I will bring our discussion as it were in for lending . 
EDL	00:22:24,619	00:22:25,681	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Forgive me with that . 
EDL	00:22:25,681	00:22:30,209	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I'm asked to sort of imagining little , and they're forgiving me for that too . 
EDL	00:22:30,209	00:22:38,089	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But several decades ago , and you're going to do , these are shows , and you probably screaming things like , well , that's cool to your dad . 
EDL	00:22:38,089	00:22:40,278	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And now here you are a dark or manager . 
EDL	00:22:40,278	00:22:42,060	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I'm in a seriously cool tech . 
EDL	00:22:42,060	00:22:52,410	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	She obviously thinks it could have some value in the context of defence , but in a serious idea of a new way of producing or creating navigation . 
EDL	00:22:52,410	00:23:07,210	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And but when you allow yourself to sort of imagine the coolest technologies that you dreamt about , even if they're not double related with what comes to mind , like what kind of error and article technologies have you dropped ? 
EDL	00:23:07,210	00:23:09,590	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You wish could be so , but not. 
EDL	00:23:10,000	00:23:17,808	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	For me personally , the most exciting thing out there , the thing that we've all been promised are where our jet packs rate . 
EDL	00:23:17,808	00:23:26,820	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so we actually did a good approval , and we have a small business initiative to look at it will be called battlefield personal mobility . 
EDL	00:23:26,820	00:23:36,520	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So the idea is , if I am a soldier , and I want to move five or ten miles is a way I can do that without being and point to point to the air . 
EDL	00:23:36,900	00:24:05,409	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so we're gonna do several smaller words to look at some innovative things to include quiet paragraphers , personal level , helicopters and potentially some version of jet packs in a military context to say , if I need to move five or ten miles , can soldiers get off the road to get a get away from large vehicles and move around freely , so that sort of a really exciting thing and innocent technology . 
EDL	00:24:05,409	00:24:08,871	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Let's just now emerging that might make that more practical . 
EDL	00:24:08,871	00:24:10,440	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	We got a lot of work . 
EDL	00:24:10,440	00:24:14,730	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Batteries regard the rebecca is now quite capital or drowned . 
EDL	00:24:14,730	00:24:23,280	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Yellow things can scale up , potentially to be something that men portable and transport , so still not there . 
EDL	00:24:23,280	00:24:31,520	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But I think if you can do the personal mobility where you basically carry your own little vehicle and are able to move around five or ten miles . 
EDL	00:24:31,520	00:24:34,520	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I think that it's a really exciting kind of opportunity to be. 
EDL	00:24:34,520	00:24:40,970	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Well , that gets it just well for me , because you know , the jet pack comes up even in a lot of correspondence with dark . 
EDL	00:24:40,970	00:24:42,740	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	But let's start like , okay , you can do it . 
EDL	00:24:42,740	00:24:43,710	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You can do it . 
EDL	00:24:43,710	00:24:45,300	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	What about the jet pack ? 
EDL	00:24:45,300	00:24:54,540	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So as entrepreneur helping to deliver the jet pack , I think your name will go down quite well in the history of dark a party , the history of technology of general . 
EDL	00:24:54,540	00:25:00,545	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So may you succeed in helping to deliver the jet pack , shifting direction just a bit . 
EDL	00:25:00,545	00:25:11,080	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I'd like to ask you to reflect on your experience as a dark program manager in a place of darker , which is so notable in the overall innovation ecosystem . 
EDL	00:25:11,080	00:25:27,260	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And this is kind of an interesting time to ask the question , because there is just tons and tons of discussion , both domestically and in other countries , about trying to emulate dolphin , whether it's an immune energy and intelligence , they are already even in the permanent transportation . 
EDL	00:25:27,260	00:25:33,180	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	There is a proposal now to create a transportation eccentric arab event research project agency . 
EDL	00:25:33,180	00:25:43,930	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So i'm just wondering your opinion , what are some of the institutional and cultural characteristics of that you , we'll be most challenging for others to emulate , replicate. 
EDL	00:25:44,590	00:25:55,490	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I am working that i've had the opportunity or adopt work a couple of projects with foreign governments on funding nations who are talking about sending throne garbage . 
EDL	00:25:55,490	00:26:18,020	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And they often ask the same elizabeth two things , at least that i've seen that are that are really enabling and motivating the first as poor managers , we know , are a short time when it , typically two to five years , we have to start a project in and get moving in and really do do exciting work . 
EDL	00:26:18,020	00:26:23,700	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And then after that , we're going to be basically thinking , have to go find another job in a summer on comment . 
EDL	00:26:23,700	00:26:33,100	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so what that means is one you very motivated to take an idea or find it , and make sure you really ready to go , and you can execute in the time fashion . 
EDL	00:26:33,100	00:26:37,900	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And the second thing is to more complicated project , and it's going to take a little blanker . 
EDL	00:26:37,900	00:26:50,095	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	You really are motivated to to make sure that it turns out footing because the person coming next week behind you to take that program over may not love it as much as you love it right to the gatsby is gonna be compelling and scattered . 
EDL	00:26:50,095	00:26:57,130	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Besides a technically the method to release in the second , I think , enabled and seeing the dark it does is one out of free the face . 
EDL	00:26:57,130	00:27:04,526	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Well , I was not afraid to basically stop program weight , weight through and say , you know what this was harder than we thought . 
EDL	00:27:04,526	00:27:10,130	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Let's take a step back , and when I stop doing this , maybe think about a better way to do it . 
EDL	00:27:10,130	00:27:15,130	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And I think we do that in TTOAfair amount of wealth , our big successes . 
EDL	00:27:15,130	00:27:34,035	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And so we're willing to to invest in things that that we think are disruptive and wealth willing to take changes that mean that panel , and that's a lot easier said than done and being willing to fail , and knowing that you will be looked as a failure if the program runs in the technology issues that is success . 
EDL	00:27:34,035	00:27:37,150	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	That you've discovered a new technology , road work. 
EDL	00:27:37,150	00:27:58,640	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Thanks for sharing some of your insights and observations about the innovation culture at DARPA , especially like the way to describe the positive value of the agency EX from , you know , both delivering an original technology vision , but also from discovering road blocks that still must be overcome , you know , to reach the finish line . 
EDL	00:27:58,640	00:28:01,190	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So very cool about that . 
EDL	00:28:01,650	00:28:04,580	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And now , before we do close , I do monitor . 
EDL	00:28:04,580	00:28:10,590	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Just we visit a little bit your air force korea before coming to durban . 
EDL	00:28:10,590	00:28:12,230	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Can you share a little more about? 
EDL	00:28:12,710	00:28:17,660	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	Sure , I was in your first officer for twenty two years , primarily engineering focused . 
EDL	00:28:18,070	00:28:21,830	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I had a relevant opportunity as my first assignment . 
EDL	00:28:21,830	00:28:25,410	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	I was sent to the national air and space intelligence center . 
EDL	00:28:25,410	00:28:28,324	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	And where's a chinese fighter aircraft hour ? 
EDL	00:28:28,324	00:28:52,500	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	So I got to look at four new aircraft and try to deduce their capabilities and have the opportunity as secondary tenant to attend the first error , chinese public aerial and nineteen ninety six , and that's received a deal that I let you know before I love their planes , and so I got it to look at four aircraft , and they move over and worked at one seventeen . 
EDL	00:28:52,500	00:29:02,320	| VfD E46 The Jet Packer |	B two has the opportunity to die during electronics when we lost in the first seventeen got to participate and figure out why that happened and how to avoid .
