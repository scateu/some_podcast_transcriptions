0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,921
the embedded entrepreneurship initiative

1
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:04,240
is you know like anything else at DARPA

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,121
it's a

3
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:10,400
it's an experiment we have specific metrics that we have to hit and

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,599
you know every year we'll continue to measure its value, we'll continue to

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,201
iterate and learn to optimize this model for impact

6
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:23,920
and at the end of the fifth year then

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
whoever the director is at that time

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,559
we'll we'll take a look at it and see if it's really helping us achieve the DARPA

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,561
mission of creating new capabilities

10
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:40,561
that are in the hands of the warfighter and national security end users

11
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:44,009
It's that last bit that part about getting technologies beyond

12
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,320
the valley of death and into the hands of war fighters and national security users

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,720
that EEI is designed to make happen more

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,119
often than it has in the past. There are

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,640
plenty of business and technology

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,801
accelerator models out there Tech

17
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:58,801
Transfer Offices at Universities try to

18
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:03,759
help faculty license patents or get startups going for one there are various

19
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,680
business boot camps that promise to turn

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,081
technical teams into business wizards in

21
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,240
three to six week programs venture

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,040
capital firms bet on winners and feed

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,881
those chosen companies various levels of

24
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:17,521
funding and sometimes business expertise

25
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:21,361
to help move concepts toward commercial products and services

26
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,001
Gerst says DARPA poses unique challenges

27
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,221
when it comes to accelerating development

28
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,400
in the innovation ecosystem

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,081
DARPA is

30
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,040
very early stage you know we're taking

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,480
things from

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,881
idea often to you know proof of

33
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,480
principle or

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,441
first prototype and really understanding

35
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:45,040
what performance can be gained and that

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,081
in business terms that's pre-seed stage

37
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:50,881
So it's unique in that it's very early

38
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,161
DARPA is

39
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:55,361
unique in that most of its portfolio

40
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,881
focuses on the

41
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:00,161
hard tech, deep tech space that you know

42
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,600
materials science, biotechnology,

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,721
microelectronics that take

44
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,048
a long time to mature.

45
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:12,800
A lot of the original business accelerators were designed for software

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,920
and not hardware and definitely not material science.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,400
and and then the last reason why it's

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
unique is that it's very

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,080
high risk but potentially high impact

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
and so

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,161
the result of that you know in my world

52
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,080
is that you don't see

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
many straightforward business models

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,561
where DARPA has you know developed a

55
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,401
technology that's just slightly

56
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,159
incrementally better from what's out

57
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,360
there today and it it nicely fits within

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,439
to the existing system

59
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,439
you know the existing market system and

60
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,200
the existing supply chain often DARPA is

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
going after things that have off the

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,480
charts performance that have the

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,640
potential to to really upend the

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
existing market structure

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,360
that require new thinking around

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
business models and partnerships

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,719
sometimes DARPA develops some really

68
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,800
unique things where we're thinking oh

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,439
this could create an entirely new space

70
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,320
a new industry and that needs to be from

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,800
a commercialization standpoint supported

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
in an entirely different way and so

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,961
we designed this program to uniquely fit

74
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,681
the DARPA model EEI came out of the

75
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,520
gates in a mad sprint

76
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,760
following a pilot stage the initiative

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,080
began ramping up to full-scale status in

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,560
october 2020 in what is initially

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
planned as a five-year institutional

80
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
experiment already EEI is engaged with

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
more than 50 research teams each one

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,881
with big big plans we have

83
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:50,719
54 research teams some of them are still

84
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,320
thinking about if they should become a

85
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,080
company

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,401
some of them are in a corporate research

87
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,241
lab and they're you know investigating

88
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,159
the hypothesis that there's a compelling

89
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
business case here and trying to

90
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,800
determine if they should spin it out or

91
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,241
license it but

92
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:09,200
54 unique technologies that we're

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
helping plan the path forward for a

94
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,841
typical EEI effort begins when a DARPA

95
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:16,321
program manager a pm approaches Gerst

96
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:18,081
and her colleagues at DARPA about a

97
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:19,680
research team of scientists and

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,081
engineers that the pm is working with

99
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,240
and that has a great idea that might not

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,439
make it through the valley of death

101
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,401
without the sort of help EEI can offer

102
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,880
the central pillar of EEI's model girth

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,961
says is to provide funding in the

104
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,641
quarter million dollar range for

105
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,560
embedding a seasoned and vetted

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
entrepreneur into a technical team for a

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,279
year or even two years the embedded

108
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,240
entrepreneur adds crucial sober business

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,720
and commercialization insight and acumen

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,279
to the optimistic and often idealistic

111
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,961
technical mindset that the researchers

112
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:53,600
bring into the mix it takes both to get

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,439
promising technology into practical

114
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,040
shape manufactured and into the hands of end users

115
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,641
here's how Gerst explains EEI's special sauce
