00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,601
Many of them are involved in war fighter performance

1
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:07,601
everything from sleep to

2
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:10,880
vaccines to making sure our guys

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,281
if they end up in a far away place and

4
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,801
get exposed to

5
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:17,201
unusual things that we can detect it

6
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,640
that we can actually make sure their

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,960
bodies are are capable of responding to

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,201
it in unique ways we are working with

9
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:25,361
operational biotech supporting our

10
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,600
troops in physical structures

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,721
Can we

12
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:31,280
create novel structures to as you land a

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,841
helicopter to decrease the dust in the

14
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,360
air using biologicals some nutrients

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,081
that coalesce(合并, 烧结的结) the sand underneath the

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,801
helicopter and keep dust down

17
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:45,759
can we create artificial reefs to both

18
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,801
land on and protect against global warming

19
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:50,000
Can we

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,280
make bricks

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,000
in faraway places without cement and

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,401
lower carbon footprints and creating

23
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,401
coalesce aggregate materials and low carbon ways

24
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:01,679
of doing this

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,480
each of these is a specific company and

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,760
a specific

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
embedded entrepreneur that we have

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
supported

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,560
In addition,

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
some things that your listeners may find

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,826
slightly odd.

32
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,361
We support individuals who are

33
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,680
bringing materials to

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
agricultural uses

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,801
in the conversion of materials that are

36
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,319
contaminated(被污染的) with such things as

37
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,721
mycotoxin(毒枝菌素) into

38
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,200
high quality ingredients(成分) by feeding

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,439
through insects(昆虫)
