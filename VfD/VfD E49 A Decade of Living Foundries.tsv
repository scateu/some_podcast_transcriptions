EDL	00:00:11,660	00:00:17,760	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Stealth technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight with operation. 
EDL	00:00:23,830	00:00:34,530	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Technologies , a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research agency has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:34,530	00:00:45,250	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window until the history , people and accomplishments , kind of earned dark membership among the most admired places and cultures of innovation
EDL	00:00:45,660	00:00:59,480	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	My name is iphone a motel and on your dark host in this episode of Voices from DARPA , we will take a tour of an ambitious ten year project to merge biology and engineering into one of the most powerful engines of molecular invention
EDL	00:00:59,480	00:01:03,952	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The world is known , although some works still remains to be done
EDL	00:01:03,952	00:01:14,919	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The program now is winding down to a clothes , but not before its research performers already delivered a new adversity of technology platform , whose consequences are begun to revolt
EDL	00:01:14,919	00:01:21,142	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	New companies follow on investments , chemical and materials based technology for the department of defence
EDL	00:01:21,142	00:01:25,990	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And perhaps one day for the public large , the players already have begun to accumulate. 
EDL	00:01:26,500	00:01:30,480	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Biology can do things that no weather technology can come close to doing
EDL	00:01:31,050	00:01:33,560	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	It can replicate itself
EDL	00:01:33,560	00:01:44,260	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	It can adapt , it can above it , can scale from one to millions to billions effortlessly in a day , and its program will fill the genetic code
EDL	00:01:45,460	00:01:47,520	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Biology is technology. 
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:50,802	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	That's former program manager alicia jackson in twenty fifteen
EDL	00:01:50,802	00:01:57,610	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	She was speaking at a meeting that showcased the mission in projects of the biological technologies office will be to you
EDL	00:01:57,610	00:02:03,805	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	She'd been a group already for several years , and was preparing to hand off stewardship of the living founderies program
EDL	00:02:03,805	00:02:10,000	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	She launched the programme twenty eleven by twenty thirteen and extensive set of academic and industrial performers
EDL	00:02:10,000	00:02:17,656	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	That's researchers in terrorist speaker had begun , or to realize the beauty of vision that biology is living
EDL	00:02:17,656	00:02:22,325	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Foundations was just one of the more are delicious embodiments of that original
EDL	00:02:22,325	00:02:33,430	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Jackson argued at the twenty fifteen BTOshowcase that biology is the past way to advance new technologies that will empower us to make useful chemicals and materials like we never have been. 
EDL	00:02:33,430	00:02:52,220	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	It offers us a chance to combine all the advances that we see now for the past fifty years and electronics and physics and computer science and data analytics , and combine it with the last two decades of advances in genomics and biology and narrow science and come up with the technological capability
EDL	00:02:52,220	00:03:03,230	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The first phases , anything that we have today , it would be truly astonishing to have a technology that could leverage both of these aspects from the engineering world and from the biological world
EDL	00:03:04,000	00:03:06,430	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	It could offer solutions and capabilities. 
EDL	00:03:06,430	00:03:08,787	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	But we just don't have today
EDL	00:03:08,787	00:03:18,372	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Former program manager renewed wages now , with ginger buyer works picked up the pattern on a living foundry is programmed twenty seven in a visit from global
EDL	00:03:18,372	00:03:23,624	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Parker said the southern twenty eighteen , she showed a status report on the project
EDL	00:03:23,624	00:03:33,023	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	It was a pipeline in the project whose first phase was known as ATthat stands for advanced tools and capabilities for generalizable platforms
EDL	00:03:33,023	00:03:42,680	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	This was the face said , wages in which the living fundraising , occasional program manager li said , intended to bring biology and engineering together in novel and never more in power. 
EDL	00:03:43,340	00:04:08,511	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	She had the decision to start to create a tool bed where we could destroy biology to an engineering to take something like the design , build , test , learn psychologically engineering and apply that to a biological system like my problem in ecology or a east or other type of bacteria to make products and molecules that would be a value to the dirty
EDL	00:04:08,511	00:04:23,750	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And I really think that her inspiration came from looking at biology as this incredible system that could make a real diversity of molecules that extends well beyond what we can make through traditional manufacturing and chemical processes
EDL	00:04:23,750	00:04:36,200	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So when you have access to that diversity of biology , can you start to manipulate that to make new pot molecules , things that have never been made before biology , which is some of the most ambitious goals of the program
EDL	00:04:36,200	00:04:45,909	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So her foundation of investments really created the tools under each one of those categories that design tools that you can quickly in automated way , design a violence
EDL	00:04:45,909	00:04:56,523	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And that apparently distinguished teens together to put into a build , said , this is that the DNA sympathizing , an insertion of DNA into a living system testing
EDL	00:04:56,523	00:04:58,916	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	This is the domestic trauma tree
EDL	00:04:58,916	00:05:03,880	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Other measure falls to look if a product has been made and importantly , learning
EDL	00:05:03,880	00:05:18,448	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So this is some of the design to make are not going to work and program programming that into your learning cycle to not use that design , make a better design next time is the first phase of the program was to build those individual components and tools
EDL	00:05:18,448	00:05:34,659	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And now the second phases to really integrate them as a platform to create this foundry type capability that the us , military or our customer , a business customer , could go to a foundery and say , I would like you to make the smaller kill kenny developed about that perfect and organism to do so
EDL	00:05:34,659	00:05:44,950	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The ultimate demonstration of that capability , that founder capability is to make one thousand unique molecules and where five hundred fifty one molecules. 
EDL	00:05:44,950	00:06:04,300	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	That was in twenty eighteen , the team performers that were then walking their way up to , and now , beyond the one thousand molecule mark include researchers at the biotechnology firms , emergency and zimmerman , and they're academic colleagues at the m it broader each group , but are different strengthening approaches to the tables as an achiever
EDL	00:06:04,300	00:06:08,040	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The BTOprogram manager , who is now taking living to the finish line. 
EDL	00:06:08,510	00:06:11,850	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So we all have different strength and different approaches
EDL	00:06:11,850	00:06:22,920	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	You know , one of the strength of of the m it broad foundery is in some of the early sort of development and a little girl approach to determines when the bills , and that are catholic
EDL	00:06:22,920	00:06:25,984	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And so there there goal was never to scale up
EDL	00:06:25,984	00:06:26,641	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	They were not
EDL	00:06:26,641	00:06:45,198	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	There are not a criminal entity , and so they were very good in sort of the very methodical approach to understanding what kind of violence that the population will go into the creating a molecule um , you know , embrace as a commercial entity has been very successful in in scaling some of their projects
EDL	00:06:45,198	00:07:00,669	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And I think some of the early development under ATCGhas has definitely added in that in that path and an imagination , I would say , in terms of of molecules and their commercial approaches been very good at the building , new materials
EDL	00:07:00,669	00:07:07,140	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And so using a certain hollywood monuments , for example , and thinking about new material that can be. 
EDL	00:07:07,640	00:07:16,100	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	At the heart of all this biosynthesis and ultimately larger scale bio manufacturing is the process of fermentation in microbes. 
EDL	00:07:16,450	00:07:19,400	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	That's the actual sort of liquid tanker
EDL	00:07:19,400	00:07:22,950	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	You put all your microbes and where you make it happy and you feed
EDL	00:07:23,430	00:07:31,858	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And it could produce a molecule and from there of an university purification of that molecules separating it from that liquid
EDL	00:07:31,858	00:07:34,330	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And those actual sales that produced. 
EDL	00:07:34,330	00:07:41,449	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Justice bureau is in baker's reliant microbes to convert sugar , it alcohol into generate carbon outside to live in bread
EDL	00:07:41,449	00:07:52,677	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Performers in the living founders program , genetically engineered eastern bacteria to ferment or chemically different kinds of starting molecules and two more useful molecules and materials
EDL	00:07:52,677	00:08:03,230	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Some of these transformations require the scientists to install a number of genes that govern the insect creation of entire bias athletes , the equipment of a new , tiny factory inside the cell
EDL	00:08:03,630	00:08:32,272	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	That's why the relatively new terms in federal biology applies here , and because it now is possible for researchers to mix and match thousands into an infinite variety of various synthetic passwords , the potential to turn microbes into living foundations for turning out molecules with different trades , and also seems to have vast potential in recent years of the program , researchers have produced , among other useful materials and biotics , drug criticisms , pesticides
EDL	00:08:32,272	00:08:40,820	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And he still feels filtering materials , mode , inhabitants and churches , catalysts for chemical reactions and article material , such as local crystals
EDL	00:08:41,150	00:08:48,150	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Synthetic biologist christopher avoid has been a principal investigator on the project at the boston based MIT. 
EDL	00:08:48,150	00:08:48,550	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	broader
EDL	00:08:48,550	00:08:54,332	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	I asked him as a leader in the synthetic biology and bio manufacturing to record what he saw
EDL	00:08:54,332	00:08:56,970	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Living founders added to the cause. 
EDL	00:08:56,970	00:09:16,600	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Living countries with unique and its focus on improving foundation of capabilities , underlying engineered biology , in other words , getting better a genetic engineering for the sake of genetics engineering without a particular application in mind as a result of these projects that were impossible in two thousand thirteen are trivial
EDL	00:09:17,130	00:09:34,474	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	He said , the fruits of this work across the upper program said it brings specific operational capabilities online from harnessing living cells to build infrastructure to converting plastic waste food to creating new domestic sources for various , as well as counter measures to handle the next pandemic
EDL	00:09:34,474	00:09:39,830	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The cells being built for these applications , use parts and methods from living countries. 
EDL	00:09:39,830	00:09:45,680	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Waiters referring here to a range of dark programs , engineering , living materials were armed
EDL	00:09:45,680	00:10:00,000	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	A program known as resource , one known as amber , which sends for environmental as a bioengineering resource , and one known as the pandemic prevention platform program , all share elements with a living founders programme. 
EDL	00:10:00,000	00:10:05,537	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And m it , we use these methods to build over thousands of new molecules in the time period
EDL	00:10:05,537	00:10:10,010	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	These include practice for energetics , monuments for residents in poland
EDL	00:10:10,010	00:10:15,672	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Targeting attacked microbes , absorbs obstacle coding , subscriptions and so on
EDL	00:10:15,672	00:10:22,225	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	One lesson learned , he said the rapid scale of biological technology remains a critical challenge
EDL	00:10:22,225	00:10:30,350	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	We cannot rapidly ensure yourselves , but moving from a few millions of leaders is challenging and slows and implementation in the world. 
EDL	00:10:30,350	00:10:40,062	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	When an achiever took the managerial biton over from renewed wages in twenty twenty , she knew it already had taken a lot of work for the program to achieve what it had achieved
EDL	00:10:40,062	00:10:44,370	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And she knew it would take a lot more to do with still had yet to be done. 
EDL	00:10:44,370	00:10:58,490	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So there were a watching sixteen initial performers under ATCG, and they have various projects for wearing links of time , ranges from academic loves , hollywood , institution companies
EDL	00:10:59,620	00:11:07,665	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And you know , they , they really spend the grounded of approaches , and they all have unique approaches and strength
EDL	00:11:07,665	00:11:19,334	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	But , you know , overall , it was their collective efforts that really kind of substantial hands , that fragmentation process of molecules and set the state occasion for MITamazons
EDL	00:11:19,334	00:11:25,510	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Imagine to pick that up in one thousand molecules and build a founder infrastructure that we have now. 
EDL	00:11:26,030	00:11:32,000	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	In the last few years , a piece of microbial design molecule making it by a manufacturing became furious. 
EDL	00:11:32,000	00:11:39,680	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Yeah , so by twenty nine team , the goal of making one thousand molecules with biology was met a full year at a schedule of the. 
EDL	00:11:39,680	00:11:53,064	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And the molecule count now , at the end of the project is well over sixteen hundred , thanks to the integration of automation machine , machine learning in other tools for scaling up to this kind of productive , the gallery of unique michael
EDL	00:11:53,064	00:12:02,250	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Malaysia has just been getting richer , and this success has LED to a very dark thing to ask yet more of the research , personal collaborators working on the. 
EDL	00:12:02,250	00:12:13,640	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	At that point , at twentieth , we were able to pick it and focus on specific molecules that could be developed further and tested for new do d operational capabilities
EDL	00:12:13,640	00:12:34,336	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So , so this meant that now we are looking to produce molecules for duty testing , evaluation partners at scale , and they saw a kind of testing they need to , so think of going from middle ground to kilogram amounts of a molecule or material , and depending on the application requirements
EDL	00:12:34,336	00:12:49,750	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And as a result of this , the program objectives in this have predicted away from broad demonstrations of capability , and they focused more on delivery of duty , relevant molecules , insufficient quantity for testing at duty facilities. 
EDL	00:12:49,750	00:12:59,980	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Participating in the suspended and face of the project had been performers at emergency emergency and MITroad with collaborators in navy , army and air force service liberty
EDL	00:13:00,380	00:13:10,042	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	They have been taking the molecule , making the material producing technologies , which performers delivered during the ATCGand one thousand molecules faces of the project
EDL	00:13:10,042	00:13:10,800	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Protest drives
EDL	00:13:10,800	00:13:16,990	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	We are talking here with stuff like tough materials for aircraft parts and higher performing liquid fuels
EDL	00:13:16,990	00:13:19,880	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Here is some audio evidence that this isn't just talk. 
EDL	00:13:32,120	00:13:42,738	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	It was manufactured information tanks by east , genetically engineered by researchers and embrace the textbook of the fuel , which normally would have been made with petroleum feet stock
EDL	00:13:42,738	00:13:50,610	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And that , he says , took place in china in california at the weapons division of the neighborhood center , known as knock WD. 
EDL	00:13:50,610	00:14:02,850	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So we are currently actually working with our partners at nowadays , and to advanced testing of some of the molecules that we developed two or three programs. 
EDL	00:14:03,180	00:14:09,410	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Senior challenger is head of research and development at armors and oversaw the work that LED to this new fuel. 
EDL	00:14:09,970	00:14:28,570	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The bottom line is that knocked wade and air violation , a lot of potential with some of these molecules that will previously not available and meaningful quantities , while , and we have been able to deliver larger and large volumes of these molecules for additional testing in advanced applications
EDL	00:14:29,300	00:14:48,060	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So , for example , the NOWDteam created a new field that they called by a renewable one or BRone , which is that it goes to nineteen percent , one , nine percent higher volumetric energy density than conventional jet fuel
EDL	00:14:48,060	00:15:00,560	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	In addition to the improved grammar , these improved will result in an increase in the operating range and good efficiency , foreign and increase and. 
EDL	00:15:01,550	00:15:05,430	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Believing fundraised program just keeps on giving us an achievement. 
EDL	00:15:05,430	00:15:25,233	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	From my point of view , this is the most crucial in the most exciting part of the whole program , right , because we are are demonstrating the real potential , all of engineering biological organisms to produce chemical materials , fuels and anything that it really has had a transparency of impact on on both duty needs
EDL	00:15:25,233	00:15:27,064	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And the writer by the economy
EDL	00:15:27,064	00:15:32,724	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So , you know , it is a powerful technology platform , and it can be possibly programed
EDL	00:15:32,724	00:15:33,856	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	You can scale it
EDL	00:15:33,856	00:15:36,120	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	You can adapt to changing environs
EDL	00:15:36,120	00:15:46,390	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Biology can software pair , so in a living foundation is able to address the development of the technology and infrastructures to really take advantage of this. 
EDL	00:15:46,390	00:15:52,055	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Key to the ongoing success and ability to keep building value on the new hardware capabilities
EDL	00:15:52,055	00:15:58,140	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Living factories has delivered , has depended on project collaborators who have been putting their own again. 
EDL	00:15:58,710	00:16:03,586	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So the scale up work and the partnerships with those duty teams have been fantastic
EDL	00:16:03,586	00:16:10,360	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	They are facilitated by both a discussion of funding from darker , as well as matching funding from those , the other partners
EDL	00:16:10,360	00:16:33,845	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	I'm so we are working with groups from army , from navy and air force to perform testing the regulation on molecules and english , the goal here is far for duty , test and innovation partners to develop tastes of these prototype models for the udi applications and advanced them to a stage that established military technology development
EDL	00:16:33,845	00:16:37,660	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Pipelines could then transition the technology and some day. 
EDL	00:16:37,660	00:16:45,371	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	That , by a sensitive field that knocked WDhas tested is one of the more mature examples to emerge from the living founders programs
EDL	00:16:45,371	00:16:53,320	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So far , the innovation ecosystem and its , perhaps the now send a great chance of the expanding and diversifying , both within an outside of DARPA. 
EDL	00:16:53,320	00:17:02,219	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Yeah , that's been great , because in addition to the m , it broad foundery of their great work , they've published a lot of that work
EDL	00:17:02,219	00:17:15,583	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	We were also fortunate to have two companies as performers , and so they serve as direct commercial transition partners , and they can incorporate technologies developed into their own commercial production pipelines
EDL	00:17:15,583	00:17:28,822	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And so we see that as a , as a great sort of wind coming out of this program , they're also been some examples of spin of companies , for example , there was one focusing on on violence that it perfectly designed
EDL	00:17:28,822	00:17:42,390	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And we are also proud to incorporate the embedded onto final initiative to help some of our academic performers look at potential commercial applications for the materials that they developed under living congress. 
EDL	00:17:42,390	00:17:47,030	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The embedded entrepreneurial initiative , or EEIis a new dark
EDL	00:17:47,030	00:17:55,940	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Its mission is to help researchers and innovators with promising , but early stage technology development ideas survive the privilege value of death
EDL	00:17:56,330	00:18:04,354	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	That's the orange phase when most start of efforts fail to get to the finish line before managerial , technical or financial obstacles , dry them up and take them out
EDL	00:18:04,354	00:18:22,242	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Meanwhile , also helping the cause is a commitment throughout the department of defence to transfer living foundry technologies from the lab to operational status last year for one , during the biotechnology for material and defense symposium , convened online by the national defence industry association
EDL	00:18:22,242	00:18:38,630	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Michelle rossel , then assistant director for biotechnology at the office , the undersecretary of defence for research engineering , said , quote , the same core competencies that can unlock production capabilities have the potential to transform military systems in ancient spaces. 
EDL	00:18:38,630	00:18:52,089	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Yes , there are combined efforts by a wide range of duty , agent , season and service branches to develop technology transition pipelines into the the audience who adopt the these emerging biotechnologies like this
EDL	00:18:52,089	00:18:58,440	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So I think he added to keep the delivery is developing founderies and really just biologically based platforms
EDL	00:18:58,440	00:19:05,100	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	Uh , I really can be able to will provide new materials and capabilities further for the do DNand the nation , frankly. 
EDL	00:19:05,570	00:19:08,980	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	For anti river living centuries in its completion. 
EDL	00:19:08,980	00:19:10,510	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	It is just getting started
EDL	00:19:10,510	00:19:23,950	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	So I think that in a post living foundry is the breath of report of products will only continue to expand , especially since commercial applications of this technology span across the biotech sector
EDL	00:19:23,950	00:19:28,480	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And for the duty , this will include continuing that development path
EDL	00:19:28,480	00:19:30,755	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	The others can imagine the solutions
EDL	00:19:30,755	00:19:34,850	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	There's been any new enhancements to military means , as well as. 
EDL	00:19:35,570	00:19:41,810	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	And that sounds like a textbook example of a double win , thanks listeners for sharing this time with me
EDL	00:19:41,810	00:19:49,750	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dirt up , thanks also to TOM shortage for his partnership and producing this program
EDL	00:19:50,720	00:19:58,206	| VfD E49 A Decade of Living Foundries |	For more information about the programs that dark is biological technologies of the snow is running , as well as about all of darkness
