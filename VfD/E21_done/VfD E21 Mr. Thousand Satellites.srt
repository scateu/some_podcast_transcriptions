2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:20,014
Stealth technology, the Internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation

3
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:22,482
Technology is a driver of our times

4
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:30,520
since its founding in 1958, in the midst of the cold war, DARPA, the defence advanced research projects agency, has been a driver of technology

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:40,030
Welcome to Voices from DARPA a window onto DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,250
My name is, Ivan Amato, I'm your DARPA host

7
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,495
And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio Mr. Paul Thomas,

8
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:53,093
known since his day one as "Rusty", because he arrived in the world with red hair.

9
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:59,825
Since september 2017, Rusty has been a program manager in the agency's tactical technology office,

10
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:06,830
which has a penchant (爱好) for pursuing audacious vehicular technologies for the air, space and oceanic domains

11
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:20,257
Already, Rusty has made his mission at DARPA to do what he can to develop new concept that will deliver more resilience, global reach and network connectivity, by way of new space systems

12
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:31,560
Rusty, join DARPA from DAQRI, an augmented reality services company, even though it does like a cocktail where he served as the executive vice president for global operations

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,410
He also held positions in a slew of commercial space companies, among them SpaceX as orbital scientist,

14
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:45,339
he has been in on the design and management of an amazing portfolio of space related programs, including the SpaceX dragon spacecraft,

15
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:58,169
the DARPA micro satellite technology experiment, or MiTex, the Iridium Low Earth Orbit satellite constellation and the US air force geo synchronous space situational awareness program

16
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,836
His initial training for all of this came in the form of a master science degree

17
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:04,907
and aerospace engineering from the University of Texas, Austin,

18
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:13,320
and a bachelor of scientific degree in astronautical engineering from Purdue University after I say, wow, let me say to you

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,501
Paul "rusty" Thomas, welcome to the Voices from DARPA studio,

20
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,160
Thanks, Ivan. It's great to be here today.

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,906
Thank you for having me.

22
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:23,810
Before we get started on your life adventure, on the forefront of space technology

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,590
I want to let listeners in on something that will not come through in your voice or words

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,910
At six feet, eight inches tall, you are among the tallest

25
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,490
people at DARPA, though we are markedly not even the tallest

26
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,020
It does make me wonder though, how you managed to fit into those thin shell when you were on the Purdue crew team

27
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:51,700
And if your fuel costs, when you fly your own Piper Dakota plane are higher than it would be if a 5'8" guy like me were the pilot.

28
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,840
Well, yeah, so it does cause me a lot of pain on airplanes these days

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,875
That is, that is true.

30
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:04,100
But I'll tell you, being tall was great I grew up in Indiana and I learned to play basketball for some reasons, I was kind of good at it because of that

31
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,170
So being 6 feet is a good thing over all, and I'll take it.

32
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,391
All right, well, one of the things I always want to hear from program managers who are with me in the studio is

33
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,700
where they got their start

34
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,347
And where the interest came from in science, engineering and technologies.

35
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,590
So I would put that question to you.

36
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,720
Okay yeah, great, when I'm an aerospace engineer

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,673
as you said, and like a lot of aerospace engineers, growing up in the 70s, early 80s, really saw what NASA was doing. My grade school had

38
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:37,440
has special readers where you can go and see the history of what NASA done even back in 60s

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,170
And I remember what was the point over those in great detail when I was a kid.

40
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,873
But the real kick for me became a career day that my schools have been made great,

41
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:50,049
where they actually pulled my father in, and I realized my dad, mechanical engineer

42
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,817
and his grandfather, his, my grandfather, his father, a civil engineer,

43
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,850
had been doing some pretty interesting things are entire career,

44
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,414
and they were staying on the cutting edge of of what was going on my dad's work for General Electric in the plastic industry

45
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:04,497
when that was getting big in the 60s and 70s,

46
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:08,890
and my grandfather worked for northwest and put in all the air fields

47
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:16,607
And when they are doing the Orient, pacific routes through the, through the 40s and 50s, he also helped design the LaGuardia Airport,

48
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:21,970
so had two generations of engineer behind me and at that career day

49
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,311
I actually have my dad was one of the people presenting,

50
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:28,222
and he walked through the different types of engineering,

51
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:29,790
and at the bottom of a list was aero space.

52
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,694
I did not know that was an option and all of a sudden clicked for me

53
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:37,154
that aerospace engineering is something I could do,

54
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:42,939
and I could focus on it and continue on and do what I thought my dad was doing in terms of, in terms of really innovative

55
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,960
things and in new concepts that could be set forward

56
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,940
So with that, I was in state for Indiana and Purdue was a great school

57
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,550
So I jumped at the opportunity and got accepted there

58
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,200
So while at Purdue we had quite a few amazing professors, one of them

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,343
Professor Andrisani would give us talks about how you could do no better in your career

60
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:09,486
as an engineer, especially if you stay on the cutting edge and advance technology advance what humanity can do

61
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:11,001
Look back at my head

62
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,835
Those words have run with me

63
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:14,650
for the last 5 years, kept moving to

64
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,320
where is the most advanced technology and

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,020
how can I help the most.

66
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,090
Well, those sound like two great lines of influence

67
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,930
I mean, you know, a dad, a teacher like that

68
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,433
And wow have you went with it.

69
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:32,101
so one of the things that I would like you to do here, is to take our listeners on a kind of Whirlwind (旋风) tours,

70
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:35,490
you can't really dwell (详述) too much on any one thing you done

71
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,080
I mean, your CV is just one of the most amazing documents I've ever read

72
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,920
[Thank you] But if you can take us for a Whirlwind tour on your experience in the commercial space.

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:55,110
Commercial space, absolutely. so I did an internship at a small engineering services company, and we've, I've got to work on NASA with with a space shuttle back at late 80s.

74
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,349
But what really got me going to commercial side was right after graduate school,

75
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:02,446
I got the opportunity to go to Motorola, it was firing up the Iridium lowest orbit

76
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:10,007
constellation proliferated (激增), lowest orbit satellites that were cross-linked and providing global connectivity in her planet

77
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:14,622
And this was a large constellation. - very large, 66 satellites plus spares (备用)

78
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:23,406
So the goal was to build one satellite per week and launched the entire consultation of of 70, 80 satellites, including the spares in one year

79
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:24,631
Never been done before

80
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:31,293
And to do that, we're gonna use a large number of launch vehicles, and Motorola has never designed a spacecraft before

81
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:34,051
So they put all that together and and back in

82
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,960
80s, 90s was this happening

83
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,293
The motorola had really good plan

84
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,203
They pulled in a lot of experts

85
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:41,900
They pulled in subcontractors

86
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,340
like Lockheed and Raytheon who were experts in this area.

87
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,094
They put together the team, and we ended up building at a rate of one spacecraft every 4.3 days.

88
00:06:51,094 --> 00:07:00,100
We launched from 3 continents in just over, in 8 days, 14 satellites, we launched off all the satellite in about 18 months.

89
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,143
And actually before you move on to some more of your commercial space experience,

90
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,776
I remember just talking with you at another time

91
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:17,900
when I am perhaps I think was on this project, you already in project which took around the world to some of the other space cultures out there, like in China and an in Russia

92
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,636
So I'm just wondering if you can compare and contrast a little bit of the kind of space cultures,

93
00:07:22,636 --> 00:07:29,110
and that, you know that that, you have experience being part of the hours here, and then witnessing those elsewhere.

94
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,523
Absolutely what the first I noticed is, when you get in the other country,

95
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:36,713
any other location is doing a Rocketry (火箭学) or spacecraft design,

96
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:41,846
You really gonna cross it as a type of engineer that you can relate to really well.

97
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:45,400
the people that do that are very similar no matter what culture they come from.

98
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,120
I was very amazed how quickly you can make friends with

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,132
the Russians and the chinese, anybody who was who are actually launched

100
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:55,079
'cause we were launching on the Protons rocket seven at a time with the Iridium,

101
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,730
and we were launching two at a time on the chinese rockets

102
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,425
five at a time on Delta II, which is our main launcher out of Andrew,

103
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:07,418
I would rotate between the lanuch bases in California, Baikonur Kazakhstan,

104
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:09,411
where the Proton rocket was launched,

105
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,951
also would go to Moscow for the integration meetings,

106
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:17,090
over to Beijing for the Chinese integration meetings in Taiyuan for the launch base is there.

107
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,881
It was very interesting program, and really, I found it, the Russians and chinese.

108
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:25,801
While Russians invented rockery, as we know, just the same time we did,

109
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:27,293
China was coming up to curb

110
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,619
They're getting faster as an incredible rate,

111
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,238
They're getting better at an incredible rate.

112
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:33,920
And I found that both Russia and China

113
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,190
Their cultures were less analytic than the American aerospace culture.

114
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,590
They were very much driven by test, build, test, build, test cycles.

115
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,320
And I found that really in the commercial space here in US.

116
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,475
We're serve pretty well admitted those type of things,

117
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,946
when you move out of the analytics

118
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,402
Don't spend year to trying to figure out exactly how to optimize a problem,

119
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:55,530
but build something that maybe sub-optimal tested and use that result to go to the next phase

120
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,470
so we see analytics, I think of of, modeling

121
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:08,130
so one thing we really, really... one area we are really, really good at in the US is very good computers and very good computer algorithms

122
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:15,702
that that let us analytically predict what a rocket would do under structural load or under guidance, navigation control algorithms,

123
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:16,570
which is great

124
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,380
but it doesn't really tell you everything that could possibly happen during the flight

125
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,480
Whereas a flight actually does tell you that.

126
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,033
Before we move off of this little a block what you are describing,

127
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:30,690
this international framework for getting so many satellites up in such a short amount of time.

128
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,188
Share with our listeners, a kind of funny experience that you had

129
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:37,970
with the Russian team when they were trying to figure out what

130
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,410
they should actually call you. - That's a great joy

131
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:40,690
Thank you

132
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,530
So, when I started working at Motorola, we would have every other month

133
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,000
We would have a technical interchange meeting

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,540
We need with either the Russian launch team or the Chinese launch team

135
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,696
So you have one each month.

136
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:54,053
When the Russians would come to town or we would go to Moscow,

137
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:58,136
we would have the stereotypical long tables with all the Russian, on one side,

138
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,152
and all of us on the other side and the translators.

139
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:04,410
When they asked, and we introduced everybody, they got to me

140
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,310
and I said, my name is, rusty thomas, they stopped the meeting real briefly

141
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,850
and they started talking to translators, and they came back and

142
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,039
said is that your real name? And I said, well, Paul is my real name

143
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,493
I was born Paul Thomas named after my grandfathers, but since the second or third day around Rusty has been a nick name.

144
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,467
And they went back and talk about this

145
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,000
It, okay, we get it, Paul, Parval, that is a good name

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,020
We're gonna call you Paul.

147
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,510
And and I said that's fine, some people would call me power, but most people here at Morotola

148
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,786
know me as Rusty, and they ended up in coming back and saying

149
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:41,680
Well, we're going to call you Paul, and the reason as we've discussed it, and and we don't have a nickname rusty here

150
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,800
in Russia, we don't feel comfortable calling anybody corrosion (腐蚀)

151
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,990
So, so they decided not to call me corrosion

152
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,340
And I was Paul from there.

153
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,730
I had been Paul on and off.

154
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,413
Since since, like,

155
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:55,240
okay, because of that, it was smooth working team

156
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,787
So now I want to take you back to that Whirlwind tour of your experience in commercial space

157
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:01,731
that I wanted you you to do

158
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,148
But I took you on a diversion (转移注意力, 消遣, 改道)

159
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:04,251
So let's get back to that

160
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:06,400
You, you talk a little about the Morotola experience now moved from the world.

161
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,181
Motorola was great. Then I then I moved up to Seattle following words, the most advanced technology happening.

162
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:17,620
Seattle in late 90s was, was really happening place for a lot of reasons

163
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:29,310
They had also a new company that was founded, called TeleDesic has some money coming from Bill Gates, Craig McCaw, tightens in the communication and computer industries.

164
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,750
And they wanted to build a global lowest orbit satellite

165
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,642
constellation, to do broad-band communication, called TeleDesic.

166
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:45,340
We got pretty far into that design, but the technology at the time wasn't quite there miniaturization (微型化), as we know it today really wasn't there

167
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,270
And the dotcom crash of 2000 and 2001, made it really hard for us to get a financing

168
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,213
So we ended up not going forward to that program,

169
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,270
even though we had got a FCC license for a lot of spectrum

170
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,840
And I had really good chance to be a major success.

171
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,131
And it was at the space of a very compelling architecture

172
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:13,400
And moved from there, engineering services in San Diego had a really good time of some of the early days of UAV, predetering Global Hawk

173
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:23,410
got to be consulted down there for the early UAV designes, and then moved to orbital sciences, where I got into the government side a little bit.

174
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,614
And then after it keeping the commercial side going.

175
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:30,412
after the orbital sciences curb, I went to SpaceX, I was in 2011,

176
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:36,436
and worked as a senior director for Dragon production, building the capsules that go to the space station

177
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:42,343
So it has been five years there and had just an amazing, amazing run, putting on those

178
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:51,722
those capsules up also got to work on the landing legs, and .... play a good part in those historic landings of those first ages.

179
00:12:51,722 --> 00:13:02,230
Right, and just weeks really before this discussion are having now, a Dragon capsule did arrive at the international space station for a resupply mission

180
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,000
So when you see that, I mean, how do you feel knowing you had been part of that

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,440
Intense pride, absolutely, that that was at a turning point in how we do...

182
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,786
how we do space missions, how NASA contracts for for things, how NASA moves forward,

183
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:22,480
the technology gets the cutting edge, develops it and then can move that technology

184
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,231
to companies like the SpaceX and others of the world, who can then use that to build a commercial case

185
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:29,850
and then allowing us to move on to the next place.

186
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:39,860
When I was at Space X, we went from doing one rocket a year, one dragon every year, to four, five, six dragons per year

187
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,930
And now the spacecraft was ramping up (上升) to 20, 30+ launches in the given year

188
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,095
It's really been an incredible time to see that

189
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,961
approach to how you do commercial space turn on and become

190
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:56,390
reality and then become a success, and then become really a major success.

191
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,410
Where it's at right now.

192
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,680
Okay, so you sort of, told the story we already hear of

193
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,513
you kind of growing up professionally,

194
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,875
along with the commercial space sector,

195
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,205
which is just kind of amazing thing to think about.

196
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:11,683
But you then made a decision to say yes,

197
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,654
when, when the offer came through to become a program manager here.

198
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:22,382
I'd like to hear that the sequence of events that lead you in this stage of your career from that the commercial activities you been in,

199
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,571
and now here, as a first year PM.

200
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,260
- absolutely. - Program manager

201
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,930
By chance I happened to in the early 2000s and be talking to some friends at orbital sciences

202
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,600
And they said, there was a very interesting program [...] enough, was called MiTex

203
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,030
I didn't know much about it, it was a DARPA program

204
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,949
It was classified what the experiments were it was, oouh we are not allowed to know it existed. The time it was used to DARPA

205
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:48,627
experimental program to do a demo of the technology,

206
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:52,145
and orbital was looking for people who had my type of background,

207
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:56,430
a little bit of commercial, but also had the right tickets so they could do, do the work

208
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,257
And and they brought me out for three-month stint (规定工作时间),

209
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:02,793
and I would just gonna help do some analysis for that spacecraft

210
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:08,835
I did some analysts, and after three months, look like DARPA was going to continue the program,

211
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,316
orbital wanted to keep expanding,

212
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,891
so they asked me if I would stay on as a manager

213
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:17,930
for the, for the design of that. so I got to run the design of the of the MiTex spacecraft.

214
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,110
And so I stayed in orbital for not three months, I ended up staying for about 8 years

215
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,154
And during that time frame, we work through the MiTex spacecraft

216
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,533
I got to do the design and build

217
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,863
We actually took it through integration, launched it

218
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,505
And I went out to Schriever Air Force Base as a vehicle engineer

219
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:39,196
and got to be on council of flight for about a year and half.

220
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:41,362
so it was a really good experience

221
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:44,610
I, It wasn't commercial. Commerical, it was about government

222
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,400
taking commercial approach. As orbital is, was a very commercial company

223
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,862
And and this was an experimental process that wasn't a strict requirements driven program

224
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:58,232
It was there to prove some key technology that we could use in space.

225
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:02,028
It was was successful, and I, as very proud of the of the results there,

226
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,243
that kind of got me into what DARPA can do.

227
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:14,390
DARPA can step into an area where, where there might not be a set need, or a set said requirements are a set funding line

228
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:20,488
and say this is technology that would really help the warfighters, help the country in significant ways,

229
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:24,605
and and we are gonna say, we're gonna do a demo, we're gonna proof that this is possible,

230
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:28,338
the the proof is here, if we can actually spend two or three years and some money

231
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,160
to actually get a demonstration of a running

232
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,654
that opened my eyes to what you could really do outside the commercial world,

233
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,902
but still using commercial approaches as much as possible,

234
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:44,389
So followed on from there and became a deputy PM on the GSSAP we mentioned earlier

235
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,910
Geostationary (同步轨道) Space Situational Awareness Programme (GSSAP) is air force programming of record

236
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,765
now that is doing very well

237
00:16:51,765 --> 00:17:02,510
It's up in GEO, and it is acknowledged but it has very, very, very good capability, and it is doing, getting a lot of good feedback from the people use it

238
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,940
So the GSSAP program are very successful

239
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,241
And after it got to the critical scientific review,

240
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:15,390
I happened to have the opportunity to to go to Space X, they were just firing up what I've already talked about that it was

241
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,480
It was a wonderful 5 years at the end of that

242
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:28,872
I was at Daiquiri during the operation's job of setting up the augmented reality global operations, manufacturing for the what's going to become a revolution

243
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm a positive, argument reality's gonna be a very, very big thing.

244
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,219
And just a two sentenced description for listeners,

245
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,560
you might not know what you mean by augmented reality

246
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:48,312
augmented reality is the ability put on glasses that will augment the information that you are seeing, real information, with computer generated 3D graphics that that actually will float in space

247
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,873
You can put text, you can put graphics, you can put anything you want.

248
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:54,220
And it was is going to be contextualized around

249
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,439
actual objects in space.

250
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:58,459
It was not virtual reality where locks you out, and you don't see anything

251
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:02,300
In argumented reality, you actually have, still see the people in the room

252
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,600
We still see all the objects.

253
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,025
But it's adding information.

254
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:14,010
And I have seen, I think, a multisyllabic phrase for this, software-defined holographic, light control, is that related to what you talking about?

255
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:22,320
It's advanced versions of argument reality and DECARY had some of the most advanced holographic light control technology out there.

256
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:31,326
Okay, so now my suspicion is confirm that you actually are are going to develop this star[..] enterprise at some point in your career.

257
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:36,710
The holo tech is out there. OK. - So, getting back to how you actually got to DARPA.

258
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:44,116
That final turn to get me back as program manager became when the concept of the blackjack consultation, which I did not come up with

259
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,594
It was already been formulated by experts here

260
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:49,006
And we'll talk a little bit more about that right after this

261
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:55,735
- great, so DARPA contacted me and said, we're going to go forward with a proliferated, Low Earth Orbital architecture

262
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,926
to start to change how we do space missions, right now

263
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:02,362
We do space missions with very exquisite, very capable satellite,

264
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:06,592
that actually cost a lot of money, so therefore we can't build very many of them

265
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:13,091
And the Low earth orbit, proliferated approach that Iridium did, back with the communications in the 90s,

266
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,010
and TeleDesic was trying to do

267
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,787
And other companies have taken it forward, is a different approach to put

268
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:24,807
smaller, lower costs and and in some ways expandable,

269
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:26,769
but not as expendable as low reliability

270
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:30,326
But the key element is small and lower-cost satellites

271
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:35,694
that are in very low earth orbits so that you can cover the entire earth with coverage,

272
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:37,503
and like we said earlier, was 60 or 70

273
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:43,830
satellites will usually do it to give yourself constant coverage over the earth and DARPA

274
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,723
let me know if they were going to move forward with an experiment to try to

275
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:56,566
move into augmenting what these exquisite satellite can do with a LEO, low earth orbit proliferated constellation,

276
00:19:56,566 --> 00:20:00,030
when that opportunity came in, I came in, gave a talk

277
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,381
and it was a match made in heaven.

278
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:07,540
because it sounds like through ten thousand people in the world [heheheheh] that seems to tailor made this kind of idea

279
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,854
I really do think in terms of match, in terms of what the DARPA wants to do

280
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:16,110
with a, what these type of consolations can do in the future.

281
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,600
And in my background is a really good match and

282
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,230
I'm very excited to be in this position.

283
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,510
And its timing is perfect.

284
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:28,820
Let's talk about Blackjack in a little bit more detail, tell me a little bit about, you know, the kind of the elements of that

285
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:35,060
And even before we start that, can you tell listeners and me where the name comes from?

286
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,506
Sure, the concept of of a Blackjack that instead of having sensors in space

287
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:50,488
that might come out of one or two or three this points of the sky, you could potentially put smaller sensors in many locations

288
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:57,570
Give the destroyers or the surface action group, commanders of the war or the army commanders or air force

289
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,989
anybody could build it to look over the horizon

290
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:05,918
with a small number of discrete sensors that they actually dot the sky in some ways,

291
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:12,348
well, if you go to a casino, and you look up, you see on the ceiling, you see all the little domes,

292
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:17,776
those little domes are all tiny little sensors, and they are making sure that nothing bad is going on, right

293
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:23,320
So the concept of Blackjack is to follow that distributed sensor approaches as you see  in a casino

294
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:31,255
You don't have one or two large systems making sure that everything is working okay and making sure that there are no cheating going on in the casino.

295
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,875
And just just for the record for our listeners, we do need to point out the DARPA

296
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,310
does not get all of its ideas from Las Vegas.

297
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,000
we don't get it all, but probably more than we should maybe

298
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,230
yes, absolutely

299
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,455
So the name came from the someone playing Blackjack would have the distributed sensor set around them,

300
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:52,660
so it is kind of a tongue-in-cheek (随口) name, but, but it was a good name and a good idea crossing

301
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,440
We give our talks at what we're doing

302
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:02,075
So Blackjack is just as they said a Low Earth Orbit consultation of sensors, that we're going to leverage and

303
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:09,856
key element of this is leveraging the commercial space as they talk my career in the past is, you can do things very quickly

304
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:13,337
You can do things very efficiently with a commercial approach,

305
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:17,058
Now, let's not to say the government approach, how we've procured things in the past is always bad

306
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:25,710
but in some cases, you don't get the optimal solution, and you could do things in a lower cost and a faster schedule if you tackle in a different way

307
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,860
So what the ideal Blackjack is it try a different approach

308
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:38,705
use low earth orbit, use proliferated commercial satellites, especially the buses where we will marry military payloads to those commercial buses

309
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:41,250
and then start flying a large number of them

310
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,766
so you can give that proliferated (激增) global constant custody constellation (星座),

311
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:50,090
and I say, constant custody, that means for a commander wants to look at a given spot on the earth

312
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,570
He can point the sensor to that spot immediately, because it is gonna be a satellite over head at any given time.

313
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:58,262
Okay, and you use the words that, in a way we hadn't been heard before. Proliferated.

314
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:00,769
Just want to make sure I understand what that means in this framework.

315
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:06,245
Proliferating means multiple points in the space and spread out over the surface, you have to accept an open space, of course

316
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:10,826
So any person on the, on the ground is going to be able to look up, see a Blackjack satellite,

317
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:14,080
with the full constellation developed in the sky at any given time,

318
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,250
and that's the end of the reciprocal (互惠的) approach works that

319
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,430
if the Blackjack satellite is always going to be able to see any point of the earth

320
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,395
at any given time.

321
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:26,879
right, so it's interesting, there 's some aspects sort of GPS-like system,

322
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:36,683
and that you got many satellites working in a kind of coordinated fashion, delivering amazing kinds of data that would not be possible otherwise.

323
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,593
Here we are actually talking about a lot more than the several dozen [..] GPS,

324
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:43,000
talk just a little bit more about

325
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,278
the various kinds of challenges that are part of this project,

326
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:52,970
one of them certainly is, is producing almost mass, producing very rapidly,

327
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,080
a lot of satellites,

328
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,050
And so you had to talk about your experience there, but there's also going to be coordination

329
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,460
There's going to be command and control

330
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,645
What are some of these other elements that you can talk us about?

331
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:06,747
Absolutely so first, yes, your analogy to the GPS is 100%

332
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:11,485
That is a proliferated constellation, but it's about at a medium or medium-high altitude

333
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:16,639
with Blackjack we wouldn't go very low, 500 kilometers to 1200 kilometers,

334
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:21,020
so arranged that that's just about the earth's atmosphere for these satellites

335
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,279
And and the trick is going to be building such a low enough

336
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,624
You are gonna need more satellites and what a GPS satellite, GPS consolation would need

337
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:32,970
So to do that, you're going to need mass production and to do that, you have the cost right

338
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,657
You going to need to build them, and on very short time scales

339
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:40,251
with a minimal amount of assembly intergration and test

340
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:45,020
and to do that, we're going to bring it as much commercial approaches we can

341
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:53,149
we've had an industry day, a very positive response from from over 130 companies signed up for the industry day

342
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:57,521
And we had overturned 75 folks who want to come in and listen to us

343
00:24:57,521 --> 00:25:03,652
So we believe that that approach of going with discreet, low-cost nodes in space

344
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:09,392
that are almost expendable, not all expendable (一次性), but almost is going to be achievable,

345
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:15,220
and we're going to use that commercial and commoditized approached to the buses

346
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:21,188
and bring that to impedance match to the military payloads that will go on those buses also

347
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:26,158
the other key element of this and you in a little to that a second ago is that we don't,

348
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:35,557
if we're gonna launch hundreds or or more thousands of of the satellite, we don't want to require teams of multiple people per satellite monitoring them.

349
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:44,830
Right now, of the exquisite satellites have excellent teams of people on the ground who are making sure everything that that satellite does is monitored

350
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,810
They're gonna analytically predict beforehand what the response of any new script they're gonna send up, that gonna happen

351
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:55,370
It's an excellent approach, but we really want to get a autonomy into the Blackjack architecture

352
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,160
And when I say autonomy, I mean, how does the mission control work?

353
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,346
How does resource planning work?

354
00:26:01,346 --> 00:26:07,889
How does the payload in terms of what it seem work in terms of, can you move instead of raw data down to the people on the ground

355
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:12,000
Can you vectorize the information and contextualize it what was important.

356
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,612
Okay, one of the other interesting things about the Blackjack program to me is

357
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:27,000
because you're not putting multiple billion dollar jewels up there, large just tremendously expensive assets that need to stay up there for years and years

358
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,180
here, you can do what I guess, much more frequent technology refresh, I presume some of them can be done through software

359
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,090
Now you can just wait as we were always upgrading

360
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,835
our various applications on our computers,

361
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:42,936
but this also does give you some opportunity to, you know,

362
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:51,100
without breaking the bank putting up actually, new generations of these small satellites and still having them work within the Blackjack consolation.

363
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,580
Yeah, yeah

364
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,641
And and they're 2 areas there that are very important, and we're gonna chase both of those on Blackjack.

365
00:26:57,641 --> 00:27:08,797
first is, if you're individual nodes low earth orbit, your launch costs is lower than going at higher orbits, the weight is less, and the cost of individual satellite is less

366
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:13,811
So we're aiming for an on-orbit cost of six million dollars per node, per Blackjack node,

367
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:19,302
that includes a launch cost, which means that if you have a problem with one of those satellites,

368
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:23,660
you can launch another one replace it for not a huge amount of money

369
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:30,404
And the second piece, is the ability to do on-orbit over the year updates of the software

370
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:36,690
We're gonna put large processors, I call a Pit Boss once again going with a Blackjack approach

371
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,590
Tried the Pit Boss is the brains on each one of the of a Blackjack nodes

372
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,967
It's going to have a terra-flop-class processor on it or more,

373
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:48,862
and it's gonna to allow us to put a lot of algorithms on space

374
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:53,058
and not only put a lot of algorithms in space to do the work up there with the edge computers

375
00:27:53,058 --> 00:28:00,000
But it's also gonna, we are gonna launch more processors, capabilities than we need for the first generation, because we expect to get better and

376
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,665
better with our algorithms, and algorithms typically need more and more processor

377
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:12,422
So if you can, we talk about our work to Space X, my, my boss there also found another company called Tesla, and one of the really gool, cool models of Tesla

378
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:16,038
is, you have a car, and you might come out and in the morning,

379
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:20,228
and it's done an over-the-air update, and you have a better car the next day than you did the prior day,

380
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:24,785
because they updated the software, so I'm going to follow that type of approach,

381
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:32,328
putting a lot of extra capacity for the processor, so that as the algorithms get better, you get a better spacecraft essentially for free

382
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:37,350
Although, of course, you have to pay for algorithm update, but in terms of launching a satellite, you don't need to

383
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:48,460
and I imagine you also have to think about end of service when you talking about so many discrete parts that are in Low Earth Orbit, means, sounds like to me these are gonna be deorbit in some way or another

384
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,176
Have you given that thought?

385
00:28:50,176 --> 00:29:00,000
absolutely, given that thought. And that goes back over the Motorola Iridium constellation, every Iridium satellite has the ability to deorbit itself at

386
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,524
the end of his life, it has a small amount of fuel reserves left.

387
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:06,667
Those fuel reserves aren't used for anything other than the deorbit,

388
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,448
and has enough redundancy and electronics on board,

389
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:12,400
so that it starts to have problems with its primary mission,

390
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,005
it can fire the thrusters and bring itself down,

391
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:20,928
so that approach has been proven successful with with the Iridium in the commercial consultations

392
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:30,530
We are gonna follow the same approach of Blackjack, and I believe there are numerous FCC filings for mega constellations of communication satellite gonna be out there.

393
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:38,970
That'll have launched even more satellites and Blackjack, they're going to be good stewards, I believe, of low earth orbit also, and put in the ability

394
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:44,813
So that is a satellite ends its operation, like all get replaced with a better tech refry for satellite,

395
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:48,000
it will immediately turn on the thrusters and deorbit and burn up,

396
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,215
usually over the south pacific or somewhere relatively benign (不危及生命的), the satellites don't make a back down

397
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:57,347
They burn up in the high atmosphere during the re-entry and make a wonderful shooting star

398
00:29:57,347 --> 00:30:00,680
If you happen to know where it is [haha]

399
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,290
So as you think about it, this is amazing to think about this is all the pieces, and you can have additions of a program

400
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:18,254
It is either one or two things about it that stands out in your mind, as maybe, particularly a rich, even we're kind of DARPA program in technology speaking.

401
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:19,080
yes,  - and logical speaking

402
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,410
Absolutely, so that the biggest reach, I believe, is the amount of autonomy we'd like to put on this spacecraft

403
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,597
I've given a metric that if we lose the ground control,

404
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:34,540
Let's say we have a comms problem, or the some type of interference and satellites aren't talking to the ground

405
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:43,596
I want them to be able to operate at least for 24 hours as a constellation, talking to each other through their systems and managing the resources

406
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:47,467
, managing the mission and still providing whatever in the fact

407
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:54,001
or our set of information, the warfighters that the people downrange need without that ground infrastructure,

408
00:30:54,001 --> 00:31:01,522
so that could be interesting, and I say the matric is one day, but really, my stretch goal is to get 30 days continuous operations

409
00:31:01,522 --> 00:31:08,561
without talking to the consultation, while it still performs its primary mission to whoever needs to have that information that is generating

410
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:14,045
So putting that in the place is also significantly leap forward from the current operations

411
00:31:14,045 --> 00:31:24,710
We have an operations control center at ground, making sure the satellite health and safety and the mission is being managed properly to one, or you don't even have a human being in the loop

412
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,239
You moved the man, you go for a man, men in the loop to men on the loop.

413
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:39,683
the people do in the management are there to make sure and watch and adjust priorities as necessary of course, but not there to make a second by second or minute by minute decision

414
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:43,260
I have the spacecraft operate what they do, that's a really hard but ...

415
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,216
So a fair amount of autonomy but always with human beings

416
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:50,979
there as shepherds and in the loop in someway. - absolutely

417
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:54,820
- so you're a first year program manager

418
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,436
Typically, program managers are here for several years, three to five

419
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:01,900
I have had people here in the studio of who have done

420
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,370
several tours of duty as well

421
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,850
So people like it enough to say they come here

422
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,500
They do one tour of duty, they go away

423
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,240
they come back.

424
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,780
I'm just wondering if, as the first time program manager, with a program of this complexity and size,

425
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:23,381
what do you think this one program is going to be enough for you to satisfy your, your technology interest, and just because it's going to be so hard to do

426
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:26,900
Or are you already imagining taking on additional programmes?

427
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,944
I'm actually already, imagine taking on additional programmes

428
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:35,164
that goes back to my theme of how to get to the most cutting-edge element of whatever you do in a career,

429
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:41,967
Blackjack is gonna be a major program, I believe, it's gonna be a huge success, and it's gonna really lead a pivot (支点) to low earth orbit

430
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:49,005
But once you start working in a low earth orbit regime and once DoD and DARPA start working and putting these systems into place,

431
00:32:49,005 --> 00:33:01,280
I can envision many other programs that will leverage this type of architecture and that success will come out of Blackjack once we build this global mesh network, this, this mesh this internet in space, space ARPAnet.

432
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,140
How can you use it to actually benefit the people on the ground?

433
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,734
And I think that's lot of programmer

434
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:12,157
and I just, I just want to point out to listeners that, even though Rusty, is talking about a program like that, it is,

435
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:21,530
it does not mean that it is automatically going to become what he's gonna have to really jump through a lot of hoops (磨练), and come into a lot of people and that's something worth doing

436
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,254
So this really is essentially glimmer on the eye

437
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:29,665
become a program, so that's one, I mean, it sounds like you migit have even more idea

438
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:40,653
Yeah, I, got a few, I I I have been spun up with augmented reality on what you can do with light control, holographic light control is an area of high interest to me

439
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:47,553
I believe that we are approaching that point where the Holo Dex, or in other words, not reconduct things that appearing,

440
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:57,191
but the ability for systems to a transmit holographic light, phase-control the light and project in a way that you are immersed in a reality that that isn't real,

441
00:33:57,191 --> 00:34:02,010
but it's seen real, because your eye is getting fed the same information

442
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,740
It would be if the object was actually there

443
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,158
I believe that type of light control just around the corner,

444
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:11,336
and there is a good chance going to revolutionize

445
00:34:11,336 --> 00:34:19,283
how we do interaction with computers and interaction with even people in the same way that the transistor revolutionized how we do computers

446
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:24,925
And I think that's are coming the next five, twenty years, and I really hope to get DARPA .. move in that direction

447
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:31,350
as you released in the potential applications of that training just poped into my eye  - Training is a huge, in fact not just training

448
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:39,189
But if, if you are deployed, if a military person is deployed, and you can have a holographic surgery

449
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:50,257
show how to fix somebody in your deployed, or in a very remote area, you can actually train somebody in real time to how to do something, because they can see it in 3D, right in front of them as it's happening

450
00:34:50,257 --> 00:35:00,000
while there are doing a medical procedure, training for welders (焊工), training for other industrial applications becomes, becomes much more advance

451
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,395
of asked if they already done the

452
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:10,000
Study showing you can train somebody anywhere from two to ten times faster with augmented reality tools and in holographic light approaches

453
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:19,494
If you, because your brain is, is, is programmed to absorb information from 3D context, much faster than you are with someone talking to you or reading in a book

454
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:22,237
So you see it, you absorb it faster

455
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:26,030
So I think training is going to be an area that could be revolutionized.

456
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,680
Another thing just came to mind, what is ergonomic sort of discovery

457
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,312
So you might have a space you want to figure out the best way to arrange things in that space with this kind of technology

458
00:35:36,312 --> 00:35:40,470
be able to test out of thousands different ways, very efficiently, cheaply.

459
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:46,760
One of my early early crip moves was that the internship we're gonna to work on, on NASA projects

460
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,378
And we will would be developing 3D CAD at a time when 2D CAD was the standard

461
00:35:51,378 --> 00:36:02,690
Computer Aided Design. Computer Aided Design. and that three dimensional CAD allowed you to mark up engineering parts, and and then do fit checks, virtual fit checks,

462
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,503
making sure the parts wouldn't interfere with each other

463
00:36:05,503 --> 00:36:09,434
And that was a huge boom forward. It really changed how engineering design, the mechanical design

464
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,400
I believe the same thing will happen

465
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,060
All we need start doing this with the interactive, collaborative tools that'll allow everybody who walk in and see what's happening in 3D space without even needing a

466
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,837
computer screen [...] them,

467
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:34,230
and then there is one other kind of technology project that you work, which also just represents to me, just how many thousands of thousands of technology engineering issues there are when you really thinking big

468
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:44,503
So you also were in on the design of the CRANE operation for mating satellites, going into, kind of, vehicle dispenser components.

469
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:47,640
right? after just one of the many, many things.

470
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,840
So this was an interesting invention

471
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:59,587
We worked as two or three of us at motorola, the problem that we had, was that Motorola was pitching the ship-and-shoot approach a spacecraft you finished on the production line

472
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:14,306
It went into a shipping container, said on a dock [contel], where the Russian proton or the Long March, Chinese Long March, or the, or the, the McDonnell-Douglas Delta II folks needed another set of satellites, and that those launched campaigns wound go and

473
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:15,925
The Russians need seven

474
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,081
And that was the case

475
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:22,400
We would call FedEx and FedEx showed up at the Sky Harbor Airport

476
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,310
We will load two or three satellites at a time

477
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,430
They would fly into the Russia

478
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:30,870
would loaded them up, and then we get them out to the launch base, and we wanna put them on a rocket within a day or two

479
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,030
And and that's obviously not help

480
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:39,940
I&T is done right now, and it .. satellites we were looking for very fast cycle times, very quick process flow and to do that

481
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,480
We needed to mate seventy satellites that are very close to each other, accurately and quickly

482
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:56,220
So we put together a CRANE, so I think we call the Swing and twisted eliminator, which mounted to the floor of the Russian integration hall in Baikonur

483
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,100
And every satellite would be brought in vertical state attached to this

484
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:08,214
And then the Russian, Ukraian, normally would swing these around a little bit, as it moved in, because you didn't have any other neighbours,

485
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:14,010
you never get a satellite tried next to you, but on the dispensers, there were 7, like wedges, there were all very close to each other

486
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,260
So you had to control the twist and the swing

487
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,870
We got to the point

488
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:26,461
We can make three of the satellites per day and have all the entire dispenser of seven satellites ready to go after three or four days of processing,

489
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,210
and then they would be fueled and be ready to launch

490
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,000
Okay, so on top of everything else, you are a CRANE guy.

491
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,690
So you know, you're working on things

492
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:42,365
that many of us would, consider to be kind of science fiction, technology fiction, though you can make these things real.

493
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:47,550
Are there non-space technologies that you just go nuts about?

494
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:53,447
Non-space, well I'm gonna stay in aerospace, without the space, Let's go to aero.

495
00:38:53,447 --> 00:39:02,406
And I do believe that the transport of human beings as those planets is going to get to the point where we are going to be able to move at the hypersonic scale,

496
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:09,290
and in the not too distant futures, not in the area of research for myself, but I'm exceptionally interested

497
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:14,841
I guess, curious on how we're going to get some new technology that seems becoming online world-wide,

498
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:27,150
to the commercial space and how we might start moving people from, from, from, say, New York to Sydney in hours instead of the 12 or 14 plus hours it takes right now.

499
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:35,352
I think the very high speed transport, which I guess that it doesn't hit your mark, because you will probably have to go into space a little bit.

500
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:46,642
during part of that flight, but I still see some very high speed flight, supersonic, high supersonic speed flight has been a area of interest of significant potential, in the next ten to fifteen years

501
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:50,640
And I think there's gonna be some teams that are cracking open a little bit.

502
00:39:50,640 --> 00:40:00,000
And so sort of, ironically, thinking bigger than this way to make the world a little smaller in the sense of [...] for any point A at any point B, in a much shorter time than  - That's right.

503
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,456
Blackjack will give you the mesh-network and

504
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:04,740
communicated at broad-band and for connection that moved the people.

505
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,850
That's going to be the next step up.

506
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,690
So Rusty,

507
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,850
You are technology developer

508
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:16,916
You been doing that your whole life but you also have taken time to get into the more of the mineset in the setting of the war fighter,

509
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:21,658
the war fighters who you are trying to server by bringing more capability

510
00:40:21,658 --> 00:40:27,270
Can you just share a little bit with listeners about your experience in that context?

511
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,813
absolutely so I've been a reservist for United States Navy since 2004,

512
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:38,974
and as an intelligence officer, I was lucky enough to be selected to go to naval special warfare intel school

513
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:49,430
and actually went out during the surge to Centcom areas, Desert areas with the SEAL teams that help do targeting and high value targeting

514
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,276
We did pretty good job.

515
00:40:51,276 --> 00:41:01,506
We got to go to move, move through are those areas and picked up, but quite a few of the Al-Queda mid-level operatives and put them away.

516
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:14,950
So for, I still active, I drill down in a little creek on every month, very important part of my life, although it as a reservist (预备役) is secondary.

517
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:25,590
But I also imagine that, that boots on the ground experience now, as a program manager, completes the kind of Luke for you that not all program managers can have

518
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,560
I think it does help.

519
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:39,180
The area that it helps the most in is when you're downrange with a special force, special operators, the amount of band with the amount of sensing you can get the distant amount of communication you can do is very limited

520
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,176
You're typically moving data through a soda straw.

521
00:41:42,176 --> 00:41:46,370
And what I'm trying to do, as a program manager here is to give those type of deployed

522
00:41:46,370 --> 00:42:02,141
Sailor, soldiers, marines, whatever they are, the ability to move data at a much higher bandwidth, and to get data from sensors at over the horizon, not necessarily organic or unit immediately within seconds back to where they are at without having to go through infrastructures

523
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:11,680
So seeing how it is operated when I have been, downrange is really help shape hell, set up the technology to for the future of what DARPA can help you with the next generation.

524
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:23,757
Well so Rusty, you've taken me and listeners on an amazing tour of, you know, someone who has been the absolute thickest part of these last couple of decades, which is evolving in space technology

525
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:26,180
so I wanna thank you for doing that

526
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,360
It's really been a pleasure.

527
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,020
Well, thank you

528
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,850
It's been ...  I've had a great career

529
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,390
I'm happy to be at DARPA and looking forward to what the next doorstep to break down

530
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,720
And where we're gonna be, gonna be cutting edge next year.

531
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:47,077
And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us, I hope you join this again for the next Voices from DARPA,

532
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:54,056
