EDL	00:01:11,936	00:01:13,728	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So thanks Paul for spending some time with me today
EDL	00:01:14,496	00:01:15,264	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Thanks very much I have
EDL	00:01:15,776	00:01:22,176	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To give him the project you're overseeing here and which we will talk about in just a little bit I'm intrigued by several ass
EDL	00:01:22,176	00:01:23,456	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Aspects of your background
EDL	00:01:23,456	00:01:26,272	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	If you can talk a little bit about those and do they really come to mind
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:30,368	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And I'm all that you have a degree that combines psychology income
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:33,440	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Computer science is not a degree in computer science is not a degree in Psych
EDL	00:01:33,440	00:01:33,952	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Psychology but it's

EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:46,496	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Between
EDL	00:01:46,496	00:01:50,080	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Humans and machines in his case in the realm of Art
EDL	00:01:50,592	00:01:54,944	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I'm hoping that you can talk about those two things in other aspects of your background
EDL	00:01:54,944	00:02:00,832	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That would help us understand how it is that you ended up here at DARPA and why you are pursuing the sorts of projects
EDL	00:02:00,832	00:02:01,344	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Since you are here
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,136	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Yeah well

EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:11,328	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Think back to the
EDL	00:02:11,328	00:02:12,608	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	1970s
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,656	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	When
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:19,776	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Not everyone had a computer there weren't laptops there wasn't an internet some people had computers
EDL	00:02:20,288	00:02:21,312	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I'm computing
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:22,848	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Was
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:26,432	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I thought points of the metaphor of our times
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:31,808	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Just a steam engines and electricity and other technology it's would have captured
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,112	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The imaginations
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:37,952	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Scientists and Poets throughout history
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:38,976	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The computer
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,512	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Took on that room
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:43,072	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And many people
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:44,864	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Certainly my dad
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,400	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Later me
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:48,960	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Started to think of the computer
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:51,776	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Has a way of thinking about
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,080	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Other things how to make art
EDL	00:02:54,080	00:02:54,848	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	How the mind works
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,920	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We started to think we'll maybe it's a computer
EDL	00:02:57,920	00:03:01,504	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Or maybe computational processes could do those things
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:05,088	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But there's always paying attention in AI
EDL	00:03:05,600	00:03:08,416	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Artificial intelligence artificial intelligence
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:10,976	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Between whether you're using the computer
EDL	00:03:10,976	00:03:12,768	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	As a model of what humans do
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:14,304	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Weather
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:18,400	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know you're just modeling a new kind of intelligence
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:19,680	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It's machine intelligence
EDL	00:03:20,192	00:03:22,496	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I think what's happened over the last 30 years
EDL	00:03:23,008	00:03:28,128	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is that all of us who started out interested in using the machine as a model walk humans do
EDL	00:03:28,128	00:03:32,480	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I've now sort of come around to the fact the machine intelligences own kind of Intel
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:37,344	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Artificial intelligence these states actually has very little to do with humans
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,880	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You say that that
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:40,928	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Remind me again of that combined
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:43,744	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Not agree so talk to me a little bit about about that
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:49,888	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Will it I mean yes I have a combined degree inside cognitive psychology and computer science
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:54,240	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But remember that was in the late 1970s
EDL	00:03:54,240	00:03:55,776	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We didn't even know what
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,568	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Call that thing then it's
EDL	00:03:57,568	00:04:00,128	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	More recently been called cognitive science
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:03,712	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I attended the first cognitive science conference
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:05,760	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	UC San Diego undergraduate
EDL	00:04:08,064	00:04:09,344	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But but
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,648	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know I was using the machine to study
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:12,416	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Human
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:12,928	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Thinking
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:17,280	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Nowadays when you talk about combining
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:18,303	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Human
EDL	00:04:18,303	00:04:19,327	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And machine
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:21,119	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Thinking you really telling about something else
EDL	00:04:21,631	00:04:22,655	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You're talking about
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,959	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Machine intelligence
EDL	00:04:26,495	00:04:28,031	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Its own kind of intelligence
EDL	00:04:28,799	00:04:35,199	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Meshing well with human intelligence its own kind of intelligence you're not talking about one trying to emulate the other
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:36,735	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	A model the other orthodox
EDL	00:04:36,735	00:04:38,783	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Stand in for the other you talking about
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:41,087	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Too premature kinds of intelligence
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:45,695	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Call listening to the kinds of interest you have in the directions you taking this is this
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:46,975	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Does remind me
EDL	00:04:47,743	00:04:49,535	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That your work really connects with us
EDL	00:04:49,535	00:04:51,071	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Kind of long history here
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:55,679	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Add doorbell and trying to really find out how the human intelligence
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:56,191	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Jensen and artificial
EDL	00:04:56,959	00:04:57,727	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Just so you know
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:05:01,055	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Yes that's exactly right and
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,359	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I think for really long time
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:07,199	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	People have viewed the machine role episode of a power tool
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:10,015	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So the machine is going to
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:12,831	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Do the very heavy
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Front work
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:15,391	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What's the we don't want to do it
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:18,719	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Proofreading it'll sort of surf the web riddle
EDL	00:05:18,719	00:05:20,511	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But it'll always do what we tell it
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To do right and where did the phrase data-crunching comes to my side crunch
EDL	00:05:26,911	00:05:27,423	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	No doubt about
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:30,751	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Who's in charge and why the machine is doing things we
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:34,079	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So that's being their attitude towards machines machines are
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:36,895	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know they're there like the tools in my toolbox
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:42,527	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	They act on my Direction They simply amplify what I want to do
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,295	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Now
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,063	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I want to change that
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:50,975	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And my communicating with computers program has as one of its tenants that the machine must actually
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:51,999	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	They have something to say
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:53,023	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And something to contribute
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,119	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The machine is going to be creative the machine is going to do some work
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:58,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	On its own
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:00,703	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Forts for its own reasons
EDL	00:06:01,471	00:06:03,007	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What I didn't count on
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:04,287	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is the enormous
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:06,335	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Cultural barriers
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,359	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To that view of machine
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:09,919	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Even within my own program
EDL	00:06:09,919	00:06:14,527	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Explain a little more you know within my own program
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:18,367	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I do want most program managers do I say let's pick
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Some
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,671	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Use cases or
EDL	00:06:20,671	00:06:22,463	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Applications that will
EDL	00:06:22,463	00:06:27,071	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know really drive this technology and so you say to all of these superb scientists
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,375	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Tell me about some applications
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:31,935	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And all of your applications they come back with
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:33,727	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Have the machine in the role of a servant
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,287	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	These are the best scientist in the world

EDL	00:06:38,335	00:06:43,711	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Imagine the machine was actually doing something for itself and it really takes a lot of effort
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:48,319	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To think of machine says you know autonomous intelligences
EDL	00:06:48,319	00:06:51,391	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Well and I think you've gone so far as to
EDL	00:06:51,903	00:06:53,183	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Challenge some of your
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:55,743	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Performers those who work with you on the
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,791	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	This program to even think about the machine

EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:04,191	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It's a right almost like they're in a in a jazz group together we could talk a little bit about
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:04,959	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That's
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:09,055	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Yeah well actually jazz is a very interesting form of communication
EDL	00:07:09,567	00:07:11,871	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Very very similar
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:13,663	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Conversation insofar as
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:15,967	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	They're they're pretty strict rules

EDL	00:07:33,631	00:07:34,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What was Finding
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:39,263	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is that when you look at a short poem that is written both
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,311	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Buy human and machine
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:44,639	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And you show that poem to another human
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:50,015	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That person isn't so good at picking out which lines were written by the human and which were written by the machine
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,319	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I would consider that a metric
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,855	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I think it is symmetric
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:57,951	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Given that this is a program communicating
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Wizz computers
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:01,023	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The program within DARPA
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,607	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Defense Advanced research projects agency
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,679	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	How do you imagine this new way of communicating with
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,215	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Computers assuming that your Altima lease
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,727	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Successful
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,287	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Will how will that change
EDL	00:08:12,799	00:08:13,567	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Apps away
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:15,359	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Those in the in the
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:16,127	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The world
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:17,407	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	National Security
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,431	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Relate to computer
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:19,199	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Those are used on
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,247	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Yeah well I think what one
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,039	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	One has to realize
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,551	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:27,647	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The modes with which we communicate with computers today
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Omar
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,743	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Extremely unnatural
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,047	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Very very cumbersome
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:40,191	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Can you still give me things like keyboards keyboards but actually if you want a computer to do something
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:41,983	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And you said I have two choices
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You can either
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:45,055	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Be a programmer
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:47,103	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And most people aren't
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:49,151	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Or you can use
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,223	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	An interface that's been designed by
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,991	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Programmer
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,295	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You can point and click and swipe
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:56,831	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Some things like that
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,135	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And neither of them is a
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:01,183	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Every natural way
EDL	00:09:01,183	00:09:02,719	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Of interacting
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:03,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	With the machine
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:06,047	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	One of the
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:09,119	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Just on that point so natural for example here we are
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:12,191	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Talking I'm looking at you I'm paying attention to your facial expressions
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:15,775	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I'm very gestural when I talk so you can see
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,335	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I might have to going all over the place is that what you mean by Nacho
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:19,359	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Communication
EDL	00:09:20,127	00:09:20,895	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Baidu
EDL	00:09:21,407	00:09:26,271	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But the sentence I just said I do is also offered during a wedding
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,319	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But it means something completely different
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:30,111	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Here
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:31,647	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Send it does a little wedding
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:32,671	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And that's because of
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:36,767	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And there has never been a good account
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:40,095	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Computational theory of contact
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,887	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The wood support
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:44,447	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Human machine communication and that's really
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:46,495	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The biggest technical problem
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,543	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In the communicating with computers
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:49,311	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Program
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,359	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It's a natural communication
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,639	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Depends on context
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:57,503	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And we've got to be able to represent contacts other When I Say I Do
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:09:59,295	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You don't think that
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,319	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I want to get married with you
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,391	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I'm upset
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:11,839	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So how far along are you or your performers which is sort of DARPA speak for those who end up
EDL	00:10:11,839	00:10:12,607	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Working on Pacheco
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:13,375	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Project
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:14,143	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:15,423	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Getting machines
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,471	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To handle contacts
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,751	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Text to be able to discern Conte
EDL	00:10:18,751	00:10:19,519	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Text in the case of
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,055	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What wherever there's an I do
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,079	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Were you just saying
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:23,103	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I agree with you
EDL	00:10:23,103	00:10:24,895	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Versus I want to marry you
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:26,175	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	How far
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:26,943	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	How long are they
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:27,711	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Well
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:31,551	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Weaver pek 3 big problems to work on
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,319	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In the program
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:33,343	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:37,951	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	One of the things that distinguishes them is the amount of contacts that's available
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:40,255	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And the amount that has to be inferred
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,303	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So the simplest problem
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:43,839	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is to build
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:48,447	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	A sort of a castle out of wooden blocks on the table top
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,263	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And the contacts that's available there
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:56,639	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is available to any computer vision system or to any human who can see
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,919	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You can actually see the blocks
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,479	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So when I say at another one
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:03,551	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You can see what we're talking about the context this right there it's
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:04,063	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Accessible
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:10,207	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Then the second big problem we're working on is having humans and machines collaborate
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:12,255	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To build
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:16,351	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Very complicated models of biological systems
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,655	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And there
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:20,447	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The context
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:22,495	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is maintained by all kinds of
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,543	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Clever machine visualizations
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:29,663	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know this molecule talks to that molecule and here's a great big network of molecules
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,455	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What's the third use
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:35,295	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Yes of a third use-cases this improvised ation kind of used
EDL	00:11:35,295	00:11:36,063	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Case and there
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:41,183	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The problem is for the context is established by the by the notes of the musician plays
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:43,231	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Oh by the words that a person says
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:44,511	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And nothing else
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,815	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Just as in this conversation
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:50,143	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Context is established by the words and nothing else
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:53,471	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Not a hundred percent true right
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:55,007	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We both have shared
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,799	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Common experience
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:58,847	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So
EDL	00:11:59,871	00:12:02,175	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Context is established by the words
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,735	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And this enormous background of human knowledge
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:08,063	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That turns out to be extremely hard for machines
EDL	00:12:08,575	00:12:10,111	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I have low expectations there
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:14,207	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Machine for example would not know why
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:16,255	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Baidu
EDL	00:12:16,255	00:12:18,047	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In a particular context
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:21,119	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It's funny because it just doesn't know anything about
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:28,543	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Get married and what you know it just doesn't feel right I said what I'm waiting for now is the greatest metric metric of success
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,823	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	For me will be when when
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,591	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Paul you
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,383	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	From your program we get
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:33,919	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	First
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:34,431	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Comedic
EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:39,551	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Let's Segway then into your other projects at the moment
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:40,575	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Big mechanism
EDL	00:12:41,855	00:12:42,623	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Well
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:48,511	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Why are we doing big Magnuson we are doing it because I am terrified
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:51,327	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That our reach exceeds our grasp
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:53,887	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We are
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:59,263	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In the state of human history where we can
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:01,567	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Interfere
EDL	00:13:02,079	00:13:02,847	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	With
EDL	00:13:03,359	00:13:04,639	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Systems
EDL	00:13:05,407	00:13:06,687	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That we don't understand
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:07,967	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,759	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That's okay if
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:14,879	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You're making some small experiment in your lab and you have to blow your lab up
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:17,951	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But it's not okay if it's the climate
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Or the economy
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:22,559	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Or any of the other huge the stones on which we depend
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,607	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So what's the problem is that
EDL	00:13:25,375	00:13:30,751	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We have really no good way of anticipating the effects of actions taken and very very complicated cyst
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:34,079	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So big mechanism is a program
EDL	00:13:34,079	00:13:36,895	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To develop technology to help humans
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,175	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Build models
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:39,455	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Of complicated systems
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,247	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Models of
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:42,783	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Unimaginable complexity
EDL	00:13:43,551	00:13:44,831	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Things That No human
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:45,855	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Possibly build
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:46,367	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Alone
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,159	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Okay and I think
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,695	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	One of the ways that
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,231	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You are hoping
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:53,023	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Computers will be able to do this
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:54,815	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Gets a little bit back to
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:56,607	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That sort of data crunching
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:59,423	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Brute Force aspect but this is
EDL	00:13:59,423	00:14:04,031	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Right where maybe a computer could go into the scientific literature and read a hundred thousand
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,079	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	A million papers that are relevant
EDL	00:14:06,079	00:14:06,847	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Does something like maybe
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:10,431	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Oncology the onset of cancer or something like that something that
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:11,967	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	People can't do right
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:13,503	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Exactly what we're doing
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:17,855	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So talk a little bit about that ability to kind of look at the
EDL	00:14:17,855	00:14:21,439	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Information sphere in ways that just impossible but then
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What will the computer
EDL	00:14:23,487	00:14:24,255	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Be able to
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:25,279	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Gather from just
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,559	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	All of all of that information
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,887	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Well so let me first describe what
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,679	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What was actually built and then
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,215	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And then I'll come back to you
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:33,727	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	2 question
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,519	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What we have now is
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,591	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Big collections of programs
EDL	00:14:38,591	00:14:39,359	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:41,407	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Read the scientific literature
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:42,687	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Temperature in
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:47,295	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Cell signaling biology cell signaling is all of these molecular processes
EDL	00:14:47,295	00:14:48,063	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Mapreduce
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:50,111	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Effects in cells including cancer
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:52,159	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Machines can read those papers
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,207	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	At the moment
EDL	00:14:54,207	00:14:55,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And as you said can we Hunters
EDL	00:14:55,487	00:14:56,255	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Thousands of paper
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:14:58,815	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And out of every paper
EDL	00:14:58,815	00:15:01,887	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The machine extract a little piece
EDL	00:15:01,887	00:15:03,423	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Of biological mechanism
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:09,823	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know this molecule phosphorylates that molecule or binds with this molecule that kind of thing but every paper
EDL	00:15:10,335	00:15:13,151	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Really talks about only a couple of little things like
EDL	00:15:14,175	00:15:16,991	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It may be a 10-page paper but the main results is like
EDL	00:15:16,991	00:15:17,503	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Tiny
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:19,551	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So after you read
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:20,831	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	300000 papers
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:21,855	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You have
EDL	00:15:23,135	00:15:24,159	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Half a million
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:30,815	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Tiny little fragments of a big complicated mechanism it'll. Little picture pixels of what might be a picture
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:31,583	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That's right
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Now you have to put it all together
EDL	00:15:33,631	00:15:35,679	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And so that's the second big step
EDL	00:15:35,679	00:15:39,775	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In Big mechanism is to assemble all of these fragments into a biologic
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,287	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Medical model
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:44,383	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Third step is to reason with that biological model to solve problems
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,175	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	How would I drug this cancer
EDL	00:15:46,687	00:15:47,711	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:51,295	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	This is giving me a sense of where
EDL	00:15:51,295	00:15:52,575	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Our two different kinds of intelligence
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:55,903	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Who's really come together because we like to be able to tell
EDL	00:15:55,903	00:15:56,671	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Stories
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,695	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We like to have
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:15:59,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Causal explanations mechanism
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,791	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Why things happen in the world
EDL	00:16:02,559	00:16:05,631	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And we are sort of good at that but we are not
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Great at at
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,703	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Seeing how a hundred thousand
EDL	00:16:09,215	00:16:10,239	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Points
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,007	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And.
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:11,775	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Connect
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,799	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We can see how
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,823	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	1020 + 30
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:15,871	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Where's the computer now
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:17,919	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Can bring in a hundred thousand points
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:20,735	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But if we're working with Attitude say
EDL	00:16:20,735	00:16:24,063	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Computer look at those points and also tell a causal story
EDL	00:16:24,575	00:16:30,975	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Then we're beginning to kind of work together am I getting yet a little bit of what you're seeking yeah and I want to be clear about why
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:34,047	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I think this is revolutionary and to do that I want to go back
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:34,815	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	2
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:37,631	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The 50s when DARPA was started
EDL	00:16:37,631	00:16:38,399	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Does a response to
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:38,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Sputnik
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:40,959	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The United States
EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:41,983	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Began
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:49,407	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To emphasize sciences and Engineering for the United States also started to reward specialization
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:50,943	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In The Sciences
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:54,015	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And we've gone to the point now
EDL	00:16:54,527	00:16:55,295	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Where
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:59,135	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I can't understand what the guy in the office next door
EDL	00:16:59,135	00:16:59,903	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Does
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:03,231	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We have become highly highly highly specialized hyperspace
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,999	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Hyper specialized
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:08,095	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The speed at which we read has not increased
EDL	00:17:08,863	00:17:10,655	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So we read more narrowly
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:12,703	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Now here's the problem
EDL	00:17:13,983	00:17:16,543	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The world's existential problems
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:18,079	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Do not fit
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:21,663	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Neatly into any one academic Department
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,991	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	They are systemic problems
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:28,575	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Am I can't think of a worse way
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,111	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The song of a systemic problem
EDL	00:17:30,623	00:17:32,159	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	When to get a bunch of people
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:35,743	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Who are experts in the tiniest aspects of that system
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,559	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What we need is a big picture
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:40,607	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And
EDL	00:17:40,607	00:17:42,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Where humans can't machines must
EDL	00:17:42,911	00:17:43,679	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And humans can't
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:47,263	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know I'm doing well 320 papers week
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:51,871	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But in order to understand the system I need three three hundred thousand paper
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:54,687	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So this is very interesting and in a way which you're saying if you look
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,479	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Even just a structure
EDL	00:17:56,991	00:18:01,087	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Of a university or even a company you have sort of departments
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:06,207	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And Amber we're almost institutionalizing an inability
EDL	00:18:06,207	00:18:09,791	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To synthesize in this very broad-based way that your suggest
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:12,351	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But the institutions continue to sort of
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:14,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Put us into these compartments words you're saying
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:19,775	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We now are in a place where we can combine our desire to synthesize with
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,055	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The powers of computer tab
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,591	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	For new kind of bug
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,639	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Era of synthesis new kind of scholarship
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:29,503	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That's why I view it as revolutionary it's not just that a machine can read a large number of paper
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,575	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It's the by doing so we have a chance
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:33,855	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Just a chance
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:37,439	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Understanding the systems on which we depend for our survival
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:39,743	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That really is exciting to me
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:46,143	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But as you know there's a great dialogue going on in society now about you know what it means for
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,423	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Computers to get smarter
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:47,935	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Where to get more into
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:49,727	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Get smarter like us
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,799	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And intelligent like us were smarter or intelligent in their own ways
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:56,639	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And this brings up some concerns it brings up excitement and concern
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:59,455	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I'd love to hear what you're excited about
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:00,735	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	As
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:02,015	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The computer the ball this
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:03,551	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In fact as you have a role in that
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:05,599	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And also what gives you some pause
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:07,647	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	If
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:11,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	People understood just how little machines were capable of
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,071	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I think
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:15,583	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You wouldn't be
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,607	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Hearing
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:18,911	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So much of the snow
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:22,751	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	There are, but I just want to push back a little bit there because it's a 19
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,799	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	48
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:29,663	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Bell Labs rolled out a single transistor it was an ugly looking thing
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,223	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And now you can get a chip
EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:34,527	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That has billions on the on something yet
EDL	00:19:35,551	00:19:36,831	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Fits snugly in my
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,343	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	My palm
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:39,647	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Those are Worlds Apart
EDL	00:19:39,647	00:19:41,695	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	There was nothing much that little
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,719	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Single switch could do
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:45,535	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And maybe do something in the telephone system
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:50,143	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Initially and now we have microprocessors that do we know Wonders on
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,935	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Even on our home computer so
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:52,703	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:55,775	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	If we add time to to the picture here
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:01,151	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Do you still think the people do not have justification of some concerns
EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:05,759	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I think the people are right to be concerned
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:06,271	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	About
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,087	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Fielding new technology
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,879	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Second
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:11,391	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Do harm
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:13,951	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know self-driving cars
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:14,719	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Could I suppose
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,023	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Get people into traffic Act
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:17,535	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Accidents
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Corsodyl
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,631	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What are the solute
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:25,983	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The reason I'm not all that concerned
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:29,567	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is the this is not by any means the first
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,335	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Time
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,383	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The society has come to grips
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:35,967	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	With threats posed by new technologies and we've always figured out
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,527	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	How to deal with those threats
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:40,575	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In one way or another
EDL	00:20:41,087	00:20:42,111	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Society
EDL	00:20:42,623	00:20:43,903	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Finds ways
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:45,183	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To offset the cost
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,487	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Associated with new technology
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:49,535	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We simply build it into the cost of doing business
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,863	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Not till we learn how to manage the written we manage the risk
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,447	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And that reminds me of some specific ways DARPA
EDL	00:20:56,447	00:20:59,519	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is working to manage the risks of a coming era
EDL	00:20:59,519	00:21:00,543	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Artificial in
EDL	00:21:00,543	00:21:01,823	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Intelligence and machine learning
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:07,455	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I'm thinking here of programs like explainable AI which your fellow program manager
EDL	00:21:07,455	00:21:08,735	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	David gunning is running
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:12,319	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And in that program he's got the goal of
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:15,647	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Developing artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
EDL	00:21:15,647	00:21:16,416	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	That
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:22,816	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Not only produce results and gather data and make decisions to help you and partners manage and operate the
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,352	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Complex systems in our world
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:28,448	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But they are systems that do this in ways that are transparent to the humans in the loop
EDL	00:21:28,960	00:21:32,544	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And that way the machine Behavior remains understandable unexplainable
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,080	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	At least in theory crustable
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:40,992	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I want to move away from specific programs and asked you about
EDL	00:21:40,992	00:21:41,504	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	DARPA
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,808	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	As a
EDL	00:21:44,576	00:21:50,720	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Part of the overall Innovation ecosystem and and what I'm thinking about there as other elements in the
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:53,792	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Tamar say academics
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:22:00,704	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	About her fundamental source of questions and doing maybe fundamental research getting new data that hadn't been out there
EDL	00:22:00,704	00:22:01,472	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Before I'm thinking about
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:03,776	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Entrepreneurs were thinking about how to
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:05,824	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	How to apply science in into
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:08,896	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And turn that into various that small and large
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:09,408	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Technologies
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:12,480	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Answer weird DARPA fits into
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:13,760	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	All of that
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:18,112	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Dash in in as we sit in the very beginning and Beyond being a driver
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,624	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	BowTech
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:23,488	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Well of course darvaza very distinguished history is it
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:24,256	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The driver of
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,280	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Technology
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:28,096	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And we we could talk about why it's being so so
EDL	00:22:28,096	00:22:28,608	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Successful
EDL	00:22:29,376	00:22:32,448	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Then maybe I could related a bit to my personality
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:36,032	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Experience which side work for DARPA as a warmer
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:37,568	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	For 30 years
EDL	00:22:37,568	00:22:39,872	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Before coming here as a program manager
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:40,896	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:44,992	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I have to say you know I thought I knew DARPA pretty well
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:48,832	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But it wasn't till I got in the building that I realized I was a really icing
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:51,648	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	A pretty narrow slice of what DARPA does
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,416	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Starbucks
EDL	00:22:52,416	00:22:55,744	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Sits at the intersection of government-industry Academia
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,280	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And other kinds of research
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:23:00,096	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And it brings it all together it's it's
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:02,144	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It's got this a big picture
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,680	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Of how Innovation happens
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:05,472	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I in the United States
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,776	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And it's been very successful
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:11,872	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Making it possible for everybody to do what they do best
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:15,712	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know the words that goes on in academe it tends to be if I might
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,296	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Say a little conservative academics
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,320	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I don't know
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:22,624	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	People will be surprised to hear this but I think academics
EDL	00:23:23,136	00:23:25,696	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Tend to be pretty conservative in the problems they
EDL	00:23:26,208	00:23:27,744	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	They they taco
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:31,072	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Siddhartha's role in Academia is often to say
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:33,888	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Let's take on something that's impossible
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,448	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And we're going to pay to get it done
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,776	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You know so that's what that sort of the message to Academia
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:41,568	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Of the message
EDL	00:23:41,568	00:23:43,360	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The government is look what's possible
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:46,176	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We just changed your view of what what
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:47,968	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	What technology can do
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:51,040	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Think about how you can use it think about how you can
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:55,136	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I use it to achieve DARPA's mission of creating an
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:58,208	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Avoiding strategic surprise
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,768	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Write and listen to you talk about
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:03,584	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Darkest place in The Innovation ecosystem in
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,632	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And moving technology forward it also
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:08,704	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Reminds me a little bit of what you were saying
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	About
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:10,752	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Big mechanism
EDL	00:24:10,752	00:24:14,080	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In bringing forth a new kind of synthesis nubility
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:14,848	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You take many different
EDL	00:24:14,848	00:24:15,616	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Four categories of
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,640	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Nothing can bring them together
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:22,528	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	One thing the DARPA seems to do is to bring communities together that do
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:25,088	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	In ways that might not be
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:28,416	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Very easy for the performers in their own institutions
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:32,000	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But here is a program manager you in a way I can bring together 5/6
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:33,536	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Performers together
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:35,072	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And create a community just didn't exist
EDL	00:24:35,584	00:24:40,960	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	So we talked about Altra specialization a moment ago and you just use the word disciplinarian and
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:42,752	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And I got really interested in the word
EDL	00:24:42,752	00:24:44,032	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Interdisciplinary
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,824	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Because
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,128	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It occurred to me that I heard it everyday
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,920	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	At the University
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:51,712	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	I might hear it never
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:52,480	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Adorable
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,832	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And I've come to view the word interdisciplinary as
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,136	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Standing for a problem
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:00,672	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Not standing for solution
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:04,000	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And the reason that we don't hear that word of DARPA
EDL	00:25:04,000	00:25:05,024	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Is that
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,048	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	We just take it for granite
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,120	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Everything we do at DARPA is interdisciplinary
EDL	00:25:09,632	00:25:16,032	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	All of my teams are interdisciplinary I have machine reading people I have linguicide biologists
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,568	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	It's just taken for granted
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:21,664	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Right I mean I look at the P&R pyrite the projects
EDL	00:25:21,664	00:25:22,944	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Which is another way of thinking about it
EDL	00:25:23,968	00:25:28,320	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Problem driven way of going about R&D so if you have the end
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:31,648	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Part of an endpoint in mind you don't know exactly where you're going because
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,672	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	He's our Leading Edge
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:33,696	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Areas
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,720	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	But you have some sense
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:36,256	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Then
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:37,024	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Really
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:43,424	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	You're not saying this is a biology problem or a physics problem or an engineering problem it's just a problem that has to be solved
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,704	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	No matter what
EDL	00:25:44,704	00:25:47,008	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Mindset or skillset you need to bring in
EDL	00:25:47,008	00:25:49,824	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And it turns out that that may be a huge variety
EDL	00:25:49,824	00:25:51,872	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Yeah when people get to the project
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:52,896	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Hyundai
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:59,040	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	They're trained in machine learning on suddenly a cancer biologist is up there speaking
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,088	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Their eyes get big in the room cats
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,600	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Quiet
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:04,672	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And after a few weeks
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,184	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Or Mom
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:06,464	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	There
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:07,488	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	The happiest people
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:10,048	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	Because this is the way science should be done
EDL	00:26:10,816	00:26:11,584	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	And
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,352	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	They got
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:14,400	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	To participate in that kind of science
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:21,568	| Episode 05 The Mind Mixer |	On that note I think we we've run out of our time for this discussion though I'm going to be eager to follow
