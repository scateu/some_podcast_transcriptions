EDL	00:01:57,760	00:01:58,784	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Thanks for joining me
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:02,368	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I'm happy to be here thank you
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:04,416	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So let's start out by talking about
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:07,488	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How you became interested in science in general
EDL	00:02:07,488	00:02:09,280	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And then particularly
EDL	00:02:09,280	00:02:10,560	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In physics and the
EDL	00:02:10,560	00:02:11,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Antics of life
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:15,936	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	When I guess that you know mean I started being interested
EDL	00:02:15,936	00:02:19,264	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Because my father was right to me articles that he was
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:23,104	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Interested in in a magazine that he was getting delivered at home
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,896	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The time you want to start as he was getting
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:26,176	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	John's RV
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:28,736	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Which was a French magazine about latest
EDL	00:02:28,736	00:02:30,272	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Discovery Center of Alamance
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:32,320	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And he was reading this to me when I was like
EDL	00:02:32,320	00:02:35,904	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	7 radius also I'm universal very early start so
EDL	00:02:36,416	00:02:41,792	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That was the beginning and then we'll clearly I mean in science has always been appealing to me
EDL	00:02:42,304	00:02:48,192	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And I we were getting additional magazines that harm you know that I was very obviously reading on
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:54,336	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I remember reading once about shredding the equation in even though I was like 10 or 11 at the time and I didn't know what he meant
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:03:01,248	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I knew how to write it down in the deepest parts of the Quan
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:04,064	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Car mechanics in uncertainty makes me think that your parents were
EDL	00:03:04,576	00:03:07,136	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Scientist or engineer my father was a doctor in engineering
EDL	00:03:08,416	00:03:09,184	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So
EDL	00:03:09,184	00:03:09,952	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But yeah
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:15,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Clearly I mean I was reading in this magazine as I said you didn't understand what equation man
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,352	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I was staying
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:18,912	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But I still was able to write it unit 2
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:24,032	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	If it wish I was able to draw this equation on paper
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:29,664	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And it is a Edwin but it's from that era so I mean I was very fascinated by this and clearly well you know
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:30,944	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Time went by
EDL	00:03:30,944	00:03:36,576	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	It was good in my head that I was going to go for a career in science I didn't know exactly what I say
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:43,488	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Shirley Burch Olean Amina became very very interested in the electronic properties of materials
EDL	00:03:43,488	00:03:44,256	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In my
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:45,792	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Interest when
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,328	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	From their own words
EDL	00:03:47,840	00:03:48,608	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To where I am right now
EDL	00:03:49,376	00:03:50,400	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Rights of the first part of your
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:51,168	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Career you
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,680	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You ended up going
EDL	00:03:52,448	00:03:52,960	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Academic director
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:56,032	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	William & Mary
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:59,104	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Talk to me a little bit about that experience as a professor
EDL	00:03:59,616	00:04:01,408	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	When I'm going to want to hear your
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:02,432	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How did you get to darkest
EDL	00:04:02,944	00:04:04,736	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So start with a u
EDL	00:04:04,736	00:04:05,760	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So I mean
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:12,672	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I have been fascinated by the fact that you know mean is not about what we are doing is like you know we're suspicious why
EDL	00:04:12,672	00:04:13,696	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Have to realize that
EDL	00:04:14,464	00:04:18,047	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Our power resides on the fact that we transferred our knowledge
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:22,655	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is not our individual knowledge is Inola from every generation before us
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:26,751	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Any disabled Beauty in my mind to pass this along to the Next Generation
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:28,543	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You're part of a continuity
EDL	00:04:28,543	00:04:29,311	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Right
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:35,455	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Correct correct so I mean I was interested in in Indiana Professor for that same reason because I wanted to
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:40,319	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To be able to you know identifying students that ain't like that capacity
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:46,463	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The drive to go for scientific research and try to mend a tendon and in health indeed the best they could be
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:50,815	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So that they can do no Advance knowledge in that particular area Evermore
EDL	00:04:50,815	00:04:52,607	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So that's why I went far
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:53,119	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Academia
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:58,239	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Of course you know when you're in Academia one of the things you need to do in order to be able to
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Duke aerial distance
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,359	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Trying to train guys do that you have to get funding
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:08,991	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And so clearly I mean I had to Explorer the funding agencies among them is
EDL	00:05:08,991	00:05:10,015	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Starpine I got some fun
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,295	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	From there by Leon
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:16,671	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And eventually you want to kind of learn okay what does it take the other side
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,975	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Right to understand
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:22,815	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How do you know select the best people to do the best work
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:24,607	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How is this process
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:27,935	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Being proceeded from the Viewpoint of the founding
EDL	00:05:27,935	00:05:28,703	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Asian
EDL	00:05:28,703	00:05:32,031	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So it was particularly intrigued by DARPA because
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:36,383	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I said I was dropping by funded by DARPA in the beginning and so
EDL	00:05:37,407	00:05:39,711	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This model of trying to find
EDL	00:05:39,711	00:05:45,855	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Basic science that has a goal and ultimate goal was really very appealing to me?
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,391	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Particular
EDL	00:05:47,391	00:05:48,927	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	As someone in academe
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:50,719	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You might have gone to National Anthem
EDL	00:05:50,719	00:05:51,999	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	If you might have gotten that
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:52,767	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Science found a
EDL	00:05:52,767	00:05:54,047	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What about
EDL	00:05:54,047	00:05:56,351	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is there a Disney day
EDL	00:05:57,375	00:06:00,191	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Question I mean on the one hand you know as
EDL	00:06:00,703	00:06:01,727	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	As an American
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,495	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Not by
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Birth by choice
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,079	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You know I have a deep love for this
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,615	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Country station for this
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:13,247	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Country Inn in a sense of Duty regarding you not trying to have this country to continue B
EDL	00:06:13,247	00:06:14,783	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What it is right now
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:20,927	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And the best way in my opinion is to try to see okay what are the needs of the people that are at the Forefront of the car
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:24,511	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Defending the country that would be the defendant the Armed Forces in general right
EDL	00:06:25,023	00:06:30,911	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is it what is it is going to make that difference in terms of yuno advances in technology advances in research
EDL	00:06:30,911	00:06:31,935	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That can top this
EDL	00:06:31,935	00:06:32,447	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This mission
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:37,823	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And clearly they are pies at the Forefront of all of this funding agencies in that particular direction
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,359	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So I was very very
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:43,199	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Intrigued and curious and interested in being part of
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:52,159	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Did you reach out LA to DARPA with there's somebody here that new about you what we
EDL	00:06:52,159	00:06:53,695	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Was the that those sort of
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:06:54,463	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Final steps
EDL	00:06:55,231	00:06:55,743	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Got you
EDL	00:06:56,255	00:06:58,047	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Onto the roster programmatic
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:03,935	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I had a collaboration with store dwarf who was at a time when I was at William & Mary he was at the University of
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:07,007	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Virginia and he was leaving and Institute in nanotechnology
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:12,383	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And an In-N-Out took it upon myself to actually introduce my research to him Detroit
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:14,175	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Static collaborative effort with him
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:15,967	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And in India
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:18,527	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Did happen and we actually got a couple of Russia
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:22,879	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Just going inside eventually but of course I knew that he kabina DARPA program manager in the past
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:26,207	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So mention to him that that I was in
EDL	00:07:26,207	00:07:28,511	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Christian like you know seen the other side of the
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,791	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Force
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:36,191	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is so she actually told me what wait on you give me your CV and I will pass it along and then particularly hits
EDL	00:07:36,191	00:07:39,263	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Told me that he was going to show it to Tiffany dumplings
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,311	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Which was a tad under the director of ESL
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,639	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Meaning offense or defense
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,039	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I technically correct correct that she got my city and she contacted me.
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,575	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To see if I was interested in pursuing a career
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:56,927	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So you mentioned Stu wolf and that gives me a little bit of Anna
EDL	00:07:56,927	00:07:57,951	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Excuse tattoo
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:58,975	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Maybe diving 2
EDL	00:07:59,487	00:08:00,255	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Your intro
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,791	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Press because I in a stool
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	He's a big name in the area
EDL	00:08:04,351	00:08:10,239	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Tronix advances to electronics immaterial Sophie talk to me even a little more
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:14,591	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The physicist that you are about this Arena of phenomena that so
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,359	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	He'll grab you
EDL	00:08:16,127	00:08:21,503	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So basically in my make my career in physics here in this country have been focused
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:24,831	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	If I take orally on spin dependent phenomena
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:28,159	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Matthias and magnetic phenomena
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:30,975	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Depended on the spins of particles like electrons
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:33,279	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In particular
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:34,815	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Yes that is correct electron
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,607	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Spencer
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:41,471	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Cancel that will during his tenure as a program manager here.
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Stuart actually was defended of
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:47,103	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Can chronic in the sentence that he realized there were some discoveries I going to have
EDL	00:08:47,615	00:08:48,383	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And a diamond
EDL	00:08:48,383	00:08:49,407	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Talking like late 90s
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,711	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In particular the giant magnet
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:52,479	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Persistence
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:53,503	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Affect which was
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,039	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	A particularly driving
EDL	00:08:55,039	00:08:55,807	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Before
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:59,135	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For the explosion in a hard drive density
EDL	00:08:59,135	00:09:00,927	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And storage in general that we have eggs
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:01,695	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Expensive Alaska
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,231	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	20 years
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:06,047	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Stop you from I realize we we kind of just passed by the
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:06,559	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Business ideas
EDL	00:09:07,071	00:09:09,119	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Spin dependent the spin of electron
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:10,399	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But there's a difference between
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:12,447	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Spin of electron which is a little less familiar
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:15,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Charge of electron negative
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Chinese people do know about
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,359	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Talk to me about the different aspects of
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:20,639	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The electron and where
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:22,943	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Dependence is
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,735	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I thought you were coming to the door
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:30,111	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Write so the electron spin is a very difficult quantity to Define because it isn't
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:30,879	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Daquan
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:34,207	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	A counterpart In classical world I mean it's a quantum mechanical effect
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:40,863	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Instead of trying to Define what spin is one is better suited by defining what is it
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:41,631	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	NetSpend.
EDL	00:09:41,631	00:09:42,655	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Athenian General
EDL	00:09:42,655	00:09:43,935	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You find it the electron
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,447	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Speed
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That is your
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:49,311	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	If you think of it as like a little arrow pointing in any given Direct
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:52,895	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And what happens is that electron spins like to either parallel to each other on
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:10:00,319	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And in the case of magnetic materials what happens is that the electron spins in different atoms in particular areas of the
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,599	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Brent Adams
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:06,719	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	They all like each other there didn't you know very much attracted to one another pointing in the same direction
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:11,071	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And in what that gives us an opportunity to give some meaning to this
EDL	00:10:11,071	00:10:14,143	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Best answer for example you can say okay if I have a group of
EDL	00:10:14,143	00:10:16,447	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Beans that are all aligned in a given Direction
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,007	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I can associate that with say number one
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:24,127	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Any they appointed in the opposite direction then I can as a say this would say number 0
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:28,735	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And then you have the binary language and you can combine the binary language in more complex
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:31,807	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Languages that lead to what we use in Computing
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:35,391	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Famous ones and zeros of our digital age
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:41,023	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Correct correct so allows you to do this in the advantages of speed
EDL	00:10:41,023	00:10:45,631	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In an RR that well you can actually have these composition
EDL	00:10:46,143	00:10:51,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Off of Spanish to be made really small which means that you can actually affect a lot of these bits
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,823	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Soft ones and zeros
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:58,943	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In space as you can enhance the area of density that you can stored of ones and zeros
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:01,759	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	They happened to be just by the nature of the materials
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:05,343	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Protective against radiation damage rain
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:07,391	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And in one of the Holy Grail
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:08,159	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Cecil is being
EDL	00:11:08,671	00:11:12,767	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Did you try to find out what is the limit how small can you make
EDL	00:11:12,767	00:11:14,047	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This little Amanda
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:14,815	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Spins
EDL	00:11:14,815	00:11:16,095	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The store
EDL	00:11:16,095	00:11:18,399	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Ones and zeros in a stable manner
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:22,751	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So focusing on spin
EDL	00:11:23,263	00:11:24,543	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Of the electron rather
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:25,823	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Charge of the electron that
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:32,223	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Actually have a smaller area of a safe a piece of semiconductor with or Wally's electrons are living
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:35,551	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Small piece of metal that semiconductor will
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:36,831	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Host a 1 or 0
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:38,623	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is not just a question of
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:40,927	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Besides butt is so soft energetic
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,207	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So mean you know me one of
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,999	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The things that matters to you is you know
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How to see how
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:51,935	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How much power are you going to be needing in order to have these this configuration of zeros and ones so
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:53,727	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In general you know this is what
EDL	00:11:53,727	00:11:55,519	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What we found there was several effects
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,055	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Associated with this activity of the elect
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,383	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That enabled
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,919	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Technologies
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:08,319	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That will enhance the density without increasing the demands of hardware and making this very stage
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,367	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Family and also and aggregation
EDL	00:12:11,135	00:12:12,159	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So that makes
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:17,791	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Didn't Tire you know collection of properties that are very very attractive
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:21,375	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Not just for storage density seoul car drives but also for name
EDL	00:12:22,143	00:12:27,263	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And that's basically one of their goals. That's been chronic program had the program that's
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:27,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Stewart actress
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:30,335	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Right and let me bring you back now
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:31,359	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How to another big
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:32,383	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Multisyllabic
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,919	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Phrase that you use earlier with
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,711	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Giant magnetoresistance
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:36,991	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Reason I'm bringing that up
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:37,503	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What is because
EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:40,063	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That phenomenon and the
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:40,831	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Technology that
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:41,599	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	It led to
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:46,207	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Became part of our everyday lives in our hard drives right in the read heads
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:48,511	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Of of the hard drives
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:54,911	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Tell us a little bit about that technology Evolution and where is it now it happened was that what he was found it was what
EDL	00:12:54,911	00:12:56,703	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I'd like to the Nobel Prize in 99
EDL	00:12:56,703	00:13:00,031	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	98 was dead when you have layer at the systems in which you have
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:04,127	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Do magnetic layer separated by what layer that is not magnetic
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:04,895	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Anywho
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:07,455	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Current through this particular contraption
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:13,087	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The resistance of this contraption will be different when the Spencer parallel with respect when they are anti
EDL	00:13:14,111	00:13:16,415	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So that gives you a mechanism to read
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:20,511	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What is going on in Tennessee if it is parallel or antiparallel because you have now
EDL	00:13:20,511	00:13:22,047	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Resistance to enabled.
EDL	00:13:22,559	00:13:23,583	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That determination
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,887	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And that's how you sense what is in their country
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Right
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:32,799	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So what you're reading the spins whether they're paralyzed or better because they have an effective assistant
EDL	00:13:33,311	00:13:34,591	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Cracked so that is a big Power
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:37,151	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So that was discovered in 1998
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:44,063	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And then later was discovered was that even replaced at the intermediate layer the magnetic
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:47,647	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Metallica The Time by an insulating layer
EDL	00:13:47,647	00:13:53,279	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Then you have an effect that is even larger which means that you have MRI enhanced sensitivity what you're doing
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,071	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That was a spin dependent magnetic
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:56,863	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Aspen Dental Independence
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:01,215	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And that led to the explosion in memory in mram
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:01,983	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That we have
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:04,031	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Okay magnetic when
EDL	00:14:04,543	00:14:05,567	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Eighth grade
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:06,591	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Yes I almost
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,871	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Forget that uniform
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,151	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Cefazolin to fill this
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:13,503	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Just like everyday language rather not for everybody understanding science
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,295	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is understanding
EDL	00:14:15,295	00:14:16,575	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Acronym that's almost half
EDL	00:14:16,575	00:14:21,951	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The battle has been in the government
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:24,511	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So let's then segue into
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:27,327	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Life is a program manager in an actually do you only
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:27,839	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I've been doing this
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,655	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For less than a year so you have a kind of prefer
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:31,167	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Perspective

EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:59,231	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Dicing with the programs that I am that I develop
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:04,095	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	People having able to use this technology for example
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To get

EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:23,551	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To achieve these by using frequency, I'm saying the Other Extreme of it was also
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:26,367	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That people have been able to probe things
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:28,159	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In the time domain

EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:33,279	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Now that is a really short duration
EDL	00:16:33,791	00:16:35,071	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Right I mean in Arrow II
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:36,351	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	10 to the minus 18 sec
EDL	00:16:37,119	00:16:38,911	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You think of a nanosecond

EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,383	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	One second
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:49,919	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is really really bad
EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:52,223	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Show that the thing about this
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:53,503	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is Dad
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:57,855	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	It is going to enable us to actually
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:58,879	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Look at the time
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Did not Dynamics
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:02,207	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Because those are the only
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:05,023	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The main entities
EDL	00:17:05,023	00:17:05,791	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Isn't that going to be
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:06,815	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Moving
EDL	00:17:07,327	00:17:08,095	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And that
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,399	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	James said that is where you're going to be using this
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:14,751	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So in some ways it's almost like you're trying to create
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	A movie
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:16,543	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Camera
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:17,567	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That is Matt
EDL	00:17:17,567	00:17:21,151	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Onto the way electrons live in the speedway
EDL	00:17:21,151	00:17:22,687	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Which is so much faster
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:27,295	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I got another lead a human but I'll even the things are
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:29,087	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You're being doing so far because
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,135	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Cuz I mean you look at the various ranges in
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:32,159	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Which week of the coven looking
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:33,695	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Yes we move it song
EDL	00:17:35,743	00:17:36,511	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	It is
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,023	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Molecules
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,303	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To have a way of movie
EDL	00:17:38,303	00:17:39,327	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Wynndata Translate
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,095	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	They brought that
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:44,703	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And then we have seen those because those movements are not at the
EDL	00:17:45,215	00:17:46,239	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	CarMax Laurel
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:47,519	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So we have been able
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,287	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Want to see some of those
EDL	00:17:49,311	00:17:52,127	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I mean you're getting the capabilities that will enable us
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,151	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	CSI
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:54,687	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You know I mean the real
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:56,223	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So much smaller
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:57,247	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And move so much
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,295	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Last episode this is Senor Cabello
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:03,903	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That would be achieved by this program and it is due to their apartment this does not exist
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,743	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So let's stand this one for a second before you move over to
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,023	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	30 program
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:14,399	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So did this sounds like very fundamental sign of course that's why it's within DSL the defense Sciences off
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:15,935	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Office among the six technical offices
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:18,751	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But on the other hand we are also in DARPA
EDL	00:18:18,751	00:18:21,055	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And so tell me a little bit about not only sort of
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,335	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Weirdest my push
EDL	00:18:22,335	00:18:23,359	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The envelope in
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,895	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Fundamental science
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:27,455	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Tell them that might actually be of relevance to National
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:33,343	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Was some of the things that for example these technologies will enable that have been talking to her performances
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:35,135	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Pistol for example
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:36,927	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Provide Metrology
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,951	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For example
EDL	00:18:38,463	00:18:39,487	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For the math
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:44,607	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And they are batteries that are being done at the Nano level formica

EDL	00:18:51,263	00:18:52,287	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You need
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:56,383	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Microprocessors in in in micro Electronics in the number of
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:57,919	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Instruments in
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,199	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	10 + things that are used
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,967	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Dubai the Armed Forces
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:01,759	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So when you reduce the football
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,319	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Their number two things that came with that
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,111	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Adamine addition to lower weight
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:07,903	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Smaller

EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:17,631	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But you also may enable lower power consumption which
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,911	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Also enables day
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:21,727	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I capability of having this instant
EDL	00:19:21,727	00:19:22,239	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This

EDL	00:19:32,223	00:19:33,503	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So I mean all of this
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,295	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is going into the same direction
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:36,831	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And to try to make you know

EDL	00:19:50,655	00:19:52,959	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In an indirect action but it goes into that but
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:57,567	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	White Sand by Metrology we mean serve new ways of measuring
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:19:59,615	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Very very small
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:03,711	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Crime in as you were speaking it also makes me think that this does put
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,247	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Perhaps play into

EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:39,295	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Advantage
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:41,599	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Which way did you already broad parameter space
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:49,023	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Alright so a lot of opportunity there in both fundamental science
EDL	00:20:49,791	00:20:50,303	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Applying at
EDL	00:20:51,071	00:20:51,583	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To the highest of tech
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,887	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So let's not move over to
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:56,191	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Your baby
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:57,471	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Are your topological EX
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,775	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Expectations in electronics
EDL	00:20:59,775	00:21:00,799	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Program
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:07,199	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And I know this gets a little bit hairy because we're using words like topological where were you going to take our imaginations down to
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,735	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The electronic level
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:11,295	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Talk to me is an undergraduate
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:12,063	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Physics in your you're
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:13,855	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Introducing some of these ideas
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:21,280	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I try in a mean one of the things that I mentioned earlier was that one of the Holy Grails that we have had for the applique
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,560	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Station of Spain's
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:27,680	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In say storage or memory is how small can you make this collection of
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,448	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Spins
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:34,080	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So they can keep their information is all aligned meaning one or auraline meaning of zero
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:38,688	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Without being disturbed by perturbations because in the end it's always an energetic
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:39,968	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Consideration of your
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:44,832	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Temperature fluctuations are more energetic than the energy that is contained in this

EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,112	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Calculator
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:53,024	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Then they're not going to win and then you lose information is like I like to say my student you think your laptop to Miami and there goes all day
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,816	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Information that you started that wouldn't be fun
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,376	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So you need something better than that
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,912	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And so
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:05,312	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I haven't put him in the literature and turns out you know that I we have in you to our
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,616	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Our disposal for for provi new paradigm
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:09,920	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Annies with apology
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:13,504	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Which is again something that has to do with a bit
EDL	00:22:13,504	00:22:15,552	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Day of orientation or configuration
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:19,392	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Pieology comes out of really though.

EDL	00:22:23,232	00:22:24,512	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Like in any way
EDL	00:22:24,512	00:22:27,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Yes it has to do with something that has to do with a special
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:27,584	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Configuration
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:35,264	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So in this particular case should we go to the heart of the matter I mean I told you that spins like to be parted on Type R
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:38,336	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But he done said that is an eternity past

EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,408	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Covered entities that are ways in which
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:42,176	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Engineer
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,456	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For them to be content
EDL	00:22:43,968	00:22:45,504	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That is making some angle between
EDL	00:22:46,272	00:22:50,112	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Now you lock them into discounting and you try to put them on a surface
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:55,744	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You realize and now they have to arrange inside themselves in such a fashion that they can accommodate accounting
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:59,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And when you try to do this exercise you could take like two little bit
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,912	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	One upon several of them on a surface
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:05,216	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	They have to be arranged in kind of a vortex
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:07,264	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Little Things
EDL	00:23:07,776	00:23:11,104	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Aspire Ollin tornado correct
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:13,920	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Something like that so that you can put them there right on the surface
EDL	00:23:13,920	00:23:15,200	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And that is what we call
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,224	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Right
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,760	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Ayr this interesting
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,552	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Well because now because they have counted
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:21,088	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	If you want to switch them off

EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:29,024	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And just just for clarity when you say the word
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:30,048	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Canting with you letter
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:31,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	BB spinzar

EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,120	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Means it or not
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:36,448	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Parallel or antiparallel but they're actually at a certain kind of angle almost like a
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Correct
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,496	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Correct correct
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:40,800	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is now because you're locked into this
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,312	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Buy some milk
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:43,360	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You just cannot
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,384	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Switch one with us
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,176	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Switching data so you have to switch the entire thing
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:49,248	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Because you have to switch the entire thing
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:52,320	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That cost you more energy than it will be
EDL	00:23:52,320	00:23:53,856	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Doing Jazzy individual
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:58,208	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Rights to the major internal structure more stable
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:24:02,560	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	. of of thermal energy a little heat snack is not enough to flip it correct
EDL	00:24:02,560	00:24:06,144	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So they become stable correct that is what the topology offers
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:06,656	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Eye protection
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:13,568	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So that if you can like engineer this in a suitable ways such that we can create the region of Spain
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,896	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Candace configuration smaller than what we have right now
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:19,200	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For collecting the ones and zeros
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:22,528	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Then you are in the next generation of memory device
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:23,552	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This is a Google based
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,064	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Step on this.
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:28,416	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And I would push it that mean and there are some
EDL	00:24:28,928	00:24:34,560	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Matrix itellas where can we go what will we are cheating by doing that and he's not just
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:37,632	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Size as I said earlier they supposed to question about energetic
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:39,936	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How much energy do we need to do this
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:46,592	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Can you move them around can you actually do things with them so you can open up several paradigms to use this and today's
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:48,384	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For memory loss record
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,408	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Sandra Bullock
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,456	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Stations beyond what we can do
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:51,968	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I guess right now
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:56,320	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Okay and does this still fall within the the tradition of spintronics and
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:58,368	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Insta will Forsythia is this
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:02,208	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	It in some other Arena
EDL	00:25:02,208	00:25:07,328	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In in spirit right but it's it has the saddest thing which is a topological
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:09,120	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Action Auto Parts
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,888	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Topological
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:13,216	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That's a new thing
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,752	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And that is what what this can take
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:17,568	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Let's talk about where your program is inside
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:18,848	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	General
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,152	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Life cycle of a program here at DARPA so
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:23,200	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You came in here you came up with this
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:24,480	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Wonderful idea
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:28,576	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You went through the harrowing experience of bringing it to what's called Tech Council
EDL	00:25:28,576	00:25:30,112	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Eyewear leadership in your
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:31,392	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Program manager
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:32,416	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Others are there
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:33,184	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Wedding it
EDL	00:25:33,184	00:25:35,488	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So you made it past all of all of those obstacles
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:36,512	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Now what
EDL	00:25:37,280	00:25:39,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Right now we have fast
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:45,728	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Selection show a broken announcement was placed publicly so that people could apply
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:49,056	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And you know send me the proposals that
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:51,872	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Proposals were evaluated by teams effects
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:52,640	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Birds
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:55,712	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And then the stations were made in terms of
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:57,248	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	For the most
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:26:01,600	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Qualified by Source selection is that those who
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:06,720	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Can make it past obstacles become a source as it were we told them performers
EDL	00:26:06,720	00:26:09,280	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Correct so right now that is De state
EDL	00:26:09,280	00:26:15,680	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And so what we have going on right now will be you know the Contracting part of it so is that when the money is
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:16,960	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Actually being delivered to the
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,240	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Performers and so
EDL	00:26:18,752	00:26:23,360	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	We think that we will have the kickoff meeting sometime early in 2018
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:27,712	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And shortly after we leave a review time right I mean they have to perform because that's
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:29,760	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The difference between DARPA and other agencies
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,808	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	She's as well is that there are very strong Matrix at
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:33,600	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	5
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:34,880	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You know that the continue with it
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:40,256	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This reminds me a little bit of some of the early days
EDL	00:26:41,024	00:26:42,048	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Here at DARPA where
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:43,584	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Well there was a funding
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:46,656	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Laboratory
EDL	00:26:46,656	00:26:47,680	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Reason and these became kind of
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:48,960	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The seeds
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:51,776	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What later became known as Material Science and Engineering
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:53,568	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	DARPA had a roll there and
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:56,128	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	At least nurturing
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:59,200	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What had was on its way to becoming a
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,968	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Harley new
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,760	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Field Material Science is this
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,784	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This
EDL	00:27:02,784	00:27:05,600	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Ascend to that kind of possibility we're
EDL	00:27:05,600	00:27:06,880	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Because you're not
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:08,160	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Ideas for organizing groups
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Potential performers
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:12,000	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You think this is going to be important for
EDL	00:27:12,000	00:27:13,280	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Restarting a new field
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:17,632	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	It is particularly important to concentrate the Air Force
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:24,032	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Experts say that maybe working on various other areas are man Ali related to one another but to console
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:26,080	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Braden focus them on this
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,360	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Specific problem with this
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:28,128	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Specific metrics
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:35,040	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And that may lead to advances in this particular terrain of which we are not even breathing because we don't know what they are going to discover
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,600	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I mean we are thinking that one application will be
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:41,696	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	These new generation memory that we all are needing and wanted
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:42,464	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	What happened
EDL	00:27:42,464	00:27:48,608	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But it so happens in this is being experienced that you know prior people including still has mentioned this to me
EDL	00:27:49,120	00:27:51,168	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That often times what happens is it
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:53,472	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Christopher former discover things that you didn't answer
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:54,240	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Dissipate
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:55,776	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In the girls room can go in at 8
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:58,592	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Direction weekend and start a new program you just don't know
EDL	00:28:00,128	00:28:03,712	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So that's basically what my hope is that because this is basic
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:06,016	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	There is always the possibility
EDL	00:28:06,016	00:28:06,784	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Kathy Cruz
EDL	00:28:06,784	00:28:07,808	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Groups of people
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:10,368	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To discover something completely non and
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,184	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That will know our minds away
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:14,720	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Well
EDL	00:28:14,720	00:28:15,744	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Well made that happen
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,768	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That sounds really
EDL	00:28:17,792	00:28:22,656	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Exciting possibility in some ways I wonder if at a place like darkover
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,936	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Are there such a diversity
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,448	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Skill set
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:29,056	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Whether there is even more of an opportunity
EDL	00:28:29,056	00:28:30,848	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To recognize when release
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,360	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Surprising things
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:33,920	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Maybe I-85 / 2
EDL	00:28:33,920	00:28:34,944	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Formas no question here
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:39,296	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Now that you're here you kind of are dropped in from academe
EDL	00:28:39,296	00:28:41,344	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Your ear in the defense Sciences office
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:43,392	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Have you met
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:44,416	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Other
EDL	00:28:44,928	00:28:45,696	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Programmatic
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:47,232	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Pictures of run into other programs
EDL	00:28:47,232	00:28:48,512	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Mom said that in a sense
EDL	00:28:48,512	00:28:51,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Blow your mind and that are you are now beginning to think of
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:53,120	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	How they relate to your own
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,168	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I'm definitely looking
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:57,472	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Is particularly for the empty or the
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:00,288	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The Microsystems
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:04,128	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That is correct because these are the guys that will be perhaps
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:10,528	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The ones I may take on whatever developments come from there so because they are the ones that are going to try to make
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:11,296	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Actual device
EDL	00:29:11,296	00:29:12,832	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Just out of this if they turn out.
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:14,368	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	To living up to
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:14,880	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The problem is that we
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,416	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	So yes
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:19,232	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Interesting Synergy there where you might
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:20,256	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You might be on there
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,560	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Really fundamental side of things
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:24,864	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	MTI Microsystems technology office
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:28,192	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Even though still fundamental in an engineering side could take it
EDL	00:29:28,704	00:29:31,264	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The next step toward what ultimately would be
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:32,544	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The finish line and of course
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:34,080	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	This is the way DARPA works that would probably be
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:36,384	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Out in industry or some
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:39,456	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	A part of the military service
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:44,576	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	But the result is an expected because in the sensor technology you don't know this may take you to some biology
EDL	00:29:45,088	00:29:49,184	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Related sensors are we're not even thinking on right now I mean it has happened a lot
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:53,024	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In in particularly in recent times at the lot of the discoveries.
EDL	00:29:53,024	00:29:55,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Copying. Like for example taking the
EDL	00:29:55,072	00:30:00,704	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In the area of nanotechnology I mean people were working with nanoparticles for the number to physical applications in the
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:04,544	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And then the biology STAAR test thinking how about using them as markers
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:09,664	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Four biological process
EDL	00:30:10,176	00:30:14,784	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Viruses are things that are much smaller than cells more around you can smell
EDL	00:30:15,808	00:30:19,904	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Opportunity
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,440	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And we would have
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:24,000	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You know we will see the performers get there
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:28,096	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And then you know if there is such an opportunity will it really extraordinary
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,120	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And make the
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,912	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	People from BtoB
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:32,960	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Mbco gangster
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:35,264	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Are you an excuse to mention I get another
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,544	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	One of the offices so that's the
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:38,336	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Biological
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:46,528	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And so that's that's that's from the Indian who knows I mean there might be other things that may be important for
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,320	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Are tactics I mean we just don't know
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:52,160	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	I mean I know that people are in STO
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:53,696	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You know maybe interesting
EDL	00:30:54,464	00:30:55,232	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You know
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,000	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Different ways
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:59,072	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Metrology that can come from these programs
EDL	00:30:59,584	00:31:00,864	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Zach will be applicable
EDL	00:31:01,376	00:31:03,168	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Pacific problems that they are working on
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:07,776	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Read it again stfc we're going through the entire repertoire here the entire set of offices that's
EDL	00:31:08,288	00:31:11,104	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Strategic Technologies office I didn't mention soap
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:17,504	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Tactical technology
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,808	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	The entire sex but again we don't know
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,368	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	We don't know where is it this particular problem is
EDL	00:31:22,368	00:31:24,416	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Going to take us I mean that is the beauty of working for
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:26,464	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	You are at the Forefront of
EDL	00:31:26,464	00:31:27,744	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Science we are therapist.
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:29,280	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In that regard
EDL	01:31:29,280	00:31:30,816	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Do you know that we are working with
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:32,608	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	With things that we don't know where they are
EDL	00:31:33,376	00:31:34,144	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Like I said he's not a spy
EDL	00:31:34,656	00:31:35,424	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Can gold
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:40,032	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	We had some idea where we want to go but we don't know if there are hidden going to be
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:40,800	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	New opportunities
EDL	00:31:43,104	00:31:44,640	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Are there
EDL	00:31:44,640	00:31:47,712	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Any questions that you wish I had asked you in this
EDL	00:31:47,712	00:31:48,992	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Discussion that I just
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,760	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Didn't get to
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:52,064	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Yes like we're white DARPA
EDL	00:31:52,064	00:31:57,440	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	In the other eye contact so I mean I mentioned this in passing through other people like when I was like it
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,768	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	A vacation a few years ago I was reading a clock off Lenovo
EDL	00:32:01,280	00:32:04,608	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	And he mentioned at some point DARPA and I like
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:11,776	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	It got through the science no kind of funeral as a discus to be a hot Asian
EDL	00:32:11,776	00:32:13,568	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	DARPA we we do know
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,336	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	Has
EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:17,920	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	A certain kind of Mystique and is out there in the cultural World in Barre
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,456	| Episode 16 The Spinmaster |	That is absolutely true
