EDL	01:08:41,541	01:08:44,375	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>two big themes the first is</b>
EDL	01:08:44,375	01:08:46,750	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>generally optical microsystems</b>
EDL	01:08:46,750	01:08:49,625	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>and the idea being if we</b>

EDL	01:08:59,625	01:09:02,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>all over and add new functionality</b>
EDL	01:09:02,500	01:09:04,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>typically the way we do these optical</b>

EDL	01:09:07,250	01:09:08,666	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>that's sort of a theme of my programs</b>
EDL	01:09:08,666	01:09:11,083	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>which is heterogeneous integration</b>
EDL	01:09:11,083	01:09:12,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>and that means different things to</b>
EDL	01:09:12,500	01:09:14,500	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>different people but really it's about</b>

EDL	01:09:22,833	01:09:25,333	| VfD E50 The Photonicist |	<b>think of many of these programs as</b>
