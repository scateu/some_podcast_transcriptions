EDL	00:01:50,520	00:01:52,920	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	dream and he has said publicly that he
EDL	00:01:52,920	00:01:55,049	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	wants to stop all infectious diseases

EDL	00:02:10,440	00:02:12,239	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you what I care so deeply about yes so
EDL	00:02:12,239	00:02:13,920	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I've been greatly looking forward to
EDL	00:02:13,920	00:02:15,209	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	discussion so why don't we get right
EDL	00:02:15,209	00:02:17,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	into it and so you're a medical
EDL	00:02:17,310	00:02:19,500	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	professional who embraces clinical and
EDL	00:02:19,500	00:02:21,810	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	field practice as well as leading-edge
EDL	00:02:21,810	00:02:24,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	research what are the origins of those
EDL	00:02:24,870	00:02:26,819	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	interests for you it started pretty

EDL	00:02:26,819	00:02:29,910	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	young I have this childhood memory of
EDL	00:02:29,910	00:02:32,190	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	being asked at my school a Catholic
EDL	00:02:32,190	00:02:33,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	school and that was meeting with one of
EDL	00:02:33,690	00:02:34,739	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the priests and they said well what do
EDL	00:02:34,739	00:02:36,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you really want to do and I said I
EDL	00:02:36,690	00:02:38,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	wanted to be a pediatrician(小儿科医师) and they
EDL	00:02:38,730	00:02:42,420	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	said why and and and I said well because
EDL	00:02:42,420	00:02:44,489	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I just want to take care of people and I
EDL	00:02:44,489	00:02:46,260	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	want to take care of children and I do
EDL	00:02:46,260	00:02:49,290	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	think it stems from my mom was a nurse
EDL	00:02:49,290	00:02:51,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and so I think less so from the
EDL	00:02:51,870	00:02:54,150	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	influence of being around someone in the
EDL	00:02:54,150	00:02:56,190	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	medical profession but more so just
EDL	00:02:56,190	00:02:57,299	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	being around someone that cares very
EDL	00:02:57,299	00:02:58,769	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	deeply about other people
EDL	00:02:58,769	00:03:00,930	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	again very early on and it but it's been
EDL	00:03:00,930	00:03:02,610	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it's been sort of a consistent part of
EDL	00:03:02,610	00:03:05,790	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	my life yeah this was in fourth grade
EDL	00:03:05,790	00:03:07,709	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	this whole like you know I wanted to be
EDL	00:03:07,709	00:03:09,600	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	a pediatrician(小儿科医师) and so as I was on this
EDL	00:03:09,600	00:03:11,430	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	trajectory and I didn't know of course
EDL	00:03:11,430	00:03:13,019	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what I was talking about you know I mean
EDL	00:03:13,019	00:03:14,850	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	even you make these decisions early in
EDL	00:03:14,850	00:03:17,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	your life but my parents and my family
EDL	00:03:17,310	00:03:20,070	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	always had this incredibly strong ethic
EDL	00:03:20,070	00:03:22,260	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of service and very deeply and
EDL	00:03:22,260	00:03:23,880	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	fundamentally because I reflect on this
EDL	00:03:23,880	00:03:26,489	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	often actually it's like Who am I and
EDL	00:03:26,489	00:03:28,370	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what am I supposed to be and I think
EDL	00:03:28,370	00:03:30,900	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what I do is I serve others and that's
EDL	00:03:30,900	00:03:32,970	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that's how I define myself maybe one of
EDL	00:03:32,970	00:03:35,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the greatest gifts from my parents was
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:38,940	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that my dad was active duty Navy officer
EDL	00:03:38,940	00:03:41,340	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	did ROTC and served as a nuclear
EDL	00:03:41,340	00:03:43,410	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	engineer on a Surface Warfare ship it
EDL	00:03:43,410	00:03:44,670	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	was active duty for five or six years
EDL	00:03:44,670	00:03:46,530	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	stayed in the Navy for another 20 plus
EDL	00:03:46,530	00:03:48,660	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	retired as a Navy captain in the
EDL	00:03:48,660	00:03:52,109	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	reserves you couple my mom's passion for
EDL	00:03:52,109	00:03:53,940	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	helping other people in the medical
EDL	00:03:53,940	00:03:56,579	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	field with my dad's passion of serving
EDL	00:03:56,579	00:03:58,440	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	our country this was almost like all I
EDL	00:03:58,440	00:04:00,569	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	knew and so that trajectory has sort of
EDL	00:04:00,569	00:04:02,160	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	guided me through all of my decisions in


EDL	00:04:02,160	00:04:03,540	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	my okay well let's actually talk a
EDL	00:04:03,540	00:04:05,130	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	little bit about that before you came to
EDL	00:04:05,130	00:04:07,560	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	DARPA you spent almost 15 years in a
EDL	00:04:07,560	00:04:09,810	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	variety of segments that took you to for
EDL	00:04:09,810	00:04:11,579	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	example for - deitrick the military's
EDL	00:04:11,579	00:04:14,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	premiere facility for infectious disease
EDL	00:04:14,040	00:04:17,728	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	research it took you to Korea to UK the
EDL	00:04:17,728	00:04:20,579	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Republic of Georgia Azerbaijan Iraq
EDL	00:04:20,579	00:04:23,039	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Thailand other places I'm sure what did
EDL	00:04:23,039	00:04:25,244	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you learn from all of that global experience 
EDL	00:04:25,244	00:04:27,720	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I would start by saying what a privilege
EDL	00:04:27,720	00:04:31,020	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what a privilege to have those types of
EDL	00:04:31,020	00:04:33,630	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	life experiences all in the context of
EDL	00:04:33,630	00:04:35,880	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	again feeling that I'm serving my
EDL	00:04:35,880	00:04:37,770	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	country and making a difference some of
EDL	00:04:37,770	00:04:39,720	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the work that I'm most proud of frankly
EDL	00:04:39,720	00:04:41,640	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	is work I did in the caucuses with
EDL	00:04:41,640	00:04:44,780	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Georgia and Azerbaijan and the program
EDL	00:04:44,780	00:04:47,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	was under the auspices(赞助) was called the
EDL	00:04:47,310	00:04:49,620	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Cooperative Threat Reduction program but
EDL	00:04:49,620	00:04:53,760	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	really my role there was to engage their
EDL	00:04:53,760	00:04:55,620	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	public health communities and their
EDL	00:04:55,620	00:04:57,750	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	medical research communities to
EDL	00:04:57,750	00:05:00,300	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	establish that capability of finding
EDL	00:05:00,300	00:05:02,880	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	infectious diseases diagnosing them and
EDL	00:05:02,880	00:05:04,740	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	ultimately treating them and it was a
EDL	00:05:04,740	00:05:07,290	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	capability that was those public health
EDL	00:05:07,290	00:05:09,060	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	systems were all part of the Soviet
EDL	00:05:09,060	00:05:10,890	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Union but when the Soviet Union fell
EDL	00:05:10,890	00:05:12,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	these countries were kind of left to
EDL	00:05:12,870	00:05:15,000	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	their own to recreate a public health
EDL	00:05:15,000	00:05:18,030	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	infrastructure and so the privilege was
EDL	00:05:18,030	00:05:20,940	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to work with those experts in the host
EDL	00:05:20,940	00:05:22,890	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	country to say how do we build that back
EDL	00:05:22,890	00:05:25,500	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	up again so that you can tell us that
EDL	00:05:25,500	00:05:27,330	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	there's an outbreak going on and then we
EDL	00:05:27,330	00:05:29,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	can collectively work together to
EDL	00:05:29,310	00:05:31,080	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	respond to that outbreak right so did
EDL	00:05:31,080	00:05:33,000	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you bring in models like the the Centers
EDL	00:05:33,000	00:05:35,130	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of Disease Control here we did yes we
EDL	00:05:35,130	00:05:36,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	did we work closely with the embassies
EDL	00:05:36,870	00:05:38,220	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we work closely with the State
EDL	00:05:38,220	00:05:40,050	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Department we work closely with the CDC
EDL	00:05:40,050	00:05:43,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	at the end of the day it was myself and
EDL	00:05:43,350	00:05:45,630	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	some of my DoD colleagues on the ground
EDL	00:05:45,630	00:05:48,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you know rolling our sleeves up helping
EDL	00:05:48,360	00:05:50,550	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	these countries develop those systems
EDL	00:05:50,550	00:05:52,640	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	developing laboratory capabilities
EDL	00:05:52,640	00:05:54,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	developing the ability to do clinical
EDL	00:05:54,870	00:05:57,030	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	research to ethical standards that would
EDL	00:05:57,030	00:05:58,710	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	be accepted all over the world and to
EDL	00:05:58,710	00:06:01,200	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	figure out how to do this you know again
EDL	00:06:01,200	00:06:03,300	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I look back what a privilege to be on
EDL	00:06:03,300	00:06:05,790	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the ground and at this point fairly
EDL	00:06:05,790	00:06:08,100	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	junior in my career and to help an
EDL	00:06:08,100	00:06:09,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	entire nation improve their public
EDL	00:06:09,870	00:06:12,450	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	health sound like a great privilege what
EDL	00:06:12,450	00:06:14,370	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	is the sequence of events Matt that
EDL	00:06:14,370	00:06:16,830	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	resulted in your current position here
EDL	00:06:16,830	00:06:19,229	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	at DARPA as a program manager throughout
EDL	00:06:19,229	00:06:21,300	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	my medical career I had heard about
EDL	00:06:21,300	00:06:25,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	DARPA and I had seen amazing technology
EDL	00:06:25,350	00:06:27,479	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that had come from DARPA that were aimed
EDL	00:06:27,479	00:06:28,919	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	at addressing infectious diseases
EDL	00:06:28,919	00:06:31,249	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	threats so I had always admired from afar 
EDL	00:06:31,249	00:06:33,390	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	before I joined DARPA I was over
EDL	00:06:33,390	00:06:34,800	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	at the White House National Security
EDL	00:06:34,800	00:06:37,740	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Council staff and in that role my job
EDL	00:06:37,740	00:06:41,559	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	was to identify what capabilities we do
EDL	00:06:41,559	00:06:43,959	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	have to respond to pandemics and then
EDL	00:06:43,959	00:06:45,579	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	how we can organize ourselves as a
EDL	00:06:45,579	00:06:47,739	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	government not just DoD but as an entire
EDL	00:06:47,739	00:06:50,169	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	government towards addressing those gaps
EDL	00:06:50,169	00:06:52,319	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	so we're ready for the next one and
EDL	00:06:52,319	00:06:54,429	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	while I was there I got tapped on the
EDL	00:06:54,429	00:06:58,089	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	shoulder and the concise phrase was
EDL	00:06:58,089	00:07:01,179	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you're doing all of this policy what we
EDL	00:07:01,179	00:07:04,059	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	should do as a government how would you
EDL	00:07:04,059	00:07:09,099	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	then like to implement and actually make
EDL	00:07:09,099	00:07:10,899	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	investments that are going to address
EDL	00:07:10,899	00:07:13,089	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	those gaps so method where you literally
EDL	00:07:13,089	00:07:15,969	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	tapped on the shoulder and so who was it
EDL	00:07:15,969	00:07:17,259	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that proposed this to you
EDL	00:07:17,259	00:07:20,439	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it was dr. Jeff Ling who was the deputy
EDL	00:07:20,439	00:07:24,159	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	director of DSO at the time and he we
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:27,119	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	met him for coffee one morning and he
EDL	00:07:27,119	00:07:29,289	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	didn't literally actually put his hand
EDL	00:07:29,289	00:07:32,589	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	on my shoulder but figuratively imagine
EDL	00:07:32,589	00:07:36,249	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	a hand on my shoulder saying Matt how
EDL	00:07:36,249	00:07:37,989	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	would you like to try at DARPA to
EDL	00:07:37,989	00:07:40,869	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	actually invest to make a difference for
EDL	00:07:40,869	00:07:42,159	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	all those things that you've been
EDL	00:07:42,159	00:07:43,959	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	talking about in terms of big policy
EDL	00:07:43,959	00:07:45,855	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	words for the last few years 
EDL	00:07:45,855	00:07:49,299	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	well and of course he provided a model of audacity
EDL	00:07:49,299	00:07:51,539	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	because he really took on from madison
EDL	00:07:51,539	00:07:53,799	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	prosthetics(修复学) and other other programs to
EDL	00:07:53,799	00:07:55,539	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	really help the warfighter why don't we
EDL	00:07:55,539	00:07:58,329	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	segue(继续) then into your life as a program
EDL	00:07:58,329	00:07:59,589	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	manager here in this tremendous
EDL	00:07:59,589	00:08:02,049	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	portfolio that you've developed which is
EDL	00:08:02,049	00:08:04,449	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I think a portfolio that also reflects
EDL	00:08:04,449	00:08:06,879	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	some kind of audacious point of view as
EDL	00:08:06,879	00:08:09,519	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	is of course reflected by that statement
EDL	00:08:09,519	00:08:12,279	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	earlier that you want to take the lethal
EDL	00:08:12,279	00:08:14,889	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	power out of infectious disease so the
EDL	00:08:14,889	00:08:16,689	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	names are fantastic some of them like
EDL	00:08:16,689	00:08:19,119	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Prometheus and Thor dialysis like
EDL	00:08:19,119	00:08:21,759	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	therapeutics in vivo nano platforms and
EDL	00:08:21,759	00:08:23,079	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we'll probably talk more about one of
EDL	00:08:23,079	00:08:24,969	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	them in particular the pandemic
EDL	00:08:24,969	00:08:27,159	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	prevention platform what I'm hoping to
EDL	00:08:27,159	00:08:28,989	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	do now is is if you could briefly take
EDL	00:08:28,989	00:08:31,839	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	us for a tour of your programs we can't
EDL	00:08:31,839	00:08:34,179	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	go in-depth about any of them at this
EDL	00:08:34,179	00:08:36,339	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	point but take me a little bit of a tour
EDL	00:08:36,339	00:08:37,719	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	on what's what you're hoping to achieve
EDL	00:08:37,719	00:08:39,429	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	with some of these programs and then
EDL	00:08:39,429	00:08:40,958	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we'll focus in a little bit more on the
EDL	00:08:40,958	00:08:42,720	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pandemic prevention platform 

EDL	00:08:42,720	00:08:45,879	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	yeah so the tour starts by saying what problems are
EDL	00:08:45,879	00:08:48,670	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we trying to solve and again at the
EDL	00:08:48,670	00:08:50,050	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	White House National Security Council
EDL	00:08:50,050	00:08:52,899	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	staff I got a chance to say look for
EDL	00:08:52,899	00:08:56,769	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	these major outbreaks pandemics or near
EDL	00:08:56,769	00:08:58,750	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pandemics how have we done as a
EDL	00:08:58,750	00:09:01,029	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	government think about the 2009 h1n1
EDL	00:09:01,029	00:09:03,579	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pandemic think about the West Africa
EDL	00:09:03,579	00:09:08,510	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Ebola crisis h1n1 that is h1n1 influenza

EDL	00:09:08,510	00:09:08,709	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	yeah
EDL	00:09:08,709	00:09:10,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	influenza think about the West Africa
EDL	00:09:10,690	00:09:12,130	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Ebola crisis think about how we've
EDL	00:09:12,130	00:09:13,959	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	recently responded to Zika there are
EDL	00:09:13,959	00:09:15,610	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	common themes throughout and some of
EDL	00:09:15,610	00:09:17,649	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	those common themes are we need to be
EDL	00:09:17,649	00:09:20,769	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	much better at diagnosing if someone has
EDL	00:09:20,769	00:09:22,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	an infection and we need to go a step
EDL	00:09:22,360	00:09:25,269	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	beyond that and imagine a world that if
EDL	00:09:25,269	00:09:28,240	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we could figure out if someone is going
EDL	00:09:28,240	00:09:30,910	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to be sick or is going to be contagious
EDL	00:09:30,910	00:09:33,430	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we can intervene and stop the outbreak
EDL	00:09:33,430	00:09:34,779	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	right in its tracks and that's
EDL	00:09:34,779	00:09:36,430	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Prometheus and that's the Prometheus
EDL	00:09:36,430	00:09:38,260	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	program but we also need to make
EDL	00:09:38,260	00:09:40,630	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	vaccines and treatments much faster than
EDL	00:09:40,630	00:09:43,149	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we currently can and that's one of the
EDL	00:09:43,149	00:09:44,829	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	examples as the pandemic prevention
EDL	00:09:44,829	00:09:46,839	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	platform we need to alternate ways of
EDL	00:09:46,839	00:09:48,940	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	how we treat infections and using
EDL	00:09:48,940	00:09:51,550	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	portable dialysis(透析) to filter the blood
EDL	00:09:51,550	00:09:53,529	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and remove any type of pathogen(病原体) is a
EDL	00:09:53,529	00:09:55,300	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	good example but that's just in that
EDL	00:09:55,300	00:09:57,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	case is does that mean I might I might
EDL	00:09:57,310	00:09:59,199	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	have been exposed to some kind of
EDL	00:09:59,199	00:10:01,269	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pathogenic(致病) agent(药剂) it's in my blood and
EDL	00:10:01,269	00:10:03,459	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	certain levels so with this kind of
EDL	00:10:03,459	00:10:05,800	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	technology remove that before it could
EDL	00:10:05,800	00:10:07,540	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	take hold and actually get me sick was
EDL	00:10:07,540	00:10:09,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that is that the idea of that yes and
EDL	00:10:09,310	00:10:13,389	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the idea would be again especially for
EDL	00:10:13,389	00:10:15,550	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pathogens where we don't have a vaccine
EDL	00:10:15,550	00:10:17,470	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	where we don't have a treatment
EDL	00:10:17,470	00:10:19,839	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	especially think about now with what
EDL	00:10:19,839	00:10:23,543	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we're seeing so much antimicrobial(抗菌剂) resistant bacteria 
EDL	00:10:23,543	00:10:25,329	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	imagine if we're we
EDL	00:10:25,329	00:10:27,670	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	can't use antibiotics(抗生素) so if we can
EDL	00:10:27,670	00:10:29,170	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	filter your blood and remove that
EDL	00:10:29,170	00:10:31,149	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pathogen what if it does is ultimately
EDL	00:10:31,149	00:10:32,860	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	gives a leg up for your own immune
EDL	00:10:32,860	00:10:35,649	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	response to ultimately make you well again
EDL	00:10:35,649	00:10:38,290	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we like that technology especially or in
EDL	00:10:38,290	00:10:40,779	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	those first days when we need to buy
EDL	00:10:40,779	00:10:42,880	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	some time to develop a vaccine and we
EDL	00:10:42,880	00:10:45,670	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	need to develop new treatments and so my
EDL	00:10:45,670	00:10:48,880	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	point across the portfolio is that we
EDL	00:10:48,880	00:10:50,740	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	have lots of investments in medical
EDL	00:10:50,740	00:10:53,529	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	diagnostics we're investing in modeling
EDL	00:10:53,529	00:10:55,600	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to forecast where infectious diseases
EDL	00:10:55,600	00:10:57,519	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	are going to go we have investments in
EDL	00:10:57,519	00:10:59,290	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	accelerating new treatments but they're
EDL	00:10:59,290	00:11:01,000	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	all connected together they are all
EDL	00:11:01,000	00:11:02,920	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	linked and let me give you an example
EDL	00:11:02,920	00:11:05,769	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	with our Prometheus program predicting
EDL	00:11:05,769	00:11:08,340	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	if someone is going to become contagious
EDL	00:11:08,340	00:11:11,500	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	well awesome right if we can do that but
EDL	00:11:11,500	00:11:14,019	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	once we predict and identify that person
EDL	00:11:14,019	00:11:17,230	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we still have to treat them and so we're
EDL	00:11:17,230	00:11:19,449	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	going to need treatments as fast as
EDL	00:11:19,449	00:11:21,879	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	possible with our pandemic prevention
EDL	00:11:21,879	00:11:24,850	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	platform and the beauty is is that those
EDL	00:11:24,850	00:11:26,709	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	treatments are probably going to be most
EDL	00:11:26,709	00:11:28,509	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	effective when they're given as early as
EDL	00:11:28,509	00:11:31,029	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	possible so I think of our whole
EDL	00:11:31,029	00:11:34,029	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	portfolio as interconnected that we
EDL	00:11:34,029	00:11:35,470	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	develop a lot of different specific
EDL	00:11:35,470	00:11:38,259	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	projects to get capabilities but that
EDL	00:11:38,259	00:11:40,789	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	they're ultimately going to intertwine(纠缠在一起)
EDL	00:11:40,789	00:11:43,217	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	so that we stop the outbreak in its tracks 

* HOST: lifecycle of a DARPA program

EDL	00:11:43,217	00:11:44,649	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	well when I think of programs
EDL	00:11:44,649	00:11:46,120	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	here at DARPA they all have a kind of
EDL	00:11:46,120	00:11:47,829	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	lifecycle to them right I mean they they
EDL	00:11:47,829	00:11:50,529	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	sort of start as a glimmer in the eye of
EDL	00:11:50,529	00:11:52,420	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	someone like you Matt a program manager
EDL	00:11:52,420	00:11:54,699	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	there's a period of vetting and working
EDL	00:11:54,699	00:11:56,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	with others here to really articulate
EDL	00:11:56,350	00:11:58,959	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and formulate the program as best it can
EDL	00:11:58,959	00:12:00,879	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	be so that it can be most effective and
EDL	00:12:00,879	00:12:02,860	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	then kind of smoke signals go out to the
EDL	00:12:02,860	00:12:04,660	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	world and seeking people who maybe think
EDL	00:12:04,660	00:12:06,129	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that they can pull off some of these
EDL	00:12:06,129	00:12:08,139	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	audacious tasks that we've put out of
EDL	00:12:08,139	00:12:09,459	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	course then the research is done and
EDL	00:12:09,459	00:12:11,920	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	hopefully in the end you succeed or if
EDL	00:12:11,920	00:12:14,470	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	not fully succeed you learn from all the
EDL	00:12:14,470	00:12:15,819	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	research that that's going on
EDL	00:12:15,819	00:12:18,220	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	so what is the status in that lifecycle
EDL	00:12:18,220	00:12:19,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of the pandemic
EDL	00:12:19,870	00:12:22,329	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	prevention platform the payment Demick
EDL	00:12:22,329	00:12:25,149	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	prevention platform just launched and so
EDL	00:12:25,149	00:12:26,889	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and by launch those who might not know
EDL	00:12:26,889	00:12:28,449	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what that means in the DARPA context
EDL	00:12:28,449	00:12:31,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	said that that means that completing the
EDL	00:12:31,360	00:12:33,129	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	contracting process so that our
EDL	00:12:33,129	00:12:35,589	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	performers that were selected in a very
EDL	00:12:35,589	00:12:38,319	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	rigorous(严密的) process can now accomplish the
EDL	00:12:38,319	00:12:40,899	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	goals of the program so they're just
EDL	00:12:40,899	00:12:43,089	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	starting in there for six months as part
EDL	00:12:43,089	00:12:45,329	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of the lifecycle these are early days
EDL	00:12:45,329	00:12:48,279	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	early days because the ultimate goal of
EDL	00:12:48,279	00:12:51,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that program is so difficult we have a
EDL	00:12:51,040	00:12:52,660	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	lot you know in some ways I feel like
EDL	00:12:52,660	00:12:54,339	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	while we have we have a long way to go
EDL	00:12:54,339	00:12:56,230	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	one of the the key points though of the
EDL	00:12:56,230	00:12:59,259	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pandemic prevention platform is that the
EDL	00:12:59,259	00:13:02,470	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	goal is incredibly ambitious but there
EDL	00:13:02,470	00:13:05,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	is foundational scientific evidence that
EDL	00:13:05,350	00:13:07,809	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	this can be done and that foundational
EDL	00:13:07,809	00:13:10,569	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	scientific evidence is derived from a
EDL	00:13:10,569	00:13:13,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	previous DARPA program and that previous
EDL	00:13:13,360	00:13:14,800	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Starkel in other words prove the

EDL	00:13:14,800	00:13:17,139	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	concepts ADEPT that's the ADEPT program

The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT)
program supports individual troop readiness and total force health protection
by ...

EDL	00:13:17,139	00:13:19,269	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	because when I looked over the program
EDL	00:13:19,269	00:13:20,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it's fascinating to me because it
EDL	00:13:20,690	00:13:23,120	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it looks like we're trying to rev up the

rev up: to become more active, or to make someone or something become more active

EDL	00:13:23,120	00:13:26,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	whole brilliant molecular world of
EDL	00:13:26,360	00:13:29,180	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antibodies and so I want you to sort of
EDL	00:13:29,180	00:13:30,440	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	go through this the sequence events
EDL	00:13:30,440	00:13:32,583	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	beginning with this earlier program at depth 

EDL	00:13:32,583	00:13:32,919	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	[GUEST] yeah 

EDL	00:13:32,919	00:13:34,670	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	but walk us through some of
EDL	00:13:34,670	00:13:36,650	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the steps because when I look antibodies
EDL	00:13:36,650	00:13:38,330	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to wear among my favorite proteins when
EDL	00:13:38,330	00:13:39,890	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I look at their just brilliant things
EDL	00:13:39,890	00:13:42,380	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	they just so selective and they find the
EDL	00:13:42,380	00:13:43,850	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	thing that we don't want our bodies like
EDL	00:13:43,850	00:13:46,790	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	glom any way you tell us the pieces of
EDL	00:13:46,790	00:13:47,546	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the program 

EDL	00:13:47,546	00:13:49,250	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you you know Ivan I couldn't
EDL	00:13:49,250	00:13:51,680	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	agree more I think all of us that are
EDL	00:13:51,680	00:13:53,810	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	fascinated by new yeah yeah DARPA right
EDL	00:13:53,810	00:13:55,970	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that's probably a common theme is we are
EDL	00:13:55,970	00:13:58,550	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	just amazed by the natural world and
EDL	00:13:58,550	00:13:59,960	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what the natural world has developed
EDL	00:13:59,960	00:14:02,660	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antibodies are a great example I mean
EDL	00:14:02,660	00:14:05,960	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	there are millions and millions of these
EDL	00:14:05,960	00:14:07,400	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	different versions of antibodies
EDL	00:14:07,400	00:14:08,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	circulating through your body at all
EDL	00:14:08,870	00:14:12,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	times and the mechanisms are so refined
EDL	00:14:12,350	00:14:16,250	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and intricate(错综复杂的) to select ok which are the
EDL	00:14:16,250	00:14:18,380	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antibodies that are most protective when
EDL	00:14:18,380	00:14:20,480	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you're exposed to an infection and your
EDL	00:14:20,480	00:14:21,740	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	body goes through the process of them
EDL	00:14:21,740	00:14:23,480	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	making a lot of those in a short period
EDL	00:14:23,480	00:14:23,900	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of time
EDL	00:14:23,900	00:14:27,020	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I think it's mind-boggling(令人惊异) how advanced
EDL	00:14:27,020	00:14:29,660	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that system is we've learned so much
EDL	00:14:29,660	00:14:31,400	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	about antibodies in the last 50 years
EDL	00:14:31,400	00:14:33,680	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you're absolutely right we want to
EDL	00:14:33,680	00:14:35,990	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	leverage all of that information that we
EDL	00:14:35,990	00:14:37,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	know how they work now and we know how
EDL	00:14:37,310	00:14:39,320	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	they know about their structure we know
EDL	00:14:39,320	00:14:41,300	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	how to make them in big vats(多样性) and why
EDL	00:14:41,300	00:14:43,250	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	can't we use that and you're seeing
EDL	00:14:43,250	00:14:45,530	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	incredible progress in medicine where we
EDL	00:14:45,530	00:14:46,850	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	are using that where you're seeing
EDL	00:14:46,850	00:14:50,180	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antibodies approved as products now for
EDL	00:14:50,180	00:14:53,000	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	cancer treatment for treating autoimmune(自体免疫)
EDL	00:14:53,000	00:14:55,370	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	disease or the category biologicals in
EDL	00:14:55,370	00:14:57,410	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the in the category of biologicals a
EDL	00:14:57,410	00:14:59,720	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	massive explosion in that space and we
EDL	00:14:59,720	00:15:01,820	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	want to use all of that knowledge and
EDL	00:15:01,820	00:15:04,010	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that technology to solve infectious
EDL	00:15:04,010	00:15:06,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	diseases problems what we do at DARPA
EDL	00:15:06,350	00:15:08,120	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	though is the fun part is we couple
EDL	00:15:08,120	00:15:10,700	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	different fields together and so as you
EDL	00:15:10,700	00:15:12,200	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	have correctly pointed out this
EDL	00:15:12,200	00:15:14,330	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	extraordinarily powerful tool of
EDL	00:15:14,330	00:15:16,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antibody engineering but can we couple
EDL	00:15:16,730	00:15:18,980	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that with the the revolution that we've
EDL	00:15:18,980	00:15:22,100	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	seen in in genetics and that's that's


* Highlight: DARPA is taking two different areas seeing if we can mix them together

EDL	00:15:22,100	00:15:24,080	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	DARPA right it's taking two different
EDL	00:15:24,080	00:15:26,170	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	areas seeing if we can mix them together

EDL	00:15:26,170	00:15:27,410	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	again
EDL	00:15:27,410	00:15:29,420	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	an antibody specialist might not think
EDL	00:15:29,420	00:15:32,150	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	about the opportunities with genetics
EDL	00:15:32,150	00:15:33,890	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the genetic specialist might not think

EDL	00:15:33,890	00:15:34,430	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	well
EDL	00:15:34,430	00:15:37,339	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	wonder if I couldn't use my use genetic
EDL	00:15:37,339	00:15:39,110	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	engineering to make an antibody you
EDL	00:15:39,110	00:15:40,850	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	bring the two fields together in a mold(模具)
EDL	00:15:40,850	00:15:43,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you know by our our magic of bringing
EDL	00:15:43,730	00:15:45,649	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	them the disciplines(学科) together we achieve
EDL	00:15:45,649	00:15:48,529	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that effect and so the proof of concept
EDL	00:15:48,529	00:15:51,800	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	which I find exhilarating(令人振奋的) it's and
EDL	00:15:51,800	00:15:55,130	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	chills up and down my spine is that we
EDL	00:15:55,130	00:15:59,060	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	can give you a piece of DNA or a piece
EDL	00:15:59,060	00:16:02,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of RNA and we can put that into your
EDL	00:16:02,870	00:16:05,180	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	muscle cells and that your muscle cells
EDL	00:16:05,180	00:16:06,980	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	say okay got it
EDL	00:16:06,980	00:16:09,709	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I am going to make this antibody that is
EDL	00:16:09,709	00:16:12,140	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	so protective that someone's not going
EDL	00:16:12,140	00:16:14,699	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to get that's encoded by these nucleic acids (核酸)
EDL	00:16:14,699	00:16:16,520	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the RNA tells that muscle
EDL	00:16:16,520	00:16:18,290	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	cell so the muscles I was doing what a
EDL	00:16:18,290	00:16:20,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	muscle cell does but once that RNA gets
EDL	00:16:20,690	00:16:22,580	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	inside that muscle cell the muscle cell
EDL	00:16:22,580	00:16:25,490	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	says right I'm gonna make a protective
EDL	00:16:25,490	00:16:26,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antibody that's gonna protect you from
EDL	00:16:26,870	00:16:29,330	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Ebola and to do that in a fairly short
EDL	00:16:29,330	00:16:32,750	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	period of time and that idea would sound
EDL	00:16:32,750	00:16:34,700	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	crazy ten years ago too many obstacles
EDL	00:16:34,700	00:16:36,649	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	can't be done the foundational
EDL	00:16:36,649	00:16:40,370	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	investment from DARPA proved that
EDL	00:16:40,370	00:16:42,260	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	concept in many different animal models
EDL	00:16:42,260	00:16:44,450	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	for many different infections but
EDL	00:16:44,450	00:16:46,130	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	because we're DARPA we said well great
EDL	00:16:46,130	00:16:48,050	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we prove the concept that wasn't good
EDL	00:16:48,050	00:16:49,610	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	enough it wasn't good enough for me and
EDL	00:16:49,610	00:16:50,990	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it wasn't good enough for the DARPA
EDL	00:16:50,990	00:16:53,900	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	leadership DARPA leadership said okay
EDL	00:16:53,900	00:16:55,490	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that's great but we need to birth the
EDL	00:16:55,490	00:16:58,970	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	baby if we're going to take pandemics
EDL	00:16:58,970	00:17:01,520	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	off the table and that's that's why I'm
EDL	00:17:01,520	00:17:04,459	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	here we need to be able to put this
EDL	00:17:04,459	00:17:08,630	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	together as a platform that can go start
EDL	00:17:08,630	00:17:11,599	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to finish from once a pathogen is
EDL	00:17:11,599	00:17:13,939	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	identified to making thousands of doses
EDL	00:17:13,939	00:17:19,069	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of this miraculous(不可思议的) antibody based
EDL	00:17:19,069	00:17:21,380	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antibody based treatment in an
EDL	00:17:21,380	00:17:23,359	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	incredibly short period of time right

* Timescale

EDL	00:17:23,359	00:17:24,859	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and let's let's talk about the timescale
EDL	00:17:24,859	00:17:25,970	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	for a minute because that's part of the
EDL	00:17:25,970	00:17:28,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	big deal here right what I've seen is
EDL	00:17:28,040	00:17:30,800	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	within 60 days of identifying the the
EDL	00:17:30,800	00:17:33,110	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pathogenic agent to actually have these
EDL	00:17:33,110	00:17:35,150	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	doses right in hand and in a
EDL	00:17:35,150	00:17:36,800	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	distributable form is that correct
EDL	00:17:36,800	00:17:38,390	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that's correct right that compares to
EDL	00:17:38,390	00:17:40,640	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what - what's the state of the art today
EDL	00:17:40,640	00:17:42,919	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the state of the art today depends on
EDL	00:17:42,919	00:17:45,410	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	infections but let's use some some
EDL	00:17:45,410	00:17:47,510	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	recent examples we currently have some
EDL	00:17:47,510	00:17:47,840	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Zeke(寨卡)
EDL	00:17:47,840	00:17:50,299	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	vaccines in clinical trials but we've
EDL	00:17:50,299	00:17:53,419	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	been working now for a few years and we
EDL	00:17:53,419	00:17:55,809	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	don't have a license to use Zeke vaccine
EDL	00:17:55,809	00:17:58,429	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you think about our [..] when we talk
EDL	00:17:58,429	00:18:00,110	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	about gaps you think about all of these
EDL	00:18:00,110	00:18:02,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	recent outbreaks and one of the
EDL	00:18:02,360	00:18:04,250	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	fundamental lessons is that we haven't
EDL	00:18:04,250	00:18:05,990	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	had vaccines and treatments that are
EDL	00:18:05,990	00:18:10,700	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	ready in time and we came up the the 60
EDL	00:18:10,700	00:18:15,770	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	day goal has been controversial when we
EDL	00:18:15,770	00:18:19,789	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	talk about audacity you know I have
EDL	00:18:19,789	00:18:21,770	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	professional colleagues who laugh at me
EDL	00:18:21,770	00:18:24,940	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I've been on I've been on panels(圆桌论坛) where
EDL	00:18:24,940	00:18:27,860	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	where I you know discuss the program and
EDL	00:18:27,860	00:18:29,899	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the other panelists joined with the
EDL	00:18:29,899	00:18:32,210	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	audience at laughing at me so I knew we
EDL	00:18:32,210	00:18:33,830	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	were in the right space the
EDL	00:18:33,830	00:18:35,899	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	counter-argument that I continually make
EDL	00:18:35,899	00:18:39,470	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to the critics(批评家) is 60 days is dictated(提出) by
EDL	00:18:39,470	00:18:43,070	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what we need to respond to pandemics so
EDL	00:18:43,070	00:18:45,140	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	if you don't agree that our approach is
EDL	00:18:45,140	00:18:47,299	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the right way then come up with an
EDL	00:18:47,299	00:18:49,250	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	alternative because we can't negotiate
EDL	00:18:49,250	00:18:51,500	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	with Mother Nature and say well we'd
EDL	00:18:51,500	00:18:53,000	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	like another six months if you don't
EDL	00:18:53,000	00:18:56,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	mind especially when you think about the
EDL	00:18:56,360	00:18:59,090	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	catastrophic consequences accordingly so
EDL	00:18:59,090	00:19:01,640	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you know we have to be we have to do
EDL	00:19:01,640	00:19:03,799	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	this within 60 days and I think again
EDL	00:19:03,799	00:19:05,750	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I'm profoundly excited because I think
EDL	00:19:05,750	00:19:08,149	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we found a way to do it so I want to try
EDL	00:19:08,149	00:19:09,590	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	to make this concrete for our listeners
EDL	00:19:09,590	00:19:11,750	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	which you've actually done fairly well
EDL	00:19:11,750	00:19:12,980	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	just now what I thought of another way
EDL	00:19:12,980	00:19:15,710	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we might do this and that's by combining
EDL	00:19:15,710	00:19:19,130	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you know kind of almost the the gaming
EDL	00:19:19,130	00:19:20,299	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	out to the future where let's say you
EDL	00:19:20,299	00:19:22,580	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	are successful and may you be successful
EDL	00:19:22,580	00:19:25,700	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	with this p3 program the the pen jet
EDL	00:19:25,700	00:19:29,710	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pandemic prevention platform program

* Back in 1918 Spanish Flu?

EDL	00:19:29,710	00:19:33,260	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	let's say that you had that p3 ability
EDL	00:19:33,260	00:19:36,770	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	back in the 1918 Spanish flu which I've
EDL	00:19:36,770	00:19:38,419	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	seen different numbers I've heard 50
EDL	00:19:38,419	00:19:41,110	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	million people people died during that
EDL	00:19:41,110	00:19:44,510	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pandemic if this technology existed back
EDL	00:19:44,510	00:19:46,940	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	in the early part of the last century
EDL	00:19:46,940	00:19:49,610	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	how would that have unfolded do you
EDL	00:19:49,610	00:19:54,080	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	think well my hope is that 50 million
EDL	00:19:54,080	00:19:57,649	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	people don't die that we and again part
EDL	00:19:57,649	00:20:00,650	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	of this is you detect that we have a new virus
EDL	00:20:00,650	00:20:04,100	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	or a new version of influenza and we
EDL	00:20:04,100	00:20:06,200	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	detect very early on in the process when
EDL	00:20:06,200	00:20:07,580	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it's first starting out in a given
EDL	00:20:07,580	00:20:10,010	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	country that it's that that it's
EDL	00:20:10,010	00:20:13,010	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	happening we flip the switch and we say
EDL	00:20:13,010	00:20:17,990	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	for that new virus we need $20,000 that
EDL	00:20:17,990	00:20:20,600	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	have to be ready within 60 days and then
EDL	00:20:20,600	00:20:22,430	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we go to win that outbreak is first
EDL	00:20:22,430	00:20:26,300	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	starting we identify who's sick we treat
EDL	00:20:26,300	00:20:28,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	those people that are most likely to be
EDL	00:20:28,730	00:20:31,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	contagious and we stop the outbreak in
EDL	00:20:31,040	00:20:33,050	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	its tracks if we add it we could have
EDL	00:20:33,050	00:20:35,090	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	stopped the Spanish flu I think even
EDL	00:20:35,090	00:20:38,150	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	more importantly right now today you and
EDL	00:20:38,150	00:20:40,550	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I both know people who are getting very
EDL	00:20:40,550	00:20:42,710	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	sick with influenza we're seeing a
EDL	00:20:42,710	00:20:45,610	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	severe season and we're seeing
EDL	00:20:45,610	00:20:48,520	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	unfortunately children die we're seeing
EDL	00:20:48,520	00:20:51,860	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	unfortunately otherwise completely
EDL	00:20:51,860	00:20:53,450	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	healthy people having you know being
EDL	00:20:53,450	00:20:56,480	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	hospitalized and influenza does that to
EDL	00:20:56,480	00:20:58,820	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	us every year we imagine a world where
EDL	00:20:58,820	00:21:01,820	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	this platform could be used to take
EDL	00:21:01,820	00:21:04,150	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	seasonal influenza off the table as well
EDL	00:21:04,150	00:21:07,280	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	an amazing thought because I mean this
EDL	00:21:07,280	00:21:09,470	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	gets back to you to them several times
EDL	00:21:09,470	00:21:11,630	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you said what a privilege it is to do
EDL	00:21:11,630	00:21:13,550	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what you're doing because if you succeed
EDL	00:21:13,550	00:21:15,710	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you will know I know you won't take this
EDL	00:21:15,710	00:21:17,960	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it's not pumping you up personally it's
EDL	00:21:17,960	00:21:20,270	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it's more for what it's doing for you
EDL	00:21:20,270	00:21:22,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	know kind of humanity but you will know
EDL	00:21:22,310	00:21:24,140	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you've had a part in potentially saving
EDL	00:21:24,140	00:21:25,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	millions of people's lives by cutting
EDL	00:21:25,730	00:21:29,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	these pandemic experiences off before
EDL	00:21:29,690	00:21:32,500	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	they really get going and spread so a
EDL	00:21:32,500	00:21:35,270	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	really quite an amazing yeah and I would

* make 2 points

EDL	00:21:35,270	00:21:38,300	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	make two points the first is that DARPA
EDL	00:21:38,300	00:21:41,930	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	my team does not do this alone
EDL	00:21:41,930	00:21:46,280	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	DARPA does not do this alone we we work
EDL	00:21:46,280	00:21:49,310	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	incredibly closely with our colleagues
EDL	00:21:49,310	00:21:51,140	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and Health and Human Services with other
EDL	00:21:51,140	00:21:52,910	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	experts in the Department of Defense in
EDL	00:21:52,910	00:21:54,890	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the US government as well as
EDL	00:21:54,890	00:21:57,530	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	philanthropy(慈善事业) as well as the private
EDL	00:21:57,530	00:21:58,940	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	sector and as well as the global
EDL	00:21:58,940	00:22:02,030	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	community it's ultimately a global
EDL	00:22:02,030	00:22:04,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	teamwork that's going to take these
EDL	00:22:04,730	00:22:06,890	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	infectious diseases off the table but
EDL	00:22:06,890	00:22:09,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	make no mistake we can say it sounds
EDL	00:22:09,350	00:22:10,880	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	hard and it's ambitious and it's crazy
EDL	00:22:10,880	00:22:14,119	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	but I challenge you to say why not
EDL	00:22:14,119	00:22:16,009	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you know why aren't we as a society
EDL	00:22:16,009	00:22:19,519	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	putting incredible even more effort into
EDL	00:22:19,519	00:22:21,349	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	taking these infectious diseases off the
EDL	00:22:21,349	00:22:22,699	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	table if we have the if we have the
EDL	00:22:22,699	00:22:24,649	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	scientific know-how to do so this is
EDL	00:22:24,649	00:22:26,329	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what I think one should be focusing it's
EDL	00:22:26,329	00:22:29,209	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	a moonshot but why not go for a moonshot
EDL	00:22:29,209	00:22:31,719	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and why not go for a moonshot for
EDL	00:22:31,719	00:22:34,669	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	against something that could kill
EDL	00:22:34,669	00:22:36,799	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	another 50 million people why not take a
EDL	00:22:36,799	00:22:40,039	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	moonshot against infectious diseases
EDL	00:22:40,039	00:22:42,319	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	like malaria and tuberculosis(肺结核) I mean
EDL	00:22:42,319	00:22:44,449	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we've seen you know there's there's
EDL	00:22:44,449	00:22:46,309	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	effort in there there's global effort
EDL	00:22:46,309	00:22:48,876	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that's absolutely tremendous but why not more 

EDL	00:22:48,876	00:22:50,869	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	so Matt just a little while ago you
EDL	00:22:50,869	00:22:52,669	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and I were kind of gushing(滔滔不绝) about the
EDL	00:22:52,669	00:22:54,499	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	molecular beauty in the biological
EDL	00:22:54,499	00:22:56,149	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	beauty of antibodies and the
EDL	00:22:56,149	00:22:58,909	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	specificities those have to go out and
EDL	00:22:58,909	00:23:01,459	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	find whatever the health threatening
EDL	00:23:01,459	00:23:04,069	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	agent might be and kind of and the role
EDL	00:23:04,069	00:23:06,739	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that plays in our own bodies fight
EDL	00:23:06,739	00:23:11,599	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	against health compromising exposures so

* QUESTION:
EDL	00:23:11,599	00:23:14,749	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I guess I kind of want to ask you do you
EDL	00:23:14,749	00:23:17,719	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	have a favorite infectious disease in
EDL	00:23:17,719	00:23:20,059	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the sense that you admire what the
EDL	00:23:20,059	00:23:23,539	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	bacterium(细菌,单数) or what the virus does and has
EDL	00:23:23,539	00:23:25,009	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	learned how to do over the course of
EDL	00:23:25,009	00:23:26,146	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	evolution? 

* ANSWER

EDL	00:23:26,146	00:23:28,939	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	so I'll answer in a slightly
EDL	00:23:28,939	00:23:34,279	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	different way I think it's a when when
EDL	00:23:34,279	00:23:35,929	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	when we say we want to take infectious
EDL	00:23:35,929	00:23:38,659	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	diseases off the table in some ways it's
EDL	00:23:38,659	00:23:40,639	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	or it's ridiculous because we're always
EDL	00:23:40,639	00:23:43,479	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	gonna have we're always going to have
EDL	00:23:43,479	00:23:46,369	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	viruses and bacteria that are part of
EDL	00:23:46,369	00:23:51,169	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the natural world and we and we've
EDL	00:23:51,169	00:23:53,059	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	always seen them as the enemy or it's
EDL	00:23:53,059	00:23:56,599	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pathogens is the word that we use one of
EDL	00:23:56,599	00:23:58,279	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the interesting ways to think about the
EDL	00:23:58,279	00:24:02,659	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	problem though is that a part of it is
EDL	00:24:02,659	00:24:04,369	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that there are a pathogen but part of it
EDL	00:24:04,369	00:24:09,109	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	is how we respond and modulating how our
EDL	00:24:09,109	00:24:11,599	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	own body responds to pathogens is a
EDL	00:24:11,599	00:24:13,249	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	major theme of what we're trying to do
EDL	00:24:13,249	00:24:15,229	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	with antibodies being one of many
EDL	00:24:15,229	00:24:17,779	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	examples and so you know one of the
EDL	00:24:17,779	00:24:20,059	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	traditional attitudes of antibiotics is
EDL	00:24:20,059	00:24:21,769	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you know antibiotics that have been
EDL	00:24:21,769	00:24:23,329	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	wonderful and certainly profoundly
EDL	00:24:23,329	00:24:25,579	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	impactful in terms of our society as
EDL	00:24:25,579	00:24:28,270	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we've as we've come along but we've also discovered
EDL	00:24:28,270	00:24:30,190	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the unintended consequences of giving a
EDL	00:24:30,190	00:24:32,020	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	broad-spectrum antibiotic incurring(招致) my
EDL	00:24:32,020	00:24:34,540	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	antimicrobial(抗菌) resistance and things like
EDL	00:24:34,540	00:24:37,540	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that as well so the the world that I
EDL	00:24:37,540	00:24:41,679	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	imagine is that there is I guess like
EDL	00:24:41,679	00:24:43,540	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you said before an appreciation of
EDL	00:24:43,540	00:24:45,610	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	pathogens an appreciation of viruses and
EDL	00:24:45,610	00:24:48,309	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	bacteria understanding what they do and
EDL	00:24:48,309	00:24:50,830	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	what they don't do and it's not always
EDL	00:24:50,830	00:24:53,440	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	wiping them out but more about rendering
EDL	00:24:53,440	00:24:55,360	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	them harmless or figuring out ways to
EDL	00:24:55,360	00:24:58,120	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	kind of coexist with them is where I
EDL	00:24:58,120	00:24:59,470	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	would like our thinking to go in the
EDL	00:24:59,470	00:25:00,127	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	21st century. 

EDL	00:25:00,127	00:25:01,240	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it makes a lot of sense
EDL	00:25:01,240	00:25:03,220	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	gonna I heard statistics about the
EDL	00:25:03,220	00:25:05,679	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	number of mammalian(哺乳动物的) cells in me and you
EDL	00:25:05,679	00:25:07,510	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and the number of bacterial cells and
EDL	00:25:07,510	00:25:10,090	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	there's we're almost from just a numbers
EDL	00:25:10,090	00:25:12,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	perspective way more bacterial than we
EDL	00:25:12,040	00:25:15,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	are mammalian we are but they're most of
EDL	00:25:15,040	00:25:16,600	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the time this is this is a symbiosis(共生)
EDL	00:25:16,600	00:25:18,130	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	this is this is a mutually beneficial
EDL	00:25:18,130	00:25:22,090	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	relationship and so it really we
EDL	00:25:22,090	00:25:23,860	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	shouldn't always think about these these
EDL	00:25:23,860	00:25:27,370	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	microbes(微生物) as things to consider them 
EDL	00:25:27,370	00:25:28,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	enemies we shouldn't consider them that's
EDL	00:25:28,690	00:25:30,309	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	right that's right and the other part is
EDL	00:25:30,309	00:25:32,710	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that we learn from them you know it's
EDL	00:25:32,710	00:25:35,830	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it's their evolution that also kind of
EDL	00:25:35,830	00:25:38,800	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	inspires us and so it's a that in some
EDL	00:25:38,800	00:25:40,480	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	ways there are adversary but in some
EDL	00:25:40,480	00:25:43,390	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	ways they're sort of that you know in
EDL	00:25:43,390	00:25:45,040	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the superhero novels and things like
EDL	00:25:45,040	00:25:47,679	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that this idea of the the the balance
EDL	00:25:47,679	00:25:49,630	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	between the hero and the villain(反派) and
EDL	00:25:49,630	00:25:51,820	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	sort of that strange relationship that
EDL	00:25:51,820	00:25:53,950	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	often and develops between the two and
EDL	00:25:53,950	00:25:55,929	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	if you will mutual appreciation is that
EDL	00:25:55,929	00:25:58,417	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	I think that's awesome pathogens 

* ENDING

EDL	00:25:58,417	00:25:58,870	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	so Matt
EDL	00:25:58,870	00:26:00,760	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we're coming toward the end of our time
EDL	00:26:00,760	00:26:03,990	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	here but I'm just wondering if there is
EDL	00:26:03,990	00:26:06,610	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	something that didn't come up during our
EDL	00:26:06,610	00:26:08,740	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	discussion that you think would be of
EDL	00:26:08,740	00:26:11,559	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	interest to our listeners given you know
EDL	00:26:11,559	00:26:15,550	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	your goal here of perhaps ridding us of
EDL	00:26:15,550	00:26:17,620	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	some of some of the concerns we have
EDL	00:26:17,620	00:26:20,500	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	about the pathogens in our environment

EDL	00:26:20,500	00:26:22,630	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	yeah one of our mantras at DARPA is this
EDL	00:26:22,630	00:26:26,230	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	idea of inspiring inspiring creativity
EDL	00:26:26,230	00:26:28,450	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and new solutions to problems and
EDL	00:26:28,450	00:26:32,200	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	oftentimes we say by sort of recruiting
EDL	00:26:32,200	00:26:33,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	in people who have not traditionally
EDL	00:26:33,730	00:26:37,270	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	thought about our problems to help us
EDL	00:26:37,270	00:26:40,090	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	with those solutions and so you know I
EDL	00:26:40,090	00:26:41,950	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	would love for the listeners
EDL	00:26:41,950	00:26:45,580	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	this podcast to be more inspired to
EDL	00:26:45,580	00:26:48,370	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	address the problems and Infectious
EDL	00:26:48,370	00:26:51,279	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	Diseases and what I mean by that is I
EDL	00:26:51,279	00:26:54,010	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	always say people like me have to you
EDL	00:26:54,010	00:26:56,409	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	know we've invested our entire careers
EDL	00:26:56,409	00:26:58,330	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and our life work into this and we have
EDL	00:26:58,330	00:27:01,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	deep knowledge of the subject but I love
EDL	00:27:01,690	00:27:03,399	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	the thought of people that have
EDL	00:27:03,399	00:27:05,860	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	expertise in computer science in
EDL	00:27:05,860	00:27:09,460	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	mathematics in what we would say well
EDL	00:27:09,460	00:27:10,990	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	maybe those fields aren't necessarily
EDL	00:27:10,990	00:27:13,659	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	obviously related that's who I think
EDL	00:27:13,659	00:27:15,850	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that's how we're gonna solve the
EDL	00:27:15,850	00:27:17,740	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	infectious diseases problems of the 21st
EDL	00:27:17,740	00:27:19,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	century and so when I speak on this it's
EDL	00:27:19,690	00:27:22,029	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	almost part it's one part recruiting and
EDL	00:27:22,029	00:27:24,340	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	it's especially recruiting those that
EDL	00:27:24,340	00:27:27,070	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	may not have all of the biases of the
EDL	00:27:27,070	00:27:28,809	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	traditional experts in infectious
EDL	00:27:28,809	00:27:30,730	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	disease to come up with a creative
EDL	00:27:30,730	00:27:34,779	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	solution to solve it so that makes me
EDL	00:27:34,779	00:27:37,480	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	think of a term that we hear a lot here
EDL	00:27:37,480	00:27:39,279	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	at DARPA you know the innovation
EDL	00:27:39,279	00:27:41,529	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	ecosystem because you just mentioned a
EDL	00:27:41,529	00:27:43,240	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	whole bunch of disciplines that you know
EDL	00:27:43,240	00:27:45,399	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	maybe on first when you first think
EDL	00:27:45,399	00:27:46,929	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	about infectious disease you might not
EDL	00:27:46,929	00:27:48,970	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	think some of those come together so it
EDL	00:27:48,970	00:27:51,340	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	is there something about you and being
EDL	00:27:51,340	00:27:54,570	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	here at DARPA that is conducive to
EDL	00:27:54,570	00:27:57,100	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	shaking up that innovation ecosystem in
EDL	00:27:57,100	00:27:58,659	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	ways that could maybe move toward the
EDL	00:27:58,659	00:28:01,299	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	goals that you have well DARPA enables
EDL	00:28:01,299	00:28:05,019	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	me to do that because again they are our
EDL	00:28:05,019	00:28:07,419	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	program announcements when we say okay
EDL	00:28:07,419	00:28:09,370	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we set the requirements solve this
EDL	00:28:09,370	00:28:12,309	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	problem make us a treatment in 60 days
EDL	00:28:12,309	00:28:14,830	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	we know that they can't do that alone
EDL	00:28:14,830	00:28:17,230	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and it takes a multidisciplinary(多学科) team so
EDL	00:28:17,230	00:28:19,690	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	if if you want funding from DARPA you're
EDL	00:28:19,690	00:28:21,340	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	gonna have to work with people you're
EDL	00:28:21,340	00:28:23,019	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	gonna have to recruit it we design it so
EDL	00:28:23,019	00:28:24,519	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that you will have to recruit in people
EDL	00:28:24,519	00:28:26,260	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	that may not be the traditional subject
EDL	00:28:26,260	00:28:29,740	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	matter experts but furthermore every
EDL	00:28:29,740	00:28:32,049	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	time I get a chance to speak and to talk
EDL	00:28:32,049	00:28:35,679	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	about this problem like on this podcast

* Podcast: as a recruiting tool

EDL	00:28:35,679	00:28:38,320	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	you know again I see it as a recruiting
EDL	00:28:38,320	00:28:43,840	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	as a recruiting tool to inspire those to
EDL	00:28:43,840	00:28:45,100	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	help us address these infectious
EDL	00:28:45,100	00:28:47,350	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	diseases threats well what I'm realizing
EDL	00:28:47,350	00:28:49,840	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	now is I do not want to prevent you for
EDL	00:28:49,840	00:28:51,909	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	another minute going out there and
EDL	00:28:51,909	00:28:54,519	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	realizing your goal of taking the
EDL	00:28:54,519	00:28:56,990	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	lethality(致命性) of pathogenic disease 
EDL	00:28:56,990	00:29:00,500	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	and we are out of time also so I just want to thank you
EDL	00:29:00,500	00:29:02,540	| VfD E18 The Disease Slayer |	this has been immensely fascinating for

* NOTE

In this episode of Voices from DARPA, COL Matthew Hepburn, a program manager
since 2013 with the Agency’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO), explains how
his urgent ambition to develop ways and means of disarming current and emerging
infectious and pandemic diseases—think here of Ebola, influenza, and
Chikungunya—has led to a portfolio of go-for-the-gold programs that ultimately
could reduce human suffering by an immeasurable degree. A biomedical engineer,
physician, and global disease fighter by training and experience, Matt has
known since he was a child that taking care of people was going to be his
mission and he says DARPA is a place where he might be able to carry out that
childhood dream to an extreme that would not be possible elsewhere.
