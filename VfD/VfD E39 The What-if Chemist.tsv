EDL	00:00:31,420	00:00:39,190	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Welcome to Voices from dark a window , and the dark is core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:39,640	00:00:43,060	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	My name is ivan , a motto and arm , your DARPA host today . 
EDL	00:00:43,060	00:00:44,230	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I am pleased to be talking with . 
EDL	00:00:44,230	00:00:50,420	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Doctors , said kung , a program manager in the agency of biological technology service . 
EDL	00:00:50,420	00:01:18,793	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	He brings to doubt that interests in experience that ranges from a novel materials that can make technologies more capable , new approaches to therapists and medical counter and new strategies for acquiring scarce materials like rare earth elements , which have rolled in many high technologies and even portable water , we are recording our conversation from our respective pounds , as we do our parts to slow the spread of coffee nineteenth , because we are not in a recording studio . 
EDL	00:01:18,793	00:01:24,046	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You might hear ambient sounds like trafficking melbourne to tell you a little bit more about safe . 
EDL	00:01:24,046	00:01:31,910	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	He joins the art of the university of california , sandy ago , where he is a professor in the department of chemistry and biochemistry and former department . 
EDL	00:01:31,910	00:01:46,218	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	His research has focused on the interface of bail in organic and medicinal chemistry and advanced materials , including middle organic frameworks or maps , which are many among themselves , chemical separations in catalysts . 
EDL	00:01:46,218	00:01:59,230	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	No stranger to federal science and technology rules that was the triple ASroger reveal fellow in global stewardship in the white house office of science and technology policy known for shorters OSTP. 
EDL	00:01:59,230	00:02:00,000	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And he is an alarm . 
EDL	00:02:00,000	00:02:02,114	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Owners of the dark responsibility .

EDL	00:02:20,500	00:02:22,301	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Sounds cool , thanks for joining me . 
EDL	00:02:22,301	00:02:23,302	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	This conversation . 
EDL	00:02:23,302	00:02:25,503	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	That's my pleasure to try to be here . 
EDL	00:02:25,503	00:02:31,908	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So I always like to get a sense of the origin of the scientist specific interests in your case in chemistry . 
EDL	00:02:31,908	00:02:45,257	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And as we mentioned in something a specific against frameworks , and you also interested in sort of all that chemistry is going on inside of sales makes me wonder , you know , certainly the chemistry side of your lighting , things on fire in your parents . 
EDL	00:02:45,257	00:02:51,450	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Base manager , you have some love at first side when you saw the period go elements , but you tell me where , where did your interests come from? 
EDL	00:02:52,030	00:02:55,350	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Managers and science definitely started in childhood . 
EDL	00:02:55,350	00:02:57,760	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	My father before he became an office . 
EDL	00:02:57,760	00:03:04,560	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Telemarketer was a bio georgia teacher for middle of high school , and he was always really passionate about science . 
EDL	00:03:04,560	00:03:14,040	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And we spent many and evening together watching novel , or nationally graphic , or even the mutual . 
EDL	00:03:14,040	00:03:15,370	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Oh my hair , I think it was. 
EDL	00:03:15,370	00:03:18,220	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Oh , wild kingdom , yes , I remembered that. 
EDL	00:03:18,630	00:03:20,110	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Wild kingdom , thank you . 
EDL	00:03:20,110	00:03:24,160	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , so shows like this were a staple of our evening . 
EDL	00:03:24,460	00:03:29,660	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Things are cosmos as well , of course , and he always just encourage my interest in science . 
EDL	00:03:29,660	00:03:36,070	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We would go fossil hunting off a more home bully varied in southern california , always assist without the top of the list . 
EDL	00:03:36,070	00:03:46,930	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And really , after my dad , although he didn't go into a longer inquiry , and scientists himself here had a real passion for it and always really inspired my interest in it . 
EDL	00:03:46,930	00:03:50,570	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so even I did not profile interest going in the high school . 
EDL	00:03:50,570	00:04:00,030	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I was very involved in speech and debate and student government , and had an interesting law and civilians that core interesting science I just couldn't shake . 
EDL	00:04:00,030	00:04:03,550	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , and it just stuck with me all the way through my current career or. 
EDL	00:04:04,210	00:04:08,850	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So fantastic practical influence in sparking the interesting science in general . 
EDL	00:04:08,850	00:04:09,970	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But how about chemistry ? 
EDL	00:04:09,970	00:04:12,030	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	What is it the direct you there? 
EDL	00:04:12,030	00:04:18,122	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , chemistry was AIsort of failing to it , which is probably not a super uncommon story . 
EDL	00:04:18,122	00:04:22,256	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I would think I went to college , you know , knowing I was politician . 
EDL	00:04:22,256	00:04:24,650	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Science as a major , maybe premature . 
EDL	00:04:24,650	00:04:30,325	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I wasn't entirely sure I never really thought about being a chemistry majoring in chemistry . 
EDL	00:04:30,325	00:04:35,610	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I was much more interested in the sort of extremes on either side of chemistry , which was either . 
EDL	00:04:35,610	00:04:40,531	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I was very interested in biology , probably again , influenced by the TVshows . 
EDL	00:04:40,531	00:04:41,172	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I watched . 
EDL	00:04:41,172	00:05:09,384	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I was interested , maybe like being a few biologists setting animals like an or the other stream of being an astronomy physicist , inspired by shows that cosmos , I was always really fascinated with space and astronomy , and had a real love for that , but I sort of fell in the chemistry , probably for two reasons , one , as I , my massachusetts , have a strong enough to be a natural physicist , and as much as I loved it , it was very challenging , but probably the bigger influence was actually just a friend in college . 
EDL	00:05:09,384	00:05:17,300	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So when I was asking for his undergrad , I was in all freshman dorms there , but I was in the one dormitory of freshmen and started making friends right away . 
EDL	00:05:17,730	00:05:37,000	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And one of my closest friends of my closest friend in college was a guarantee , stephen miller , and we became fast friends very early , and he had a real passion for chemistry , and we took those freshmen chemistry classes together and very competitive owls trying to beat each other on the next term of final . 
EDL	00:05:37,000	00:05:42,111	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And he thought that kept nudging me towards chemistry , and I was good at it at the time . 
EDL	00:05:42,111	00:05:44,777	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	At least , you know , I didn't came as classes . 
EDL	00:05:44,777	00:05:53,860	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so as I think , a combination , having some sort of feeling of ethnic ford , but a lot of just urging by this body of mine to say , hey , let's do chemistry together . 
EDL	00:05:53,860	00:05:55,140	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And it's really cool . 
EDL	00:05:55,140	00:05:57,190	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And you should , you should stick with chemistry . 
EDL	00:05:57,190	00:05:58,500	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And I thought of how it ended out . 
EDL	00:05:58,500	00:06:14,476	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And the funny is also a professor chemistry at university , foreign games , well , and in our PHTthesis , I credited him for my interest in sticking with chemistry , and he , conversely , credited me , which I thought was ironic because I never thought I put chemistry . 
EDL	00:06:14,476	00:06:18,520	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I was out of the other way around , but apparently we sort of self coaches each other in the field. 
EDL	00:06:18,520	00:06:27,420	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Love that story , I mean , just how how two friends would influence each other , and also the chemistry degree is near , and due to my heart , because of that , that was my undergraduate degree as well . 
EDL	00:06:27,420	00:06:28,900	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Campaign event spring up . 
EDL	00:06:28,900	00:06:42,460	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And for what I do is a science communicator , I felt like what that did for me is giving me the language of science , but in a way where I could actually also talk to biologist and go in the other direction and talk to some of the anybody dealing with atoms and molecules . 
EDL	00:06:42,460	00:06:44,780	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So so if I think it's a great degree. 
EDL	00:06:45,220	00:06:46,700	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , I strongly agree with that . 
EDL	00:06:46,700	00:06:53,200	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And although I can never encourage myself being a chemist as my crude developer , I definitely found it to be a really good film . 
EDL	00:06:53,200	00:07:23,864	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I love the a synthetic chemistry training , so making new molecules , although I did have a postcard and biochemistry , but that's idea that the process of discovery and being creative in coming up with new molecules that nobody ever made before and being in the lab and making something that no one , at least on this planet , is ever made before orange and characterising and figuring out what it is and what it does is a spiritual element of creativity there that are not sure everybody appreciates that I found this is kept my passion in science over the years . 
EDL	00:07:23,864	00:07:24,720	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I love to that . 
EDL	00:07:24,720	00:07:27,630	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I think , you know , people will be excited about and interesting. 
EDL	00:07:27,630	00:07:29,128	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Indeed , indeed , and these are hope . 
EDL	00:07:29,128	00:07:35,120	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Some young people listening to this and hearing about the way of the excitement of discovery that comes with going into chemistry . 
EDL	00:07:35,120	00:07:36,951	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So maybe you actually influence them . 
EDL	00:07:36,951	00:07:38,590	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And there are reference in there . 
EDL	00:07:38,590	00:07:50,896	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So when a movement tried to coming to dark on taking on the roads , program engineering , biological technologies of office , I was in twenty one thousand nine hundred and twenty years at the university , california , sandy ago , in an academic setting . 
EDL	00:07:50,896	00:07:55,310	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Some just wondering what in buyer , the leap two , and how did they come about ? 
EDL	00:07:55,830	00:07:56,410	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I think you. 
EDL	00:07:56,410	00:08:00,000	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	As you mentioned , I have always had a with my colleagues . 
EDL	00:08:00,000	00:08:03,454	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Greece , I also had long standing in tuesday and policy and civics . 
EDL	00:08:03,454	00:08:11,323	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	This goes back to high school as well , where I was involved in a lot of clubs quickly , the genuine station of america , which was a very big civic club . 
EDL	00:08:11,323	00:08:16,410	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so a student government club that I really love and still love , still support . 
EDL	00:08:16,410	00:08:29,150	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so when i've got ten year , uses NDAgo around two thousand and sixty thousand and seven , I had time for a civilization , and it was time for me to sort of scratch that each in terms of policy interests and civic interests . 
EDL	00:08:29,150	00:08:34,741	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so I applied and received that replies , fellowship that he mentioned and went to work at all ATP for a year . 
EDL	00:08:34,741	00:08:39,400	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It was actually under both the bush and obama administrations of their own transition . 
EDL	00:08:39,400	00:08:41,062	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It was a wonderful experience . 
EDL	00:08:41,062	00:08:42,354	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I absolutely loved it . 
EDL	00:08:42,354	00:08:48,818	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It was just a totally different world , and it was one of the great benefits of being a professor and academic with that . 
EDL	00:08:48,818	00:08:56,310	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You have these opportunities to literally step out of your everyday job and step in doing a timely , different world and do something totally different . 
EDL	00:08:56,660	00:09:16,760	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so those TPIdid advantage of science policy world and got to hang out around and near the white house and and see a change of administration is received today between two two administrations and just a lot of stuff that is acted in a chemistry I would never seen in my life , and I got a pretty open , close and personal view . 
EDL	00:09:16,760	00:09:25,680	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It saw it was just great , and after I finished that september twenty nine team , I knew I wanted to come back and was just a matter of where and when . 
EDL	00:09:25,680	00:09:34,780	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so I looked at working at a variety , federal agencies on the national science , on and then dark became a people mentioned above . 
EDL	00:09:34,780	00:09:38,680	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I learned about it through the disease , which you mention the defensive study group . 
EDL	00:09:38,680	00:09:41,550	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	There are a number of prominent people at my university . 
EDL	00:09:41,550	00:09:47,437	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	This is an eagle who a football program managers at the , including our chancellor and our DNA engineering . 
EDL	00:09:47,437	00:09:54,334	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And they have mentioned how much they enjoyed dark on what special places it was , and so that really stimulated my interests . 
EDL	00:09:54,334	00:10:02,153	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so about a decade after I left , DC, Idecided to try to positions in the federal government , particularly with focus on DARPA . 
EDL	00:10:02,153	00:10:05,318	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And ultimately , it worked out I am here now , I really like it . 
EDL	00:10:05,318	00:10:08,111	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I should say , i'm at dark under a special mechanism . 
EDL	00:10:08,111	00:10:16,629	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I am still actually a part of the USDfaculty and ultimately plan on returning there , and I still have a research group that conducts our research . 
EDL	00:10:16,629	00:10:19,030	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	There is well filled with grassins and post dogs. 
EDL	00:10:19,380	00:10:30,090	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Best of both worlds , because many program managers are so moved to come to dark , but that tells you that they know it's just for a couple of years , and they don't know at a time whether they are going to end up afterwards . 
EDL	00:10:30,090	00:10:30,820	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So it's great to have . 
EDL	00:10:30,820	00:10:35,090	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I would imagine the kind of security that this arrangement does afford you . 
EDL	00:10:35,680	00:10:49,330	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So before we talk about a few of what are really amazing sanding programs that you ever see , including ones that help us take on the troubling rise of anti biotic resistance , and also precured . 
EDL	00:10:49,330	00:10:51,190	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	What are where it is scarce . 
EDL	00:10:51,190	00:10:59,330	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I have to ask you about a seminar that you told a few times the UCS d it is called history of the american muscle car death. 
EDL	00:11:00,000	00:11:01,491	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , that was a lot of fun . 
EDL	00:11:01,491	00:11:04,687	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So UCS d has a program called freshman seminars . 
EDL	00:11:04,687	00:11:11,080	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	They tried to incentivize faculty to get to know the incoming freshmen better in a small environment . 
EDL	00:11:11,080	00:11:17,616	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so it hurt it like a large person in chemistry class to get to know your students well , and so they have this christmas . 
EDL	00:11:17,616	00:11:20,499	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Women are programmed as limited to twenty students . 
EDL	00:11:20,499	00:11:23,960	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It's one hour a week , and you can basically teach any topic you want . 
EDL	00:11:23,960	00:11:26,327	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So the first couple of times I did it . 
EDL	00:11:26,327	00:11:31,458	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I tried to keep it close to home to chemistry , and I talk classes in forensic chemistry . 
EDL	00:11:31,458	00:11:33,826	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It was called by CSIfact infection . 
EDL	00:11:33,826	00:11:40,610	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I told a class in archaeological chemistry , archaeological set of which I call two motorcycles , something like that . 
EDL	00:11:40,610	00:11:48,140	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And then I realized how much latter to the university would give me on this , because they really were having factory , getting a freshmen . 
EDL	00:11:48,520	00:11:56,320	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so again , inspired by my father , my father , his brother were big motorhead when I was growing up , my dad was always buying and selling cars . 
EDL	00:11:56,320	00:12:00,030	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So it is brother that worked in a gas station and own gas station together . 
EDL	00:12:00,030	00:12:00,670	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Write new opinion . 
EDL	00:12:00,670	00:12:09,640	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Hot dogs , los angeles , growing up together , I always love cars and not as knowledgeable about all mobiles as my father and his brother were , but I, Icertainly love them . 
EDL	00:12:09,640	00:12:12,860	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Another history pretty well have only a few class of the years . 
EDL	00:12:13,260	00:12:22,740	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so I just thought , hey , why not learn more about it myself and just have a fun , engaging way with the students in much of my surprise , they approve the class . 
EDL	00:12:22,740	00:12:23,650	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We did the class . 
EDL	00:12:23,650	00:12:33,817	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	About half a twitter of lectures , if you will , are discussions about the history of automobiles , particularly the muscle car period of the nineteen sixties in early seventies . 
EDL	00:12:33,817	00:12:38,160	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But then we would do the last five classes as a on one of the places that uses any eagles . 
EDL	00:12:38,160	00:12:41,260	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So I would invite the muslim club or invite the shopping club . 
EDL	00:12:41,260	00:12:49,060	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I invited the more part club , and those guys love coming out , and they will show off their cars in the students would walk around the place . 
EDL	00:12:49,060	00:12:54,528	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	A lot of students is , but I would walk around and talk to the owners about their cars and learn about how they were . 
EDL	00:12:54,528	00:12:54,869	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	They were . 
EDL	00:12:54,869	00:12:57,424	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	They came from and how they restored them and all the stuff . 
EDL	00:12:57,424	00:12:58,957	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So it was a lot , a lot of fun . 
EDL	00:12:58,957	00:13:00,210	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It was a lot of fun. 
EDL	00:13:00,210	00:13:01,180	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Absolutely love it . 
EDL	00:13:01,180	00:13:11,090	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So if you remind me that when I was in high school , my best friend had a sixty five months than you know that he restored , there was a lot of fun to drive around that . 
EDL	00:13:11,090	00:13:14,020	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So this makes me wonder what muscle card you have in your driver. 
EDL	00:13:14,330	00:13:16,870	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , so I have owned a couple of years . 
EDL	00:13:16,870	00:13:19,860	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I had a couple of muscles , because they will . 
EDL	00:13:19,860	00:13:24,150	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	They used to be another pretty expensive , the use of the entry level car for a collector . 
EDL	00:13:24,150	00:13:29,990	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So I had a seventy three mark one , a mastering gold with a final talk . 
EDL	00:13:29,990	00:13:32,340	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It was quite the thing I had that actually back in grass school . 
EDL	00:13:32,340	00:13:34,080	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I bought it off that uncle of mine . 
EDL	00:13:34,080	00:13:36,253	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Then I had a seventy two mark one . 
EDL	00:13:36,253	00:13:53,215	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Then I , when I got ten year , I bought myself a sydney three , mustn't convertible , and then I upgraded to a sixty nine firebird convertible , which I actually that car discovered when I was here at OSTP, my mentor at OCP, her father owner car . 
EDL	00:13:53,215	00:13:59,365	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	He was the original owner , had had its since nineteen sixty nine , wanted to get rid of it to a good home . 
EDL	00:13:59,365	00:14:08,220	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so I car back with me from my first ten year and DCand restored it and drove that car for a long , long time , is a wonderful car . 
EDL	00:14:08,220	00:14:17,700	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And then my most recent acquisition , like I just saw a few years , is there a sixty three quarrel that convert about it was always a dream that was always a dream car . 
EDL	00:14:17,700	00:14:18,500	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Mind , yeah , sixty three . 
EDL	00:14:18,500	00:14:18,890	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	so. 
EDL	00:14:18,890	00:14:24,580	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Wrap it , okay , so you know , let's get to the business at hand , which is your experience at the dark . 
EDL	00:14:24,580	00:14:34,923	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so I wanted to start with one of your programs that , gosh , sounds like it would be great to have the , the technology you're invision in the anti viral technology , and it had that in hand . 
EDL	00:14:34,923	00:14:37,310	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Now , the , the program , short name is interesting . 
EDL	00:14:37,310	00:14:42,202	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It's one name is interfering and coal evolving provincial and therapy programs . 
EDL	00:14:42,202	00:14:46,205	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We started actually , by a previous program manager , jim kim lit . 
EDL	00:14:46,205	00:14:51,440	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I just would've shared sort of the basic concept of the program , and where it now. 
EDL	00:14:51,440	00:14:56,658	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Sure , so it's a fascinating program , and I feel privileged to have inherited it . 
EDL	00:14:56,658	00:15:00,530	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	When I joined , DARPA was a great introduction agency . 
EDL	00:15:00,530	00:15:13,891	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Until you get me up to speed about how to how to learn about the program and manager program , and the program is focused on a class of what will be or could be a novel theraputics for treating viral disease . 
EDL	00:15:13,891	00:15:20,558	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And his novel therapeutics are called tips , which stands for therapeutic interfering particle . 
EDL	00:15:20,558	00:15:32,724	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So let's say , for example , you have the , now we have a vaccine for the flu , but we have to reinvent that vaccines every year , because the flu mutates and a new strain becomes dominant year after a year . 
EDL	00:15:32,724	00:15:46,618	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So what this approach would do that was different , different from our a vaccine , which stimulates the new system or a small molecule , which is sort of your typical drug like aspirin , that which is directly set of attack , the virus is developed . 
EDL	00:15:46,618	00:15:52,286	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	These tips , the best way I think to describe it is that it's a neutral version of the flu virus . 
EDL	00:15:52,286	00:16:00,030	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So it has all the components of the flu virus , but some genetic element is missing or disrupted , or others . 
EDL	00:16:00,030	00:16:03,050	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Why is not properly constructed ? 
EDL	00:16:03,050	00:16:19,090	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so what you end up with is this tape , a therapy of kenya particle is viral particle that looks like the virus is how many of the components of the virus , but the key part that is missing province , it from self replicating , and that's really the key . 
EDL	00:16:19,090	00:16:23,910	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so this type can be given to someone it can enter . 
EDL	00:16:23,910	00:16:26,760	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The person sells just like a virus . 
EDL	00:16:26,760	00:16:30,930	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But once it's in the cell , it just stopped there and can do anything . 
EDL	00:16:31,260	00:16:46,729	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	However , if that same becomes infected by the live flu virus , the disease causing club virus , it turns the tip on , and what the tip will do is , instead of allowing the virus to replicate itself inside the tip will steal . 
EDL	00:16:46,729	00:16:49,667	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The machinery is missing in its noodle genome . 
EDL	00:16:49,667	00:16:53,508	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It will steal that machine ray virus and make copies of itself . 
EDL	00:16:53,508	00:17:01,383	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And that's really important , because what happens now is , instead of the virus replicating itself , the type replicate itself . 
EDL	00:17:01,383	00:17:12,001	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And the tip is not disease causing , nor can the tip replicate once the virus is gone so effectively , the tip competes with the , until the virus is just knocked out . 
EDL	00:17:12,001	00:17:18,005	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And in the whole system shuts down , and the virus is stopped , and even if it doesn't stop it on the first path . 
EDL	00:17:18,005	00:17:25,503	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So let's say it competes with the virus may be knocked down the number of articles that are produced , but various dealers escapes . 
EDL	00:17:25,503	00:17:26,996	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It can escape with it . 
EDL	00:17:26,996	00:17:40,500	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so those viral particles go , in fact , neighboring cells again , the tips can enter themselves as well and continue to come back and compete with until the library was suggested , exhausted and outcompeted . 
EDL	00:17:40,500	00:17:41,860	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And then the whole system. 
EDL	00:17:42,360	00:17:53,656	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	That is an amazing kind of molecular dynamic to imagine , actually , in a sort of pulling off when you work at the performers , which charges say the research , said that of contracts that working under the program . 
EDL	00:17:53,656	00:17:57,880	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	How would you articulate the farther said any of these researchers have got into the goal? 
EDL	00:17:57,880	00:17:59,190	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Well , I am very encouraged . 
EDL	00:17:59,190	00:18:07,220	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It's very much your program entering its fourth year now , and the results of the innocent program are very intelligent . 
EDL	00:18:07,220	00:18:12,050	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Tips could become a completely new class of therapy of canada measures for treating violence . 
EDL	00:18:12,050	00:18:14,537	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We started , or again , gym , gym , look before me . 
EDL	00:18:14,537	00:18:30,450	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And the other programming is that the manager program before me started with just saying or looking at , can we make safe and effective tips that can you make a tube that competes with the virus effectively knocks down an infection and isn't harmful to sales or an animal . 
EDL	00:18:30,450	00:18:45,376	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And what I can tell you that for a wide range of viral diseases from the flute HIVto others , more exciting ones , you may not have heard of , and even some more current data looking at covered were trying to get for these . 
EDL	00:18:45,376	00:18:49,107	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	These establishes is like flu , HIV, and others . 
EDL	00:18:49,107	00:19:03,430	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	There is very good data showing that these researchers can develop tips that the tips are safe in animal models , and as the tips effectively prevent not only infection , but the spread of that infection between animals . 
EDL	00:19:03,430	00:19:07,610	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so I think the program is looking very encouraging . 
EDL	00:19:07,610	00:19:11,090	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We are pushing some of our performers to try to get these novel . 
EDL	00:19:11,090	00:19:14,140	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Canada measures into a face , one clinical trial . 
EDL	00:19:14,140	00:19:16,610	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And i'm hopeful before the programs over , we will do that . 
EDL	00:19:16,610	00:19:17,910	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I think that's parliament . 
EDL	00:19:17,910	00:19:22,330	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The last major hurdle is that this is an entirely new type of drug . 
EDL	00:19:22,330	00:19:27,090	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It's not like vaccines or biologics or small molecules . 
EDL	00:19:27,090	00:19:38,770	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The way we normally think of them , and so it will be interesting to see how this moves forward in a clinical setting , how the fta will available a therapy to look like this with a think will be appropriate . 
EDL	00:19:38,770	00:19:44,720	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I am very encouraged that we could see tips as a real medical theraputics for dealing with violence in the future. 
EDL	00:19:45,090	00:19:46,460	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , interesting . 
EDL	00:19:46,460	00:19:52,464	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I am glad that you are encouraging your performers to really think about the trials and getting the they did there . 
EDL	00:19:52,464	00:20:06,840	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Because , as you mention , this is so different from the sort of pharmaceutical mechanism and antibiotic mechanism that it could will be that a regulatory challenge is going to be the dark ahead problem , even more so than the actual sort of chemical and former social and. 
EDL	00:20:07,520	00:20:12,090	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , it very well could be , because it is a really different mechanism for drug . 
EDL	00:20:12,090	00:20:28,795	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But if you think about the current code pandemic that were all living in , I mean , if you had a drug that could keep up with that virus and not only stamped out in an individual , but prevent that individual from spreading it to others , it's literally exactly what you would want even more . 
EDL	00:20:28,795	00:20:34,000	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So I would say than vaccine , perhaps , in the current situation we have been living in . 
EDL	00:20:34,000	00:20:39,151	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You know , having seen what we all lived in experience through the last , almost coming on a year . 
EDL	00:20:39,151	00:20:46,570	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Now , I think that , you know , that should provide some real incentive for a tip to be given serious consideration , considering what they. 
EDL	00:20:46,570	00:21:07,112	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	May you succeed because , as we know and democracy bets will work experiencing that right now , this new technology might not be in hand for this particular round of a pandemic , but hopefully for the next one , let's move on to a summer related program in the sense that it's aiming for a new kind of pharmaceutical techniques . 
EDL	00:21:07,112	00:21:15,164	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But in this case , may be dealing more with bacteria and harnessing in the medical activity for life saving remedies , or in a short form . 
EDL	00:21:15,164	00:21:38,840	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Hiller at HEALRsaid this one , two as a satisfactory focus on developing new countermeasures , though more focus on sort of looking at the public health communities were concerned about because of the ascent of antibiotic resistant microbes and the potential that we could enter a sort of a post end up at it everywhere we can no longer use these fantastic medicine . 
EDL	00:21:38,840	00:21:43,850	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So how might the hero program step in and save the day when it comes to fighting off? 
EDL	00:21:43,850	00:21:51,170	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Bacteria , sir , so here is a new program that my team is dark and I developed , but approve that we're pushing for now . 
EDL	00:21:51,580	00:21:59,180	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , anybody resistance is in many ways , the sort of stealth pandemic that's been emerging for over twenty years now . 
EDL	00:21:59,180	00:22:17,570	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So people , oh no , that this is a problem that the bacteria that we get infections from are becoming increasingly resistant to the analytics that we have available , that when a new energy is developed , residents emerges much more rapidly , sometimes within a year of the drug being first used . 
EDL	00:22:18,070	00:22:23,980	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so this is a crisis that has been well recognized by , I guess that many people have called the pandemic . 
EDL	00:22:23,980	00:22:27,580	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	That's been a sort of evolving or emerging for twenty years . 
EDL	00:22:27,580	00:22:42,340	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so the human program is designed to take on this challenge , using a new approach , a different approach that involves harnessing one's own biology to combat the bacterial function . 
EDL	00:22:42,340	00:22:48,460	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so there's a technology that's been about a little less than a decade . 
EDL	00:22:48,460	00:22:54,970	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I would say , and it's an approach by which a new class of drugs often referred to his camera drugs . 
EDL	00:22:54,970	00:23:03,010	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Camara , referring to the middle article creature that has multiple heads on a single body like fine and a dragon and eagle fuse to one body . 
EDL	00:23:03,010	00:23:27,162	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	These molecules also have multiple heads and the way they work is one head of the molecule engages your target , so something that is causing or propagating a disease that head is attached to another head that engages some sort of biology within your cell that is designed to either the activate or eliminate that the activators are destroyed . 
EDL	00:23:27,162	00:23:40,470	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so this concept has been widely investigated , as in any inconnue trials currently for addressing cancer , but it has not yet been applied to many other diseases , including bacteria , cross diseases . 
EDL	00:23:40,860	00:24:02,554	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so what the hiller program is largely focused on is taking this protects or climate technology and porting it from its name and face with cancer biology and applying it to bacteria , threats and bacterial talks in such as anthrops toxin , or barcelona , or many patriotic micro organisms . 
EDL	00:24:02,554	00:24:26,150	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so this is a very , very different mechanism , because you're not just sort of poisoning the organism , or directly attacking a component of the organism , but you are buying the impact of what the organism needs to be patagonia , and you're then shadowing it away and just using natural biological processes to damage the activity , or destroy those such as the disease . 
EDL	00:24:26,150	00:24:29,880	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And this has never been applied to microbial disease before . 
EDL	00:24:29,880	00:24:45,875	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so we're hopeful that by bringing again , sort of like with tips and entirely new medical camera measure modality or mechanism of action , we can overcome some of the resistance issues that are playing traditional and about development for decades. 
EDL	00:24:46,335	00:24:52,106	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , so the way you describe these agents in it with the multiple heads in each one having a different function . 
EDL	00:24:52,106	00:24:57,961	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Absolutely not just fascinating to think of that sort of macro molecular construction participants . 
EDL	00:24:57,961	00:25:07,029	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Sounds like anybody , right , because it , I have to have a kind of specificity for one of those as where can go after the troubles and bacteria , but you do not go after everything else . 
EDL	00:25:07,029	00:25:08,940	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So headache has specifically , yes , so. 
EDL	00:25:08,940	00:25:13,080	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The use of an anybody is is definitely one possible approach . 
EDL	00:25:13,420	00:25:18,160	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I'm sure , when hiller begins its research efforts is not actually at that stage yet . 
EDL	00:25:18,160	00:25:37,010	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But once it starts , I am , if you look at the scientific literature on this , which you see is that there are actually a variety of that are being pursued in that inclusions at antibodies that also include small molecules or poor small molecule drives , can be very , very specific for a target , includes different kinds of biological or peptide base constructs . 
EDL	00:25:37,010	00:25:38,180	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	There are many different ways . 
EDL	00:25:38,180	00:25:48,370	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	One can can address this problem , actually both to develop the head to target the packaging , as well as the head to target the biological system to eliminate the passage . 
EDL	00:25:48,700	00:25:59,462	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Both of those require development of very specific groups , and there are variety ways to do that , and actually part of the hill program is to invest in the technology . 
EDL	00:25:59,462	00:26:02,183	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	How do identify those , what we call leagues ? 
EDL	00:26:02,183	00:26:04,366	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	How do you identify the best legals ? 
EDL	00:26:04,366	00:26:05,895	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	What are the best approaches ? 
EDL	00:26:05,895	00:26:15,190	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	How do you discover them quickly and make sure , like you said , they're specifically so that is actually part of the investment hiller plans to make in developing the technology. 
EDL	00:26:15,190	00:26:23,604	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The epidemic will also send it to me , almost like in one agent , you kind of putting together several components about natural music systems . 
EDL	00:26:23,604	00:26:27,332	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Do right to anybody might allege onto a passenger particle . 
EDL	00:26:27,332	00:26:32,611	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It also is then flagging other cellular parts of the municipal development for the kill . 
EDL	00:26:32,611	00:26:43,906	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Where is it seems like you're getting not only your sort of selective identification of a passage in , on this case of microbes , but it is very same particle you've packaged in the killing mechanism . 
EDL	00:26:43,906	00:26:46,910	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So it seems almost like a super efficient immune. 
EDL	00:26:47,330	00:26:48,700	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , that I actually went on . 
EDL	00:26:48,700	00:26:49,810	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	My program . 
EDL	00:26:49,810	00:26:52,510	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Manager colleagues made that observation to me . 
EDL	00:26:52,510	00:26:58,672	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	He said that , oh yeah , so it seems like you're creating an artificial immune system using other biological pathways . 
EDL	00:26:58,672	00:27:00,720	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And I think that's a description . 
EDL	00:27:00,720	00:27:07,630	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So there are certainly a lot of parallels with this camera approach to the native amusing system . 
EDL	00:27:07,630	00:27:25,308	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I think the potential advantage of the approach here is that you can use it to compliment the natural annual system , because you're not necessarily going use the same clearance path with you could use these molecules , help recruit elements of the immune target the packaging . 
EDL	00:27:25,308	00:27:38,100	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But again , there are many other passwords that are in signs that would degrade the passage and or an important component of the pathogen , or , as you said , flagged for destruction , which is actually how protects itself works . 
EDL	00:27:38,400	00:27:53,240	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So I think , in a sense , we're almost like opening up human biology to see what other processes and human biology can actually , as a type of immune system , if we can honest them. 
EDL	00:27:53,240	00:27:57,476	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Okay , when umbrella amazing programs , we have to be learning about themselves . 
EDL	00:27:57,476	00:27:59,209	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And I want to talk about one more . 
EDL	00:27:59,209	00:28:02,180	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And this one has , and that sounds like to be hard to live up to . 
EDL	00:28:02,180	00:28:10,850	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But I love the acquaintance is all spell that you would expect AWEthat stands for atmospheric water extraction . 
EDL	00:28:11,380	00:28:16,330	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Now , you know , the availability of fresh water is a big deal , is becoming a bigger and bigger deal . 
EDL	00:28:16,330	00:28:25,976	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We had walked with a fresh water if changing weather patterns and roads are making fresh water , a real concern for the future in a world climate change . 
EDL	00:28:25,976	00:28:31,680	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So talking about how you imagine the opportunity or program and what you hope to deliver with it to the us . 
EDL	00:28:31,680	00:28:34,230	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Bilateral improves as a billion sectors. 
EDL	00:28:34,230	00:28:47,600	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The opportunity was the first program I started at darbar , and despite its simple acronym , it was actually one of the more difficult acronyms to come up with , not just because it was my first program , but because I actually am a huge science fiction . 
EDL	00:28:47,600	00:29:00,230	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And I was absolutely dead , said on naming the program , something related to taiwan , or lose skywalker or uncle owen , because uncle owen in star wars was the moisture farmers would take out . 
EDL	00:29:00,230	00:29:21,745	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So I was very disappointed , but I could not come up with an agreement to fit any of those things , and so ended up with all but the opportunity seeks to take advantage of effect as you mention , what is the scarce resource not only essential to our war fighters , it's essential for humanitarian purposes , and it is literally been the cause of conflict throughout the world . 
EDL	00:29:21,745	00:29:50,990	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so the upper ground would like to produce a device with a relatively low footprint in terms of energy and size and weight that can harvest the naturally occurring moisture that we have in the air all around us , especially leaving here in the washington DCarea , especially in the summer , many of us will complain about how humidity is and a humidity , of course , is a measurement of how much gaseous water there is in the air . 
EDL	00:29:50,990	00:29:55,960	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It's a very pure form of water , and it's just sort of sitting there , ready for the taking . 
EDL	00:29:55,960	00:30:15,500	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The challenges is , how do you get that water out of the air and energy efficient manner with a small footprint device , so we have ways of capturing water from air ranging from very low energy devices , but that require a very large amount of since called fog nets . 
EDL	00:30:15,810	00:30:25,310	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	A fog nester used under humanitarian situations , they act almost like a big leaf and capture water , condemning out of the air . 
EDL	00:30:25,310	00:30:26,927	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But there are huge installations . 
EDL	00:30:26,927	00:30:36,750	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	They are not very practical for the department defence , and you can only use them where you have a hundred percent relative humidity , so where you're literally the water is stripping out of the air . 
EDL	00:30:36,750	00:30:38,550	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so that's not always useful . 
EDL	00:30:38,550	00:30:49,420	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We are other devices like condensers are the humidity fires that can coolly air such that you can then get the water to liquid fire out of the air , condense out of air . 
EDL	00:30:49,420	00:30:57,949	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You can think of this is your home air conditioning unit if you ever run , sort of like a window unit , you'll see the water dripping off of the condensation . 
EDL	00:30:57,949	00:31:04,880	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	In that case , has been used to call the air , but you can run that device , your air conditioner on a similar way to collect water . 
EDL	00:31:04,880	00:31:33,260	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But the issue there is that , as we all know in the summer , especially in place , like the washing in this area , our electric bills go up tremendously when summer hits , because the air conditioning is a very energy intensive process , so that cooling of the air takes a lot of money and makes that kind of water capture likely not useful for the department of defence and not useful for a lot of other , say , humanitarian applications is just too energy intensive in the all program . 
EDL	00:31:33,260	00:31:52,000	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We hope to find a happy meal medium of a device that can capture water from the air under a wide range of environmental conditions from very humid conditions to very dry conditions , with a small size , weight and power input in the key to this is two parts . 
EDL	00:31:52,000	00:31:55,810	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	First is the development of news orbit materials . 
EDL	00:31:55,810	00:32:04,020	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So new material that can extract the water from the air efficient , and many of us rescue familiar with these urban materials . 
EDL	00:32:04,020	00:32:05,760	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But we need an extraordinary once . 
EDL	00:32:05,760	00:32:22,663	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So the everyday familiar example of a zombie is the little silicon package that you might get with a new pair of shoes or a new backpack or piece clothing that little silicon package is designed to absorb water from the air to keep the clothing fresh and not given being damaged by the humidity . 
EDL	00:32:22,663	00:32:26,950	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So that material very effectively actually grabs the water from the air . 
EDL	00:32:26,950	00:32:34,030	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The challenge was something like silicas is that it doesn't let the water go very easily , take a lot of energy to get the water back out of that material . 
EDL	00:32:34,350	00:32:47,330	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so what we are looking at in odds to the very sophisticated modern materials , next generation that cannot only absorb the water , but then release it under relatively mild conditions , such as that we can make , it advised the harvest water . 
EDL	00:32:47,330	00:32:48,290	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So that's the first. 
EDL	00:32:48,290	00:32:54,160	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The authorities are questioned or may help make your trigger the release that would have been used from from sort of electrical stimulation . 
EDL	00:32:54,160	00:32:54,689	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	magnetical . 
EDL	00:32:54,689	00:32:57,863	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Meanwhile , the materials actually be stimulated to release it . 
EDL	00:32:57,863	00:33:00,000	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	There is a number of different possible. 
EDL	00:33:00,000	00:33:07,560	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But is there are performers that have just started their work are looking at different options , but it could range from all the above . 
EDL	00:33:07,560	00:33:09,660	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You just mention and and others as well . 
EDL	00:33:09,660	00:33:14,526	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So you can hit materials , you can potentially do some of the things you mentioned . 
EDL	00:33:14,526	00:33:17,498	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You can use a variety of sort of thermal electrical . 
EDL	00:33:17,498	00:33:20,470	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Others stimulate to try to get the water back out . 
EDL	00:33:20,470	00:33:25,170	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The key is to make sure that the energy required is as as low as possible , right. 
EDL	00:33:25,170	00:33:27,890	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You're about to go into the sort of the second big element of the. 
EDL	00:33:28,350	00:33:28,791	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	right ? 
EDL	00:33:28,791	00:33:31,662	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So the second big element is the engineering . 
EDL	00:33:31,662	00:33:44,776	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So we do have some new zoo materials that have been described in scientific literature that looks very promising for this , and they have really spectacular water's option and release properties that we can build off of . 
EDL	00:33:44,776	00:33:48,730	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But nobody is ever , really , holistically designed the device. 
EDL	00:33:49,124	00:33:55,835	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	这个时候，我们就可以看到这样的一种情况，在此之前也许会有很多问题。
EDL	00:33:55,835	00:34:06,640	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	但是如果我们在这个过程当中有一些问题的时候，guys that maximum employees , these urban materials and the program is divided in the two . 
EDL	00:34:06,640	00:34:11,820	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	What we call tracks one is called the expansionary , and the other is called the stabilization . 
EDL	00:34:12,140	00:34:32,898	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And the expeditionary track is designed to create a device that an individual would carry and would be very small , obviously in size , maybe something the size of the canteen that would harvest water from the air and then fill up that , for example , war fighters , canteen or their camel back or whatever receptacle they have for collecting the water . 
EDL	00:34:32,898	00:34:39,200	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So this would be a small device just designed to provide enough water from individual on a daily basis . 
EDL	00:34:39,200	00:34:50,962	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And then we have a stabilization approach where this would be a larger device , maybe something on the size of refrigerator , but this will produce a much larger amount of and could supply political drinking water for safety of individuals . 
EDL	00:34:50,962	00:34:52,860	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	They are one hundred and fifty individuals . 
EDL	00:34:52,860	00:34:57,448	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	These require very different engineering challenges are present , very different engineering challenges . 
EDL	00:34:57,448	00:35:06,774	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so our performers have to take that under consideration as well , both from the material standpoint and the engineering standpoint , depending on which device they're trying to successfully produce . 
EDL	00:35:06,774	00:35:14,280	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But both the next petitionary and stabilization size device could have a number of both commercial and immediately in applications . 
EDL	00:35:14,280	00:35:15,170	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We're going to come. 
EDL	00:35:15,170	00:35:19,187	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	For a learning here , you've been very generous with your time , just couple of quick questions . 
EDL	00:35:19,187	00:35:20,473	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Maybe we can be brief here . 
EDL	00:35:20,473	00:35:21,920	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	One of them is just served trying . 
EDL	00:35:21,920	00:35:30,926	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	How do you think about your experience and academic team for twenty years and now is the program and a general federal RNDagency , which is to say , darker . 
EDL	00:35:30,926	00:35:35,960	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And how would you compare and contrast the role of academic , and you know , agency like that in. 
EDL	00:35:35,960	00:35:41,950	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Evolutionary ecosystem , I think they play very different roles in many respects . 
EDL	00:35:41,950	00:35:51,910	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	First of all , I like both work environments very much , and I have to really say that dark has been as many people told me it would be one of the best places I could ever imagine . 
EDL	00:35:51,910	00:35:52,330	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	working . 
EDL	00:35:52,330	00:36:01,960	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It is a fascinating agency filled with incredibly a smart , motivated people who create a incredibly supportive work environment . 
EDL	00:36:01,960	00:36:07,010	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So I am very pleased to an honor to have been part of the arab and continue to be part of the arab . 
EDL	00:36:07,010	00:36:20,110	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	But I would say that in the role in terms of innovation and the ecosystem , you know , the universities are really sort of the front line , right , so medium in department of defense terms , they are sort of the tip of the sphere . 
EDL	00:36:20,110	00:36:36,778	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Right , there are the ones in during the research , you know , with grad students and post dogs and underground and faculty and research staff out there , you know , pushing the boundaries , making the discoveries and and innovating , of course , and coming up with lots of creative ideas are constantly . 
EDL	00:36:36,778	00:36:44,890	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I think that the role of dark , as well as you know , other federal agencies that don't have their own research component , like the national science foundation . 
EDL	00:36:44,890	00:36:50,264	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We're like dark , but they're just funny research and not performing research themselves . 
EDL	00:36:50,264	00:37:00,030	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You know , they are critical part of that industry because that tip of the spear in the elevator is going to happen without federal support and federal funding . 
EDL	00:37:00,030	00:37:16,311	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so a place I doubt not only provides the financial support to allow the research to function and to proceed , but dark , I think , also plays , as well as agencies do a very important point in in pushing those boundaries . 
EDL	00:37:16,311	00:37:16,720	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	right . 
EDL	00:37:16,720	00:37:32,220	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So one thing , having been on both sides of defense here , the academic research and the dark aside , one thing that dark is very well known for is really pushing the boundaries as an academics , historically , you know , sight fatal funding from a variety agencies . 
EDL	00:37:32,220	00:37:52,330	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We're often , you can tend to be a little bit more conservative when you are asking for fatal support because you want to make sure that your programs and that the reviewers of your grand believe it's going to work , and that you can show that you don't research along those lines that shows that you are really capable of doing it , and that tends to keep our ambitions in academia . 
EDL	00:37:52,330	00:37:59,349	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Sometimes real , temporary , because we have to make sure that we can convince the federal government and these agencies that we can continue to do that work . 
EDL	00:37:59,349	00:38:09,559	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And that's a very important function are not knocking it anyway , but there can be a tendency for that , and and people I think , on both sides of the oil go size of the fence , know that . 
EDL	00:38:09,559	00:38:14,697	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And so the dark of places are , especially , it is known for being a cutting edge agency . 
EDL	00:38:14,697	00:38:16,964	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It's known for pushing the boundaries . 
EDL	00:38:16,964	00:38:27,660	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And though our performers are highly qualified and highly skilled individuals , are they done and teams of individuals , they don't necessarily have to assume that they can do this yet . 
EDL	00:38:27,660	00:38:35,050	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	It is a latest and greatest , and in many ways , can be the most risky as research , and that's an important role in the dark of the fields . 
EDL	00:38:35,050	00:38:52,050	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	He's pushing that very cutting edge , allowing people to to take chances to try crazy ideas that are still grounded in good science and good concepts , but that might be outside the comfort zone of a lot of other parts of the federal government to find . 
EDL	00:38:52,050	00:38:53,979	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And I think that's why you see . 
EDL	00:38:53,979	00:38:57,194	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And this has been spoken about for many administrations . 
EDL	00:38:57,194	00:39:00,740	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Now , other federal agencies trying to emulate japan . 
EDL	00:39:00,740	00:39:02,820	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And I think that's a good thing . 
EDL	00:39:02,820	00:39:07,240	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I don't think they should try to emily daughter at the point of their own nonexistence . 
EDL	00:39:07,240	00:39:13,530	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I think , you know , funny agencies like the animation and itself in the do e and missed online online . 
EDL	00:39:13,530	00:39:26,839	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	They play very important roles in the type of research they found in the way they do it , and they have their own emissions that are extremely important , but many of them have taken a nugget of darkness theme and try to incorporate it into the own portfolios . 
EDL	00:39:26,839	00:39:28,867	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And that I do think is a good thing . 
EDL	00:39:28,867	00:39:38,140	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I probably the most notable examples , arbitrary over the department of energy where they are trying to push , cutting out technology for energy sciences and those applications . 
EDL	00:39:38,140	00:39:51,770	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Yeah , I think universities should have tipped the spear certainly idea generating as well , and in dark , a place that sort of super supportive role , and allowing and encouraging those type of researchers to push those boundaries. 
EDL	00:39:51,770	00:40:02,565	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Thanks for giving witness a sense of the many parts of the innovation ecosystem where academic fixing were dark with fixing and across the components of the research infrastructures that there was really great . 
EDL	00:40:02,565	00:40:11,224	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So now , just before we do close here itself , I wanted to give you an opportunity to bring anything that just didn't come up in the discussion and didn't come about a question I ask like that . 
EDL	00:40:11,224	00:40:13,950	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You think there might be interesting films in the snow. 
EDL	00:40:13,950	00:40:19,295	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I guess coming from academia , it gives me a different perspective on DARPA and federal service . 
EDL	00:40:19,295	00:40:21,139	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Certainly , i'm not the only one of done . 
EDL	00:40:21,139	00:40:27,591	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	This is many , many , many people before me , but I do think it gives me a perspective that I like to share , and I will share .

EDL	00:41:02,001	00:41:07,607	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	The other thing I like to highlight is for all those graduate students and post dogs out there . 
EDL	00:41:07,607	00:41:21,020	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	So it dark bug , just like it at my university job , I am given a small team of ph d level scientists to help support all of these programs that you talk about innocent and healer and all , and they help go through all the technical data . 
EDL	00:41:21,020	00:41:35,851	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And how many programs , and they even helped inspire many , many components of these programs , and it's a career opportunity that I think many post dogs and graduate students across the country are probably not aware of , and it is a very , very exciting . 
EDL	00:41:35,851	00:41:38,960	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And I think , in reaching korea past to consider .

EDL	00:41:43,870	00:41:47,680	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Soon in the post , officer looking at in the weather , next step is. 
EDL	00:41:48,080	00:41:51,870	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Great , this was just a really , really fun conversation for me . 
EDL	00:41:51,870	00:42:09,416	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	We covered a lot , some amazing things when a one program that could bring a new anti viral technologies , another one that could potentially play role in this enormous global concern that antibiotics are becoming less effective , and we can really need new ways of countering bacterial infections . 
EDL	00:42:09,416	00:42:16,140	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	A program , yanking water out of the air , both for military and civilian users , perhaps down the line . 
EDL	00:42:16,140	00:42:18,790	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Or , you know , you talk about the innovation ecosystem . 
EDL	00:42:18,790	00:42:31,260	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	You did a great recruiting talk at the end here by why one should work , replace like dark , but so I just want to thank you for all of your time , all of you thinking your expertise , thanks for joining me in this Voices from german conversation. 
EDL	00:42:31,260	00:42:32,010	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	He's been my pleasure . 
EDL	00:42:32,010	00:42:33,200	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	I went , thanks for having. 
EDL	00:42:33,500	00:42:39,420	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us , I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dirt . 
EDL	00:42:41,620	00:42:55,114	| VfD E39 The What-if Chemist |	Thanks also to ban selected for his partnership in producing this program for more information about dark assets called the programs he runs in the agencies , biological technology office and the other breakthrough technologies .
