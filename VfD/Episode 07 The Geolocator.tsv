EDL	00:01:22,944	00:01:24,736	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Thanks for spending time with me today
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,528	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Well thank you for inviting me
EDL	00:01:27,552	00:01:30,368	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Before we talk about some of your efforts to develop
EDL	00:01:30,368	00:01:34,720	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Plan B for when GPS might not be available or to create
EDL	00:01:34,720	00:01:39,072	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Undersea version of GPS I just interested you I want to find out a little bit
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:44,448	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	About you your background and maybe something about how that background explains
EDL	00:01:44,448	00:01:46,752	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	How you ended up here at DARPA in 2012
EDL	00:01:46,752	00:01:48,544	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Well when I was growing up
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:49,824	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I never
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:50,848	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Thought about
EDL	00:01:50,848	00:01:53,152	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	My grow up I want to be a navigation engineer
EDL	00:01:53,664	00:01:57,504	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That was not something that was at the front of my mind
EDL	00:01:58,016	00:01:58,784	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	However when I
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,576	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Came out of grad school
EDL	00:02:00,576	00:02:01,344	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	My first
EDL	00:02:01,344	00:02:01,856	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Job
EDL	00:02:02,368	00:02:05,184	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Was a navigation flight controller
EDL	00:02:05,184	00:02:06,464	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For space shuttle operation
EDL	00:02:07,232	00:02:11,328	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And I fell in love with the Art and Science of navigation
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:18,240	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And it's been a Common Thread in my career ever sets exciting entry I mean to be working on the space shuttle
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:19,264	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Graham just a little bit more about the
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:23,104	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But I was working on the space shuttle program that was before
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:26,176	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We had ups and so the navigation
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:27,456	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	System.of of the
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:29,504	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Are the space shuttle used
EDL	00:02:29,504	00:02:31,296	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A variety of sensors
EDL	00:02:31,296	00:02:33,088	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To determine where that
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,880	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Vehicle was in space
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:39,488	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So we are the navigation system was primarily critical on the
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:40,768	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Entry portion
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:44,096	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Admission that is when it returns from space
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,632	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To The Landing
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:49,472	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Field but also a scent and on orbit operation
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:52,288	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And what did you study in grad school
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:53,824	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Physics
EDL	00:02:53,824	00:02:56,640	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And then I I quickly learned that
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,944	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Theoretical physics was not
EDL	00:02:58,944	00:02:59,968	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	My forte
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:06,112	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But I still love physics so I my graduate degree was in engineering physics
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:12,000	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And there's one other thing about your biography of sense that I'm interested in is your name because I believe your
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:13,536	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Full first name is
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:19,680	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Franklin Co you go buy at Lynn the second syllable for short winners most people who have the name Franklin
EDL	00:03:20,704	00:03:24,032	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We'll go with that for civil Frank so what's up with Lynn
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:28,896	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I like to think that my mother has a sense of humor I am a junior
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,968	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And she did not want to Frank's running around the house
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:35,040	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So my father goes by Frank
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:35,552	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I go by
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:40,160	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It's so that indicates to me that there was a big dose of
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:45,024	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Pragmatism in your home address that spilled over into other way you would he work
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:49,632	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What's Noah talk about some of your programs I think we'll start with the
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:53,472	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Adaptable navigation systems program
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:58,848	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	As do all programs at DARPA this one goes by an acronym in this case ANS
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:03,200	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What intrigues me about this one but I want you to say more about it is that you are
EDL	00:04:03,712	00:04:10,112	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Trying to tap into a huge diversity of signals hear things like signals and cell towers are TV signals that are
EDL	00:04:10,112	00:04:12,928	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Already out there kind of in the constructed environment
EDL	00:04:13,440	00:04:19,839	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But also other kinds of signals in the natural environment the one that does really sticks out for me
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,863	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is lightning
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:27,775	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Let me stop there and just asked you to tell me in the listener is a little bit about the adaptable navigation
EDL	00:04:27,775	00:04:28,543	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Systems program
EDL	00:04:29,567	00:04:34,175	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Okay ins is actually a portfolio of
EDL	00:04:34,175	00:04:35,455	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Multiple programs
EDL	00:04:36,479	00:04:38,015	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	One of those programs on Uranus
EDL	00:04:38,783	00:04:42,111	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It's called Aspen Aspen with short for all source
EDL	00:04:42,111	00:04:43,135	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Positioning in navigate
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,719	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And IT addresses the topic you you
EDL	00:04:46,719	00:04:49,791	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Reference to we like to think of it as
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:52,351	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A developing a navigation
EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,119	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Architecture
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:56,959	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	An algorithm that can process what we call sensors
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:05:01,311	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Of opportunity that is any sensor that has spatial
EDL	00:05:01,823	00:05:03,359	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Or temporal information
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:04,383	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So
EDL	00:05:04,895	00:05:06,175	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Consider an aircraft
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:08,479	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Primarily aircraft today
EDL	00:05:09,247	00:05:10,527	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Use GPS
EDL	00:05:10,527	00:05:11,551	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	End
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:14,623	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Either Standalone mode or they will
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:15,391	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Integrate
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:18,975	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A GPS receiver with what's called and inertial measurement u
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:21,279	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Basically a dead reckoning device
EDL	00:05:21,791	00:05:24,863	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Has sensors in it for work that senses accelerations
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:27,679	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And will sense rotational rates and from that you can dead reckon
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:29,215	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So the two
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:32,799	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	GPS and inertial measurement unit combined form a very robust
EDL	00:05:33,311	00:05:34,335	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Solution but
EDL	00:05:34,335	00:05:36,383	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	GPS sometimes is not available
EDL	00:05:36,895	00:05:43,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And then that system will rely primarily on the IMU
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:45,599	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Are the situation under which GPS might be
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,111	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Become unavailable
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:51,231	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Foreground users GPS can become unavailable when
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:54,303	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You are in what we call Urban Canyons that is
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,583	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Idents
EDL	00:05:55,583	00:05:59,167	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Ordinary skyscrapers you think of downtown Chicago
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:05:59,679	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Or downtown
EDL	00:06:00,191	00:06:02,239	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Manhattan where the buildings are at
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:02,751	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Obstructing the
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:07,615	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Especially in this is all in the context of maintaining very accurate now
EDL	00:06:08,895	00:06:09,407	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Aircraft
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:15,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Especially military aircraft when they roll over turn upside down now the GPS antenna is pointing to
EDL	00:06:15,295	00:06:15,807	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is ground
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:17,855	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Signals aren't coming from the ground
EDL	00:06:17,855	00:06:20,415	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Okay so we rely on the inertial measurement unit
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:22,975	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Do dead reckon until the GPS
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,743	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Leicester City versus expose
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,279	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:27,583	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Because the GPS signal is so weak
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,119	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Eye by Design
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:31,679	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That it is very easy to
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:33,215	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Interfere with
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,007	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A receivers reception of that City
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:38,847	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Okay so actually kind of sets up the problem for us and that Melanie
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:41,151	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Get you back to what you were talking about sandwiches
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,967	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To use some sensors of opportunity out there to
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:48,063	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Makeup for whatever what we recognized was that many platforms we have
EDL	00:06:48,831	00:06:50,367	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Have sensors on them
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:53,439	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Better providing spatial information
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,511	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But they're not being used by the navigation system
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:06:59,071	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So the question we asked ourselves
EDL	00:06:59,071	00:06:59,839	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Was
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:00,863	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Can we come up with
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,143	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	An algorithm
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:05,983	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And an architecture that can be rapidly reconfigure
EDL	00:07:06,751	00:07:09,311	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To use sensors that are already on board
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:11,359	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Are platforms to navigate
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:14,175	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	When GPS is not available
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:20,319	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Just as importantly to provide redundancy and hence additional Integrity to the Jeep
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:21,087	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	PS signals themselves
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:28,255	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Cocaine to work through a couple of examples of a kind of sensing signals okay so they might use your want one that we have
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,071	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Used very successfully
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:31,583	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is imagery
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:34,911	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Okay consider aircraft with a camera
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,447	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Looking at the ground
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:40,287	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The Advent of satellite imagery
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:41,055	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Think of Google Earth
EDL	00:07:41,567	00:07:44,895	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Are all all those pixels and a Google Earth image
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:48,223	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Have an Associated latitude and longitude
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:50,015	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And if we can correlate the image
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:51,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That is
EDL	00:07:51,295	00:07:54,111	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Being observed by the camera on the airplane with
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:58,463	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That satellite that what we call a Geo registered satellite image
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,255	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Frabill to determine
EDL	00:08:00,255	00:08:01,279	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Where that aircraft is
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:02,815	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That's part of the
EDL	00:08:02,815	00:08:06,655	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Problem the other part of the problem is not how do I get that into my navigation system
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,191	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Such that I can continually navigate
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:10,239	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And that's what
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:11,519	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The Aspen
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,823	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A program that's where then you you need
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:17,919	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That inertial measurement unit in a sense of timing combined with that
EDL	00:08:18,431	00:08:20,479	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Imagery on the ground and you can then start
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:21,247	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To keep track of
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,551	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That where you are now and where you going until
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:24,575	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Interesting yet
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,343	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Button
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:27,135	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Foreground users
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:30,207	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For example we are being bombarded with radio frequency signals
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:32,767	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Where we are sitting right now
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:36,863	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But we're not using them for navigation but they have special information in them whether they be
EDL	00:08:36,863	00:08:37,631	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	BTV
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:38,399	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Signals
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:41,215	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Radio signals or if we are outside we would be
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:44,031	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Receiving many signals from satellites
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:49,407	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And so we call those signals of opportunity and we've shown that you can navigate
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,199	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Very well with those signal
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:55,807	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Drilling a little bit on one of those signals of opportunity
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:56,575	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Lightning
EDL	00:08:56,575	00:08:59,903	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	How does that fit in a picture that was a very fun signal for us
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:01,951	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	When lightning strikes
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:04,511	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It essentially lights up
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,279	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The entire
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:10,143	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Electromagnetic spectrum from DC to Daylight and Beyond research
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,191	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Have shown that they're even
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:14,495	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	X-rays and potentially even gamma rays
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,007	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is coming out of a lie
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:17,311	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Tremendous amount of energy
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,383	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For a very short period of time
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:22,943	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We're talkin one to several milliseconds
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:24,991	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Of duration and time
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,039	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,063	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Huge burst of energy
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,367	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The energy that is in
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:35,487	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The spectrum that we call the very low frequency band vlf which is
EDL	00:09:35,999	00:09:38,047	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The Tenkiller region
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:39,839	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	10 to 20 kilohertz in general
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,375	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:45,215	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Portion of the energy can travel around the world
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:51,359	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	There's almost like a waveguide right now between the Earth and the ionosphere and then those signals
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That is what writer
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,687	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That is the reason that the waveguide is because
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:56,991	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	10 kilohertz
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,527	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Your wavelength
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,831	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is now kilometers
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,903	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	1012 15 km
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:05,695	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Depending on what exact
EDL	00:10:05,695	00:10:06,207	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The exact freak
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:08,767	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Because that there's only a few wavelengths
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,559	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Between the Earth and the
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:13,631	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Bottom of the ionosphere which is depending on the time of day around 80
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,679	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And you get a wave.
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:16,447	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Affect which has
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,239	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Very low signal attenuation
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,263	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Cancel the signal
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:21,567	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Can be received at very high
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,079	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Signal
EDL	00:10:22,847	00:10:24,127	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And so the question was
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,663	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Can we
EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:27,199	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Navigate with the
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:31,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So we went outside and put a vlf receiver
EDL	00:10:31,295	00:10:34,879	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	On the street or even in in the building you would be picking up
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Pens
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:41,535	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Of signals per second the the vlf portion of a lightning strike is called a sphere
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:47,935	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Short for an atmospheric that's a fairly old term that that's what we call it so you would be receiving
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:49,983	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Dozens of spherics
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:51,007	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Per second
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:53,055	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Answer questions can you navigate
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,407	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	This is amazing to think about that navigating by lightning strikes
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:11:04,063	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You have to know where those lightning strikes are in order for this to to work correct that is absolutely correct and that is
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:06,623	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	In my opinion one of the hardest
EDL	00:11:06,623	00:11:10,207	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Parts of a lightning navigation system if you will
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To detect those
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,791	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We use a
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,327	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Einetwork
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:18,399	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What we called monitoring station to reference stations
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,679	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Located around the world
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That would
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:22,495	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Geo locate those lightning
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:30,175	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Yes right and we both seen these on on weather reports where they're showing the lightning strikes from the sky minion minion
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,199	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Versys have
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,735	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Lightning detection Network
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,527	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	In place there are commercial products
EDL	00:11:35,039	00:11:36,831	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For getting that information as well yes
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:43,487	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Absolutely fascinates let's Segway to another program you're working on which was related to this one
EDL	00:11:43,487	00:11:47,327	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	This one is known mercifully in short form as stoic
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:50,399	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Sto I see but that actually short
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:52,447	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For the long form
EDL	00:11:52,447	00:11:58,591	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Name of the program which is spatial-temporal and orientation information in contested environment
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:01,151	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But let's go with store cuz it's easier to say
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:04,735	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And this too as a deliverable of a backup UPS of sorts
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:10,367	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And it involves a number of interesting sounding components that I hope we can talk about briefly
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:16,511	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Two that I mentioned are very low frequency signals which we actually did touch upon already when we were talking about lightning
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,583	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But another component here
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:25,727	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Has the development of optical clocks which rely on quantum mechanical behaviors in atoms
EDL	00:12:26,239	00:12:27,007	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To keep by super
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:31,871	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Accurate time and then the clocks are always a part of these kinds of navigation system
EDL	00:12:31,871	00:12:35,455	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We can't go deeply into the Weeds on on these things but
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:39,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Let's let's try to talk about him a little bit give us a flavor of what Stokes
EDL	00:12:39,295	00:12:42,111	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It's about and what technology we're hoping to develop to make it work
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:44,159	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Okay let's talk about the the vlf component
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,719	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It's interesting to note
EDL	00:12:47,231	00:12:48,255	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That the
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:51,839	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	First global positioning system was not called
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:52,607	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	GPS
EDL	00:12:53,631	00:12:54,655	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It was called Omega
EDL	00:12:55,679	00:12:58,495	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It operated back in the from the early 70s
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:00,287	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Through the early 90s
EDL	00:13:00,799	00:13:03,103	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And it was a vlf
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,639	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Broadcast system
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,943	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And provided Global coverage
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:08,223	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	With only eight
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:09,503	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Transmitters
EDL	00:13:09,503	00:13:10,271	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Located around the world
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:13,087	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	However it was not accurate
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:16,927	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That system generally provided one
EDL	00:13:16,927	00:13:17,951	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To wish
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:20,767	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Kilometer levels of positioning accuracy
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,839	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Whereas GPS is generally below five
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:28,703	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So the older Mega System is clearly not accurate for what we now
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:29,983	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Depend on today
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,311	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I from GPS so the primary challenge we have
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:35,103	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	In-store
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,639	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For the vlf component
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,151	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,967	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Developing new models
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,503	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Back can
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:43,039	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Accurately replicate
EDL	00:13:43,039	00:13:44,575	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	How that vlf signal
EDL	00:13:44,575	00:13:45,343	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Propagates
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:47,903	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	From a transmitter
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:49,183	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To a receiver
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,999	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I such that we can get our accuracies
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:53,791	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To GPS level
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:58,911	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	In NY the vlf2 very low very good component of the full
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:02,239	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Spectrum about it many many choices of frequency bands to use
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,031	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So you mentioned the waveguide effect
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:06,335	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I'm in and we talked about the fact that
EDL	00:14:07,359	00:14:08,127	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Waveguide effect
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:12,991	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Has significantly less signal attenuation such that the signal can be received
EDL	00:14:13,503	00:14:15,039	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	At longer distances
EDL	00:14:15,551	00:14:17,855	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So in the context of providing a
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:20,415	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Backup system to GPS
EDL	00:14:20,927	00:14:22,719	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Oh that has Global range
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:27,071	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Clearly we don't want to put a position Beacon if you will
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:29,119	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Every few miles around the Earth
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:35,263	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So the ability to provide a positioning system with only a few let's say less than
EDL	00:14:35,263	00:14:36,031	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	10
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:37,823	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The electrons meters
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:38,847	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is very appealing
EDL	00:14:39,359	00:14:42,687	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Especially when the signals can be received at very high levels
EDL	00:14:42,687	00:14:49,087	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Right in this there's probably pragmatic and cost issues I believe vlf transmitter is rough and very big
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:49,855	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So they are
EDL	00:14:50,367	00:14:53,951	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Not only are they very big but they're also very old it's in general
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,743	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	They're using
EDL	00:14:56,255	00:14:59,583	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	1950s 1960s technology
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,863	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And so using
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:05,215	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	New technology we're looking at ways of making them much smaller
EDL	00:15:05,215	00:15:06,239	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	More affordable
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:08,543	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And more portable okay and then
EDL	00:15:08,543	00:15:10,591	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Let's talk about the

EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,887	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So there is a common phrase used
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:35,679	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	On the navigation community
EDL	00:15:36,191	00:15:38,751	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Which is thymus position and position is time

EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:40,703	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The same is also true so the key
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:42,239	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The GPS
EDL	00:16:42,239	00:16:44,031	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is indeed the clocks
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,103	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You're getting a ranging signal off at the GPS satellite
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:48,639	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Can you receiver determines rain
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:52,223	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You don't measure distance what you are actually measuring is time
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:56,319	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	How long did it take that signal to travel
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:57,599	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	From the satellite
EDL	00:16:57,599	00:16:59,903	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To your receiver so the satellite tells you
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:03,487	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	This signal left my antenna at
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,511	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Time Warner
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,791	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You look at your receiver clock
EDL	00:17:06,303	00:17:08,095	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	When that signal was received
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:08,607	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	At time
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:12,447	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And time 2 minus time 1 is

EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:22,175	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Netflix that's where the rain comes runs but it all goes back to the
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:26,015	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Read speed of light which we know and is constant that sort of
EDL	00:17:26,015	00:17:26,783	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The key here right
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:27,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	O'Brien
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Without that
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:31,135	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You wouldn't be able to just from a measurement of time
EDL	00:17:31,135	00:17:31,903	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Know what the range
EDL	00:17:32,927	00:17:39,327	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That it that is cracking there are a lot of other things your GPS receiver has to do as well but that's primarily like
EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:44,959	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	It is remarkably complex on sort of every level by any metric you can you can imagine applying to it
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:51,871	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So let's move now to 1/3 program this will be the last one I think we talked about this one is known as Poseidon
EDL	00:17:51,871	00:17:55,455	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And that stands for positioning system for deep
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:55,967	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Ocean
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:18:00,831	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Navigation so it sounds like you're going for an underwater GPS system
EDL	00:18:01,343	00:18:01,855	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Yes
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:05,695	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Bottom Line GPS does not work underwater
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:08,767	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Actually you can receive it at very
EDL	00:18:08,767	00:18:10,815	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Shallow depths inches
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,863	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I'm people have shown that
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:14,911	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But that's not relevant to
EDL	00:18:15,423	00:18:17,215	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Where we actually operate we went to
EDL	00:18:17,727	00:18:19,007	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We want to be able to navigate
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,543	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	At much deeper level
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:25,919	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Poseidon is about bringing a GPS like positioning capability
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:27,455	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	2
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,223	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Submerged user
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:32,319	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So when I think about the submerged users
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:33,087	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I don't think about
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:39,231	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Radio operation there though I know that there's some other real interesting working trying to bring
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:42,303	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Radio with with vlf and ultra-low frequency
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:47,935	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So down into into underwater operations but I left I think immediately of acoustic types of signal
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:50,751	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So I presume that that's part of why you were correct
EDL	00:18:50,751	00:18:57,151	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The climate research Community has been using low-frequency acoustic signals for several decades
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:57,919	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Now
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:18:59,711	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	How to monitor the temperature
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:00,991	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Of the ocean
EDL	00:19:01,503	00:19:02,015	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	As a function
EDL	00:19:03,551	00:19:04,831	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And
EDL	00:19:04,831	00:19:07,903	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	By using low frequency signals if you know again
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,951	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The analogy of just gave earlier
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:11,231	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Time is Key here
EDL	00:19:11,999	00:19:14,303	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	If you know when the signal left a
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:14,815	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Transmitter
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,351	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Compare that
EDL	00:19:16,351	00:19:16,863	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	2
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:20,703	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The time you received it at another location you can get the time of
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Flight of that signal
EDL	00:19:22,751	00:19:24,287	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Now for underwater
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:25,311	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So you mentioned
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:28,383	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For GPS the speed of light is is is constant
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,943	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That's not quite the case
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,991	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For underwater the speed of sound
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:36,063	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Underwater is a function of many things
EDL	00:19:36,831	00:19:37,855	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Primarily temperature
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:39,647	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But also I doubt
EDL	00:19:40,671	00:19:43,231	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And salinity and some other terms as well
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:44,511	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So
EDL	00:19:45,023	00:19:46,559	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We have developed models
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,607	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Account fraud
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:51,167	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	In addition to that the
EDL	00:19:51,167	00:19:53,215	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Acoustic signals underwater
EDL	00:19:53,215	00:19:57,567	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I don't travel in a single line between the transmitter and receiver
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:19:59,103	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Which radio frequencies
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:01,151	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Typical acoustic signals will take
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:01,919	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Many paths
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,967	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	On the way from the source
EDL	00:20:04,479	00:20:05,759	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To a receiver
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:07,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Because the signal was getting re
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:07,807	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Refracted
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:11,647	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Due to temperature profiles in the ocean
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,927	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Pressure profiles
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:16,767	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Things like that's when you hear a signal low-frequency signal at a receiver
EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:20,095	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That was admitted far away you actually hear
EDL	00:20:20,095	00:20:21,119	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Multiple instances
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:22,655	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Like an echo
EDL	00:20:23,167	00:20:24,959	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I'm in the car for a week all that multi
EDL	00:20:25,727	00:20:28,799	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	There are multiple paths that a signal will take
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:30,591	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So it sounds like
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,383	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Eyewitness multipath
EDL	00:20:32,383	00:20:34,431	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Phenomenon going on that one of the big
EDL	00:20:34,431	00:20:36,223	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Issues here is going to be sort of
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:39,295	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	How do you deconvolve all of those
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:45,695	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Signals coming in and so that sounds like algorithms it sounds like computational issues
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:47,999	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So I just to make sense of what otherwise would be just a morass of
EDL	00:20:49,279	00:20:50,047	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You are correct
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:53,375	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And that is exactly what we are focused on in the program
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,167	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Initially
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:55,935	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What is
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:56,447	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Can we
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,727	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Improve
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:02,591	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Current models develop new models that can accurately count
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:06,431	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For all of those paths that a signal take such that we can extract
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:10,783	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	An accurate time of flight and hence an accurate distance
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,319	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Once we get the distance
EDL	00:21:12,319	00:21:14,623	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I from that signal the navigation part
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,903	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is is fairly
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,440	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The hard part
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,976	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is the signal
EDL	00:21:18,976	00:21:19,488	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Measurement model
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:24,352	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Justice GPS depends upon constellations of
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:26,912	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Satellites and forgetting the exact number now but
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:27,680	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What is a couple of days
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,216	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Do you know the exact number
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:35,616	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What's around 3130 would Poseidon in an undersea GPS system also rely
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:40,992	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Ayana constellation of acoustic beacons so distributed through the oceans yes but hopefully not 30

EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:48,928	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Also the ocean is there a phenomenon like the one we talked about for very low frequency radio signals
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,696	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Minnesota
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:54,816	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Skirting the Earth through the Earth in the ionosphere and that sort of long-wave guard guide effect
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:22:00,960	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Acoustic sound can travel tremendous distances in the ocean right there where I'm thinking here of how
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:02,240	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Whales communicate over greatest
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,800	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That is correct and within that is the exact
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:06,336	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The fact that we were exploding
EDL	00:22:06,336	00:22:08,640	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	There is what's called a sound channel
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:10,944	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The death of a sound channel
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:12,224	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is in general a function of
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,760	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Of temperature
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:17,344	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	But in general in deep oceans it's about a kilometer
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:18,112	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Deep
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:18,880	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And so
EDL	00:22:18,880	00:22:20,160	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Low frequency
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:20,672	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Acoustics
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:24,768	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Will travel for very long distances that there was a Seminole
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:27,840	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Study in the 90s that showed
EDL	00:22:27,840	00:22:29,376	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Low frequency signals
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:31,680	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Could be received in the sound channel
EDL	00:22:32,192	00:22:36,288	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Many thousands of kilometres I believe it was almost 9000 km
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:37,312	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Persuade Absol
EDL	00:22:37,312	00:22:38,080	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Who is down.
EDL	00:22:38,080	00:22:43,968	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And it also just brings another question to mine I don't know much about how these beacons work and what their characteristics are
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:49,088	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Are there issues of concern for animals living in the ocean
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:51,648	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Who are these signals on will be
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:53,184	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Propagating absolutely
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:55,488	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A key tenet of the program is
EDL	00:22:55,488	00:22:56,768	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We have to develop a system
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:59,584	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That complies with all the Federal
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,608	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Regulation
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:01,376	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Protecting
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,400	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A marine mammal
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:06,240	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	When I take it one of the things that drives you
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:09,568	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is the concern that we have become utterly dependent
EDL	00:23:09,568	00:23:12,640	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	On GPS just the way we were utterly dependent upon the electric
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:13,408	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Grid
EDL	00:23:13,408	00:23:17,760	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We all know when the electrical grid goes down that we become frantic even 5 minutes
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,808	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Power out we are going nuts
EDL	00:23:20,320	00:23:21,344	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	ISO
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:24,672	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	GPS has a similar vulnerabilities tell me about
EDL	00:23:24,672	00:23:29,024	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That aspect of how you think about technology and security
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:32,864	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Yeah so there was a phrase that some people use you have
EDL	00:23:33,376	00:23:34,144	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Fail-Safe
EDL	00:23:34,656	00:23:35,936	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And fail operational
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:36,704	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Cayo
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:38,752	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Your primary system fails
EDL	00:23:38,752	00:23:40,544	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And he's the fail to a
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:46,176	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Safe mode use or fail first two you're still operational and then if it fails again you're still safe
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:52,832	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Okay so you have that built-in redundancy same into the power grid when the power goes out the building the diesel generators come on
EDL	00:23:52,832	00:23:53,856	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	If you need
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:55,392	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Continuous levels of power in that building
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,440	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The same thing as is happening
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,488	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	In the in the navigation
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,536	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Considera autonomous
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:02,304	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Vehicles
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:04,096	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Witcher on the horizon
EDL	00:24:04,608	00:24:05,376	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Clearly they can't
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:07,936	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Solely depend on GPS
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:10,496	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To tell the car where it is located
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,008	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Because of
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:14,080	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Some of the things we talked about earlier such as
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,128	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The urban Canyon they can't pick up the
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,640	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	GPS signal
EDL	00:24:17,152	00:24:18,176	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So you're already sing
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,272	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Driverless cars being more dependent on other sensors for
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,552	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Fighting positioning a
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,320	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Information weather
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,856	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Lidar laser radar
EDL	00:24:26,624	00:24:27,904	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Or or imagery
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:28,672	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	For example
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,440	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Or even the
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:30,208	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The Doppler sensor
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,512	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	High on The View
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:36,096	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So you're already seeing redundancy starting to be built into
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,376	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Systems that are going to be
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:38,912	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Depended on navigation
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:45,056	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So when we think of the three programs that we just talked about the ANS stoic and Poseidon
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:49,664	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And I should point out that you just handed off stewardship this program to a colleague in the Strategic
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:50,176	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Technology
EDL	00:24:50,944	00:24:54,528	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Can you give us a sense in each case of what the status of the v20
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:57,856	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So ans is wrapping up
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:58,880	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Anuses
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:24:59,904	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is is transitioning
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:03,744	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	To the end users to the services in various ways
EDL	00:25:03,744	00:25:04,512	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And that's a good thing
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:05,792	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Stoic
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:07,584	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:09,120	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Almost halfway
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:10,144	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Through a
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,680	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	3-phase program so weird
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We are in Phase 2
EDL	00:25:13,728	00:25:16,288	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Are the Start program so we've demonstrated
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:17,312	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Feasibility
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,104	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Came up with an initial approach
EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:21,920	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Generated evidence to support
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:22,688	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Support
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:23,456	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That approach
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:25,504	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And in face to wear now
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:26,784	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Implementing that approach
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,296	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And and
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:28,576	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Doing higher fidelity
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:29,600	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Data collection
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,416	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Besides just getting started we are
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:36,000	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	In the middle of what we call Phase 1 of Poseidon
EDL	00:25:37,024	00:25:39,072	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Just one more question before you lend
EDL	00:25:39,072	00:25:40,608	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I'm and that's
EDL	00:25:40,608	00:25:42,656	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What question do you really wish
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,192	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:45,984	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	What about you that I didn't
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,752	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And if
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,056	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Such a question comes to mind you can ask
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,824	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Skip now and answer
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,384	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So you mentioned Optical clock
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:57,504	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Thanks for reminding me I should have pushed you didn't answer that question earlier
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,296	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So an optical clock
EDL	00:25:59,808	00:26:02,880	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is it's an atomic clock and we have atomic clocks today
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:05,952	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Such as a rubidium clock
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:06,976	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Or a cesium
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:10,816	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Does if there were cesium beam has been around since
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:11,840	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The 50s
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:15,680	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Just a winter mean for a second
EDL	00:26:15,680	00:26:20,800	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Simple way of thinking about these things and then why atoms can be clocks is because there are
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:27,200	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Vibrations oscillations associated with the nuclei but rather than the the kinds of isolation
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:33,600	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Did you think about it and I are kind of old-fashioned clock with a pendulum I mean something to some ways that's what's going on but it's going on at billions
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:37,440	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And trillions of oscillations in what we consider duration of reckon
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:42,048	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So in the atomic clocks of today we are exploiting signals
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:44,096	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Emitted by atoms
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,888	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Hot in the microwave reach
EDL	00:26:46,912	00:26:48,192	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Gigahertz
EDL	00:26:48,192	00:26:48,704	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Level six
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:52,032	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Gigahertz is
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,568	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Billion x
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:54,848	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Per second
EDL	00:26:54,848	00:26:55,872	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	An optical clock
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,664	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Is exploiting
EDL	00:26:58,176	00:27:00,224	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Atomic energy level transitions
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:02,528	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That have frequencies
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:03,808	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Over 400
EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,344	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Terahertz
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:05,856	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Another
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:07,904	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Five orders of magnitude
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:11,744	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	So that that clock is Optical clock ticks five orders a magnet
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,256	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Faster
EDL	00:27:12,768	00:27:13,280	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Then
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,072	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Atomic clocks
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,352	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Today
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:19,680	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And by virtue that that's more precise time and
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,448	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	We get
EDL	00:27:20,448	00:27:21,728	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Much improved stability
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:22,752	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Out of that
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:25,568	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Optical clocks today in general
EDL	00:27:26,592	00:27:30,944	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Are about the size of a small laboratory universities have these Optical clocks
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,480	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Nest
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:37,088	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	The National Institute of Standards and technology has the world's most stable
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,368	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Optical clock
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:41,440	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	DARPA in the past had a program
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:45,280	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	That showed by making some trades and size weight and Power
EDL	00:27:45,280	00:27:48,096	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And performance you could reduce the size of that off
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,888	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Clock down to the size of
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:51,424	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	A shoebox
EDL	00:27:51,424	00:27:53,216	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	From a laboratory size download shoebox
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:55,776	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Yes but that clock is still ticking
EDL	00:27:55,776	00:27:56,800	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	At Optical frequency
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,104	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Another DARPA program
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,128	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	I showed how
EDL	00:28:00,896	00:28:01,920	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	You could
EDL	00:28:01,920	00:28:03,712	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Make a very small
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And robust
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:08,576	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Device called a frequency comb that acts like a set of gears
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,904	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	And transfers that very stable
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:14,464	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Optical tick in the 400 terahertz
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:15,744	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Region
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:16,768	| Episode 07 The Geolocator |	Down to RF
