EDL	00:00:11,780	00:00:31,130	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Stealth technology, the internet, GPS in the palm of your hand on the most operation technology, is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, doubt the defence advanced research projects agency has been a driver of technology. 
EDL	00:00:31,510	00:00:36,840	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA a window onto DARPA's core of program managers. 
EDL	00:00:37,120	00:00:39,652	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Their job, to redefine what is possible. 

EDL	00:00:39,652	00:00:43,431	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	My name is Ivan Amato , and I'm  your DARPA host. 
EDL	00:00:43,431	00:00:47,522	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Today, I am pleased to be talking with Dr. Sergey Bratus.
EDL	00:00:47,522	00:00:50,711	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Sergey joined DARPA as a program manager in the agencies' 
EDL	00:00:50,711	00:00:55,209	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Information Innovation Office in 2018, he brings into the agency, 
EDL	00:00:55,209	00:01:01,212	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	what you might think of as a six cents for the suring of a deeply hidden security vulnerabilities 
EDL	00:01:01,212	00:01:08,961	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	in the oceans of software and the communications practices underlying our civilian and military technologies and systems. 

EDL	00:01:08,961	00:01:10,183	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Prior to coming to DARPA,
EDL	00:01:10,183	00:01:16,593	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Sergey had been at Dartmouth College, beginning in 2002 as a post doctoral research associate, and most
EDL	00:01:16,593	00:01:21,745	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	recently as research associate professor in the computer science department, 
EDL	00:01:21,745	00:01:27,676	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	he began his professional career at BBNtechnologies where he worked on natural language processing. 
EDL	00:01:27,676	00:01:33,328	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I find that professional element fascinating because the BBN-DARPA connections spanned 
EDL	00:01:33,328	00:01:39,461	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	back to 1960s when the two work together on some of the foundations of Internet. Back to Sergey,
EDL	00:01:39,461	00:01:46,849	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	he received his undergraduate education at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and earn his PhD
EDL	00:01:46,849	00:01:49,220	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	in mathematics from Northeastern University.
EDL	00:01:49,220	00:01:55,211	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	He has published over one hundred technical papers, and his research has received several awards, including 
EDL	00:01:55,211	00:01:59,980	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	the 2012 Black Hat Pony Award for most innovative research. 
EDL	00:02:00,000	00:02:03,060	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	That award, pony award is a prestigious (有声望的) one 
EDL	00:02:03,060	00:02:07,140	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	that recognizes achievements of security researchers and security community. 
EDL	00:02:07,730	00:02:19,450	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Doctor Sergey Bratus, thanks for making some time to talk with me today about your many and very efforts to increase every safety in the paralysis, cyber domains that we are immersed in. 

EDL	00:02:19,450	00:02:20,470	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Thank you for being here.
EDL	00:02:20,720	00:02:22,080	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Thank you for having me here, Ivan. 

* Orignal Story

EDL	00:02:22,270	00:02:28,720	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Let's start with the origin story of your interests in computer science and cyber security. 
EDL	00:02:29,160	00:02:38,700	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I think one of the things that fascinate the public about scientists and engineers is just where there are sort of in some ways, hybrid specialized interests come from. 
EDL	00:02:38,700	00:02:41,330	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	[Q] So did you grow up in a geeky household ? 
EDL	00:02:41,620	00:02:47,560	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	[Q] Did you encounter an engaging professor at the Moscow Instruments of Physics and Technology ? 
EDL	00:02:47,670	00:02:48,770	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	[Q] Where did you interest come from? 
EDL	00:02:49,220	00:02:50,890	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Oh, computers were a miracle. 

** Soviet Union

EDL	00:02:51,370	00:03:03,590	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I grow up on the Soviet Union, and we would get a slow trick of imported technology, which is so wonderfully contrasted with the rest of life. 
EDL	00:03:03,830	00:03:07,280	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	They were something from the future. 
EDL	00:03:08,100	00:03:12,612	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so even though the technology that was available 
EDL	00:03:12,612	00:03:18,316	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	to a school student was perhaps decade behind, 
EDL	00:03:18,316	00:03:20,565	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	it was never less a miracle, 
EDL	00:03:20,565	00:03:29,100	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	and it had an enormous attraction over the executives myself, we wanted to know how it worked, 
EDL	00:03:29,100	00:03:35,770	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	and we wanted to be able to program something like those games that we saw on those computer screens. 
EDL	00:03:36,930	00:03:41,815	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so we did, but as I was growing up in the Soviet Union, you could
EDL	00:03:41,815	00:03:54,030	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	see the slow progression of technology being important from the rest, and we were left behind by some people listening ten to fifteen years. 
EDL	00:03:54,650	00:04:16,020	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	There was a bit of luck in that, because in my age, I go to see the very basics of computing, starting with programming micro calculators, where my appears in the west might have seen, might have been already seen IBM PC XT, which was an incredible miracle of technology. 

IBM PC XT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT
BM个人计算机XT是1983年3月8日发行的IBM个人计算机系列中的第二台计算机。
除了增加了内置硬盘驱动器和额外的扩展插槽之外，它与1981年的原始IBM PC型号5150非常相似。


*** 补充问了一下年代

EDL	00:04:16,770	00:04:20,070	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And Sergey, just so that the listeners have a sense of timing here. 
EDL	00:04:20,270	00:04:25,360	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You say that you, you really encountered computers for the first time when you're in middle school. 
EDL	00:04:25,360	00:04:26,882	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So what years were those actually?
EDL	00:04:26,882	00:04:31,850	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	we're talking 197x, late 1970s, early 1980s
EDL	00:04:32,350	00:04:33,020	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Okay, thank you. 

EDL	00:04:33,020	00:04:34,660	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So I took you off track, I'll right on that
EDL	00:04:34,910	00:04:51,779	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So making computers do things was a huge time sink, because we're people in california might have had access to storage devices and floppies. 
EDL	00:04:51,779	00:04:57,482	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	we actually had to retype our Texas Instruments
EDL	00:04:57,482	00:05:00,518	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	kind of a clone [...] programs.
EDL	00:05:00,518	00:05:07,005	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Still, it was an incredibly magical experience, but that was my introduction to computers. 

** Introduction to security

EDL	00:05:07,005	00:05:18,120	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	My introduction to security came when I was a grad student at Northeastern working on my degree, mathematics and Linux was exploding on the scene. 
EDL	00:05:18,120	00:05:20,000	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Everyone wanted to run a Linux server. 
EDL	00:05:21,060	00:05:24,420	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	The internet was still the wonderful place where you met. 
EDL	00:05:24,420	00:05:27,510	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Like minded geeks [..] wasn't anything else. 
EDL	00:05:27,920	00:05:30,849	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so I set up my Linux server. 
EDL	00:05:30,849	00:05:38,170	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I followed every bit of, the how-to instructions, and it worked, and I was happy. 
EDL	00:05:38,460	00:05:45,590	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And then in about two weeks, that server was compromised and taken over, and I found it serving ...
EDL	00:05:45,810	00:05:47,600	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I don't know ..
EDL	00:05:47,600	00:05:56,230	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Music that I could not quite understand or pieces of a game are probably pirated, that I knew nothing about. 
EDL	00:05:56,430	00:06:11,676	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It got, as the saying was at the time, a pond compromise taken over as it happened with many university computers in the 1990s, and I wanted to know how. I did everything by the book. 
EDL	00:06:11,676	00:06:13,876	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I thought I could understand
EDL	00:06:13,876	00:06:17,520	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	the way programs were written by that time I was already competent(有能力的)
EDL	00:06:17,550	00:06:24,200	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	C programmer, I thought, and I thought I understood that environment and those programs. 
EDL	00:06:24,330	00:06:27,680	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Turned out I did not, and the hackers did. [Host] right. 
EDL	00:06:27,680	00:06:38,020	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So you had a very personal experience with personal violation showing up a right at your own computer station that really got you hooked and concerned about these security issues. 

EDL	00:06:38,280	00:06:41,580	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I probably owe who ever did that a beer. 

EDL	00:06:42,480	00:06:49,780	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Right, so now you wanna go find out who that person is and shake their hand, because they essentially were central in the rest of the trajactory of your career. 

EDL	00:06:49,910	00:06:58,120	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I might say that, and so I went down the rabbit hole of a hacking and computer security, rather than being a mathematician

* Moscow -> US

EDL	00:06:58,370	00:07:07,051	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	One of the quick question just cause i'm serious in the timing of in your educational, professional development and world history. 
EDL	00:07:07,051	00:07:12,336	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You got to undergraduate degree in Moscow, and then you got your graduate degree in Northeastern
EDL	00:07:12,336	00:07:18,620	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So can you tell me, how is it that you made the transition from the then Soviet Union to United States? 

EDL	00:07:19,370	00:07:24,360	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I saw the late Soviet Union. 
EDL	00:07:24,360	00:07:41,260	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I grew up with the totalitarian(极权) society that it was, and I wanted out at the time, it was nearly impossible to do in any legal fashion. 
EDL	00:07:41,720	00:07:45,460	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But luckily, the soviet power was collapsing. 
EDL	00:07:45,620	00:08:01,600	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It collapsed between 1991 and 1993, and so I could, in fact, go out and study abroad, if an American university would take me and several offered. 
EDL	00:08:01,850	00:08:13,050	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so I left. Quite a few people were more enthusiastic about the prospects of poor Soviet Russian and poor Soviet States, unfortunately, they were proven wrong. 

*** Their losses are our gain

EDL	00:08:13,830	00:08:16,150	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	All right, well, their losses are our gain. 

EDL	00:08:16,150	00:08:21,690	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So happy that you did actually make it out and clearly embrace the opportunities that were here. 
EDL	00:08:21,970	00:08:48,154	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Sergey, after getting your degrees where you worked first BBN, then you segwey into academy at Dartmouth where you build the computer science and security program that included the what you have described as a called quote-unquote "hidden curriculum(课程)", this one derived from the mindset and innovations of the hacker community, which is sounds fascinating to bring that into account of a computer science program and necessary. 
EDL	00:08:48,154	00:08:49,510	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I think the right thing to do surely. 
EDL	00:08:49,510	00:08:59,650	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So please talk about how these professional experiences contributes to your approach now to cyber security, and how they lead to your job at DARPA

EDL	00:09:00,030	00:09:11,630	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	starting in the 2018. I am very grateful to Dartmouth for letting me do this for taking me on as a research of shoot on one of their cybersecurity efforts. 

EDL	00:09:12,340	00:09:19,110	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I started with a machine learning application of a cyber security. 
EDL	00:09:19,600	00:09:35,496	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But by that time, I was already interested in how an exploitation worked, how exploits were written, how vulnerabilities were discovered and being a mathematician by education
EDL	00:09:35,496	00:09:38,034	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I wanted to systematize this. 

*** Hacker Conventions: Hacker 课程

EDL	00:09:38,034	00:09:51,030	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So I started showing up at the hacker conventions, such as the DefCon, and what I realized very soon was that there was a curriculum(课程) there, which the community came up with. 
EDL	00:09:51,600	00:09:58,180	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It was distributed and split up between various minds and groups. 
EDL	00:09:58,180	00:10:12,820	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But there were, a consistent sets of things that newcomers learned, and even though they had some interaction with how we took computer science and computer programming in academia(学术界), they were not quite the same. 
EDL	00:10:12,870	00:10:28,350	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And in many aspects, ah, they actually, went deeper on how things worked, and so I started systematizing this discipline(学科), which I maintained it has become as of at least late 1990s. 
EDL	00:10:28,440	00:10:46,750	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And I tried to extract that hidden curriculum, and I had support from my supervisors of Dartmouth doing that, and I have support to bring in students to the computer hacking conferences and then exposing them to this hidden curriculum. 
EDL	00:10:46,750	00:10:56,910	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And it turned out that it translated to impressive undergraded and then graduate dissertations(学位论文), all in all, I find that this work is not done.

EDL	00:10:57,230	00:10:57,622	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Ivan Amato: Right
EDL	00:10:57,622	00:11:05,350	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Well, it of course is not done because of there's innovation going on, both in those were seeking new and more powerful exploits, 
EDL	00:11:05,350	00:11:15,860	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	and those who are worried about that and trying to to come up with countermeasures(反制措施) and defenses against that and everybody in there has to be brilliant, so it's kind of an amazing dynamic going on. 

EDL	00:11:15,860	00:11:41,465	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So now, before we talk about your programs, and I think it's scared of algebra's out of listeners who might not know about some of the hazards and wait and sort of, all the software we use, and perhaps how they are even contributing to some of the hazards, and in practices that they engage in the, info sphere, I really want to talk about the way you think about an engaged cyber space in the info sphere. 
EDL	00:11:41,465	00:11:50,080	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We sort of began to get into that a little bit, but you know, as I've looked over your programs and really try to understand where you are coming from, and which you are trying to achieve. 

*** Metaphor

EDL	00:11:50,290	00:11:59,930	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	As I looked over your Dartmouth College page, your lab page, a sort of metaphor(隐喻) came to my mind about you, which is, and maybe one way of thinking about it is
EDL	00:12:00,000	00:12:07,960	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	All of us.  Most of us are drivers, and when we were out there driving, we're paying attention to the various hazards of the road, you know, very traditional things. 
EDL	00:12:07,960	00:12:10,096	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	What's happening with the street lights ? 
EDL	00:12:10,096	00:12:14,665	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Are we going to be able to make it through that yellow, are their children on the side of the road ? 
EDL	00:12:14,665	00:12:18,756	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You know, what's the weather is.  It looks like there's about to be a downpour(倾盆大雨), right?

EDL	00:12:18,756	00:12:23,699	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	All of us sort of have a sense of these hazards are their part holes coming in the condition of the road. 
EDL	00:12:23,699	00:12:34,100	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	you know, I imagine that you are looking at the info sphere, kind of driving through that world with that same kind of heads up view on these kind of obvious hazards. 

* Hidden Hazards

EDL	00:12:34,250	00:12:44,000	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But more than that, I kind of imagine you having almost the sixth sense in being able to see even what might be hidden hazards
EDL	00:12:44,000	00:12:55,740	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	you know, let's say, there's a sink hole, and it's just now, as I'm coming upon it about to open up with my cars gonna to go in there, something that you could not see from the surface, but somehow you can see through the road. 

*** six sense

EDL	00:12:55,740	00:13:05,700	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And you see that sink hole about to start, I get the feeling you have that sixth sense in the information technology and the cyber sphere to see what we really need to worry about. 
EDL	00:13:05,990	00:13:09,620	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Okay, that's me terribly describing your mind. 

EDL	00:13:09,770	00:13:11,480	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You know your mind better than me. 
EDL	00:13:11,700	00:13:20,635	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So, talk to me about that cognitive framework that you bring in to this cyber rich world that we live in.

* Response

EDL	00:13:20,635	00:13:24,420	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	On the ex three vision of vulnerability is a lot to claim. 
EDL	00:13:24,770	00:13:41,130	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I certainly do not claim that what I could claim is a lot of trepidation(不安) and reluctant(不情愿) using some technologies that I know are not as dependable or as simple as they could be. 

*** without personal smart phones

EDL	00:13:41,360	00:13:44,150	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I am the person with no personal smart phone. 

*** Javascript

EDL	00:13:44,610	00:14:02,410	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I am the person who, before engaging with the website tries to see what the website looks like with all the executable bits, a javascript, disabled, and mostly it looks like nothing, which is too bad. 

EDL	00:14:02,560	00:14:23,360	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Because for most of those websites, and for most of those tasks that I want to complete on them, they have no business executing code on my computer and then pulling code from their associates, maybe commercial advertising or analysis associates, and then executing their code on my computer. 
EDL	00:14:23,780	00:14:26,190	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And then the code from their associates as well. 

EDL	00:14:26,510	00:14:31,196	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So you consider these all to be almost like nested vulnerabilities. 

EDL	00:14:31,196	00:14:31,900	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	They are indeed.

* PDF different

EDL	00:14:31,990	00:14:38,680	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	One of the best examples of this is probably the thing that everyone uses every day, the web based email. 
EDL	00:14:38,990	00:15:11,340	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But when I look at the web browser, I see a machine for denying the user the understanding of where those are graphic elements in the email were in the overall pain of the browser up come from or where they eat if you click on them, it is the browser's goal to seamlessly blamed all of the content and hide the possible directions. 

EDL	00:15:11,550	00:15:19,620	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But at the same time, it doesn't let me see what my next action would actually bring about. 
EDL	00:15:20,190	00:15:28,030	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Now for me, I can second guess this for a typical user of such a webmail. 
EDL	00:15:28,580	00:15:30,340	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This is the tool order. 

EDL	00:15:30,820	00:15:39,520	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Imagine we make our trust decisions and based on the province of what we hear and see them directly. 
EDL	00:15:40,030	00:15:46,580	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And here we were denied any visual cues or any cues at all to that province. 

EDL	00:15:46,920	00:16:15,830	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Speaking of a protocol, this is a very slow process, but some people could see that bottle hole ten years ago, it was actually hit. One of my programs documents deals with another search photo are peaceful of electronic documents that we all exchange, and we are to not click on if we can't really verify where it came from. 
EDL	00:16:15,830	00:16:24,940	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But then, of course, see the previous point about webmail most of the time you are denied any cues as to where it actually came from. 
EDL	00:16:25,460	00:16:49,760	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But of course, it is our job to click on those documents, read them, send them onwards(向前), any ambiguity in the description of these formats is insecurity, and that insecurity will hit us ten years or or five years from now, from all from when it was introduced, people might say, well, it is okay. 
EDL	00:16:49,760	00:16:51,630	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We have anti-virus programs. 
EDL	00:16:52,510	00:16:58,550	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We can check, and we have firewalls, and we have other devices that could just check for mals. 
EDL	00:16:59,100	00:17:12,504	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	However, it's typical because of the format, ambiguities for all the readers and interpreters of electronic documents to disagree about what those documents actually contain.
EDL	00:17:12,504	00:17:22,040	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It's been a hacker's sport to make a file like a PDF document appear differently in different viewers. 

EDL	00:17:22,670	00:17:28,270	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It will similarly use a little different to the anti-virus or an application firewall. 
EDL	00:17:28,450	00:17:39,830	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so if you can't really agree with all your electronic helpers and applications want what is actually in the document, what better way to hide malaysia ? 
EDL	00:17:40,170	00:17:51,140	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And again, this is something that fundamental computer science can tell you that will result at in those. 
EDL	00:17:51,180	00:17:57,783	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But as we call the parsing differentials of those data formats and those documents.

* NEW TOPIC: AMP

EDL	00:17:57,783	00:18:03,519	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I'm glad that you have began to talk about your programs you started with safe documents. 
EDL	00:18:03,519	00:18:10,350	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Actually that's one of the easier ones of yours to say one of the other easier ones is assured micro patching or AMP. 

EDL	00:18:10,350	00:18:20,350	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I'm actually just gonna read all of the DARPA names because they are so DARPA. And DAPRA is known for its names and acronyms just for listeners to hear them.

EDL	00:18:20,390	00:18:25,780	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And then we're not gonna acceptably really go through each one, because we would be here for quite a long time. 
EDL	00:18:25,780	00:18:29,190	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I would love to, but we can't have a five-hour podcast. 
EDL	00:18:29,190	00:18:33,400	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We lose everybody, but let me just read them because they are beautifully multisyllabic(多音节的). 
EDL	00:18:33,780	00:18:35,610	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And they gave some sense of what you are up to. 

EDL	00:18:35,610	00:18:44,300	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So here we go, Artificial Intelligence Mitigations of Emergent Execution, or AIMEE. 

AIMEE: https://www.darpa.mil/program/artificial-intelligence-mitigations-of-emergent-execution

EDL	00:18:44,300	00:18:50,428	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	verified security and performance enhancement of large legacy software or V-SPELLS 
EDL	00:18:50,428	00:18:54,863	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	recovery of symbolic mathematics from code or ReMath 
EDL	00:18:54,863	00:18:59,131	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	hybrid AI to protect integrity of open source code. 

EDL	00:18:59,131	00:19:06,709	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And we've already mentioned SafeDocs and Assured Micro Patching(AMP), and there is even one more,  I think this is the newest one that got approval is 

https://www.darpa.mil/program/safe-documents

EDL	00:19:06,709	00:19:13,641	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	is called, HARDEN and that's short for hardening development toolchains against emergent execution engines. 

https://researchfunding.duke.edu/hardening-development-toolchains-against-emergent-execution-engines-harden

EDL	00:19:13,641	00:19:40,067	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	What a mouthful that is, it sounds like quite an ambitious set of programs to decrease our vulnerabilities, as we been talking about, but since we can't really go into any depth with these, certainly not all of that. Maybe you can pick and choose and sort of walk through your programs you spend, you know, as little or as much times you want on this one or that one, it just to give us a sense of what, in fact, you are worried about. 
EDL	00:19:40,067	00:19:47,990	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And what kinds of problems you're trying to solve, all the interests of increasing security for our war fighters are also for all the civilians out there.

** GUEST speaking

EDL	00:19:48,210	00:20:01,880	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Certainly, and I would borrow a phrase from one of the famous security researchers, who said, the point of our profession, is making computers that we could finally trust. 
EDL	00:20:02,370	00:20:07,720	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Which, of course, hurricanes to the fact that we cannot trust computers as we make them now. 

EDL	00:20:08,000	00:20:10,300	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But, and who, who said that, who is that famous person ? 
EDL	00:20:11,000	00:20:16,130	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It is Felix Linder, a researcher from berlin. 

*** HIGHLIGHT: cannot trust computers, software we built today
EDL	00:20:17,430	00:20:25,218	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Now we cannot trust computers we built today, and we can not trust software we built today. 

EDL	00:20:25,218	00:20:31,210	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And part of the reason is, even if we build them exactly to the specification. 
EDL	00:20:31,280	00:20:51,535	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And even if there is no ambiguity, but all the morsel, if there raised some ambiguity(含糊) in that a specific issue, we end up building what we intend, and something else. That something else turns to be a lot friendlier to the attackers, to the exploiters. 

EDL	00:20:51,535	00:20:54,161	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Then we've ever intended to be. 
EDL	00:20:54,161	00:21:02,170	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It's as if packaged with your shiny work station or your server is the kit for exploiting that server. 

EDL	00:21:02,620	00:21:16,663	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And this is what I refer to as emergent execution uh, emergent properties of computing systems, properties that we never met them to have needed the hardware and other software, not the combination there are of
EDL	00:21:16,663	00:21:29,500	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But yet they allow the adversary to reprogramme computers, reuse existing, well-debugged pieces of software before attack purposes. 
EDL	00:21:30,160	00:21:40,290	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And this is the aspect of the computers that I would like to reduce, mitigate and eliminate where possible. 

EDL	00:21:40,390	00:21:43,890	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Right, so maybe I can ask you to take that another level further. 

EDL	00:21:43,890	00:21:46,930	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We have given us kind of the helicopter view. 
EDL	00:21:47,020	00:21:48,270	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And then your programs. 
EDL	00:21:48,270	00:21:53,240	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I imagine are designed to go after a specific categories of vulnerabilities. 
EDL	00:21:53,240	00:21:57,750	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So maybe just talk about two of the ones that may be our particular interest in reports. 
EDL	00:21:57,780	00:22:03,101	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So here is, a are likely to find save dogs or save documents. 
EDL	00:22:03,101	00:22:15,510	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Looks at the information interchange formats, the formats in which data arrives at our computers and arrives at our software, and will also sometimes exploit them. 
EDL	00:22:16,080	00:22:26,150	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Now, how do we build code that can safely intake a data that might be hostile or might have been manipulated ? 
EDL	00:22:26,150	00:22:39,460	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	How do we make software that agrees on what is in the message between the various computing components that are involved in the the flow of our email of our documents ? 
EDL	00:22:40,130	00:22:47,770	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	How do we, as we say, parse the data securely, or how do we intake data securely? 
EDL	00:22:47,970	00:23:16,120	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This is a SafeDocs, and then, of course, now, that we found some vulnerabilities or ambiguities, we want to fix those vulnerabilities in the date intake, and very typically, those vulnerabilities are like a single check on the input data that was assumed was done, but was actually never done by the actual software doing the data and take the passer. 

EDL	00:23:16,570	00:23:33,202	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So how do we patch those vulnerabilities usually is a simple check, but the problem with a simple change to any binary software is that you have to make sure that you are not destroying something else. You are not 
EDL	00:23:33,202	00:23:40,850	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	damaging the baseline functionality of your device and the methods and tools for insuring it is AMP.

NOTE: AMP介绍完毕

* HOST:

EDL	00:23:40,930	00:23:47,875	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I just have to say, so, what's fascinating about that description to me is that there is a parallel in genetic engineering. 
EDL	00:23:47,875	00:24:05,288	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We're, if you're going to make a change, even a varies tiny point change, changing one omenos at a protein, or or just one DNA nuclear tide, sometimes that will have effects on, other proteins that you never thought would be involved, given your initial intention. 
EDL	00:24:05,288	00:24:09,186	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So it's kind of the same way, right, a patch going into legacy software. 
EDL	00:24:09,186	00:24:13,700	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You'll, you're after, you know, it fixes and try to increase security, but you don't know.
EDL	00:24:13,770	00:24:19,138	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Maybe there is another set of changes that are deleterious(有害的) that you would would regret.

* GUEST: 
EDL	00:24:19,138	00:24:26,250	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	That's right, well, each and every one of us, we are computing devices [laugh] besides other the things. 

EDL	00:24:26,460	00:24:29,950	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So this is a very valid analogy(类比). 

EDL	00:24:29,950	00:24:39,950	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And then, of course, you might want to check how you could add components or add features to a system without disrupting it. 
EDL	00:24:39,950	00:24:42,730	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And this is the V-SPELL program.

* HOST:
EDL	00:24:43,160	00:24:46,260	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So let me just go to one that gets back to your. 
EDL	00:24:46,260	00:24:53,625	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I would say earlier interest, you know, your interests as a mathematician is the recovery of symbolic mathematics from code. 
EDL	00:24:53,625	00:24:55,000	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So this is sort of working backwards. 
EDL	00:24:55,000	00:25:03,010	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It sounds like from the software, to mathematical formulations that maybe were at the heart of what the programmer was trying to do. 
EDL	00:25:03,010	00:25:05,600	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Now, why is this an important ability?

* GUEST:
EDL	00:25:05,960	00:25:34,950	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It is extremely important when you encounter legacy software as you rely more, as we all rely more and more on algorithms controlling our power, power, medical devices and or even our cards, you want to make sure that the intended algorithm are with the engineer planned to put in that device is actually what the device does. 
EDL	00:25:34,950	00:25:49,320	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So connecting back the binary form of software to the symbolic form of mathematics that the software and codes, it is an extremely important step in making sure that our devices are trust worthy. 
EDL	00:25:49,900	00:26:04,350	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Very often, you don't have the source code in legacy software, the company that may, the thing the device went out of business, or it might not have gone out of business, but it actually lost the source code. 

EDL	00:26:04,800	00:26:07,260	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This has happened to companies begin small. 
EDL	00:26:07,620	00:26:22,680	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	What would like to do is still be answer the question of does this books do, what it what was intended to do, and what was it in control engineering terms? 

* HOST: question
EDL	00:26:22,900	00:26:39,445	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Interesting question comes to mind now that as you work backwards from software to, sort of, the original mathematical formulations and algorithms, does that uniquely to one mathematical formulation was impossible that you, you might have several. 
EDL	00:26:39,445	00:26:45,620	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And then you still left with the question of what was the actual original intent in the regional mathematical formulation? 

* GUEST: 符号执行

EDL	00:26:45,990	00:26:58,940	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You certainly end up with the several and in fact the whole continue, because there are many different ways to write down the same as medical formula, and many more to encode that formula in code. 
EDL	00:26:59,250	00:27:13,770	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And of course, not all code comes from mathematical formulas, but for the well engineered systems, for the so called control processers that control things such as engines or generators. 
EDL	00:27:14,240	00:27:24,390	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	There is a well-engineered symbolic mathematical theory of how they work, and we should be able to discern(分辨) that in code. 

EDL	00:27:24,390	00:27:27,616	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This is, what ReMath attempts to do. 

* HOST
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:30,830	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	right. This is something like embedded processors in the grid. 
EDL	00:27:31,060	00:27:40,440	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And there are certain other things you can bring in to kind of rule out 5 candidate mathematical formulations, cause you know what it should look like in this particular engineering category. 
EDL	00:27:40,510	00:27:41,280	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	That's right. 
EDL	00:27:41,280	00:27:44,330	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This aims to help the subject [...] experts. 
EDL	00:27:44,500	00:27:50,780	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This aims to put together the specialist in the binary and in the control algorithms. 
EDL	00:27:51,010	00:27:53,556	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Or control engineers

EDL	00:27:52,556	00:27:54,150	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Q: When you say binary, what do you mean? 
EDL	00:27:54,430	00:28:01,840	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	The executable code, as a compiled form of it that finally goes into the memory of the device on controllers and it's operation. 

EDL	00:28:01,840	00:28:19,242	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We're only getting started.  I could keep asking questions because what you do fascinates me, and I want to know more and more, but I'm actually gonna suggest that listener to who have the common trigue to go to your program manager webpage on the website, and then to take a tour themselves to get at least some additional taste of all of your programs. 

* BIGGER QUESTION: Univ. Industry and Gov.

EDL	00:28:19,242	00:28:24,289	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You know, as we come to the end of our time here, I want to get into a couple of just bigger questions. 
EDL	00:28:24,289	00:28:33,530	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This is the innovation, ecosystem and technology and society types of questions, what fascinates me about you is that you really have had experience in the three kind of major sectors. 

EDL	00:28:33,530	00:28:45,835	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We tend to think about in the innovation ecosystem, right, so you started your career in industry in BBN and spent nearly twenty years in academy at DARPA, and you might return to that at the end of your time here in DARPA.
EDL	00:28:45,835	00:28:48,993	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And then here you are doing government work at DARPA since 2018.
EDL	00:28:48,993	00:29:06,185	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So when you look at those three players, universities and industry and government in the overall innovation ecosystem, specifically when it comes to the to sort of cyber security technology, how do you see each of those players contributing. 

** ANSWER: academia follows publishing trends

EDL	00:29:06,185	00:29:07,820	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It's a great question. 
EDL	00:29:08,680	00:29:13,950	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I would say that, of course, the industry looks to deploy product. 
EDL	00:29:14,550	00:29:22,320	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Academia explores new ideas and follows publishing trends. 
EDL	00:29:23,300	00:29:35,250	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	The role of DARPA has been to, at least in the success that I have seen has been to pursue things that could not be immediately made them to product. 
EDL	00:29:35,660	00:29:39,209	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Or the industry might not believe could be made into products 
EDL	00:29:39,209	00:29:49,970	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	and encourage that kind of exploration, when which you could not justify(证明...有理) to your manager, to your shareholders as an industry worker. 

EDL	00:29:50,300	00:29:56,760	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	You mean, in that case, because there is a sense that there is, there is too much risk to go ahead to do that responsibly in a business context. 

EDL	00:29:56,980	00:30:08,300	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But then, if DARPA comes in and has the benefit of managers like you, who can have programs that demonstrate, take the risk down in certain areas, then a company might say, okay, let's take this to a finish line. 
EDL	00:30:08,300	00:30:08,840	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	That's right. 

EDL	00:30:08,890	00:30:28,913	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Whereas with the academia, well, you may have heard the phrase of publish appearash, which means that and academic research or not to have a successful career or any career at all is expected to produce at least several papers a year aimed at a difficult first-tier(第一类) conferences or journals. 
EDL	00:30:28,913	00:30:56,120	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Now, those have some idea of which research directions are promising and interesting, but these often fail to encompass(围绕) significant parts of reality, including industrial reality, or even the parts of the industry, does not think about now, has been behind a several DARPA successes that I have experienced personally to define a new direction.

EDL	00:30:56,830	00:31:06,760	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Define a new trend and puts some grand funding behind the trend in order to get academia to listen
EDL	00:31:06,760	00:31:09,500	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Well, this is the need that you might be missing. 

EDL	00:31:09,780	00:31:20,780	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This is the cool thing that might, with time create its own first tier publication venue(会场) of journal and conferences. 
EDL	00:31:21,120	00:31:24,020	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And there, I believe, DARPA has been greatly successful. 

* HOST

EDL	00:31:24,210	00:31:31,171	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Thinking about this, what a great finish line, what a great result is a DARPA of which is to take a technology. 

EDL	00:31:31,171	00:31:46,534	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Neither take the risk down so that someone else will pick it up, in sort of, transition, but a military service or to industry for additional development, sometimes programs just segway to another program to build on what has accomplished in the prior work
EDL	00:31:46,534	00:31:58,670	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	when you scanning your own mind, your programs and the many research performers who are working on them who like to come to you now again, say, Sergey, Sergey
EDL	00:31:58,670	00:32:10,000	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Look what I've done. can you mention one or two of the maybe the more mature accomplishments that you think have a good chance of transition and becoming actual technologies in our lifes? 

** ANSWER

EDL	00:32:10,000	00:32:30,850	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	One of the things that really excites me, it is on the SafeDocs program we've been working with the PDF association, which is an industry by the united, unites many stakeholders in the portable document format to produce a machine readable, unambiguous specification of the format.
EDL	00:32:31,750	00:32:39,710	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	This is the first time ever that this has been attempted for a major format, with billions of documents out there. 
EDL	00:32:40,020	00:32:52,370	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And of course, you cannot reinvent that format for that reason, because people would not take kindly to their documents being simply deemed and compliant and not opening. 
EDL	00:32:52,370	00:33:13,769	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But I think we are on our way to reforming how the standards process, the international standards process at the international standardization organization, deals with the information interchange formats and how we might make our electronic documents much more trust worthy 
EDL	00:33:13,769	00:33:31,610	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	so that we would not actually be told to not click on documents and could rely on computers to securely process the data that comes in a documents and communications in the many sensor sheets that surround us. 

** HOST

EDL	00:33:31,700	00:33:44,150	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Okay, and let you spend one more minute on this PDF example that you bring up, and so that listeners who might not be in this world of increasing security, reducing vulnerabilities as they interact with, say, PDF documents. 
EDL	00:33:44,280	00:33:57,180	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	What is the security gain that you get by moving toward that kind of standardization that you just mentioned, and the, disambiguation on the part of the platform on which showing up. 
EDL	00:33:57,180	00:33:59,030	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	How does that increase our security?
EDL	00:33:59,030	00:34:13,570	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Directly and immediately remember the time of your training when starting to use any computing system, when you're told to never click on attachments from people you do not trust 
EDL	00:34:13,570	00:34:14,530	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Why is that ? 
EDL	00:34:15,190	00:34:25,580	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It's because documents these days are not equivalent of a simple sheet of paper with some passive content that you can read or ignore it [...]
EDL	00:34:25,760	00:34:37,520	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	They are sophisticated programs that interact with the software on your computer, make it do things, trigger emergent properties. 
EDL	00:34:37,680	00:34:49,950	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Emergent are parts in that software that no one wanted there, no one intended to put there in the first place, and that we could locally really know as the exploit. 
EDL	00:34:50,980	00:34:59,640	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So when you talk to not click on documents, well, this is the part of the present that I would like to exclude from the future. 

EDL	00:35:00,000	00:35:06,778	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It'll take a lot of effort, but unambiguous definitions of what you expect to find there. 
EDL	00:35:06,778	00:35:09,906	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And what is denied and what is expected. 
EDL	00:35:09,906	00:35:11,210	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	isn't a three piece of it

EDL	00:35:11,210	00:35:16,345	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Super helpful for for someone like me who sees that I don't click, I don't clicks. 
EDL	00:35:16,345	00:35:18,131	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Try to make that my practice. 
EDL	00:35:18,131	00:35:29,620	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But now I understand that that in some ways that are hedge against some creative person who might have found one of these emergent executable pathways into my computer. 
EDL	00:35:29,900	00:35:33,000	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Yeah, which are typically known as vulnerabilities.
EDL	00:35:33,150	00:35:41,964	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But because we don't know all of the vulnerabilities that could be in there, the broad brostroke solution of not clicking on it sort of solves a lot of problems. 
EDL	00:35:41,964	00:35:45,440	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But you're saying, we know, that's not really good solution. 

EDL	00:35:45,500	00:35:47,050	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Yeah, actually it doesn't work. 
EDL	00:35:47,050	00:35:53,100	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Whatever your job is, you're intended to read things. 
EDL	00:35:53,400	00:35:55,790	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Edit them, send them on.
EDL	00:35:56,780	00:36:11,690	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I don't think there is any professions these days that doesn't include some kind of form filling or manual reading, or any one of those tasks that do take electronic documents, so you can't just not click. 

EDL	00:36:12,520	00:36:19,100	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So I often ask of my, my discussion leaders, who I presume our tech files, because here this is DARPA, right ? 

* DREAMed technology
EDL	00:36:19,210	00:36:29,470	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Um.. here's the question. I, I was always like to find out if there are technology that you dreamed about when you were in middle school or later, this don't have to be DARPA technologies at all. 
EDL	00:36:29,820	00:36:39,050	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But just, you know, when you just sort of look back in your wish for, you say, oh, if that technology existed I would just love it, are there technologies like that for you?

EDL	00:36:39,640	00:36:49,410	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Of course, I mean ，I am the child of the space exploration age, or the a tail end there're of.(?)
EDL	00:36:49,630	00:36:59,630	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so flying cars that can go to the moon, a rockets that teenagers could pilot. 
EDL	00:36:59,630	00:37:08,650	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	If you look back at some of those novels of Heinlein and others, that's what you see. 

罗伯特·海因莱因 (Robert A. Heinlein)  科幻小说作家
美国硬科幻小说作家，人称“科幻先生”。他的作品被认为在科学和工程方面有相当可信度，也帮助提高了对科幻类作品的科学准确性的要求标准。 海因莱因是1940年代晚期将无修饰科幻小说打入一般主流杂志的第一位科幻小说作家。他是1960年代最畅销长篇科幻小说的头几名作家之一。 维基百科

EDL	00:37:08,650	00:37:21,500	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And we are getting some not the flying cars yet, but certainly spacecraft, and that can land vertically, used to be straight Sci-Fi
EDL	00:37:21,500	00:37:22,503	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	till it was not

EDL	00:37:22,503	00:37:22,880	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	[Host] right. 
EDL	00:37:22,880	00:37:26,529	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	We do see that I have to say that the idea of millions of teenagers of 
EDL	00:37:26,529	00:37:31,565	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	piloting their own rocket is about the most frightening vulnerability I possibly can imagine, 
EDL	00:37:31,565	00:37:36,101	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	but maybe we can educate the teenagers to operate these things safely, 
EDL	00:37:36,101	00:37:37,990	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I just have the image ever I actually do kind of love. 

* One final question

EDL	00:37:38,220	00:37:44,070	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	One final question before I show you my gratitude for talking with me. 
EDL	00:37:44,070	00:37:48,529	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And that's just, is there something, Sergey, that I should've asked you that I did not or
EDL	00:37:48,529	00:37:52,670	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	just something else that on your mind that you think would be adventurous(新奇的) to our listeners. 
EDL	00:37:52,980	00:37:59,930	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	If I could say one thing on the technology in general, it is that, uh, it is exciting. 
EDL	00:38:00,900	00:38:09,098	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	But at the same time it brings large and unknown failure modes and vulnerabilities, 
EDL	00:38:09,098	00:38:18,158	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	getting too enthusiastic about technology to the point of mandating its use is hardly ever a great idea in my book, 
EDL	00:38:18,158	00:38:23,795	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	you can call me a techno-fobe(排科技主义) or a combined techno-file and techno-fobe (?)

EDL	00:38:23,795	00:38:34,290	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	but mandating of the use of any particular technology also means mandating the use of the vulnerabilities that come with it. 
EDL	00:38:34,730	00:38:42,800	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so any such decisions, any sessions enthusiasms should be tampered by the understanding that this is what happens. 
EDL	00:38:43,810	00:38:44,140	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	[Host] right
EDL	00:38:44,140	00:38:52,989	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And so one way I think about what you just said is that a question that has to be there in the technology development process is 
EDL	00:38:52,989	00:38:55,528	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	what could possibly go wrong, right ? 
EDL	00:38:55,528	00:38:59,980	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And that all we should be part of the practice that is sort of hygiene(保健?) for technology development.

EDL	00:39:00,000	00:39:04,248	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	That is true, but I would also take it further. 
EDL	00:39:04,248	00:39:13,100	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I would say that listening to rejectionists of any particular technology is underrated(被低估). 
EDL	00:39:13,780	00:39:23,400	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	They might, in fact, be right in certain ways that a people more enthusiastic about the technologies might not have foreseen(预见)

EDL	00:39:24,450	00:39:25,950	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So we must deal with caution here.
EDL	00:39:26,580	00:39:32,546	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	I believe, love that balanced perspective of being excited in a techno feel of sense
EDL	00:39:32,546	00:39:38,487	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	but also having that sense of respect and eyes wide open and caution and fear of unintended consequences that 
EDL	00:39:38,487	00:39:42,754	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	justified a little bit of a techno-fobe component, as well as you move forward. 
EDL	00:39:42,754	00:39:45,567	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So that's really, really interesting to hear. 

EDL	00:39:45,567	00:39:48,082	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	Sergey, we're out of time. 
EDL	00:39:48,082	00:39:54,620	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	So let me just thank you for helping me understand a bit more about the cyber security and insecurity landscapes. 
EDL	00:39:55,010	00:40:01,111	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	And I have to say, I am really hardened that people with your expertise and attentions, 
EDL	00:40:01,111	00:40:06,090	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	which is to say, people exactly like you in particular, I am happy around the case. 
EDL	00:40:06,160	00:40:08,170	| VfD E51 The Cybersecurity Sleuth |	It was just a real blast for me to talking to you.

* Bye

** NOTES

In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, Sergey Bratus (https://www.darpa.mil/staff/dr-sergey-bratus), a program manager since 2018 in the agency’s Information Innovation Office (https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/offices/I2O), shares his educational and professional journey, beginning in the late 1970s as a computer-smitten middle-schooler in the former Soviet Union and leading to his current and prominent role among those who aim to render the increasingly prevalent and perilous software, hardware, and networks in our lives much safer to use. His fascination with computer security emerged in the 1990s as a mathematics graduate student when a computer he was programming and responsible for at Northeastern University in Boston was taken over by a hacker. “I probably owe whoever did that a beer,” Bratus tells listeners. Why? Because it set him on his life’s mission to learn as much as he can about the vulnerabilities of software and hardware with the goal of learning how to best minimize or eliminate those vulnerabilities. Noting his embrace of the hacker community for its deep and innovative expertise in this context, Bratus tells podcast listeners about how the programs he oversees at DARPA could help reduce or entirely remove even some of the most stealthy and unexpected vulnerabilities that reside in software and its logical, computational, and mathematical foundations.
