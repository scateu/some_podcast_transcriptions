00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,550
Stealth technology the Internet GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:31,310
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the cold war DARPA, the defense Advanced Research projects agency has been a driver of technology

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:40,660
Welcome to voices from DARPA a window unto DARPA's core of program managers their job to redefine what is possible

4
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,030
My name is Ivan Amato, and I'm your DARPA host. For this episode

5
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:55,210
The last one I will host, I decided to collect observations that program managers have shared with me and you listeners, since as they reflected on their time at the agency

6
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,860
So many of them told me that the job was the best, most fun, most rewarding, most impacted job they had ever had

7
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:14,880
Even though they knew from the start that they would only have the job for a few years, that's how DARPA rolls, you can get the dream job and bring your new blood to, but then you need to hand that dream job off to yet some newer blood

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,870
Let me start with the words of Peter Hynum

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,280
The agency's deputy director, who in a previous Santa DARPA from 1999 to 2003

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,830
Served as a program manager overseeing programs in electronic wrong fare and electronic communications

11
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,670
I love the way he described the program manager's job to me back in June of 2020

12
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,070
I don't have a program manager quite literally invents tomorrow

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:02:00,660
The upward program managers have the leeway the authority to find the the best teams in the world to work on a particular problem, and then they have the authority and capabilities to drive to achieve the results that are of to them

14
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:09,400
DARPA is a place where the program managers are the ones who really drive the ship, the office directors and the the front office

15
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,990
Our job is to make it possible for them to do that to give them the tools and to help them achieve their goals

16
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:26,880
A DARPA program manager blames a research problem with a plausibility story with a deep awareness and knowledge of the state of the art, and that problem idea

17
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:37,080
A very careful idea with use cases and such as to why that problem is of great importance to national defence and to our military

18
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:46,390
And then how it can be executed as a research program and then how progress will be measured and assessed, and then who will be who will benefit from the results

19
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:58,010
How will those results transition into practice and again and again and again for 60 years now, DARPA program managers have set up programs, have run them

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:09,680
And quite literally, that rigour, that passion that a program manager brings to the job will be saving lives 5 10 15 years from now

21
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,960
I am particularly grateful to Tyler McQuade

22
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:31,200
Who was a big ideas program manager in the agency's defense sciences office in September 2016, when he sat down with me in a studio on the 13th floor of DARPA headquarters in Arlington for my very first podcast recording, I wanted to start with Tyler because my aim was for the podcast to be accessible to a wide audience

23
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,042
And I knew he would say things like this

24
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:33,990
a coconut

25
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,890
It smells the way it does because a chemistry

26
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:51,400
But he also revealed that tantalized, what if mentality that I would encounter over and over again throughout my podcast recordings with program managers or PMs, as they also are known, DARPA, is that one

27
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,660
Place where

28
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,500
We are thinking about

29
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,140
Innovation unconstrained like, where can we go

30
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,550
Yeah, that where can we go?

31
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:15,010
That could be a tagline for DARPA, dev Palmer was another podcast guest earlier in the series at the time in late 2016, he was a program manager in the agency's Microsystems Technology Office or MTO

32
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,740
He would leave DARPA the next year

33
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:25,120
But in 2020 he came back as PM's also sometimes do to become MTO's current deputy director. Back in our podcast discussion

34
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,780
He heaped a whole lot of love about working at DARPA

35
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,600
Coming to DARPA is like grabbing the nose cone of a rocket and holding on for dear life

36
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,440
It's a fast moving place that has a significant impact on the trajectory of technology for the nation

37
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:51,090
And being part of that is an incredible thrill, the idea that you can come up with a technical idea that's interesting to you

38
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,250
And create a community to pursue that ideas

39
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,870
is an experience you won't get anywhere else

40
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,347
You can take flyer bets on crazy things like integrating magnetics with semiconductors,

41
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:05,960
and people will actually soldier up and tell you how they're gonna do it.

42
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:18,210
Blake beckstein has followed a similar path to deaf Palmer's he too started out as a program manager in his case in in the biological technologies office, and later took on some management responsibilities

43
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,020
I recorded him when he was still a newbie

44
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,816
Blake has one of those gleams in his eye that makes anyone think this guy is going to do something amazing

45
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:27,250
after all

46
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,060
One of his ambitions has been to protect nothing less than food supply from both natural and engineered threats

47
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,013
Which is another way of saying biological warefare,

48
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:38,250
well, I came to DARPA because I saw a fantastic opportunity

49
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,050
For my research community, the DARPA mission is unlike things that I've done in the past

50
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,100
Because the dark emission is to look at high risk, high reward

51
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:57,533
projects that could benefit humanity in a sort of that 20 to 50 year time frame,

52
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,790
and it also gives an opportunity to derest

53
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,650
ah, some programs and some projects

54
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,270
So that they can actually come to light and and see youth

55
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,280
So when the opportunity to come to DARPA presented itself,

56
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,817
I thought it was just this awesome chance to do some really great science,

57
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:21,930
and I was encouraged because I was asked to think about things that traditionally weren't funded very well

58
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:28,970
You know, the positive that can come out of this and the world changing abilities that we're gonna gain is incredible

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,060
Beckstein came into DARPA with an uncommon specialty and interest in agricultural biotechnology and food security for eber furu

60
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:46,550
Who was a DARPA program manager from 2014 through 2018 in the agency's Defense Sciences Office, also brought in a unique mindset, and she was nervous about it

61
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:57,780
She was skeptical about how a mathematician like herself would fit in in my podcast featuring Furu, which aired in March of 2017, I asked her what she thought she might be able to do at DARPA that she could not do elsewhere

62
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,030
I say DARPA is probably the best place to be

63
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,785
If you are an applied mathematician, in fact, I just say for if you're a mathematician

64
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:13,462
and I'd like to solve problems because one of the greatest thing about DARPA is that,

65
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:21,363
there is this wealth of information, wealth of problems that are important,

66
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:24,470
and I have to say they're very, very cool

67
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:33,172
The coolness factor for problems to solve for a mathematician here is enormous

68
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:38,024
because you feel that not only you're solving a problem that has importance,

69
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,680
they're certainly broader impact

70
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,938
As far as you know, you're solving important problems in national security,

71
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:50,574
but you also feel like the problems are so rich that in some ways,

72
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:56,940
there is so much to contribute the richness of the problem is maybe the the biggest driver,

73
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,300
a motivating factor for anybody, certainly for a mathematician.

74
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:08,592
And I just want to add, and I've been saying that to my friends to my colleagues, anybody who would listen

75
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:16,090
that why mathematics is actually very important to to DARPA and encourage them to become future program managers

76
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:24,380
Is that when you're encountered by important problems and you see that your your ideas

77
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,320
The role you have as a mathematician that not only you try to look at these particular problems,

78
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:40,670
but you try to abstract out and coming with different representation that would yield better solution for these problems, so you basically see that your ideas are at work

79
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,940
I mean, what better satisfaction are there

80
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,390
Hear that mathematicians out there

81
00:08:45,390 --> 00:09:04,490
Don't forget about DARPA could be just the place for you wage shen, who's nearly five year stint as a program manager or APM for short ended in 2019, he reveled in the way DARPA embraces the most fundamental kind of scientific in an R&D continuum that can lead to the highest technologies of all, obviously

82
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,770
Even within the US government, there are a number of organizations of fund basic research

83
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,470
The fund applied research that fund various projects along that continuum

84
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,310
And I think DARPA has a very unique role

85
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,230
It's it's a role that spans the gap between basic research and applied science

86
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:34,540
Oftentimes, we're looking for the applications that seem impossible, whether it's, you know, launching ah drones off of flying aircraft or you know

87
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:44,820
Detecting human trafficking online, all of these things are things that you know we're emerging capabilities 3 or 4 years ago, but now have proven to be possible

88
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,340
And so DARPA's, in a very unique place that

89
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:59,095
Allows us to push the technology beyond the theoretical stages to the point where we can actually see where the where the applications are going to be,

90
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:02,730
so we're not builders of the ultimate technology

91
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,245
Right, and at the end of the day, we fund the research, and that research eventually becomes product types in other forms,

92
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:18,855
but if you look at the you know progression of robotics and self driving cars, all of those AI technologies were curated out of DARPA programs early on

93
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:24,300
and have subsequently you know a ten year horizon after that become productizeable

94
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,470
The industry has been able to take it up, so we serve a very crucial role

95
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,930
And the reason that we can serve that role is

96
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,360
The program managers themselves, these folks come with the ideas

97
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,799
And they can see the horizon

98
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:50,800
Jonathan fouth, who from 2015 to 2019 brought interests in the social sciences and social psychology to DARPA as a program manager in the information innovation office expressed to me in the middle of his PM stint,

99
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,960
a multifaceted enthusiasm for his temp job at the agency

100
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,700
DARPA is such an amazing place that

101
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,670
It's hard when you're in

102
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,259
field doing research and development and leading other people and doing it

103
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,610
to not know about DARPA to not know about the amazing things that DARPA has done

104
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,700
So for me, it was it was very natural to say, boy

105
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,210
I could imagine at some point

106
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,900
Appropriately, in my career, I would love to serve at DARPA and spend those four

107
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,420
or five years in my life here helping

108
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,840
Arriving at DARPA

109
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,640
There's a sense of incredible empowerment that with the

110
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,570
wherewithal(为做某事而需要的钱) that you get to

111
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,601
really make some extraordinary things happen, not just

112
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,200
oh, I'm going to run a program

113
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,720
But no, I'm going to, you know

114
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,900
write a seminal book with

115
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,640
the best people in the world I'm going to

116
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,700
change a whole discipline

117
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,180
It's an amazing feeling.

118
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,860
and when you do all of that and you tie it back to national security and feeling

119
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,130
like you're serving your country, it's a great feeling.

120
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,880
As you already have heard a PM job at DARPA is temporary three or 4 years

121
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,200
Maybe 5 is typically what you get

122
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,580
That's not job security, but it has been a catalyst for both individual and institutional achievement

123
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,410
I wholeheartedly agree

124
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:15,020
That one of the things that makes a successful organization, this idea of bringing pro managers in for a short amount of time get

125
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,500
The work done that they envision getting done and then leave in order for new blood to come into the culture and into the organization

126
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,210
It's important

127
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:30,250
That's Scott Wierzbanowski of the Tactical Technology Office I recorded a podcast episode with him this past April

128
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,330
Just a month before he finished his four year PM gig

129
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,820
By understanding that you have a very limited time in a very special place like DARPA, it becomes your priority

130
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:49,590
You focus all of your time and attention, day, night weekends on whatever these projects happens to be, it becomes a passion

131
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:57,396
It becomes your life and you can do so for a 2 to 4 five year period, where this is everything that you're focused on,

132
00:12:57,396 --> 00:13:07,170
but eventually human nature takes over, and eventually people either get burnt out or they no longer have newer ideas that needs to be brought to bear

133
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:14,420
And that motivation isn't necessarily gone, but it is time for other people to come in with their new ideas

134
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,249
And there's another new ones that happens too

135
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:20,012
you have a program and you work this program for a couple of years,

136
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,505
and you're focused on making it successful,

137
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:25,168
but sometimes a program manager can get biased(有偏见),

138
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:29,420
and by bringing in new blood or a new program manager into a particular case

139
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:36,254
They may see in a different light and maybe able to make changes that the other program manager didn't wasn't aware of

140
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:40,160
or maybe just decided that it'd be better to go down a different path

141
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,763
It's a double edge sword, but I think in general doing so,

142
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:54,500
we're bringing in new program managers into take care of programs that are ongoing as well as bringing their own in is really what makes us such a

143
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,798
A great place to work

144
00:13:55,798 --> 00:14:00,528
Peter Hynum when he was serving as acting director of DARPA during part of 2020,

145
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:06,720
outlined what he thought were some of the most important institutional traits that made DARPA so successful

146
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,750
One of them was that temporary nature of the program manager role, but there were others

147
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:21,980
A DARPA or originally when it was upper back in 1958, somehow the framers the people who put this machine together

148
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,530
Quite a few things, really, absolutely right

149
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:35,628
And it's those my view, those those few things, but of an enabled DARPA to succeed over 60 years now

150
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:40,920
and delivering and and continuing to deliver and invent tomorrow for the department

151
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,890
So the first of these three things is that to everybody who works on the technical side of DARPA

152
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,990
program managers, office directors

153
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,813
front office folk.

154
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:55,750
We are all temporary by design, we we come

155
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,120
We send we spent four years or so here and then we leave

156
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,530
We come from industry

157
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,480
We come from universities we come from elsewhere in the government

158
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,110
We come from the the military services

159
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,660
We do our job, we push hard and then we leave this one thing

160
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:21,140
DARPA also is a project agency, so there are no standing activities

161
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,490
DARPA is not always going to do X or Y

162
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,780
It's continuously changing

163
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:34,043
I'd like to say that in some ways, DARPA is framed to catch the night guys or to be in it and to

164
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:44,040
drive to the next level, so it's in the zeitgeist(时代浪潮), and in some ways, it is that it captures it exactly, and that's what these two things enable us to do

165
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,271
People, ephemeral people will temporarily and project based,

166
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,670
and then the third pieces, DARPA has no assets of its own

167
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,750
We have no laboratories

168
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,599
We have no test facilities, we have no factories,

169
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:03,140
so we don't have a standing army of anything,

170
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:10,915
so and it's perfectly framed as an institution to continuously track and drive and push

171
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:17,000
the frontiers of knowledge applied to problems at real interest and importance to the military

172
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:25,511
For major Christopher Orlowski, who was a program manager in the Tactical Technology Office when I spoke with him in the fall of 2017,

173
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:32,809
it was access to the collaborations it takes to move audacious ideas toward real technology that was special about the PM job

174
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:36,009
the biggest thing I've learned since being a program manager is that

175
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:39,210
the innovation and collaboration is a team effort

176
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,100
I don't do it by myself

177
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,724
There's no way I could begin the fathom to manage all these programs

178
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:45,245
and all these efforts that are under by myself,

179
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:50,891
so I have a great team, a great support team that helps our technical experts in the field

180
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:51,760
in their fields

181
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,290
And that ultimately, even us is not the ones that do it

182
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:01,989
It's the engineers and scientists at companies and universities and defense contractors that we fund

183
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:06,856
that are the ones that ultimately are gonna bend metal and write code, and they deliver these capabilities to war fighters,

184
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:13,250
but I can't forget the war fighters either, because their invaluable advice recommendations are also part of a loop

185
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,520
So it's a collaborative ecosystem that results in the innovation that provides these new capabilities

186
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,524
It is those war fighters that were foremost in the mind of Rosa Alejandra Lukaszew

187
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:33,430
when she joined the defense sciences office in 2017 DSL program managers conceive of an overseas, some of the agency's most fundamental science projects

188
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,318
In her case in the way collections of electrons behave in materials, among

189
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:42,289
other really fundamental stuff, I spoke with her when she was about halfway through her

190
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,420
three and a half year run as a PM

191
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,620
As an American

192
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,940
Not by birth

193
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,500
but by choice, you know, I have a deep love for this country

194
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,710
The admiration for this country and a sense of duty regarding you know, trying to help this country to continue

195
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,400
Be what it is right now, and the best way, in my opinion, is to try to see, okay

196
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,710
What are the needs of the people that are the forefront of defending the country that would be the defense

197
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,600
the arm forces in general, right

198
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,380
And so what is that is going to make that difference in terms of you know

199
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,835
Advances in technology, advances in research that can help this dismission,

200
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:21,881
and clearly DARPA is at the forefront of all of these funding agencies on that particular direction,

201
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:28,150
so I was very, very intrigued and curious and interested in being part of this particular

202
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,781
organization for that reason,

203
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:40,242
before colonel Matthew Hepburn came to DARPA's Biological Technologies Office to work on the challenge of responding far more rapidly than ever before to threats from both known and new infectious diseases,

204
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:43,980
he had been pushing that goal in policy jobs in circles

205
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,740
That's when he got a call from the then DSO director Jeff ling, who asked Matt if he wanted to come to DARPA

206
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:57,140
Where he could try and turn policy into action, in his case, into the technologies it will take to prevent pandemics

207
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,670
One of our mantras at DARPA is this idea

208
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,670
Inspiring, inspiring creativity and new solutions to problems

209
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,918
And oftentimes, we say by sort of recruiting and people who have not traditionally thought about our problems

210
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:17,905
to help us with those solutions, and so you know, I would love for the listeners of this podcast to

211
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:22,660
be more inspired to address the problems and infectious diseases.

212
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,440
And and what I mean by that is, I always say, people like me

213
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,430
We've invested our entire careers and our life work into this

214
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:36,992
And we have deep knowledge of the subject, but I love the thought of people that have expertise in computer science

215
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:40,810
in mathematics in what we would say, well

216
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,010
Maybe those fields aren't necessarily obviously related

217
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:51,890
That's who I think that's how we're going to solve the infectious diseases problems of the 21st century, and so when I speak on this, it's almost part

218
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,713
It's one part recruiting, and it's especially recruiting that may not have all of the biases

219
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:03,600
of the traditional experts in infection disease to come up with a creative solution to solve it

220
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:11,203
Matt must have really liked his DARPA job because he left in 2019 after six years, a long timer in DARPA terms

221
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:15,050
for about half of the time that Hepburn was working in the biological technologies office

222
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,779
Brad ring hysen had been working first as the office's deputy director, then is the director

223
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:31,935
I met ring Hyson in March 2020, just as the World Health Organization declared that the spread of SARS CoV-2 infections had grown into a global pandemic into covid-19,

224
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:34,892
partly because of the programs Hepburn had worked on

225
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:43,582
ring hyacinth and his team of PMs were in a position to deploy the DARPA model of research and development to this new multifaceted crisis

226
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:47,230
DARPA plays a really important role for the the entire government, quite honestly

227
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:56,350
But specifically for the department of and that in its ability to predict what is emerging uh as threats to both

228
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,620
our war fighters and our DoD personnel

229
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,950
But also to the country as a whole

230
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,836
And that has been something that's been persistent through the entire lifetime of DARPA,

231
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:08,840
but specific to infectious disease and emergent disease, this is something over the last

232
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,470
two decades DARPA has been there.

233
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:17,100
We've learned what is needed and what is required to be able to fight the types of outbreaks

234
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:26,120
and pandemic that we're seeing right now. With some amazing program manager's amazing forethought that's happened back 5, 10, even 15 years ago

235
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,895
Program managers started thinking about an ideal world

236
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:37,480
where we can have a rapid response platform where we could instead of having to develop vaccines over the course of years

237
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,806
Maybe even decades at at in time

238
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:43,130
Wouldn't it be great if we had a world where we could reduce that

239
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,102
research and development process down to a matter of potentially weeks or months

240
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:50,976
rather than having to wait on that tremendously long time frame, which we know

241
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,380
living through what we're living through right now

242
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,840
It's just too long.

243
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,950
even though the job of DARPA program manager is by definition temporary

244
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,041
Some PMs like the job so much they come back dev Palmer, who we heard from earlier, had done that,

245
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:12,850
so did David gunning, whose fingerprints are all over the ascent of Siri and the entire category of digital assistance

246
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,880
I've been here three times

247
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,580
Because to me

248
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,440
It's one of the most fascinating jobs you

249
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,230
Can have you're the pinnacle of new technology development

250
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,020
You have such a broad view of what's going on, and DARPA gives you this incredible freedom to pursue

251
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,840
what you see is, you know, a vision on where where

252
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,849
things should go.

253
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,660
and Fisher a PM in the Defense Sciences Office, is another several timer at DARPA

254
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:45,223
She got her start as a so called SETA, a contractor working for none other than Tyler McQuade, he was the PM I featured in the very first episode of this podcast,

255
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:50,959
SETA, stands for Science Engineering and Technical Assistant

256
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:56,870
SETAs, who often bring in PhD, postdoc and top tier professional experience to the job

257
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,756
work closely on the programs with the program managers.

258
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,560
They are essential parts of the team.

259
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,500
When I asked Fisher during a podcast conversation in 2018, if there was something I had failed to ask her

260
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,585
This is how our conversation went

261
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:12,110
well, you didn't ask me how fun this was.

262
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,100
Well, tell me how fun it is.

263
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,512
Well, this being the podcast, but also life in general at DARPA,

264
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:28,230
and I say that because we get to interact with amazing top notch scientists on a daily basis multiple times times a day

265
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,638
Um, and that's really exciting, and it's really fun, and it's amazing opportunity,

266
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:39,940
and those are the folks that are doing the the hard work to implement all of the ideas that we might generate here

267
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,324
I'm really put them to practice and and again from you know,

268
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:49,840
the perspective of coming to work every day and being humbled by that and being so excited and energized by what they have to bring

269
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,960
in terms of their ideas and their talents.

270
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,420
Some program managers get the DARPA bug earlier than others

271
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,036
Few have gotten that bug earlier than current BTO program manager Eric Van Gieson,

272
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:04,820
whose portfolio of programs are anchored in the molecular biology of disease and health

273
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:11,655
He told me an hour podcast conversation in 2020 that DARPA had been on his mind since the 1980s

274
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:19,070
when I was in middle school, I would ride my bike over to the library in falls Church across from Marshall high school in northern Virginia

275
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,590
And I would go in there, and I'd read popular mechanics

276
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,110
And I'd read car magazines

277
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,370
And I started reading stories about DARPA that

278
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:32,080
was when we were starting to hear about some of the the computing technologies and the networking technologies that were coming out of DARPA

279
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,400
As part of ah the unveiling of the internet and so

280
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,501
that got me interested

281
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:39,050
in 2020

282
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,075
I spoke with current DSO program manager Mark Wrobel,

283
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:45,730
who hadn't had DARPA on his mind since he was a teenager, the way Van Gieson did,

284
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,297
but he had long known about the agency when he started his PM stint in March 2019

285
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:52,180
one year later

286
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,035
When it became clear that SARS CoV-2 had spread into a pandemic,

287
00:24:56,035 --> 00:25:06,940
Wrobel began pivoting a program under his wing known as sigma plus, to see if the threat detection technology that was its focus could be adapted for early detection of viruses.

288
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:15,969
DARPA does amazing things, and as a federal employee for how going on 12 years, I think now and as an

289
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:22,650
active duty service member for 22 years, you know very few places in government

290
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,940
do you have the real capacity to make change to innovate

291
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:35,670
to discover and to do amazing things, and DARPA is one of those places

292
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,333
It's literally a dream come true to be a program manager here,

293
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:48,150
never in my wildest dreams, did I think this was actually going to come to be, and now I'm here, and

294
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,210
it's been an awesome year

295
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,760
It was an awesome year when I detailed, and I'm hoping for another few years of awesomeness

296
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,290
Before I wrap up my tenure here.

297
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,360
Like Wrobel, John-Francis Mergan

298
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,560
A current program manager in the Information Innovation Office had a long career before coming to DARPA

299
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,245
He had long thought about a stint at the agency,

300
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,273
and when the time was right for him,

301
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:15,220
he finally found himself in a technology playground that was as fun as he

302
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,578
had hoped it would be

303
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:19,790
coming to DARPA was something I'd always wanted to do

304
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,650
But I needed to wait for the right time in my career.

305
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,950
I wanted to be sure my son had graduated from college.

306
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:37,850
I wanted to achieve certain milestones and also get some people in place at my old employer to make sure that the research could carry on,

307
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:45,970
and I also wanted to have the right set of ideas for programs I didn't want to show up and wander around for a year

308
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,556
trying to come up with an idea for a program, so I had my little basket of program ideas,

309
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,160
and I came in the door, I was all excited.

310
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:02,090
I started up and part of the reason for coming to DARPA is there's several neat things that DARPA program managers get to do

311
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,780
One

312
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,938
They get to talk with other people who are who are in the organization

313
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:11,790
and get their ideas and get them completely unfiltered.

314
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,550
But the other one is you can tap into researchers all across the globe

315
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,830
You call up and say, hi, I'm from DARPA, and I was wondering what you were thinking about something

316
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:31,270
And usually the conversation will run far longer than you ever anticipated or you ever even planned,

317
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,860
but you're sorry, when it's over.

318
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,430
I've been able to talk with researchers at Caltech at MIT

319
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,243
And they'll call back with another idea afterwards

320
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:47,956
that is unbelievably exciting, and for someone like me,

321
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:53,194
having that kind of access is the greatest entertainment I could ever hope for

322
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:57,240
the other big piece about this is you get to go see their labs

323
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,838
And you got to go see stuff happening,

324
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:06,900
and as you can guess from being a pilot and from being a ham radio operator, I'd love to touch the technology

325
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,990
I love to play with it

326
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,470
I love to do things with it

327
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,900
Over and over again, I heard from program managers a sense of responsibility to war fighters, to the nation

328
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:23,310
To the taxpayers a sense of privilege and of gratitude the fae of all people got to do this job

329
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,590
The PM job

330
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:35,160
Here's how Tristan mcclair Begley, whose current portfolio of programs in BTO are all about helping word fighters remain healthy and heal from mental and physical injuries expressed to me this past July

331
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,110
Program managers exist in a privileged space

332
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:52,789
We are given a lot of freedom with which to make decisions with which to resource efforts in order to produce research projects that are very near and dear to us

333
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:57,374
There is a lot of I would dare to say that you know, program managers are

334
00:28:57,374 --> 00:29:02,890
very personally invested in the the programs that they're responsible for, and so you know

335
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:13,310
We have a tendency to take things personally because there is that degree of relationship that exists between the ideas, the problems we're trying to solve

336
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,642
The reasons why we're trying to solve those problems and ultimately how the research is done, and I would

337
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:27,395
say that despite that emphasis on the program manager, as this sort monolithic entity responsible for

338
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:34,530
all of this fantastic research and pushing at you know the boundaries of what is you know currently possible

339
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:40,816
I would also say that it has been part of my experience that this is a profoundly collaborative agency

340
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:48,798
that I spend a substantial amount of time in very productive discussions with my colleagues

341
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:55,540
here at the agency, getting very different perspectives on a number of fundamental issues and questions

342
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,790
As well as the collaborations that I have both with the other government mental agencies

343
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,161
The end users who is ultimately going to take the thing that I tried to invent

344
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:11,207
and turn it into some real enabling capability for national security,

345
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:19,388
for rehabilitation(修复) for treatment for restoration in our veteran population in the you know, broader civilian population,

346
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:22,750
and then also with the with the researchers themselves

347
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:30,370
that part of the job of a DARPA program manager is not just coming up with clever ideas and setting things in motion

348
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:37,630
But also continuing to work and pay attention to what the research is producing

349
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,994
What does it tell you about your initial hypothesis and any assumptions that you made

350
00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:46,923
and which of those things are ultimately going to be rejected, we don't

351
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:50,144
learn as much from success as we do from failure, and so

352
00:30:50,144 --> 00:30:55,001
sometimes you just have to be mindful that and do your best to establish the

353
00:30:55,001 --> 00:31:04,450
appropriate balance between things that are practically impossible for a reason versus things that are practically impossible just due to a

354
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,620
lack of innovation

355
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,410
talk to just about any program manager, and they will tell you that DARPA, as an institution,

356
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:16,737
has enough of a track record to claim it has a special sauce, a special institutional culture

357
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:22,190
that makes it about as impactful as any player can get in the innovation ecosystem

358
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,610
Here's how Tim Chung, a PM with the tactical technology office, puts it

359
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,830
I definitely believe DARPA has a secret sauce that has continued to

360
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,940
been able to generate both the ideas, but also create and execute and realize those ideas

361
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,763
I think on the one hand, certainly from the Tactical Technology Office from which I have,

362
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:50,133
we really love seeing technologies demonstrated, so systems being brought together

363
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:54,568
and realized in some sort of field tester demonstration, and I think that's one end

364
00:31:54,568 --> 00:32:00,680
on the other hands we're interested in creating whole new, you know, foundations

365
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,060
whole new areas of research that hadn't really been thought about.

366
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:09,840
And I think that being able to expand that spectrum and do it in the context of, you know

367
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,230
100 or so program managers across 300 programs is is pretty phenomenal.

368
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:23,750
During a podcast recording in the spring of 2020, Chung floated a neologism that captures some of the institutional audacity DARPA is known for

369
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:32,260
It also relates to part of the draw for scientists and engineers like Chung, who have been the masterminds behind challenge based programs

370
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:39,551
Including most recently for Chung, the subterranean challenge known for short as Sub-T, that challenge was all about seating,

371
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:44,527
a research community that will be able to develop autonomous and robotic systems that work in

372
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:51,240
natural and human made underground settings for national defense missions and for humanitarian tasks such as

373
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,986
such as disaster response.

374
00:32:52,986 --> 00:32:55,510
I'd say one of the ways I describe DARPA

375
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,180
This was one of my colleagues had previously described the research this way

376
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,467
is there a lot of folks out there that might say some research is impossible

377
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:10,090
or some vision is impossible, and my colleague at the time said, actually, no

378
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,380
It's not impossible

379
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,420
It's rather it's unpossible, it's just that it hasn't been done yet

380
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,480
It's not that it can't be done

381
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,245
It just hasn't been done yet,

382
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:28,780
And I'd like to embrace that philosophy and everything that that I'd try to touch in the sense because it hadn't been done before is not proof that it can't be done

383
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,160
In fact, it's a challenge to say that maybe I'm the one who can who, who can do it

384
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:40,140
And DARPA really gives us both the tools and the inspiration and the kind of community

385
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:47,253
I'd say that both the support, but also my you know, program manager colleagues, when I see all the amazing things there

386
00:33:47,253 --> 00:33:55,669
making possible, it makes me think that the things that once might have been considered impossible or are simply just opportunities

387
00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:05,730
for Bruce draper, a program manager in the Information Innovation Office, one of the most exciting ways these provisional unpossibility Chung referred to unfolds

388
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:11,630
is the way a DARPA project can spawn entirely new and lasting fields of research and development

389
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:21,910
In a place like DARPA, you can create programs that help define the field and and create intellectual communities of people that are trying to tackle brand new problems, and that's an opportunity

390
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,140
It's something you can do it in DARPA

391
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,760
You just can't do anywhere else

392
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:38,610
That community building opportunity resonates with Sergey Bratus, an I2O program manager colleague of Drapers who came to the agency from academia and has been intent on recruiting performers from that sector into his cyber security programs

393
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:47,910
It has been behind several DARPA successes that I've experienced personally to define a new direction

394
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:55,486
define a new trend, and put some grand funding behind that trend in order to

395
00:34:55,486 --> 00:35:01,620
get academia to listen to well, this is the need you might be missing

396
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,640
This is the a cool thing that might

397
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:16,180
with time create its own first tier publication of venue of journals and conferences, and there, I believe DARPA has been greatly successful

398
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:24,020
And talk about things that have never been done before from 2016 to 2020, Mike Fiddy was a program manager in the Defense Sciences Office

399
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,253
Where he took on programs with goals as mind soaring

400
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:33,987
as extracting propulsive energy from quantum mechanical fluctuations inherent in space itself

401
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:37,483
in a discussion soon before he left the agency in June 2020,

402
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:42,356
Fiddy pointed out to me that the researchers, that is, the performers in DARPA speak

403
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:45,566
that program managers contract with to work on projects

404
00:35:45,566 --> 00:35:49,580
tend to feel that they are part of a team with crucial goals to achieve

405
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,790
And so they become motivated to perform not just for themselves

406
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,150
But really for the country

407
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:08,460
I think there's something special about DARPA in the eyes of our performers as well as those of us fortunate enough to work for the agency, I think that rapid turnover

408
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,978
that sense of urgency that very well organized structure DARPA has make

409
00:36:14,978 --> 00:36:22,994
performers feel that they engaged in something special when they get funded, and they want to give their best,

410
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:27,650
and I do see a lot of performers who put in um

411
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:33,104
really a lot of extra effort to make those deadlines, keep us informed,

412
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:40,013
stay on track, they understand that we're usually in an arrangement with them

413
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:44,141
where there's program managers were in regular contact and

414
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:52,120
wearing involved month by month, quarter by quarter with with what they're doing, and they don't want to disappoint

415
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,039
And they understand that the program has a goal and the goal was approved

416
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,833
for good reason because it's addressing

417
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:04,220
some need that the DoD has.

418
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,500
Air force lieutenant colonel c David Lewis is an African American program manager to get where he is

419
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:17,630
He had to overcome systemic racism and to seize those opportunities that did arise whenever and wherever they did

420
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,330
Because there's a phrase that we use in the air force all the time, and that is a bloom where you're planted, um

421
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,730
You know, of course, being in the military, we don't get to choose where we live all the time

422
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,060
We don't necessarily get to choose what assignment

423
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,952
we get assigned to, and so the phrase is to say that no matter where you are,

424
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:42,911
do the best that you can do because it's going to help out the country,

425
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:49,110
and you always have to be prepared for when opportunity knocks because you know opportunity

426
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:53,300
And my opinion shows up at everyone's door

427
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:58,625
The question is, what have you been doing to prepare for that opportunity, when it comes,

428
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:04,660
it took a lot of preparation pretty much, I think over my entire air force career up until that point

429
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,270
to be ready for this opportunity, and it's worked out thus far

430
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,301
Part of the opportunity, lieutenant colonel Lewis alludes(提及) to here has to do with the

431
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:17,166
privilege that program managers enjoy to devote taxpayer money,

432
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:21,756
a precious resource to tough and risky problems that are worth investing in

433
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:25,950
because of how much could be gained for the nation by the solutions to those problems

434
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,970
in late 2020 I spoke with program manager John Waterston

435
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,486
A former nuclear submarine crew member and now captain in the US Navy reserves,

436
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:40,980
he thinks of DARPA as something like a venture capital fund with a mission to further the cause of national security

437
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,880
I feel what we do at DARPA is being a venture capital fund, right?

438
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:54,355
We are a place where you can bring ideas and mature them so that they have the most impact going forward, so

439
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:57,670
at DARPA, we don't have excessive bureaucracy

440
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,250
We're able to move fast

441
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:06,254
We got this advantage, that everyone's motivated to succeed and good ideas that have the most impact,

442
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:09,140
and that that's what makes me excited every day that I come to work

443
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,670
It makes every day different, and those two things kind of keep me pushing you know

444
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,639
now for almost four years.

445
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,360
make that five years now in our podcast conversation

446
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:29,520
Waterstone pointed to yet another crucial ingredient of DARPA's unique success at conceiving of new technologies and capabilities and ushering them toward realization

447
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,350
That ingredient is an embrace of the valuable lessons that come from failure

448
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:41,290
I'm not judged on success of my progress, so I'm very comfortable operating with a lot of risk

449
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:47,840
I've had a lot of failures along the way as a PM at DARPA, forgotten rid of programs, things didn't succeed

450
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,250
They didn't fire me

451
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,600
What they did to say, what did we learn from it

452
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,330
And how do we make the next iteration of what we do better, it's often said to fail fast

453
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:04,462
And we take those losses, and we turn into something valuable and that, that what makes DARPA a very special place

454
00:40:04,462 --> 00:40:13,992
that celebration of risk taking and positive valuation of failure are also part of what BTO program manager Seth Cohen identifies as one of DARPA's most empowering traits

455
00:40:13,992 --> 00:40:22,520
and in a podcast episode we posted in February of last year, he noted with interest how other government agencies sometimes try to emulate the DARPA model

456
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,830
And so DARPA plays this very special role because it is known for being a cutting edge agency

457
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:36,140
It's known for pushing the boundaries, and and though our performers are highly qualified and highly skilled individuals, they don't

458
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,386
teams of individuals, rather, they don't necessarily have to have shown

459
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:47,280
that they can do this yet it's the latest and greatest in many ways can be the most riskiest research, and that's an important role

460
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,060
I think that DARPA fulfills is pushing that very cutting edge

461
00:40:51,060 --> 00:41:00,130
allowing people to take chances to try crazy ideas that are still grounded in good science and good concepts

462
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:06,139
but that might be outside the comfort zone of a lot of other parts of the federal government to fund,

463
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:11,652
and I think that's why you see, and this has been spoken about for many administrations now

464
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:14,350
other federal agencies trying to emulate DARPA.

465
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:21,440
Cohen told me he could not be more grateful for the opportunity to be part of an organization that others aim to emulate

466
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:29,190
I have to really say that DARPA has been, as many people told me, it would be one of the best places I could ever imagine working

467
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:38,800
It is a fascinating agency filled with incredibly, smart, motivated people who create an incredibly supportive work environment

468
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,780
So I'm very pleased to an honor to have been part of DARPA and to continue to be part of DARPA

469
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:53,980
Even though program managers at short timers have that hair on fire, urgency about doing their work, they also are working on hard problems with long time horizons

470
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,039
It's a disconnect that many of them, including Whitney Mason,

471
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,100
who was a program manager in the Microsystems Technology Office

472
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,381
actually fond to be tantalizing, something about contributing now to a return on investment

473
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:07,726
that will take decades to unfold

474
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:16,959
the thing that I think is the most amazing and the most impactful part about DARPA is

475
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,410
that I get to throw the dart(飞镖) really hard

476
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,790
I get to say I've done some research

477
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,990
I've talked to people, I think it's gonna work, but it might not, right?

478
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:37,730
Failing fast is an option if you learn something, and so you really get to explore the space of what might be impactful ten years from now

479
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,758
20 years from now, 30 years from now, as opposed to having to make sure that it works, which is

480
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:47,363
also a valuable job, but my technology doesn't have to work in two years,

481
00:42:47,363 --> 00:42:50,040
it doesn't have to go on a tank in two years.

482
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,460
It can be way out there and far reaching, and I think changed the world

483
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:58,875
I often heard from program managers during my podcast discussions that they

484
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:04,830
viewed DARPA as an ideal of technology innovation, yet it was an ideal that was real and operational

485
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,449
One of them is Gordon Keeler, a program manager since 2017 in MTO, where he

486
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:16,027
and colleagues are doing their darndest to keep the 70 year sprint of the microelectronics

487
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:19,950
microsystems technology revolutions going far into the future

488
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,190
This is what he told me.

489
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,180
I had no doubt really in my mind

490
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:30,776
DARPA was clearly the pinnacle of doing innovative scientific research and development

491
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:34,130
and leading the community to go do new things.

492
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,120
New things, indeed

493
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,550
That's DARPA's thing

494
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:43,460
And Keeler speaks for everyone else at the agency when he invites innovators out there to think about collaborating with DARPA

495
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:49,770
Good ideas come from everywhere, and you mentioned the limited tenure that we have at DARPA

496
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,795
We're always looking for new people, and so if you've got ideas,

497
00:43:53,795 --> 00:43:57,760
I care a lot about Optical Microsystem, so for sure, come see me

498
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,120
If you've got ideas in this area

499
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,290
But you know, ah, get involved, DARPA is not one person or one place

500
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,144
It's a collection of people that are excited about moving technology forward,

501
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:11,337
and so you know, maybe you want to be a program manager, maybe you want to work as a SETA

502
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:14,977
and maybe you want to be a performer and keep doing research search, but

503
00:44:14,977 --> 00:44:16,930
reach out and get involved with DARPA

504
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,380
You might say that DARPA director Stephanie Tompkins has gotten involved with the agency

505
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,700
She runs the place now, but her current position is just one of the four jobs she has had at DARPA

506
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,090
And she says the program manager position is one of the best

507
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,230
I've been extraordinarily lucky

508
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,920
To have so many different jobs at DARPA, i've been a program manager

509
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,540
I've had leadership roles in technology offices

510
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,980
I even served a year as the acting deputy director, and then I left DARPA

511
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,200
forever a few years ago or so, I thought, don't get me wrong

512
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,880
Getting a chance to come back and serve this organization as its director is a tremendous privilege

513
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:59,240
But the program manager is the center of DARPA, the PMs each and every one of them have a chance to change the world

514
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,010
And I can't think of any simpler way to put it

515
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,940
They come in with ideas that they think will make the nation more secure

516
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,080
They put together their plans and very quickly get an army of brilliant people working on these ideas

517
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,160
The rest of us at DARPA, our job

518
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,400
is just to support the program managers so they can get on with their jobs

519
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,100
of changing the world, it's just such an amazing place

520
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,020
I can't think of anywhere else I have ever been or ever heard of that works quite like this one

521
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,040
on with as much freedom

522
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,060
It's just extraordinary.

523
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,799
Thanks, listeners, for sharing this time with me and with

524
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:39,774
some of the program managers who have joined me over the past five years to capture

525
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:43,495
some of the psychological, sociological and cultural foundations, and that

526
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:47,241
underlie DARPA's exceptional place in the innovation ecosystem,

527
00:45:47,241 --> 00:45:50,631
I look forward to handing the voices of DARPA podcast off to my

528
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:54,650
colleagues in public affairs and hearing the innovative new ways

529
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,134
they are likely to take

530
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:58,124
so listeners goodbye for now,
