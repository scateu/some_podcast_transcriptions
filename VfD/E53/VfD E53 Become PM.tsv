EDL	00:00:20,220	00:00:31,310	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the cold war DARPA, the defense Advanced Research projects agency has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:31,310	00:00:31,940	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:00:31,940	00:00:40,660	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Welcome to voices from DARPA a window unto DARPA's core of program managers their job to redefine what is possible
* Last one
EDL	00:00:40,660	00:00:45,030	| VfD E53 Become PM |	My name is Ivan Amato, and I'm your DARPA host. For this episode
EDL	00:00:45,030	00:00:55,210	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The last one I will host, I decided to collect observations that program managers have shared with me and you listeners, since as they reflected on their time at the agency
EDL	00:00:55,210	00:01:01,860	| VfD E53 Become PM |	So many of them told me that the job was the best, most fun, most rewarding, most impacted job they had ever had
EDL	00:01:01,860	00:01:14,880	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Even though they knew from the start that they would only have the job for a few years, that's how DARPA rolls, you can get the dream job and bring your new blood to, but then you need to hand that dream job off to yet some newer blood

* Peter Hynum
EDL	00:01:16,320	00:01:18,870	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Let me start with the words of Peter Hynum
EDL	00:01:18,870	00:01:24,280	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The agency's deputy director, who in a previous Santa DARPA from 1999 to 2003
EDL	00:01:24,280	00:01:29,830	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Served as a program manager overseeing programs in electronic wrong fare and electronic communications
EDL	00:01:29,830	00:01:30,180	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:01:30,180	00:01:33,670	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I love the way he described the program manager's job to me back in June of 2020

EDL	00:01:33,670	00:01:34,880	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:01:34,880	00:01:39,070	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I don't have a program manager quite literally invents tomorrow
EDL	00:01:39,070	00:01:39,500	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:01:39,500	00:02:00,660	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The upward program managers have the leeway the authority to find the the best teams in the world to work on a particular problem, and then they have the authority and capabilities to drive to achieve the results that are of to them
EDL	00:02:00,660	00:02:09,400	| VfD E53 Become PM |	DARPA is a place where the program managers are the ones who really drive the ship, the office directors and the the front office
EDL	00:02:09,400	00:02:16,990	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Our job is to make it possible for them to do that to give them the tools and to help them achieve their goals
EDL	00:02:16,990	00:02:26,880	| VfD E53 Become PM |	A DARPA program manager blames a research problem with a plausibility story with a deep awareness and knowledge of the state of the art, and that problem idea
EDL	00:02:26,880	00:02:27,350	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:27,350	00:02:37,080	| VfD E53 Become PM |	A very careful idea with use cases and such as to why that problem is of great importance to national defence and to our military
EDL	00:02:37,080	00:02:37,510	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:37,510	00:02:46,390	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And then how it can be executed as a research program and then how progress will be measured and assessed, and then who will be who will benefit from the results
EDL	00:02:46,390	00:02:58,010	| VfD E53 Become PM |	How will those results transition into practice and again and again and again for 60 years now, DARPA program managers have set up programs, have run them
EDL	00:02:58,010	00:02:58,500	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:58,500	00:03:09,680	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And quite literally, that rigour, that passion that a program manager brings to the job will be saving lives 5 10 15 years from now

* Tyler McQuade
EDL	00:03:10,490	00:03:12,960	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I am particularly grateful to Tyler McQuade
EDL	00:03:12,960	00:03:31,200	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Who was a big ideas program manager in the agency's defense sciences office in September 2016, when he sat down with me in a studio on the 13th floor of DARPA headquarters in Arlington for my very first podcast recording, I wanted to start with Tyler because my aim was for the podcast to be accessible to a wide audience
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:33,042	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And I knew he would say things like this 
EDL	00:03:33,042	00:03:33,990	| VfD E53 Become PM |	a coconut
EDL	00:03:33,990	00:03:34,630	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:03:34,630	00:03:37,890	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It smells the way it does because a chemistry
EDL	00:03:37,890	00:03:38,380	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:03:38,380	00:03:51,400	| VfD E53 Become PM |	But he also revealed that tantalized, what if mentality that I would encounter over and over again throughout my podcast recordings with program managers or PMs, as they also are known, DARPA, is that one
EDL	00:03:51,400	00:03:52,270	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:03:52,270	00:03:53,660	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Place where
EDL	00:03:53,660	00:03:55,500	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We are thinking about
EDL	00:03:55,500	00:03:59,140	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Innovation unconstrained like, where can we go
EDL	00:03:59,140	00:04:00,070	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

EDL	00:04:00,070	00:04:02,550	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Yeah, that where can we go? 

* Dev Palmer
EDL	00:04:02,550	00:04:15,010	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That could be a tagline for DARPA, dev Palmer was another podcast guest earlier in the series at the time in late 2016, he was a program manager in the agency's Microsystems Technology Office or MTO
EDL	00:04:15,010	00:04:16,740	| VfD E53 Become PM |	He would leave DARPA the next year
EDL	00:04:16,740	00:04:25,120	| VfD E53 Become PM |	But in 2020 he came back as PM's also sometimes do to become MTO's current deputy director. Back in our podcast discussion
EDL	00:04:25,120	00:04:28,780	| VfD E53 Become PM |	He heaped a whole lot of love about working at DARPA

EDL	00:04:28,780	00:04:33,600	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Coming to DARPA is like grabbing the nose cone of a rocket and holding on for dear life
EDL	00:04:33,600	00:04:34,480	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:04:34,480	00:04:41,440	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's a fast moving place that has a significant impact on the trajectory of technology for the nation
EDL	00:04:41,440	00:04:41,800	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:41,800	00:04:51,090	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And being part of that is an incredible thrill, the idea that you can come up with a technical idea that's interesting to you
EDL	00:04:51,090	00:04:51,470	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:51,470	00:04:55,250	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And create a community to pursue that ideas
EDL	00:04:55,250	00:04:55,640	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:04:55,640	00:04:57,870	| VfD E53 Become PM |	is an experience you won't get anywhere else
EDL	00:04:57,870	00:05:02,347	| VfD E53 Become PM |	You can take flyer bets on crazy things like integrating magnetics with semiconductors, 
EDL	00:05:02,347	00:05:05,960	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and people will actually soldier up and tell you how they're gonna do it.
EDL	00:05:05,960	00:05:07,060	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]

* Beckstein
EDL	00:05:07,060	00:05:18,210	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Blake beckstein has followed a similar path to deaf Palmer's he too started out as a program manager in his case in in the biological technologies office, and later took on some management responsibilities
EDL	00:05:18,210	00:05:18,820	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:05:18,820	00:05:21,020	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I recorded him when he was still a newbie
EDL	00:05:21,020	00:05:26,816	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Blake has one of those gleams in his eye that makes anyone think this guy is going to do something amazing 

EDL	00:05:26,816	00:05:27,250	| VfD E53 Become PM |	after all
EDL	00:05:27,250	00:05:33,060	| VfD E53 Become PM |	One of his ambitions has been to protect nothing less than food supply from both natural and engineered threats
EDL	00:05:33,060	00:05:35,013	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Which is another way of saying biological warefare, 

** GUEST
EDL	00:05:35,013	00:05:38,250	| VfD E53 Become PM |	well, I came to DARPA because I saw a fantastic opportunity
EDL	00:05:38,250	00:05:46,050	| VfD E53 Become PM |	For my research community, the DARPA mission is unlike things that I've done in the past
EDL	00:05:46,050	00:05:50,100	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Because the dark emission is to look at high risk, high reward
EDL	00:05:50,100	00:05:57,533	| VfD E53 Become PM |	projects that could benefit humanity in a sort of that 20 to 50 year time frame, 
EDL	00:05:57,533	00:05:59,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and it also gives an opportunity to derest

EDL	00:05:59,790	00:06:00,520	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:06:00,520	00:06:03,650	| VfD E53 Become PM |	ah, some programs and some projects

EDL	00:06:03,650	00:06:07,270	| VfD E53 Become PM |	So that they can actually come to light and and see youth
EDL	00:06:07,270	00:06:07,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:06:07,790	00:06:11,280	| VfD E53 Become PM |	So when the opportunity to come to DARPA presented itself, 
EDL	00:06:11,280	00:06:15,817	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I thought it was just this awesome chance to do some really great science, 
EDL	00:06:15,817	00:06:21,930	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and I was encouraged because I was asked to think about things that traditionally weren't funded very well
EDL	00:06:21,930	00:06:22,230	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:06:22,230	00:06:28,970	| VfD E53 Become PM |	You know, the positive that can come out of this and the world changing abilities that we're gonna gain is incredible
EDL	00:06:28,970	00:06:30,000	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]

* Eber Furu
EDL	00:06:30,000	00:06:37,060	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Beckstein came into DARPA with an uncommon specialty and interest in agricultural biotechnology and food security for eber furu
EDL	00:06:37,060	00:06:46,550	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Who was a DARPA program manager from 2014 through 2018 in the agency's Defense Sciences Office, also brought in a unique mindset, and she was nervous about it
EDL	00:06:46,550	00:06:57,780	| VfD E53 Become PM |	She was skeptical about how a mathematician like herself would fit in in my podcast featuring Furu, which aired in March of 2017, I asked her what she thought she might be able to do at DARPA that she could not do elsewhere

** GUEST
EDL	00:06:57,780	00:06:58,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:06:58,790	00:07:02,030	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I say DARPA is probably the best place to be
EDL	00:07:02,030	00:07:07,785	| VfD E53 Become PM |	If you are an applied mathematician, in fact, I just say for if you're a mathematician 
EDL	00:07:07,785	00:07:13,462	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and I'd like to solve problems because one of the greatest thing about DARPA is that, 
EDL	00:07:13,462	00:07:21,363	| VfD E53 Become PM |	there is this wealth of information, wealth of problems that are important, 
EDL	00:07:21,363	00:07:24,470	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and I have to say they're very, very cool
EDL	00:07:24,470	00:07:25,950	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]

EDL	00:07:25,950	00:07:33,172	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The coolness factor for problems to solve for a mathematician here is enormous 
EDL	00:07:33,172	00:07:38,024	| VfD E53 Become PM |	because you feel that not only you're solving a problem that has importance, 
EDL	00:07:38,024	00:07:40,680	| VfD E53 Become PM |	they're certainly broader impact
EDL	00:07:40,680	00:07:45,938	| VfD E53 Become PM |	As far as you know, you're solving important problems in national security, 
EDL	00:07:45,938	00:07:50,574	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but you also feel like the problems are so rich that in some ways, 
EDL	00:07:50,574	00:07:56,940	| VfD E53 Become PM |	there is so much to contribute the richness of the problem is maybe the the biggest driver, 
EDL	00:07:56,940	00:08:01,300	| VfD E53 Become PM |	a motivating factor for anybody, certainly for a mathematician.

EDL	00:08:01,300	00:08:08,592	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And I just want to add, and I've been saying that to my friends to my colleagues, anybody who would listen 
EDL	00:08:08,592	00:08:16,090	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that why mathematics is actually very important to to DARPA and encourage them to become future program managers

EDL	00:08:16,090	00:08:24,380	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Is that when you're encountered by important problems and you see that your your ideas
EDL	00:08:24,380	00:08:30,320	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The role you have as a mathematician that not only you try to look at these particular problems, 
EDL	00:08:30,320	00:08:40,670	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but you try to abstract out and coming with different representation that would yield better solution for these problems, so you basically see that your ideas are at work
EDL	00:08:40,670	00:08:42,940	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I mean, what better satisfaction are there

EDL	00:08:42,940	00:08:43,620	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]

* Wege Shen
EDL	00:08:43,620	00:08:45,390	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Hear that mathematicians out there
EDL	00:08:45,390	00:09:04,490	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Don't forget about DARPA could be just the place for you wage shen, who's nearly five year stint as a program manager or APM for short ended in 2019, he reveled in the way DARPA embraces the most fundamental kind of scientific in an R&D continuum that can lead to the highest technologies of all, obviously
EDL	00:09:04,490	00:09:08,770	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Even within the US government, there are a number of organizations of fund basic research
EDL	00:09:08,770	00:09:09,070	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:09,070	00:09:14,470	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The fund applied research that fund various projects along that continuum
EDL	00:09:14,470	00:09:14,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:09:14,790	00:09:17,310	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And I think DARPA has a very unique role
EDL	00:09:17,310	00:09:23,230	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's it's a role that spans the gap between basic research and applied science
EDL	00:09:23,230	00:09:23,720	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:09:23,720	00:09:34,540	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Oftentimes, we're looking for the applications that seem impossible, whether it's, you know, launching ah drones off of flying aircraft or you know
EDL	00:09:34,540	00:09:44,820	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Detecting human trafficking online, all of these things are things that you know we're emerging capabilities 3 or 4 years ago, but now have proven to be possible
EDL	00:09:44,820	00:09:47,340	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And so DARPA's, in a very unique place that
EDL	00:09:47,340	00:09:59,095	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Allows us to push the technology beyond the theoretical stages to the point where we can actually see where the where the applications are going to be, 
EDL	00:09:59,095	00:10:02,730	| VfD E53 Become PM |	so we're not builders of the ultimate technology
EDL	00:10:02,730	00:10:08,245	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Right, and at the end of the day, we fund the research, and that research eventually becomes product types in other forms, 
EDL	00:10:08,245	00:10:18,855	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but if you look at the you know progression of robotics and self driving cars, all of those AI technologies were curated out of DARPA programs early on 
EDL	00:10:18,855	00:10:24,300	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and have subsequently you know a ten year horizon after that become productizeable
EDL	00:10:24,300	00:10:24,910	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:10:24,910	00:10:28,470	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The industry has been able to take it up, so we serve a very crucial role
EDL	00:10:28,470	00:10:30,930	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And the reason that we can serve that role is
EDL	00:10:30,930	00:10:35,360	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The program managers themselves, these folks come with the ideas
EDL	00:10:35,360	00:10:37,799	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And they can see the horizon 


* Jonathan Fouth
EDL	00:10:37,799	00:10:50,800	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Jonathan fouth, who from 2015 to 2019 brought interests in the social sciences and social psychology to DARPA as a program manager in the information innovation office expressed to me in the middle of his PM stint,
EDL	00:10:50,800	00:10:54,960	| VfD E53 Become PM |	a multifaceted enthusiasm for his temp job at the agency

EDL	00:10:54,960	00:10:57,700	| VfD E53 Become PM |	DARPA is such an amazing place that
EDL	00:10:57,700	00:10:59,670	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's hard when you're in 
EDL	00:10:59,670	00:11:00,130	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:11:08,610	00:11:12,700	| VfD E53 Become PM |	So for me, it was it was very natural to say, boy
EDL	00:11:12,700	00:11:14,210	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I could imagine at some point

EDL	00:11:50,050	00:11:54,880	| VfD E53 Become PM |	As you already have heard a PM job at DARPA is temporary three or 4 years
EDL	00:11:54,880	00:11:57,200	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Maybe 5 is typically what you get
EDL	00:11:57,200	00:12:02,580	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That's not job security, but it has been a catalyst for both individual and institutional achievement
EDL	00:12:02,580	00:12:04,410	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I wholeheartedly agree
EDL	00:12:04,410	00:12:15,020	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That one of the things that makes a successful organization, this idea of bringing pro managers in for a short amount of time get
EDL	00:12:15,020	00:12:21,500	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The work done that they envision getting done and then leave in order for new blood to come into the culture and into the organization

EDL	00:12:21,920	00:12:23,210	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's important

** HOST
EDL	00:12:23,210	00:12:30,250	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That's Scott Wierzbanowski of the Tactical Technology Office I recorded a podcast episode with him this past April
EDL	00:12:30,250	00:12:33,330	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Just a month before he finished his four year PM gig

** GUEST

EDL	00:12:33,330	00:12:39,820	| VfD E53 Become PM |	By understanding that you have a very limited time in a very special place like DARPA, it becomes your priority
EDL	00:12:39,820	00:12:40,240	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:40,240	00:12:49,590	| VfD E53 Become PM |	You focus all of your time and attention, day, night weekends on whatever these projects happens to be, it becomes a passion
EDL	00:12:49,590	00:12:57,396	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It becomes your life and you can do so for a 2 to 4 five year period, where this is everything that you're focused on, 
EDL	00:12:57,396	00:13:07,170	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but eventually human nature takes over, and eventually people either get burnt out or they no longer have newer ideas that needs to be brought to bear

EDL	00:13:07,170	00:13:14,420	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And that motivation isn't necessarily gone, but it is time for other people to come in with their new ideas

EDL	00:13:14,420	00:13:16,249	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And there's another new ones that happens too 
EDL	00:13:16,249	00:13:20,012	| VfD E53 Become PM |	you have a program and you work this program for a couple of years, 
EDL	00:13:20,012	00:13:22,505	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and you're focused on making it successful, 
EDL	00:13:22,505	00:13:25,168	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but sometimes a program manager can get biased(有偏见), 
EDL	00:13:25,168	00:13:29,420	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and by bringing in new blood or a new program manager into a particular case

EDL	00:13:29,420	00:13:36,254	| VfD E53 Become PM |	They may see in a different light and maybe able to make changes that the other program manager didn't wasn't aware of 
EDL	00:13:36,254	00:13:40,160	| VfD E53 Become PM |	or maybe just decided that it'd be better to go down a different path

EDL	00:13:40,160	00:13:43,763	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's a double edge sword, but I think in general doing so,
EDL	00:13:43,763	00:13:54,500	| VfD E53 Become PM |	we're bringing in new program managers into take care of programs that are ongoing as well as bringing their own in is really what makes us such a
EDL	00:13:54,500	00:13:55,798	| VfD E53 Become PM |	A great place to work 

* Peter Hynum
EDL	00:13:55,798	00:14:00,528	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Peter Hynum when he was serving as acting director of DARPA during part of 2020, 
EDL	00:14:00,528	00:14:06,720	| VfD E53 Become PM |	outlined what he thought were some of the most important institutional traits that made DARPA so successful

EDL	00:14:07,110	00:14:11,750	| VfD E53 Become PM |	One of them was that temporary nature of the program manager role, but there were others

** GUEST
EDL	00:14:11,750	00:14:21,980	| VfD E53 Become PM |	A DARPA or originally when it was upper back in 1958, somehow the framers the people who put this machine together
EDL	00:14:21,980	00:14:22,720	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:14:22,720	00:14:26,530	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Quite a few things, really, absolutely right
EDL	00:14:26,530	00:14:26,880	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:14:26,880	00:14:35,628	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And it's those my view, those those few things, but of an enabled DARPA to succeed over 60 years now 
EDL	00:14:35,628	00:14:40,920	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and delivering and and continuing to deliver and invent tomorrow for the department

EDL	00:14:41,720	00:14:47,890	| VfD E53 Become PM |	So the first of these three things is that to everybody who works on the technical side of DARPA 
EDL	00:14:47,890	00:14:49,990	| VfD E53 Become PM |	program managers, office directors
EDL	00:14:49,990	00:14:51,813	| VfD E53 Become PM |	front office folk. 
EDL	00:14:51,813	00:14:55,750	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We are all temporary by design, we we come
EDL	00:14:55,750	00:15:00,120	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We send we spent four years or so here and then we leave

EDL	00:15:00,120	00:15:01,530	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We come from industry
EDL	00:15:01,530	00:15:05,480	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We come from universities we come from elsewhere in the government
EDL	00:15:05,480	00:15:08,110	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We come from the the military services
EDL	00:15:08,110	00:15:13,660	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We do our job, we push hard and then we leave this one thing
EDL	00:15:13,660	00:15:14,060	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:15:14,060	00:15:21,140	| VfD E53 Become PM |	DARPA also is a project agency, so there are no standing activities
EDL	00:15:21,140	00:15:21,480	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:15:21,480	00:15:24,490	| VfD E53 Become PM |	DARPA is not always going to do X or Y
EDL	00:15:24,490	00:15:26,780	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's continuously changing
EDL	00:15:26,780	00:15:34,043	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I'd like to say that in some ways, DARPA is framed to catch the night guys or to be in it and to 
EDL	00:15:34,043	00:15:44,040	| VfD E53 Become PM |	drive to the next level, so it's in the zeitgeist(时代浪潮), and in some ways, it is that it captures it exactly, and that's what these two things enable us to do
EDL	00:15:44,040	00:15:44,480	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:15:44,480	00:15:50,271	| VfD E53 Become PM |	People, ephemeral people will temporarily and project based, 
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:53,670	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and then the third pieces, DARPA has no assets of its own
EDL	00:15:53,670	00:15:53,990	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:15:53,990	00:15:55,750	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We have no laboratories
EDL	00:15:55,750	00:15:59,599	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We have no test facilities, we have no factories, 
EDL	00:15:59,599	00:16:03,140	| VfD E53 Become PM |	so we don't have a standing army of anything, 
EDL	00:16:03,140	00:16:10,915	| VfD E53 Become PM |	so and it's perfectly framed as an institution to continuously track and drive and push 
EDL	00:16:10,915	00:16:17,000	| VfD E53 Become PM |	the frontiers of knowledge applied to problems at real interest and importance to the military

* Christopher Orlowski
EDL	00:16:17,630	00:16:25,511	| VfD E53 Become PM |	For major Christopher Orlowski, who was a program manager in the Tactical Technology Office when I spoke with him in the fall of 2017, 
EDL	00:16:25,511	00:16:32,809	| VfD E53 Become PM |	it was access to the collaborations it takes to move audacious ideas toward real technology that was special about the PM job
EDL	00:16:32,809	00:16:36,009	| VfD E53 Become PM |	the biggest thing I've learned since being a program manager is that 
EDL	00:16:36,009	00:16:39,210	| VfD E53 Become PM |	the innovation and collaboration is a team effort
EDL	00:16:39,210	00:16:40,100	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I don't do it by myself
EDL	00:16:40,100	00:16:43,724	| VfD E53 Become PM |	There's no way I could begin the fathom to manage all these programs 
EDL	00:16:43,724	00:16:45,245	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and all these efforts that are under by myself, 
EDL	00:16:45,245	00:16:50,891	| VfD E53 Become PM |	so I have a great team, a great support team that helps our technical experts in the field 
EDL	00:16:50,891	00:16:51,760	| VfD E53 Become PM |	in their fields
EDL	00:16:51,760	00:16:54,290	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And that ultimately, even us is not the ones that do it
EDL	00:16:54,290	00:17:01,989	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's the engineers and scientists at companies and universities and defense contractors that we fund 
EDL	00:17:01,989	00:17:06,856	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that are the ones that ultimately are gonna bend metal and write code, and they deliver these capabilities to war fighters, 
EDL	00:17:06,856	00:17:13,250	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but I can't forget the war fighters either, because their invaluable advice recommendations are also part of a loop
EDL	00:17:13,250	00:17:18,520	| VfD E53 Become PM |	So it's a collaborative ecosystem that results in the innovation that provides these new capabilities

EDL	00:18:12,380	00:18:16,835	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Advances in technology, advances in research that can help this dismission, 
EDL	00:18:16,835	00:18:21,881	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and clearly DARPA is at the forefront of all of these funding agencies on that particular direction, 
EDL	00:18:21,881	00:18:28,150	| VfD E53 Become PM |	so I was very, very intrigued and curious and interested in being part of this particular

EDL	00:18:40,242	00:18:43,980	| VfD E53 Become PM |	he had been pushing that goal in policy jobs in circles
EDL	00:18:43,980	00:18:49,740	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That's when he got a call from the then DSO director Jeff ling, who asked Matt if he wanted to come to DARPA

EDL	00:26:19,790	00:26:23,650	| VfD E53 Become PM |	But I needed to wait for the right time in my career.
EDL	00:26:23,650	00:26:27,950	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I wanted to be sure my son had graduated from college.
EDL	00:26:27,950	00:26:37,850	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I wanted to achieve certain milestones and also get some people in place at my old employer to make sure that the research could carry on, 
EDL	00:26:37,850	00:26:45,970	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and I also wanted to have the right set of ideas for programs I didn't want to show up and wander around for a year
EDL	00:26:45,970	00:26:51,556	| VfD E53 Become PM |	trying to come up with an idea for a program, so I had my little basket of program ideas, 
EDL	00:26:51,556	00:26:54,160	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and I came in the door, I was all excited.
EDL	00:26:54,160	00:27:02,090	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I started up and part of the reason for coming to DARPA is there's several neat things that DARPA program managers get to do
EDL	00:27:02,090	00:27:02,780	| VfD E53 Become PM |	One
EDL	00:27:02,780	00:27:07,938	| VfD E53 Become PM |	They get to talk with other people who are who are in the organization 
EDL	00:27:07,938	00:27:11,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and get their ideas and get them completely unfiltered.

EDL	00:27:11,790	00:27:17,550	| VfD E53 Become PM |	But the other one is you can tap into researchers all across the globe
EDL	00:27:17,550	00:27:22,830	| VfD E53 Become PM |	You call up and say, hi, I'm from DARPA, and I was wondering what you were thinking about something

EDL	00:27:31,270	00:27:33,860	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but you're sorry, when it's over.

EDL	00:27:47,956	00:27:53,194	| VfD E53 Become PM |	having that kind of access is the greatest entertainment I could ever hope for 
EDL	00:27:53,194	00:27:57,240	| VfD E53 Become PM |	the other big piece about this is you get to go see their labs

EDL	00:27:57,240	00:27:59,838	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And you got to go see stuff happening, 
EDL	00:27:59,838	00:28:06,900	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and as you can guess from being a pilot and from being a ham radio operator, I'd love to touch the technology

EDL	00:28:41,110	00:28:52,789	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We are given a lot of freedom with which to make decisions with which to resource efforts in order to produce research projects that are very near and dear to us
EDL	00:28:52,789	00:28:57,374	| VfD E53 Become PM |	There is a lot of I would dare to say that you know, program managers are 
EDL	00:28:57,374	00:29:02,890	| VfD E53 Become PM |	very personally invested in the the programs that they're responsible for, and so you know
EDL	00:29:02,890	00:29:13,310	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We have a tendency to take things personally because there is that degree of relationship that exists between the ideas, the problems we're trying to solve
EDL	00:29:13,310	00:29:18,642	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The reasons why we're trying to solve those problems and ultimately how the research is done, and I would

EDL	00:29:27,395	00:29:34,530	| VfD E53 Become PM |	all of this fantastic research and pushing at you know the boundaries of what is you know currently possible

EDL	00:29:34,530	00:29:40,816	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I would also say that it has been part of my experience that this is a profoundly collaborative agency 
EDL	00:29:40,816	00:29:48,798	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that I spend a substantial amount of time in very productive discussions with my colleagues 
EDL	00:29:48,798	00:29:55,540	| VfD E53 Become PM |	here at the agency, getting very different perspectives on a number of fundamental issues and questions
EDL	00:29:55,540	00:30:00,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	As well as the collaborations that I have both with the other government mental agencies

EDL	00:30:22,750	00:30:30,370	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that part of the job of a DARPA program manager is not just coming up with clever ideas and setting things in motion

EDL	00:30:46,923	00:30:50,144	| VfD E53 Become PM |	learn as much from success as we do from failure, and so 
EDL	00:30:50,144	00:30:55,001	| VfD E53 Become PM |	sometimes you just have to be mindful that and do your best to establish the 
EDL	00:30:55,001	00:31:04,450	| VfD E53 Become PM |	appropriate balance between things that are practically impossible for a reason versus things that are practically impossible just due to a

EDL	00:31:05,620	00:31:10,410	| VfD E53 Become PM |	talk to just about any program manager, and they will tell you that DARPA, as an institution, 
EDL	00:31:10,410	00:31:16,737	| VfD E53 Become PM |	has enough of a track record to claim it has a special sauce, a special institutional culture

EDL	00:31:22,770	00:31:26,610	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Here's how Tim Chung, a PM with the tactical technology office, puts it
EDL	00:31:26,610	00:31:27,120	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:31:27,120	00:31:31,830	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I definitely believe DARPA has a secret sauce that has continued to 
EDL	00:31:31,830	00:31:32,760	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:31:32,760	00:31:38,940	| VfD E53 Become PM |	been able to generate both the ideas, but also create and execute and realize those ideas

EDL	00:31:38,940	00:31:44,763	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I think on the one hand, certainly from the Tactical Technology Office from which I have, 
EDL	00:31:44,763	00:31:50,133	| VfD E53 Become PM |	we really love seeing technologies demonstrated, so systems being brought together 
EDL	00:31:50,133	00:31:54,568	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and realized in some sort of field tester demonstration, and I think that's one end 
EDL	00:31:54,568	00:32:00,680	| VfD E53 Become PM |	on the other hands we're interested in creating whole new, you know, foundations
EDL	00:32:00,680	00:32:04,060	| VfD E53 Become PM |	whole new areas of research that hadn't really been thought about.
EDL	00:32:04,060	00:32:09,840	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And I think that being able to expand that spectrum and do it in the context of, you know
EDL	00:32:09,840	00:32:15,230	| VfD E53 Become PM |	100 or so program managers across 300 programs is is pretty phenomenal.

** HOST
EDL	00:32:15,230	00:32:23,750	| VfD E53 Become PM |	During a podcast recording in the spring of 2020, Chung floated a neologism that captures some of the institutional audacity DARPA is known for
EDL	00:32:23,750	00:32:24,390	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:32:24,390	00:32:32,260	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It also relates to part of the draw for scientists and engineers like Chung, who have been the masterminds behind challenge based programs
EDL	00:32:32,260	00:32:39,551	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Including most recently for Chung, the subterranean challenge known for short as Sub-T, that challenge was all about seating, 
EDL	00:32:39,551	00:32:44,527	| VfD E53 Become PM |	a research community that will be able to develop autonomous and robotic systems that work in 
EDL	00:32:44,527	00:32:51,240	| VfD E53 Become PM |	natural and human made underground settings for national defense missions and for humanitarian tasks such as
EDL	00:32:51,240	00:32:52,986	| VfD E53 Become PM |	such as disaster response. 
EDL	00:32:52,986	00:32:55,510	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I'd say one of the ways I describe DARPA
EDL	00:32:55,510	00:33:00,180	| VfD E53 Become PM |	This was one of my colleagues had previously described the research this way
EDL	00:33:00,180	00:33:04,467	| VfD E53 Become PM |	is there a lot of folks out there that might say some research is impossible 
EDL	00:33:04,467	00:33:10,090	| VfD E53 Become PM |	or some vision is impossible, and my colleague at the time said, actually, no
EDL	00:33:10,090	00:33:11,380	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's not impossible
EDL	00:33:11,380	00:33:15,420	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's rather it's unpossible, it's just that it hasn't been done yet
EDL	00:33:15,420	00:33:17,480	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's not that it can't be done
EDL	00:33:17,480	00:33:19,245	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It just hasn't been done yet, 
EDL	00:33:19,245	00:33:28,780	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And I'd like to embrace that philosophy and everything that that I'd try to touch in the sense because it hadn't been done before is not proof that it can't be done
EDL	00:33:28,780	00:33:34,160	| VfD E53 Become PM |	In fact, it's a challenge to say that maybe I'm the one who can who, who can do it
EDL	00:33:34,160	00:33:40,140	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And DARPA really gives us both the tools and the inspiration and the kind of community
EDL	00:33:40,140	00:33:47,253	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I'd say that both the support, but also my you know, program manager colleagues, when I see all the amazing things there
EDL	00:33:47,253	00:33:55,669	| VfD E53 Become PM |	making possible, it makes me think that the things that once might have been considered impossible or are simply just opportunities 
* Bruce Draper
EDL	00:33:55,669	00:34:05,730	| VfD E53 Become PM |	for Bruce draper, a program manager in the Information Innovation Office, one of the most exciting ways these provisional unpossibility Chung referred to unfolds 
EDL	00:34:05,730	00:34:11,630	| VfD E53 Become PM |	is the way a DARPA project can spawn entirely new and lasting fields of research and development

EDL	00:34:11,630	00:34:21,910	| VfD E53 Become PM |	In a place like DARPA, you can create programs that help define the field and and create intellectual communities of people that are trying to tackle brand new problems, and that's an opportunity
EDL	00:34:21,910	00:34:23,140	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's something you can do it in DARPA
EDL	00:34:23,140	00:34:24,760	| VfD E53 Become PM |	You just can't do anywhere else

* Sergey Bratus
EDL	00:34:24,760	00:34:38,610	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That community building opportunity resonates with Sergey Bratus, an I2O program manager colleague of Drapers who came to the agency from academia and has been intent on recruiting performers from that sector into his cyber security programs
EDL	00:34:38,610	00:34:39,010	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:34:39,010	00:34:47,910	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It has been behind several DARPA successes that I've experienced personally to define a new direction

EDL	00:34:48,690	00:34:55,486	| VfD E53 Become PM |	define a new trend, and put some grand funding behind that trend in order to 
EDL	00:34:55,486	00:35:01,620	| VfD E53 Become PM |	get academia to listen to well, this is the need you might be missing
EDL	00:35:01,620	00:35:05,640	| VfD E53 Become PM |	This is the a cool thing that might
EDL	00:35:05,640	00:35:16,180	| VfD E53 Become PM |	with time create its own first tier publication of venue of journals and conferences, and there, I believe DARPA has been greatly successful

EDL	00:35:24,020	00:35:27,253	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Where he took on programs with goals as mind soaring 
EDL	00:35:27,253	00:35:33,987	| VfD E53 Become PM |	as extracting propulsive energy from quantum mechanical fluctuations inherent in space itself 
EDL	00:35:33,987	00:35:37,483	| VfD E53 Become PM |	in a discussion soon before he left the agency in June 2020, 
EDL	00:35:37,483	00:35:42,356	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Fiddy pointed out to me that the researchers, that is, the performers in DARPA speak 
EDL	00:35:42,356	00:35:45,566	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that program managers contract with to work on projects 
EDL	00:35:45,566	00:35:49,580	| VfD E53 Become PM |	tend to feel that they are part of a team with crucial goals to achieve

EDL	00:35:49,580	00:35:52,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And so they become motivated to perform not just for themselves
EDL	00:35:52,790	00:35:54,150	| VfD E53 Become PM |	But really for the country
EDL	00:35:54,150	00:35:54,670	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
** GUEST
EDL	00:35:54,670	00:36:08,460	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I think there's something special about DARPA in the eyes of our performers as well as those of us fortunate enough to work for the agency, I think that rapid turnover
EDL	00:36:08,460	00:36:14,978	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that sense of urgency that very well organized structure DARPA has make
EDL	00:36:14,978	00:36:22,994	| VfD E53 Become PM |	performers feel that they engaged in something special when they get funded, and they want to give their best, 
EDL	00:36:22,994	00:36:27,650	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and I do see a lot of performers who put in um
EDL	00:36:27,650	00:36:33,104	| VfD E53 Become PM |	really a lot of extra effort to make those deadlines, keep us informed, 
EDL	00:36:33,104	00:36:40,013	| VfD E53 Become PM |	stay on track, they understand that we're usually in an arrangement with them 
EDL	00:36:40,013	00:36:44,141	| VfD E53 Become PM |	where there's program managers were in regular contact and 
EDL	00:36:44,141	00:36:52,120	| VfD E53 Become PM |	wearing involved month by month, quarter by quarter with with what they're doing, and they don't want to disappoint
EDL	00:36:52,120	00:36:52,740	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:36:52,740	00:36:58,039	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And they understand that the program has a goal and the goal was approved 
EDL	00:36:58,039	00:37:00,833	| VfD E53 Become PM |	for good reason because it's addressing 
EDL	00:37:00,833	00:37:04,220	| VfD E53 Become PM |	some need that the DoD has.

EDL	00:37:05,150	00:37:10,500	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Air force lieutenant colonel c David Lewis is an African American program manager to get where he is
EDL	00:37:10,500	00:37:17,630	| VfD E53 Become PM |	He had to overcome systemic racism and to seize those opportunities that did arise whenever and wherever they did
EDL	00:37:17,630	00:37:18,720	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:25,330	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Because there's a phrase that we use in the air force all the time, and that is a bloom where you're planted, um
EDL	00:37:25,330	00:37:29,730	| VfD E53 Become PM |	You know, of course, being in the military, we don't get to choose where we live all the time
EDL	00:37:29,730	00:37:32,060	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We don't necessarily get to choose what assignment
EDL	00:37:32,060	00:37:32,580	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:37:32,580	00:37:37,952	| VfD E53 Become PM |	we get assigned to, and so the phrase is to say that no matter where you are, 
EDL	00:37:37,952	00:37:42,911	| VfD E53 Become PM |	do the best that you can do because it's going to help out the country, 
EDL	00:37:42,911	00:37:49,110	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and you always have to be prepared for when opportunity knocks because you know opportunity
EDL	00:37:49,110	00:37:53,300	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And my opinion shows up at everyone's door
EDL	00:37:53,300	00:37:58,625	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The question is, what have you been doing to prepare for that opportunity, when it comes, 
EDL	00:37:58,625	00:38:04,660	| VfD E53 Become PM |	it took a lot of preparation pretty much, I think over my entire air force career up until that point 
EDL	00:38:04,660	00:38:08,270	| VfD E53 Become PM |	to be ready for this opportunity, and it's worked out thus far
EDL	00:38:08,270	00:38:09,120	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:38:09,120	00:38:13,301	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Part of the opportunity, lieutenant colonel Lewis alludes(提及) to here has to do with the 
EDL	00:38:13,301	00:38:17,166	| VfD E53 Become PM |	privilege that program managers enjoy to devote taxpayer money, 
EDL	00:38:17,166	00:38:21,756	| VfD E53 Become PM |	a precious resource to tough and risky problems that are worth investing in 
EDL	00:38:21,756	00:38:25,950	| VfD E53 Become PM |	because of how much could be gained for the nation by the solutions to those problems 
* John Waterston

EDL	00:38:34,486	00:38:40,980	| VfD E53 Become PM |	he thinks of DARPA as something like a venture capital fund with a mission to further the cause of national security

EDL	00:38:41,600	00:38:46,880	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I feel what we do at DARPA is being a venture capital fund, right? 
EDL	00:38:46,880	00:38:54,355	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We are a place where you can bring ideas and mature them so that they have the most impact going forward, so
EDL	00:38:54,355	00:38:57,670	| VfD E53 Become PM |	at DARPA, we don't have excessive bureaucracy
EDL	00:38:57,670	00:38:59,250	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We're able to move fast
EDL	00:38:59,250	00:39:06,254	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We got this advantage, that everyone's motivated to succeed and good ideas that have the most impact, 
EDL	00:39:06,254	00:39:09,140	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and that that's what makes me excited every day that I come to work
EDL	00:39:09,140	00:39:14,670	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It makes every day different, and those two things kind of keep me pushing you know

EDL	00:39:20,360	00:39:29,520	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Waterstone pointed to yet another crucial ingredient of DARPA's unique success at conceiving of new technologies and capabilities and ushering them toward realization
EDL	00:39:29,520	00:39:34,350	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That ingredient is an embrace of the valuable lessons that come from failure

** GUEST
EDL	00:39:34,350	00:39:41,290	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I'm not judged on success of my progress, so I'm very comfortable operating with a lot of risk
EDL	00:39:41,290	00:39:47,840	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I've had a lot of failures along the way as a PM at DARPA, forgotten rid of programs, things didn't succeed
EDL	00:39:47,840	00:39:49,250	| VfD E53 Become PM |	They didn't fire me
EDL	00:39:49,250	00:39:51,600	| VfD E53 Become PM |	What they did to say, what did we learn from it
EDL	00:39:51,600	00:39:57,330	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And how do we make the next iteration of what we do better, it's often said to fail fast
EDL	00:39:57,330	00:40:04,462	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And we take those losses, and we turn into something valuable and that, that what makes DARPA a very special place 

* Seth
EDL	00:40:04,462	00:40:13,992	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that celebration of risk taking and positive valuation of failure are also part of what BTO program manager Seth Cohen identifies as one of DARPA's most empowering traits 
EDL	00:40:13,992	00:40:22,520	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and in a podcast episode we posted in February of last year, he noted with interest how other government agencies sometimes try to emulate the DARPA model
EDL	00:40:22,520	00:40:22,870	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]

EDL	00:40:22,870	00:40:27,830	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And so DARPA plays this very special role because it is known for being a cutting edge agency
EDL	00:40:27,830	00:40:36,140	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's known for pushing the boundaries, and and though our performers are highly qualified and highly skilled individuals, they don't
EDL	00:40:36,140	00:40:40,386	| VfD E53 Become PM |	teams of individuals, rather, they don't necessarily have to have shown 
EDL	00:40:40,386	00:40:47,280	| VfD E53 Become PM |	that they can do this yet it's the latest and greatest in many ways can be the most riskiest research, and that's an important role
EDL	00:40:47,280	00:40:51,060	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I think that DARPA fulfills is pushing that very cutting edge
EDL	00:40:51,060	00:41:00,130	| VfD E53 Become PM |	allowing people to take chances to try crazy ideas that are still grounded in good science and good concepts
EDL	00:41:00,130	00:41:06,139	| VfD E53 Become PM |	but that might be outside the comfort zone of a lot of other parts of the federal government to fund,
EDL	00:41:06,139	00:41:11,652	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and I think that's why you see, and this has been spoken about for many administrations now 
EDL	00:41:11,652	00:41:14,350	| VfD E53 Become PM |	other federal agencies trying to emulate DARPA.

EDL	00:41:38,800	00:41:43,780	| VfD E53 Become PM |	So I'm very pleased to an honor to have been part of DARPA and to continue to be part of DARPA

EDL	00:42:37,730	00:42:42,758	| VfD E53 Become PM |	20 years from now, 30 years from now, as opposed to having to make sure that it works, which is 
EDL	00:42:42,758	00:42:47,363	| VfD E53 Become PM |	also a valuable job, but my technology doesn't have to work in two years, 
EDL	00:42:47,363	00:42:50,040	| VfD E53 Become PM |	it doesn't have to go on a tank in two years.

EDL	00:42:50,040	00:42:54,460	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It can be way out there and far reaching, and I think changed the world

EDL	00:42:55,270	00:42:58,875	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I often heard from program managers during my podcast discussions that they 
EDL	00:42:58,875	00:43:04,830	| VfD E53 Become PM |	viewed DARPA as an ideal of technology innovation, yet it was an ideal that was real and operational
EDL	00:43:04,830	00:43:05,160	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:43:05,160	00:43:10,449	| VfD E53 Become PM |	One of them is Gordon Keeler, a program manager since 2017 in MTO, where he 
EDL	00:43:10,449	00:43:16,027	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and colleagues are doing their darndest to keep the 70 year sprint of the microelectronics 
EDL	00:43:16,027	00:43:19,950	| VfD E53 Become PM |	microsystems technology revolutions going far into the future
EDL	00:43:19,950	00:43:21,190	| VfD E53 Become PM |	This is what he told me.

EDL	00:43:21,190	00:43:23,180	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I had no doubt really in my mind
EDL	00:43:23,180	00:43:23,830	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:43:23,830	00:43:30,776	| VfD E53 Become PM |	DARPA was clearly the pinnacle of doing innovative scientific research and development 
EDL	00:43:30,776	00:43:34,130	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and leading the community to go do new things.
EDL	00:43:34,130	00:43:34,520	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]

EDL	00:43:34,520	00:43:36,120	| VfD E53 Become PM |	New things, indeed
EDL	00:43:36,120	00:43:37,550	| VfD E53 Become PM |	That's DARPA's thing

EDL	00:43:37,550	00:43:43,460	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And Keeler speaks for everyone else at the agency when he invites innovators out there to think about collaborating with DARPA
EDL	00:43:43,460	00:43:43,790	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:43:43,790	00:43:49,770	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Good ideas come from everywhere, and you mentioned the limited tenure that we have at DARPA
EDL	00:43:49,770	00:43:53,795	| VfD E53 Become PM |	We're always looking for new people, and so if you've got ideas, 
EDL	00:43:53,795	00:43:57,760	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I care a lot about Optical Microsystem, so for sure, come see me
EDL	00:43:57,760	00:43:59,120	| VfD E53 Become PM |	If you've got ideas in this area
EDL	00:43:59,120	00:44:03,290	| VfD E53 Become PM |	But you know, ah, get involved, DARPA is not one person or one place
EDL	00:44:03,290	00:44:07,144	| VfD E53 Become PM |	It's a collection of people that are excited about moving technology forward, 
EDL	00:44:07,144	00:44:11,337	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and so you know, maybe you want to be a program manager, maybe you want to work as a SETA 
EDL	00:44:11,337	00:44:14,977	| VfD E53 Become PM |	and maybe you want to be a performer and keep doing research search, but 
EDL	00:44:14,977	00:44:16,930	| VfD E53 Become PM |	reach out and get involved with DARPA

EDL	00:44:17,960	00:44:22,380	| VfD E53 Become PM |	You might say that DARPA director Stephanie Tompkins has gotten involved with the agency
EDL	00:44:22,380	00:44:27,700	| VfD E53 Become PM |	She runs the place now, but her current position is just one of the four jobs she has had at DARPA
EDL	00:44:27,700	00:44:31,090	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And she says the program manager position is one of the best

EDL	00:44:31,470	00:44:33,230	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I've been extraordinarily lucky
EDL	00:44:33,230	00:44:36,920	| VfD E53 Become PM |	To have so many different jobs at DARPA, i've been a program manager
EDL	00:44:36,920	00:44:39,540	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I've had leadership roles in technology offices
EDL	00:44:39,540	00:44:42,980	| VfD E53 Become PM |	I even served a year as the acting deputy director, and then I left DARPA
EDL	00:44:42,980	00:44:47,200	| VfD E53 Become PM |	forever a few years ago or so, I thought, don't get me wrong
EDL	00:44:47,200	00:44:51,880	| VfD E53 Become PM |	Getting a chance to come back and serve this organization as its director is a tremendous privilege

EDL	00:44:52,590	00:44:59,240	| VfD E53 Become PM |	But the program manager is the center of DARPA, the PMs each and every one of them have a chance to change the world
EDL	00:44:59,240	00:45:01,010	| VfD E53 Become PM |	And I can't think of any simpler way to put it
EDL	00:45:01,010	00:45:01,680	| VfD E53 Become PM |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:45:01,680	00:45:04,940	| VfD E53 Become PM |	They come in with ideas that they think will make the nation more secure

EDL	00:45:05,360	00:45:10,080	| VfD E53 Become PM |	They put together their plans and very quickly get an army of brilliant people working on these ideas

EDL	00:45:10,690	00:45:12,160	| VfD E53 Become PM |	The rest of us at DARPA, our job

Episode 53: So, You Want to Become a DARPA Program Manager?

2022-1-12 | 0:46:23 | Voices from DARPA |

In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, listeners will hear a “best
hits” medley(混杂) from program managers (PMs), who since 2016 have
chronicled(编年) in the podcast their joy, sense of accomplishment, scientific
stimulation, privilege to influence entire fields of research and development,
sense of mission as they further the cause of national defense and security,
fun, and, in short, the overall awesomeness of their jobs. Every program
manager arrives at DARPA with an expiration date on their badges. It’s a
short-term deal that constantly brings in new blood and is routinely cited as
part of DARPA’s “special sauce.” Those who become PMs know their jobs likely
will end three to five years after they start. Yet so many of them say there is
no better job and that they wouldn’t have it any other way. Their collective
message is that being a DARPA PM can be a dream job for just about any
scientist or engineer, whether they are only beginning to rev up their careers;
already making a name for their themselves in an academic, start-up, industry,
or government setting; or in search of a second-career to apply the experience
and wisdom they have accrued over previous decades of work. At the end of the
podcast, DARPA director and former program manager Stefanie Tompkins
encapsulates the collective message of the many DARPA voices in this episode:
“The program manager is the center of DARPA. The PMs, each and every one of
them, has a chance to change the world.”
