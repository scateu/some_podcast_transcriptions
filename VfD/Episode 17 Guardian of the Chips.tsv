EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And was the most wonderful accident
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:13,536	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Let's talk about that move you made that pivot into electrical
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:20,448	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And really electronic engineering as it turned out right so you can cuz you ended up going to IBM one of the most store
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:25,312	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Ohrid companies and organizations when it comes to certain the entire history of micro Electronics
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:30,688	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I just would be interested in hearing about the numerous hats that you did wear there and
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:32,736	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And what you learned about that
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:33,504	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Technology
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,784	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Timing is so much
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,344	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And at the time that I graduated college

EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:17,280	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The bipolar was very power-hungry
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:19,327	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the power was really limiting
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:19,839	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	How much you could do
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:21,887	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So when I first
EDL	00:04:21,887	00:04:22,655	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Entered
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:23,167	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The space

EDL	00:04:52,351	00:04:53,375	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Play Jeopardy
EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,655	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Quite a ride
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:04:57,983	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's two things about your experience there that fast they make
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,567	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	One is that you became part of that IBM team
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:07,967	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	With a bachelor's in electrical engineering right this was from Washington University in st. Louis and then you've got several
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:14,367	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Phds worth of Education while you were there because you don't have a Ph.D here Ivan I don't even have a masters
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:20,767	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Don't even have a masters but when I see you in action oh my gosh right it didn't clearly you got everything that that any of them
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:22,559	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Hyper educated people here have
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:23,839	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Are you learned it
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,631	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Kind of insult you in the in the industry
EDL	00:05:26,399	00:05:27,167	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	He was
EDL	00:05:27,167	00:05:28,703	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A matter of luck
EDL	00:05:29,215	00:05:29,727	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That
EDL	00:05:30,239	00:05:33,311	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	When I entered the field the industry was moving so fast
EDL	00:05:33,823	00:05:35,615	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That for me to take time away to
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:36,639	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To take time out
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:38,175	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To go for my graduate degree
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:39,711	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Was actually putting me behind
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:43,807	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because I was not getting to participate in all the game-changing
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:44,831	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	New process
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:46,111	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And Chip design
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:46,879	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Technology
EDL	00:05:46,879	00:05:47,647	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	She's at work
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:48,159	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Being produced
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,463	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So I did take a few graduate courses
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,535	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And at that point decided no I really want to
EDL	00:05:53,535	00:05:54,303	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Being on the
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:54,815	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The ground floor

EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:45,759	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So
EDL	00:06:46,783	00:06:48,575	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Clearly and thread parallel machines
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:52,927	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's simultaneous need for the same data in multiple locations
EDL	00:06:52,927	00:06:53,695	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	In microprocessor
EDL	00:06:54,463	00:06:55,231	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And at the time
EDL	00:06:55,743	00:06:57,279	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The notion was well let's keep
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:00,095	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Keep interrogating a memory over and over and
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,119	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Send its results
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,655	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To each of the separate place
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:03,679	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	This is where it might be needed
EDL	00:07:04,191	00:07:05,727	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The GPR
EDL	00:07:05,727	00:07:07,007	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The general purpose register
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:08,031	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Invention
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,079	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	How did I develop with her
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:10,847	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	13
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:14,175	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Allowed us to simultaneously access the same data
EDL	00:07:14,175	00:07:15,199	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And send it to
EDL	00:07:15,199	00:07:16,479	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Different locations
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:17,247	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	At the same time
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:18,527	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:22,367	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	It it found its way into a lot of very high performance
EDL	00:07:22,367	00:07:23,135	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Which computer application
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	If I was to this day
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,999	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And went when did you make this development and get this patent
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:33,119	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Early my career is one of one of my first one said sometime in the 80s
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:34,399	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Yes ladies
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:40,799	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Okay so let's not move to your dark adventure and another thing I really like to learn about from p.m.
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:43,359	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is the mechanism by which you ended up
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:43,871	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Getting here
EDL	00:07:44,383	00:07:50,015	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So some a program manager and office director at a conference
EDL	00:07:50,015	00:07:55,135	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Others just were in love with DARPA for years and years and they kind of made the initial
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,671	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I reach out
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:58,719	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	How how did you actually end up here
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:01,279	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So without going Kiki on you
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:04,351	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Over the 30 years that I was at IBM
EDL	00:08:04,863	00:08:06,911	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	This this happened about seven years ago
EDL	00:08:08,191	00:08:09,471	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	About 7 years ago
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,519	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	There was a
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,591	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I was involved course in the design and
EDL	00:08:14,591	00:08:15,615	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Fabrication
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,919	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	High performance
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,943	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Computing elements
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,479	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:22,527	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Became apparent there was a class
EDL	00:08:22,527	00:08:23,295	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Defects
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:24,319	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The class of failures
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,855	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That were
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:27,391	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Exquisitely difficult
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,159	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	2
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:28,927	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A diagnosis
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,999	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And a very difficult to image
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,047	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or to lie
EDL	00:08:34,047	00:08:34,815	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Try to Define
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:37,375	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But none the less they impacted yield BMP
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Performance
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:39,423	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And in some cases
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,727	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Even had the ability to change
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:42,495	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	What the
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:43,519	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Computer chip was supposed
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:48,639	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To do it so you're talking about defects that really go all the way down to sort of the
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:51,967	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Micron scale the transistor level element level
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:58,367	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Scale of of these chips right near exactly right and I am not smart enough to be a high-level Ark
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:08:59,391	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Architect I was very much
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:01,439	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A hardware engineer
EDL	00:09:01,439	00:09:03,743	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Very much about the hardware the physical design
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:10,655	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And Fabrication of the actual listener is just a vision of this I believe we're probably talking of
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:15,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	About defects that could be the size of like individual biological cells 50 microns across
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:16,287	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Even smaller
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,055	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Indeed
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,615	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Indeed and as technology scale
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:22,943	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The size of the defects that were vulnerable to also
EDL	00:09:22,943	00:09:23,711	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Continue
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,479	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shrink silk
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,503	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's essentially
EDL	00:09:25,503	00:09:26,271	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Beekeeper
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:27,807	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A very very clean environment
EDL	00:09:28,575	00:09:29,343	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:32,159	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	If you can clear to me that there was a class of defects
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,439	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That we were vulnerable
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,767	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Not just from a yield or functional point of view
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,815	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But that potentially someone malicious
EDL	00:09:38,815	00:09:41,119	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Could intentionally assert upon a process
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:43,167	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or a pond design
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,703	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	2
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,727	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Perhaps
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:47,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Compromise
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:51,615	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The component or its function or its reliability its lifetime
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,175	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Make a long story short I
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,455	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Became a
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,223	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Contractor
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:57,247	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Consultant to DARPA
EDL	00:09:57,759	00:10:01,087	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And Amethyst insulting era
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:06,463	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or phase of your intersection with our boys at 2 to begin to define the kinds of programs
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,999	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That you ultimately would end up
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,023	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Running
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:15,167	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	With the aim of addressing the concerns that you learned about when you're a type indeed initially it was
EDL	00:10:15,167	00:10:16,703	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To consult an existing program
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:18,239	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:18,751	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:21,567	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Became involved in actually doing things
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,847	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To computer chips
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,127	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And then
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:27,199	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The DARPA program would hire
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:29,247	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Reverse Engineers to try to find
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:30,527	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	What was done
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:32,575	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:33,855	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We continue to make progress
EDL	00:10:34,623	00:10:35,391	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	At both.
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:35,903	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Detecting
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:38,207	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Identifying those
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:41,279	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Those features which couldn't couldn't be detected
EDL	00:10:42,047	00:10:42,815	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:44,863	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	One thing led to another and after
EDL	00:10:45,631	00:10:48,703	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	After about a year of Consulting DARPA finally set one or two
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:49,471	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	You come to DARPA
EDL	00:10:49,471	00:10:51,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So I retired from IBM at that point
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Then came the dark
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:53,311	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To assume
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:56,127	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The swim Lane if you want to swim Wayne of
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,151	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Hardware store
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,199	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Right and released
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,015	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Three of your programs and the names of them really kind of
EDL	00:11:02,015	00:11:07,135	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Reflect just some of the goal that you have had in mind that I've been working toward
EDL	00:11:07,135	00:11:11,231	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Summer referring to trusted integrated circuits which is known as
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:13,023	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	In the short form is Trust
EDL	00:11:13,535	00:11:17,375	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Integrity and reliability of integrated circuits known as Iris
EDL	00:11:17,375	00:11:20,959	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the supply chain Hardware Integrity for electronics
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:21,727	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Defense
EDL	00:11:21,727	00:11:22,495	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Which
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:25,055	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is it known as short as Shield
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:29,663	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Each one has its own individual aspects but together there's a certain kind of theme
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,967	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I'm wondering if you can actually sort of talked about them
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:33,247	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Collectively
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,319	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And of course diving into each one as you might
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,111	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Feel so inclined indeed
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	God bless our warfighters
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,695	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	It is critical now
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:43,231	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	For us
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:44,255	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To make sure that
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:48,351	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Not just the mission is successful that that were protecting the warfighters
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:49,375	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Executing atmel
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:51,679	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Electronic components
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,471	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We used to support that mission
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:55,775	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Need to be
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:11:56,287	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Authentic
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:12:01,151	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We need to make sure that those parts do no more and no less than they're supposed to
EDL	00:12:01,151	00:12:04,479	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But they were built where they claim to be when they were claimed to be
EDL	00:12:04,479	00:12:07,551	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We have to make sure that they last for the full stated lifetime
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,599	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We have to make sure that
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:10,879	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	There is no
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:14,719	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Nothing done to that component during the supply chain during distribution
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,023	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But there are no Trojan horses
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:18,047	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or Easter eggs
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:19,839	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	If you will better built in
EDL	00:12:19,839	00:12:22,399	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And this is challenging right to rebuke because in the
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,215	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Creation of a chip in the fabrication of a chip
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:27,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's so many players
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:28,799	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's so many different places that
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:30,591	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And somebody can have your fingers on it
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,895	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That that you really need some way of tracking
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,919	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That's exactly right
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:35,711	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Once Upon a Time
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:38,527	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Chain of custody was a sufficient means
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,807	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Up tracking
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:42,111	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The authenticity and integrity of our component
EDL	00:12:42,879	00:12:44,415	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But micro-electronics
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,695	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Has indeed become global
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:49,023	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And right about the time that I warned DARPA
EDL	00:12:50,047	00:12:51,071	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That there could be
EDL	00:12:51,583	00:12:53,119	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	An issue in the space

EDL	00:13:33,055	00:13:34,335	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I'm reminded that
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:36,639	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's one thing to come up with a challenge
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:37,919	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But it's quite another
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:39,455	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To go

EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:16,063	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of mic electronic Component begins InDesign
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,599	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	It goes right through fabrication
EDL	00:14:18,111	00:14:22,207	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And then after fabrication and packaging it goes through distribution
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:24,255	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shield is a tagging
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:25,791	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shield

EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:34,751	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To be the correct part
EDL	00:14:34,751	00:14:38,847	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	For a number of reasons the existing authentication Technologies were
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:40,383	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Necessary but not
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:40,895	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Sufficient
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,711	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So Shield is a microscopic tagging
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:47,551	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We hope to get it into the world records here before we are all done
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:51,391	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But it is used to make sure that this is the part
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,695	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That we intended
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:54,975	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To go into

EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:43,359	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And so because that we have to talk to with RF physical contact is too small
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:43,871	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That's correct
EDL	00:15:44,895	00:15:46,431	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	V is

EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:35,071	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the TCP IP network address
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,351	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of where it was two
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:38,399	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	In this way
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:40,447	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	At least for the most
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:40,959	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Serious
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:43,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Over counter fit in phone threats
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:45,567	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We believe we have a very cost
EDL	00:16:45,567	00:16:46,079	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Effective solution
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:48,383	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The goal is to make sure that

EDL	00:16:50,687	00:16:51,199	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Becomes
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,735	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Too expensive
EDL	00:16:52,735	00:16:54,015	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	It takes too long
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:55,039	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	For the bad guy
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:59,391	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Right absolutely amazing description I mean this sounds to me like a bat
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:01,951	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The highest of high technology
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:04,767	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A certain length in the synthesis the way you're mixing and matching
EDL	00:17:04,767	00:17:09,119	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Different kinds of Technologies also is just to me one of the things that characterizes
EDL	00:17:09,119	00:17:15,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A lot of what's going on here at one thing I'm somewhat of a pain in the rear to my performers about
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:18,335	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because I'm just a knuckle-dragger hardware engineer
EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:19,615	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Everything we do
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,663	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	You have to be able to hold it in your hand
EDL	00:17:22,175	00:17:23,711	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And this is a program
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:30,111	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Especially this program where it's not rainbows coming out of keyboards are unicorns sleeping over Terminals and Magic
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:30,879	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Will happen
EDL	00:17:30,879	00:17:32,159	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	This has to be
EDL	00:17:32,159	00:17:32,927	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Deterministic
EDL	00:17:33,439	00:17:34,207	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Quantitative
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:37,279	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Very analytic real engineering
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,863	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And after the initial Technologies were developed
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:41,631	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shield
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:42,399	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is about
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:42,911	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Good engineer
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,703	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We've engineered
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:45,215	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A beautiful Prada
EDL	00:17:45,727	00:17:48,031	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	All right well since you're all about that kind of ground truthing
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,847	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Where are we at with the with this
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,407	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Program with these tiny little
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:55,455	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Triplets how would you characterize the status
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:17:58,015	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shield is a 3-phase program
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,831	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Phase one was to go develop
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,879	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Those five core Technologies
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,671	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because they really did not exist
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,463	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	At that scale all five
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,999	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Have been demonstrated to be
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:08,511	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Functional
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:12,607	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Phase two is the integration of those Technologies
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:13,887	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Into the shield
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:14,399	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Prototype
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,959	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Phase 3 of the program
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:18,239	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Which is the field test
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,799	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of Shield
EDL	00:18:20,799	00:18:21,823	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Will begin
EDL	00:18:21,823	00:18:23,359	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Early in 2018
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:25,151	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The field testing
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:27,455	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is supported by
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:32,575	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Some wonderful companies that we won't identify right now that have volunteered their supply chain
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,367	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And we will do things
EDL	00:18:34,367	00:18:35,391	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	What's the components
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,671	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Windshield attached
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:38,463	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And use their supply chains
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:41,279	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And we will see how effective Shield is
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:41,791	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	In Catching
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,863	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Hickory we talked about
EDL	00:18:44,863	00:18:45,631	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shield
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:51,775	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I do want to go back to to the other programs that you work on one of them is completed now and one of them is still in progress it was
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:55,103	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Start with trusted integrated circuits Trust
EDL	00:18:55,103	00:18:56,127	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I wish I believed
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,431	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Kind of one of the earliest programs YouTube
EDL	00:18:58,431	00:19:02,015	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Trust was the program that I actually began supporting before I enter
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,575	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Trust was a program
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:07,135	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To make sure that we could verify
EDL	00:19:07,135	00:19:10,975	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Set apart is doing no more and no less than it is supposed to do
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:13,791	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Trust was a large program
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,839	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Lots and lots of achievements
EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:17,375	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We developed microscopes
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:19,423	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We develop Solutions
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:23,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	For pulling netless if you will the schematic
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:23,775	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	From Chip
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,591	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To make sure that the schematic is what it's supposed to
EDL	00:19:27,103	00:19:28,895	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We look at both cots
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:30,431	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Commercial off-the-shelf product
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,991	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	As well as Gods parts
EDL	00:19:32,991	00:19:34,271	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Government-owned components
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:37,599	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We looked at field programmable gate arrays
EDL	00:19:38,111	00:19:39,647	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	As well as Asic
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:41,951	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The output of that program
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:44,511	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is installed in a number of agencies
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	All over the country
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:47,583	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And stopping Leverage
EDL	00:19:48,095	00:19:52,703	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Ready when you mentioned a 6in field programmable gate array names for
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:55,263	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Other kinds of categories of integrated circuits
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,055	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That have different capabilities
EDL	00:19:57,055	00:20:01,663	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	But all of which are used today and all of which we really need to feel very confident about is correct
EDL	00:20:01,663	00:20:03,455	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So that's trust in that completed
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:07,295	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A year or two ago when did that included
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:08,063	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	About
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:08,575	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	18 month
EDL	00:20:09,087	00:20:13,695	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So obviously there's parts of the spirit of that program that are part of Shield
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:18,559	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the other program I just wanted to say a little bit about this one continues
EDL	00:20:18,559	00:20:23,935	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Today and that's the integrity and reliability of integrated circuits program or Aires
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:26,751	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The question that Iris answered was
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:29,311	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	If indeed we know that this component
EDL	00:20:30,079	00:20:31,615	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Has not been compromised
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,383	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	In its function
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:35,711	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Can we still be assured that it has not been compromised
EDL	00:20:35,711	00:20:36,479	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And its integrity
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,783	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	How do we make sure with
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	With a low sample size
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:43,647	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That this component indeed fulfills
EDL	00:20:43,647	00:20:44,927	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Its lifetime spec
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,951	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Its reliability
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:48,767	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That it is up to the task
EDL	00:20:48,767	00:20:49,791	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	A performing
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:52,095	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	For $20,000 an hour
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:54,399	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or 100000 power in hours
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:55,935	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or whatever the spec is
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:57,727	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That mission that is critical
EDL	00:20:57,727	00:20:58,239	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	2
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,311	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To the defense
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:03,103	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That it's installed in
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:09,503	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Okay and this is to defend against such things as counterfeiting practicewear an old
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:14,111	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Call Chip might be taken out of some unit it might than the blacktop right where new kind of
EDL	00:21:14,111	00:21:20,256	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Packaging is put on with new printing looks new but in fact it's old and so might not be able to actually live
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,024	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Up to its
EDL	00:21:21,024	00:21:22,560	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Suspect that a user expects
EDL	00:21:22,560	00:21:23,584	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	That's correct Ivan
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,120	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Just like human beings age
EDL	00:21:25,632	00:21:26,656	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	In automobiles rust
EDL	00:21:27,424	00:21:29,472	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's a lifetime to electronic components
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:34,848	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The lifetime must be we depend on that lifetime when the Windows system
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:35,872	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is built
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	For that part to execute its function
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:41,504	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Even without the malicious intent
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,320	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	We need to know we need to be able to
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,856	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Very quickly assess
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:48,416	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The reliability
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:48,928	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of a part
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,208	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Concurrently
EDL	00:21:50,720	00:21:52,256	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	The reliability science
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,024	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is is a
EDL	00:21:53,024	00:21:54,304	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is very involved
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,328	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Painful
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,120	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Long-term
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:21:59,680	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And so
EDL	00:21:59,680	00:22:00,448	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Iris
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:01,216	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Looked
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To try to
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,032	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Improve the turnaround
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:05,312	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I'm the testing
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:05,824	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Reliability
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:10,176	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I want to move to a couple of other questions before we we close out
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:15,040	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	One of them is really I want you to reflect a little bit about micro Electronics
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:16,832	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	As a technology in your
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:19,904	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Roll your beer several decades roll in
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:26,048	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Pushing that technology forward and doing whatever you can to ensure the integrity and safety of it
EDL	00:22:26,048	00:22:29,888	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And you know with some programs even moving forward thinking about
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:34,752	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Next Generations of Mike electronic devices even in the nanoscale area
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:38,336	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	So so that we continue to have a
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,384	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Progressive technology micro Electronics
EDL	00:22:40,896	00:22:47,040	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	As you think about all of that me what excites you about this category of technology and Terry what
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:51,136	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I've been few months ago I had the
EDL	00:22:51,136	00:22:52,416	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Privilege of
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:56,256	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Spending a week with a 311th Fighter Squadron
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:57,792	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	At Holloman Air Force Base
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:22:58,560	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	In New Mexico
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:01,376	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And after spending a week of them sharing
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:02,400	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	With me
EDL	00:23:02,400	00:23:03,168	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	What they do
EDL	00:23:03,680	00:23:05,984	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	I have the opportunity at the end of that week
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,752	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To describe
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,032	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	To them what I do
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:09,312	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And that's when it hit me
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,408	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	My son is training to be an A-10
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,688	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Fighter pilot

EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,296	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And when I
EDL	00:23:19,296	00:23:20,832	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Got in front of the audience
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:21,856	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	They all look like Mikey
EDL	00:23:22,368	00:23:22,880	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	Y'all look like
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:24,416	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	My son
EDL	00:23:25,184	00:23:26,208	| Episode 17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I'm retarded
