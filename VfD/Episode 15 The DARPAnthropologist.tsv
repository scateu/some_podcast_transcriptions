EDL	00:02:12,864	00:02:19,264	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So let's start off by talking about how you became interested in science in general and more specifically in the social science
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,592	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And even more particularly in cultural anthropology

EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:44,608	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	As you pointed out being the
EDL	00:02:45,376	00:02:46,400	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Set a primary driver there
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:48,448	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Realization quickly that 13 year olds are not the same ever

EDL	00:02:54,336	00:02:55,616	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Rules change
EDL	00:02:55,616	00:02:57,664	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well you start figuring out first ball
EDL	00:02:57,664	00:02:58,688	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That the world does Andre differ
EDL	00:02:59,712	00:03:02,272	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But that that is not an attractive
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:04,320	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Boundary that you can actually understand what the world
EDL	00:03:05,856	00:03:06,880	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In some cases
EDL	00:03:06,880	00:03:08,672	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	If your 13 and a new school you have to
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:09,184	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Survival
EDL	00:03:09,952	00:03:12,256	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In other cases it's really to Dalton with your benefits
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,048	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Did you understand how

EDL	00:03:18,144	00:03:22,240	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So even at the age of 13 you were we were observing cultural differences and
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:28,384	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Evidently you brought that into your program when you got into college well right the social sciences
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:29,920	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Swath of of disciplines
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:33,504	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And I'm fairly as a
EDL	00:03:33,504	00:03:34,272	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Is Regina.
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:37,856	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But I wouldn't anthropology specifically I think because it was obvious
EDL	00:03:38,368	00:03:41,696	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That anthropology allows you to come to be a practitioner of all trades
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:43,232	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Caressa master of none
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,280	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But you touched every facet

EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:48,352	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:51,424	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You can't do as apology if you don't also understand something
EDL	00:03:51,424	00:03:52,192	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	About economics

EDL	00:03:55,520	00:03:58,080	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And what I was particularly focused on which was identity
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:03:59,872	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The concept of identity
EDL	00:03:59,872	00:04:01,664	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I think really is what distinguishes
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:06,016	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Humans human social behavior from other natural
EDL	00:04:06,016	00:04:06,528	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Physical sciences
EDL	00:04:07,296	00:04:10,368	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Identity is a very rich and complex idea
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:16,256	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I mean they're all kinds of identities that that we can assume I want you to talk a little bit about identity I know that
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:20,351	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	When you were at Oxford that your dissertation really focused on the subject
EDL	00:04:21,119	00:04:22,399	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right well so I was
EDL	00:04:22,399	00:04:23,935	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Focus on what
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:26,495	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I was described by thinking in some areas of crisis
EDL	00:04:28,287	00:04:30,079	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And let me give you a little context

EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:05,407	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And as I said that genitti's that we have and share
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:10,015	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Develop and just wait when you say collected fictions just to be clear because I think of
EDL	00:05:10,015	00:05:14,111	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Of Economics for example as a real thing but when you said when you use the language
EDL	00:05:14,111	00:05:15,391	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	A collective fiction just
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,415	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Explain that for a listener
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:19,487	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well it's the great term from Harare who wrote
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:23,839	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Sapiens and I think he's right that our species competitive Advantage is our ability to sort of

EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,519	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	As you can see
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,055	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Genesis the challenge
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:36,639	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That we want to model sort of financial crises
EDL	00:05:36,639	00:05:37,919	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The crashes as

EDL	00:05:40,735	00:05:42,271	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What kind of top models from physics
EDL	00:05:43,807	00:05:45,599	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The problem is
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:49,951	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Is that by virtue of action modeling a phenomenon you can lead people to believe
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,975	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That it could occur
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,791	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So you actually created the phenomenon you were trying to stand the first
EDL	00:05:54,559	00:05:55,839	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Show
EDL	00:05:55,839	00:05:56,607	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That that

EDL	00:06:01,983	00:06:04,287	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And we've all that way to do that because there is great power
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:05,567	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We all believe in kind of this
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:07,103	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Efficient

EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:24,735	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well you just give me an excuse to ask you a question, based on some prior discussions we've had things I've heard you say witches
EDL	00:09:25,247	00:09:28,319	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That social science is harder than say physics
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:33,439	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Which I love the idea and I think you've got a good
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:34,207	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Argument which is
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:35,743	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well 80
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:37,279	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It's not my arm

EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,967	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Summarizes nicely I think
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,783	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Open question
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:00,575	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That I'm actually trying to tackle here at
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:04,927	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Through couple programs potentially more and ideally with
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:06,207	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It was support for
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:10,559	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	A future part of managers interest in this area and we will get to those in particular later
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:15,935	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You know you can tell the difference between the billions of dollars
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:17,215	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Time invested in physics
EDL	00:10:17,727	00:10:22,591	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And the probably Millions if not billions of hours of intellectual labor compared to weapon of essence social
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:25,663	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Are we at the stage where we just need better tools
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:28,735	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Do understand these things like identities that done amateur play
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:31,039	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Or we about to discover that wow this is really a dick
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,087	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	This is the stuff I sort of
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,159	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Standard scientific approach
EDL	00:10:36,159	00:10:38,463	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We need to think about this in new ways
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:39,231	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Is because
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:40,767	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	There are these are wicked problems waiting for
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,303	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	One of which is
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,839	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You change the very system you're studying
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:47,679	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I'm so so that's an open question but I do think right now
EDL	00:10:47,679	00:10:49,215	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I would I would say is harder
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:52,543	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The weather that's always the case with it's a function of we just haven't
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:54,847	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The tools whether it's a function the subject matter itself
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:58,431	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I think it is like I said no one question and one that
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:00,991	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I think really we need to understand from
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,503	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Even a National City
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:05,087	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right well and one of the things DARPA
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,647	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It is charged with doing is not only
EDL	00:11:08,159	00:11:10,463	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Doing R&D that that's sort of
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:13,279	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Specify begins to determine what is
EDL	00:11:13,279	00:11:14,303	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Possible
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:20,191	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But also to get a handle on what are fundamental constraints and limitations so
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:24,799	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And that's actually an exciting kind of space of uncertainty to be in
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:28,383	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We're going to move into into a sort of a DARPA segments here in a second but
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,943	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But before we move away from your
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:33,247	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Schooling in your
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:39,391	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Time-It Oxford I just want to ask you about your your rugby career in your rugby experience because I think in some ways
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:44,255	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Your experience in that social and cultural context
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:45,535	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Has informed
EDL	00:11:45,535	00:11:50,911	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Some of the questions that you asking and the way you go about thinking about cultural anthropology and now
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:52,191	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In
EDL	00:11:52,191	00:11:53,471	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The kind of DARPA
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:57,311	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	National Security contact so talk to me about you know rugby and how informed why you think now
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:12:00,895	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Interesting I probably haven't reflected enough upon that
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,199	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Did they give you an intelligent answer
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,015	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That's right that's right
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:11,391	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	There's a selection bias problem perhaps in that did I choose rob you to drive you choose me
EDL	00:12:11,391	00:12:13,439	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I'm not a natural athlete by any means but I
EDL	00:12:13,951	00:12:14,975	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	For some reason to
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:16,511	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Cookwell for sport and I think part of it is
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:19,327	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Because it is such an inherently social
EDL	00:12:19,327	00:12:20,351	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It really is a team Orange
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:21,631	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	40 degrees
EDL	00:12:24,703	00:12:26,239	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Level up

EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:31,871	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Is room for everybody in rugby
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Seems to be
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,479	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Chili good at building character
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,015	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I'm in
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:38,527	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Scar tissue
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:43,903	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But but but I character part I think is tested on a regular basis both
EDL	00:12:43,903	00:12:45,695	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Against other teams but also even with your own.
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:49,279	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I became really interested in the imponderable
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,327	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	As I
EDL	00:12:52,607	00:12:54,655	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Describe these things like cohesion and teamwork
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:57,215	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Leaving frankly Beyond identity commitment
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,543	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	These things are clearly important that clearly impact
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:01,311	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The real world
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,871	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Even in areas where we have Simple Rules like rugby
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,919	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Humble that are really hard to measure
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:07,711	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:10,527	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And remain at this point almost kind of like a match
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:13,599	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And we look to the best coaches
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:16,159	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Greybull to sell some of this magic and produce
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:19,743	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	My performances from teams that really help a person I've gotten there
EDL	00:13:19,743	00:13:20,767	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And likewise

EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,607	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Where you to have the best Superstars and they just don't seem to

EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:28,703	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That's where his remains like I said kind of this
EDL	00:13:29,215	00:13:30,239	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Imponderable
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,031	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The area of

EDL	00:14:01,983	00:14:08,383	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Think about you what is it what is that magic is you call which maybe is something discernible and something that you want kids
EDL	00:14:08,383	00:14:11,711	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That will take a group of individuals a team
EDL	00:14:11,711	00:14:14,783	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And have this team achieve collectively
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:19,647	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Human Feats that are often absolutely astounding so
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:25,791	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I don't want to talk too much about that now but it just said that you kind of Cadillac that thought will
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:29,119	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It's an ectopic this is an example where I think

EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:35,007	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Because there's a lot of literature on team
EDL	00:14:35,775	00:14:37,567	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But I guess you woke in the literature
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,639	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Deathly reflects Duncan Watts

EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:56,767	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Actually this is part of my frustrations when you turned it to where
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,047	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Presumably they would have the answer
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:14:59,583	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Is it magic resist
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,631	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	There's very little

EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:14,687	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What can I draw from the social science literature
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,199	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It helped me
EDL	00:15:16,479	00:15:17,247	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	There's not a lot
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:20,575	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right now that I would consider be reliable or bus enough
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:22,623	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Really help me dry Ford
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:25,695	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Does it have to be that way or their way so we can improve
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,487	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The research itself so that I
EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,023	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	As Commander at leader

EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	To really get
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,887	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The other most
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Out of out of
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:41,311	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We're trying to do okay well I can tell that you're hinting about something that will talk about you just didn't in the very near future but I want to move
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:44,639	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Move our two men scrum here toward DARPA
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:46,431	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How did you actually
EDL	00:15:47,199	00:15:52,319	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What was the sequence of events where you met somebody to talk to somebody scene
EDL	00:15:52,831	00:15:53,599	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	There's always
EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:57,183	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How did I get my job story soap
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:01,535	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well I'm so don't you drive me to the rugby choose me did I choose. About to drop it to me
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,095	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can say, in this case DARPA and chooses you
EDL	00:16:05,887	00:16:07,423	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So I was
EDL	00:16:07,423	00:16:08,447	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Fortunoff I think
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,727	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Tube having been in
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,007	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	As you mentioned
EDL	00:16:11,007	00:16:13,567	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I've been moving in the circle of
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:16,127	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We are program managers and this Advanced research area for
EDL	00:16:16,127	00:16:16,895	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	National Security
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,431	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And I think
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:22,271	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Getting to know some folks who have done work both it was in DARPA and for DARPA
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:24,319	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It's hard not to swear to be effective
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:26,111	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	To realize that
EDL	00:16:26,623	00:16:27,647	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	They really do want to walk
EDL	00:16:28,159	00:16:29,951	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	They're willing to take these chances
EDL	00:16:30,719	00:16:31,743	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Risk Investments
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:33,279	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That another
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,559	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The areas might be
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:35,327	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Be considered
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:40,703	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You know given what I said earlier about you know the difference between the amount of money and time spent on face
EDL	00:16:40,703	00:16:41,727	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social science
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:43,263	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	If there's agency that can actually
EDL	00:16:44,031	00:16:47,103	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Make-out we've been three five years over the 20 years we might need a normally
EDL	00:16:47,615	00:16:49,151	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How you know doctor did nothing
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,943	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well how do you how do you not say that
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:54,015	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So have you made a couple of connections with
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:59,391	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Within the building and then also have been called in by some leadership I think really understood
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,671	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:01,951	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But he's a really important question
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:05,535	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Coordination cooperation competition ultimately
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:07,071	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Every national security question
EDL	00:17:07,071	00:17:08,351	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We really care about
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:10,399	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Has some fundamental human
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:11,935	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social and behavioral aspects to it
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,471	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:18,079	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	UFC referees my order comments about the state of the literature and they sent to which you can really inform
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,359	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Are solutions this problem
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:21,407	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	They realize I think and I
EDL	00:17:23,199	00:17:24,223	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Things might be changing
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,831	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Culturally with a new emphasis on reproducibility
EDL	00:17:28,831	00:17:30,111	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And transparency in the science
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:32,415	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Ultimately I hope
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Improve the quality of
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,463	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Kelso 10
EDL	00:17:34,975	00:17:37,791	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So technologically we now have capabilities to
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:39,071	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You run experiments scales whenever
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,887	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We have the ability to analyze
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,679	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	New complex weight
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:44,447	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We have the ability to
EDL	00:17:44,447	00:17:45,471	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Pre-register stop
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:47,007	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That is where I announce my study publicly
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,543	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Joe Alves
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,079	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Almost community peer-review
EDL	00:17:50,591	00:17:53,407	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So we're reinvesting Andre investigating
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,455	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Regular does conventional models
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:59,551	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	DARPA leadership realize okay maybe now is the time
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,599	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	To take that risk Estep and see if
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:02,879	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Bring that science
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,951	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Okay perfect time then just to just just
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,999	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Talk a little bit about each of your program
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:11,071	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What's what start with the first program that you managed to
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:14,911	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Get through the difficult wedding and approval process your
EDL	00:18:14,911	00:18:19,519	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Referring to the Next Generation social sciences program which
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:23,359	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Is pretty transparent about what you're trying to do with 2nd generation
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,383	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Next Generation
EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:26,175	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social site transparent in just
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:29,759	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The most surface sort of way so what do you actually mean by that
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:33,599	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right so we're trying to accomplish two
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,879	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I would say probably insanely ambitious
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:36,671	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But that's that's what we do here
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:40,255	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The first is were trying to get after
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:41,791	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Experimental
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:45,119	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Those imponderables as emergent phenomena we were referring to Earl
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The things like
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:46,911	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Quite the vagina
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,447	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How does the me
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,519	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Yoga by the other selves to the me becomes the
EDL	00:18:52,287	00:18:53,823	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What's most important
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:56,127	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	For that serve emergent Behavior
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:56,895	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:00,735	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We know we have lots of case studies with lots of people who serve observe this in the world
EDL	00:19:00,735	00:19:04,063	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But we don't have his experimental evidence to begin to test
EDL	00:19:04,063	00:19:05,087	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	These different mechanism
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,879	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So we're trying to Leverage
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,927	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What we think are advances now technology
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,719	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Detectorpro out that experimental
EDL	00:19:11,743	00:19:13,791	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In the process and this is the second bowl
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:17,631	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We're trying to do it so that we can have greater confidence in the reproducibility of the war
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,703	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	All the way from
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:21,983	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Testing multiple models
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:26,079	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Rather than being married to a single model that I will then try to prove is true I'm actually
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:28,383	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Actually trying to figure out which models are
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,407	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	More effective than others
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,711	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And again these would be models about what
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:32,991	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	About Industries Collective identity
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,807	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So there's lots of literature about what leaves
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:36,831	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I made a bunch of the week
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,623	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Will they all make
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,695	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In many cases they make very different predictions
EDL	00:19:41,695	00:19:42,975	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Under similar conditions
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:44,255	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	If you can actually get the models
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:45,791	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That's another
EDL	00:19:46,559	00:19:47,839	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	His many social science model
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:48,863	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Apples are so
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:51,423	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That is almost impossible to say what they would predict but
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:58,335	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Prediction predictability is a Hallmark of what we might consider going to the hard Sciences
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:04,735	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You come up with the theory and if you can predict when Halley's Comet is going to come back around then you say hey I
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:05,503	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I've made it
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:06,015	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I'm approaching
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:12,927	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I think that's true and I and I and I think there's another side that witches if you make prediction in your wrong at least you know that how wrong
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,463	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	When you are and that's how you make
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:14,975	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Improvements
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:19,071	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But you never make that prediction or you engage in a practice
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:19,839	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Parking
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:24,191	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Which is a hypothesizing after the results are known in this is very common if you if you
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:27,775	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Collect your data and you analyze them and nobody ever knows what
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:29,311	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Question was you rash in the first place
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,591	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can always go back
EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:32,895	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And claimed I was looking for the answer I found the first
EDL	00:20:33,407	00:20:34,175	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Republic
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:38,271	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And then rationally reconstruct a plausible story that makes sense of what you think
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:40,063	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	An n in social science in particular
EDL	00:20:40,575	00:20:44,927	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It's hard to come up with a scenario in which no matter what answer you find you can't come up
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,231	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	With a post-hoc story that makes sense
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:50,303	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	No matter what I find in any experiment in social science the most part
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:53,631	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can go back in time and tell a plausible story is that well why that's obvious
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:56,191	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That is a real problem
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:59,775	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Okay so if we get utopian for a minute and you succeed wildly
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:05,407	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In this insane Ambitions of actually coming up with next-generation social science
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,431	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What will social science
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,479	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Will be reminded again
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:13,343	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social sciences Awards live brush but if we
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:14,879	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Extrapolate from what word
EDL	00:21:14,879	00:21:16,159	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The question we're asking right now.
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,464	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Extended to other questions
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:21,536	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Things like
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,560	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Deterrence and cooperation
EDL	00:21:23,072	00:21:23,840	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Competition
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:25,888	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The process to me would look very similar
EDL	00:21:25,888	00:21:26,656	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Which is
EDL	00:21:26,656	00:21:29,216	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	People will be mining the literature that already exists
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:30,496	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	To come up with different models
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:31,776	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That make predictions
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:35,360	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Not just sort of qualitative descriptions of how the woman
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:36,384	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Where's my predictions
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:37,408	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But then can be
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,944	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Tested empirically
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,480	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In experiments
EDL	00:21:40,480	00:21:41,760	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	1/10 scale if necessary
EDL	00:21:42,272	00:21:43,296	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That are transparent
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:44,320	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Better
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,856	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Queer
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,880	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That are pre-registered
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:48,928	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And that also
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,696	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Are replicated
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:53,024	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So the replication process is really important
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:58,400	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Especially with you social systems because the answer you get the next time around won't be the same the world that will have changed
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,216	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The participants will change the behavior will change
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:05,312	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But if you don't do that your process if you don't replicate you won't know
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:07,104	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	When your model begins to fail when it doesn't
EDL	00:22:07,616	00:22:09,408	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And incentives right now
EDL	00:22:09,408	00:22:12,480	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Frankly in many ways are just to get published
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:13,248	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	As opposed to getting a ride
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:15,808	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We are trying to figure out how to close those inside
EDL	00:22:16,320	00:22:17,088	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So that
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:18,880	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Getting it right Altima is what gets you pumped
EDL	00:22:19,648	00:22:25,024	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So you are running another program that really sounds relevant to what you're talking about right now the ground truth
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:28,352	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Program and the name of that really fascinates me because
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:29,632	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The first time I ran
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:31,680	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Across that term
EDL	00:22:31,680	00:22:35,776	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I actually was related to satellite remote-sensing of
EDL	00:22:35,776	00:22:42,176	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The snowpack in need what would happen if there's natural herb status briefly the Earth emits snatcher microwave
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:43,712	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Radiation it goes through
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:48,320	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Snowpack this is the signals can be picked up by sensors on satellites
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,624	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And then with a model
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:52,928	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The satellite then can
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:55,232	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Convert those raw signals into
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:23:00,096	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Some measure of exactly what the snowpack is and that's important information for
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:04,192	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Example farmers who are going to need to know how much snow is going to be coming up nearby mountains
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:08,288	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Toast but input in order to be confident about the model
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:11,360	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	People would go on the ground in their snow boots with
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:14,432	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Long rulers and actually measure the depth
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:16,480	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I'm in and that way
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:19,040	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Could you validate that the models were
EDL	00:23:19,040	00:23:22,880	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We're working well so in this context ground-truth and in in social science
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:24,416	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:27,488	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So this is a question I think you can only ask you to place a DARPA
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,280	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So we will
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,048	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We do not have
EDL	00:23:30,560	00:23:31,584	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That kind of grouchy
EDL	00:23:32,352	00:23:33,376	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:34,912	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Partly because
EDL	00:23:35,424	00:23:37,728	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The very measures we take from the very beginning of making assumptions
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:39,008	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That were measuring
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:41,312	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We can't see the things we really care about so we have to use it
EDL	00:23:42,336	00:23:43,360	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Inside of Hope
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,640	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That were caption constructs
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:46,944	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:49,760	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We actually have very little idea how Acura
EDL	00:23:53,856	00:23:54,368	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We are crew
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:57,952	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In this question fundamental imitation
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:23:59,744	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Accurate we actually alter webe
EDL	00:24:00,256	00:24:01,536	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	When faced with these complex
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,072	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Systems
EDL	00:24:03,072	00:24:03,840	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	My social behavior
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,888	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	DARPA
EDL	00:24:05,888	00:24:08,704	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Has given me the chance to serve in Port that question will be
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:09,472	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And say okay
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,800	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We have these amazing advances in Social stimuli
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:15,104	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How to give you have you talked to John about
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:17,152	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Upper GI Joe is very interested in this
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:22,016	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	There's enormous advances agent-based modeling that allow you to
EDL	00:24:22,016	00:24:24,832	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Run lots of little agents and see how they interact
EDL	00:24:24,832	00:24:25,344	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The Crazies
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:30,208	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Emergent and very complex behaviors from fairly simple rules and by agents you mean
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:34,304	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	He could be people doing things people doing things in this case
EDL	00:24:34,304	00:24:36,096	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Lil Wayne Avatar that I have
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,376	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Rules
EDL	00:24:37,376	00:24:39,168	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Those avatars in a rack of my computer
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:43,008	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I am because my computer now holds his enormous amount of computational power
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,800	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can really start scaling this up I can start
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,360	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Simulating behaviors on
EDL	00:24:48,128	00:24:50,944	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	On the scale and some cases of of Nations and International
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:52,992	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Interactions
EDL	00:24:54,272	00:24:57,344	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right now our approaches we use a simulation to try to understand the real one
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:24:59,392	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We are asked the question well
EDL	00:24:59,392	00:25:00,928	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What if we put that on hold for a moment
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:03,744	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And I using simulations instead as a wind tunnel
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,792	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right almost that ice pack
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:07,840	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So that I have causal truth
EDL	00:25:07,840	00:25:08,352	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Or ground
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:11,168	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You know I grew this
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,192	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Alternate world
EDL	00:25:12,192	00:25:13,216	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Which I'm seeing
EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:13,984	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social behavior
EDL	00:25:15,008	00:25:17,568	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What is so complex
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:20,128	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Now I give that as a wind tunnel
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:20,896	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	2
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:21,920	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social science
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:23,712	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social scientist and other
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:25,504	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Other areas so researchers
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,552	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And ask them can you give me
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:31,648	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Using your meth is your best approaches can you tell me what causing the behavior
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:36,000	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Can you predict what's going to happen in this simulation when something happens like a resource dries up
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:38,560	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And can you also may help us understand what are the
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,328	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The framers
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:41,376	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Their most important in the behaviors
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How close can you actually get
EDL	00:25:42,912	00:25:43,424	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What happened
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:44,960	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Mentos is a couple
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:48,288	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	1 which tools are most appropriate for which kind of socially complex
EDL	00:25:48,800	00:25:49,568	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Questions
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,104	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	To what
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:55,200	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What if any are there theoretical limitations of being able to understand and predict
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:56,224	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And that's really important
EDL	00:25:56,736	00:25:59,040	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Hey you people talk about what why do you want to know what you can
EDL	00:26:00,064	00:26:03,392	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well am I spring certainly within National Security
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:07,744	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Dude in particular very comfortable with risk they have to make decisions
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:09,536	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Under incomplete information
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:12,864	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Why do you want to figure out what you can't know how is that useful
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,400	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:16,192	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That gives you the boundary
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:16,960	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Of
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:17,984	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What you can plan for
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,520	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And if you know for
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:21,824	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I see both
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:24,128	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	4 facts that you can't know something
EDL	00:26:24,128	00:26:25,152	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	If you can plan for that too
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:27,200	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It's a much different planning price
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,992	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But that's really important
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:33,344	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And again at DMV in particular constantly has to operate in
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,880	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Highly uncertain environment
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,160	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But being able to say
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,184	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Yes sir or mam
EDL	00:26:37,952	00:26:41,280	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	This is a dynamic this is a situation that we cannot predict what's going to happen next
EDL	00:26:42,048	00:26:43,072	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You can plan accordingly
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:44,864	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That's very different from
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:47,168	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Believing you know what's going to happen
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:48,448	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Being inaccurate
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:50,240	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But being very confident and that leads to bad
EDL	00:26:51,520	00:26:57,152	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You can't bear it Universe any idea to kind of be a World creator where you can control that world
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:04,064	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Throwing in a very certain situations how does social behavior unfold in the simulated environment and hopeful
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:09,696	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We learn something that you can take out of the box the computer box in the NFL plaid to the test for the real world that we live in
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,720	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Breathin
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:17,376	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I want to just talk about one more program is actually not a program it's it is a preliminary phase of what could become a program
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:22,496	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I would show you sent out is what we call insert government speak a request
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:25,312	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	For information and that is an RFI about
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:32,224	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	About this particular request for information I was looking at the possibility
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:34,272	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Of using semi-automated
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:35,552	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Rules to give us
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,856	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Calibrate the confidence we can have
EDL	00:27:38,368	00:27:40,672	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In the social Behavioral Science research that already exists
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,768	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How we can do social science going into
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:49,632	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Ground rules that program is for looking at how how effective we can actually be
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,936	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Even if we're wild lyrics
EDL	00:27:52,448	00:27:53,216	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And in developing
EDL	00:27:54,496	00:27:56,288	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	This our request information
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:28:02,432	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Is an analogy that there's tremendous amount of literature and research has been done I'm questions that you know DOD National Security care
EDL	00:28:03,456	00:28:06,528	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We just don't know how much confidence we should have
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,808	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In some of those claims and models
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:12,672	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And that's best exemplified by the recent reproducibility project
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,000	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I was a different
EDL	00:28:16,000	00:28:16,768	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Research
EDL	00:28:16,768	00:28:19,328	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Scientists Center for open science has the most
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,096	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Famous
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,888	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Before that where they actually took
EDL	00:28:21,888	00:28:24,192	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Canonical studies in Psychology the replicated
EDL	00:28:24,192	00:28:25,472	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And they did not all rap
EDL	00:28:25,472	00:28:27,264	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	In fact more often. They did not Rebel
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,800	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And it's
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:32,640	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Yeah there's lots of renting of clothes and gnashing of teeth that have this happen
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:38,784	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Well part of it is working the great name for this to write for the crisis of reproducibility
EDL	00:28:38,784	00:28:41,088	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Now it is and it's not just by the way social sign
EDL	00:28:41,600	00:28:42,624	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:46,976	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But part of it while part of it is because the science is hard part is also stems from
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:50,560	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	These these requests will research Praxis
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:52,096	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That are invited by
EDL	00:28:52,864	00:28:53,888	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Import centers
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:55,936	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Some cases just
EDL	00:28:55,936	00:29:01,312	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Enormous degrees of freedom that is if I'm given a large dataset there many things I can do with those data
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,104	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And if I'm
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,944	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Only going to publish positive results don't be surprised when I only tell you about the positive result
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:10,784	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	This is our natural human reaction it's not that people are malicious or nest
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,296	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Play faking data
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:13,856	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	This is just a result of housing Centerline
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:16,416	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And yet much of the research is solid
EDL	00:29:16,928	00:29:18,464	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Right mid there many things
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:21,024	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You can soar Bank on if you're building a model about humans
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:22,304	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Behavioral Services
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,840	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We just don't know how to disentangle them
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:28,704	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Answer the question of race is asking are there new ways of putting together Pratt weak signal
EDL	00:29:30,496	00:29:33,312	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Inherent to a study or article me the stats are off a little bit
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:34,848	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The perfect
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:35,872	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Has the study been replica
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,176	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Has been tested on more than one population
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:41,504	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You know has anyone I should bother to reproduce the results
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:45,344	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And then I think increasingly there these other signals that we haven't
EDL	00:29:45,344	00:29:46,624	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Historically been able to
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,672	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Things like discussions and social media
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:52,000	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Social media in some cases actually an open peer review process
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:55,584	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You will get some more controversial Studies have come out reason
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:58,144	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I think you know the discussions have occurred
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:01,216	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Informative
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:03,520	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Yes I'm that is is ad hominem attacks
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:09,920	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Subjective discussion about the tapping into the wisdom of the crowd absolutely
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,200	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The hard part is
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:13,504	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You know the crowd is very busy
EDL	00:30:14,784	00:30:16,064	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How do we
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:16,832	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Better Weber
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,880	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Those that do signals
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:20,672	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	How to make them
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:23,488	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So that if if it is successful
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,768	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I see two outcomes one is
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:28,608	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can more more easily more rapidly more confidently
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,656	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Where is the normal filter for the story out there
EDL	00:30:31,168	00:30:34,240	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Second is frankly crate almost kind of a road map
EDL	00:30:34,752	00:30:37,568	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	So that if I'm a young researcher or I'm a program manager
EDL	00:30:37,568	00:30:38,080	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Funny research
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:39,872	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can look at
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:40,896	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Des algorithm
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:41,664	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Or this credits
EDL	00:30:42,176	00:30:42,688	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	For lack of a better term
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,528	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And I know how I can improve confidence in my research
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:49,600	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can look at the things that matter for increasing confidence
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:50,368	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And I can
EDL	00:30:50,368	00:30:51,136	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can do the right thing
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:52,416	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can replicate my stuff
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,208	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can make my data available
EDL	00:30:54,208	00:30:55,744	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Independent party
EDL	00:30:56,256	00:30:57,536	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I can test it on multiple
EDL	00:30:58,304	00:31:01,120	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You know I can't I can be transparent about my analyses
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,656	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Where they working where they didn't etcetera
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:09,568	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Gauging you in this conversation it also is occurring to me there's another reason why
EDL	00:31:09,568	00:31:15,968	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Bringing social science into the DARPA portfolio was so important it's just it's because of the way the vulnerability landscape
EDL	00:31:15,968	00:31:18,784	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The risk and threat landscape has been changing its so much
EDL	00:31:18,784	00:31:20,576	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	There's so many more
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:24,928	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Kinds of risks that are inherently in that social
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:31,328	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Behavior and cultural Behavior space I'm just thinking about the wild wild place of the internet and how
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,632	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Identities are made and created
EDL	00:31:33,632	00:31:35,936	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	And manipulated in in that
EDL	00:31:35,936	00:31:37,984	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Global environment so
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:41,056	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Maybe just before we close out
EDL	00:31:41,056	00:31:46,944	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Talk to me a little bit about that in with respect to the kinds of efforts you're making your
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:50,272	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	It doesn't take long to talk to any driver
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:51,040	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Peugeot manager
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	4
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,832	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	They begin to
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,624	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Bringing this discussion you did
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:56,672	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Of the social complexity no matter what platform
EDL	00:31:57,184	00:31:58,720	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	No matter what technology
EDL	00:31:58,720	00:31:59,488	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Software developer
EDL	00:32:00,768	00:32:03,328	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You pull that string a little bit and it leads quickly to
EDL	00:32:03,840	00:32:04,608	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	This
EDL	00:32:04,608	00:32:05,888	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Threat landscape as you said
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:07,168	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That's right landscape sometimes it's
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:08,704	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Just not even understand
EDL	00:32:11,520	00:32:13,312	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	What should I think
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:14,848	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	This is Mario
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:15,616	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Frankly we have to go
EDL	00:32:16,384	00:32:18,944	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	To be in to get a better sense of those questions
EDL	00:32:18,944	00:32:19,712	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Erased
EDL	00:32:19,712	00:32:20,480	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	I think
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,272	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	You know we should be excited
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:24,064	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	About our new capability
EDL	00:32:24,576	00:32:25,344	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We can use
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:25,856	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	To try to get there
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,648	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	We should remain humble
EDL	00:32:27,648	00:32:29,696	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	As weak as you go forward though
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,488	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Daddy Riggins are magic rotation
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,792	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But I but I do think
EDL	00:32:33,792	00:32:35,328	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	But if I do nothing other
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:36,352	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	With my time at DARPA
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:38,656	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	The idea that we can use these tools
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:43,264	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Did the re-engage and try to get after that social complexity
EDL	00:32:43,264	00:32:44,288	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	That it has something
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,312	| Episode 15 The DARPAnthropologist |	Contribute to National
