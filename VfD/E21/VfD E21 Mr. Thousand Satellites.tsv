EDL	00:00:11,570	00:00:20,014	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Stealth technology, the Internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation 
EDL	00:00:20,014	00:00:22,482	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Technology is a driver of our times 
EDL	00:00:22,482	00:00:30,520	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	since its founding in 1958, in the midst of the cold war, DARPA, the defence advanced research projects agency, has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:31,680	00:00:40,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA a window onto DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:40,600	00:00:43,250	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	My name is, Ivan Amato, I'm your DARPA host
EDL	00:00:43,250	00:00:47,495	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio Mr. Paul Thomas, 
EDL	00:00:47,495	00:00:53,093	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	known since his day one as "Rusty", because he arrived in the world with red hair. 
EDL	00:00:53,093	00:00:59,825	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Since september 2017, Rusty has been a program manager in the agency's tactical technology office, 
EDL	00:00:59,825	00:01:06,830	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	which has a penchant (爱好) for pursuing audacious vehicular technologies for the air, space and oceanic domains
EDL	00:01:06,830	00:01:20,257	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Already, Rusty has made his mission at DARPA to do what he can to develop new concept that will deliver more resilience, global reach and network connectivity, by way of new space systems
EDL	00:01:20,257	00:01:31,560	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Rusty, join DARPA from DAQRI, an augmented reality services company, even though it does like a cocktail where he served as the executive vice president for global operations
EDL	00:01:31,560	00:01:37,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	He also held positions in a slew of commercial space companies, among them SpaceX as orbital scientist, 
EDL	00:01:37,410	00:01:45,339	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	he has been in on the design and management of an amazing portfolio of space related programs, including the SpaceX dragon spacecraft, 
EDL	00:01:45,339	00:01:58,169	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the DARPA micro satellite technology experiment, or MiTex, the Iridium Low Earth Orbit satellite constellation and the US air force geo synchronous space situational awareness program
EDL	00:01:58,169	00:02:01,836	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	His initial training for all of this came in the form of a master science degree 
EDL	00:02:01,836	00:02:04,907	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and aerospace engineering from the University of Texas, Austin, 
EDL	00:02:04,907	00:02:13,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and a bachelor of scientific degree in astronautical engineering from Purdue University after I say, wow, let me say to you
EDL	00:02:13,320	00:02:16,501	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Paul "rusty" Thomas, welcome to the Voices from DARPA studio, 
EDL	00:02:16,501	00:02:18,160	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Thanks, Ivan. It's great to be here today.
EDL	00:02:18,160	00:02:18,906	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Thank you for having me. 

EDL	00:02:18,906	00:02:23,810	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Before we get started on your life adventure, on the forefront of space technology
EDL	00:02:23,810	00:02:28,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I want to let listeners in on something that will not come through in your voice or words
EDL	00:02:29,040	00:02:32,910	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	At six feet, eight inches tall, you are among the tallest
EDL	00:02:32,910	00:02:36,490	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	people at DARPA, though we are markedly not even the tallest
EDL	00:02:36,490	00:02:42,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It does make me wonder though, how you managed to fit into those thin shell when you were on the Purdue crew team
EDL	00:02:42,430	00:02:51,700	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And if your fuel costs, when you fly your own Piper Dakota plane are higher than it would be if a 5'8" guy like me were the pilot. 
EDL	00:02:51,700	00:02:55,840	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Well, yeah, so it does cause me a lot of pain on airplanes these days
EDL	00:02:55,840	00:02:56,875	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That is, that is true.
EDL	00:02:56,875	00:03:04,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But I'll tell you, being tall was great I grew up in Indiana and I learned to play basketball for some reasons, I was kind of good at it because of that
EDL	00:03:04,100	00:03:08,170	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So being 6 feet is a good thing over all, and I'll take it. 
EDL	00:03:08,170	00:03:13,391	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	All right, well, one of the things I always want to hear from program managers who are with me in the studio is 
EDL	00:03:13,391	00:03:15,700	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	where they got their start
EDL	00:03:15,700	00:03:20,347	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And where the interest came from in science, engineering and technologies.
EDL	00:03:20,347	00:03:22,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So I would put that question to you. 

EDL	00:03:22,590	00:03:24,720	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay yeah, great, when I'm an aerospace engineer
EDL	00:03:24,720	00:03:32,673	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	as you said, and like a lot of aerospace engineers, growing up in the 70s, early 80s, really saw what NASA was doing. My grade school had
EDL	00:03:32,673	00:03:37,440	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	has special readers where you can go and see the history of what NASA done even back in 60s
EDL	00:03:37,440	00:03:41,170	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I remember what was the point over those in great detail when I was a kid.
EDL	00:03:41,170	00:03:45,873	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But the real kick for me became a career day that my schools have been made great, 
EDL	00:03:45,873	00:03:50,049	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	where they actually pulled my father in, and I realized my dad, mechanical engineer 
EDL	00:03:50,049	00:03:53,817	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and his grandfather, his, my grandfather, his father, a civil engineer, 
EDL	00:03:53,817	00:03:56,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	had been doing some pretty interesting things are entire career, 
EDL	00:03:56,850	00:04:02,414	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and they were staying on the cutting edge of of what was going on my dad's work for General Electric in the plastic industry 
EDL	00:04:02,414	00:04:04,497	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	when that was getting big in the 60s and 70s, 
EDL	00:04:04,497	00:04:08,890	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and my grandfather worked for northwest and put in all the air fields
EDL	00:04:08,890	00:04:16,607	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And when they are doing the Orient, pacific routes through the, through the 40s and 50s, he also helped design the LaGuardia Airport, 
EDL	00:04:16,607	00:04:21,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so had two generations of engineer behind me and at that career day
EDL	00:04:22,390	00:04:25,311	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I actually have my dad was one of the people presenting, 
EDL	00:04:25,311	00:04:28,222	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and he walked through the different types of engineering, 
EDL	00:04:28,222	00:04:29,790	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and at the bottom of a list was aero space.
EDL	00:04:29,790	00:04:33,694	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I did not know that was an option and all of a sudden clicked for me
EDL	00:04:33,694	00:04:37,154	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that aerospace engineering is something I could do, 
EDL	00:04:37,154	00:04:42,939	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and I could focus on it and continue on and do what I thought my dad was doing in terms of, in terms of really innovative 
EDL	00:04:42,939	00:04:45,960	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	things and in new concepts that could be set forward

EDL	00:04:45,960	00:04:50,940	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So with that, I was in state for Indiana and Purdue was a great school
EDL	00:04:50,940	00:04:53,550	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So I jumped at the opportunity and got accepted there
EDL	00:04:53,550	00:04:58,200	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So while at Purdue we had quite a few amazing professors, one of them
EDL	00:04:58,200	00:05:04,343	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Professor Andrisani would give us talks about how you could do no better in your career 
EDL	00:05:04,343	00:05:09,486	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	as an engineer, especially if you stay on the cutting edge and advance technology advance what humanity can do
EDL	00:05:09,486	00:05:11,001	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Look back at my head
EDL	00:05:11,001	00:05:12,835	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Those words have run with me
EDL	00:05:12,835	00:05:14,650	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	for the last 5 years, kept moving to
EDL	00:05:14,650	00:05:16,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	where is the most advanced technology and
EDL	00:05:16,320	00:05:18,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	how can I help the most.

EDL	00:05:18,020	00:05:21,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Well, those sound like two great lines of influence
EDL	00:05:21,090	00:05:22,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I mean, you know, a dad, a teacher like that
EDL	00:05:23,410	00:05:25,433	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And wow have you went with it. 
EDL	00:05:25,433	00:05:32,101	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so one of the things that I would like you to do here, is to take our listeners on a kind of Whirlwind (旋风) tours, 
EDL	00:05:32,101	00:05:35,490	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	you can't really dwell (详述) too much on any one thing you done
EDL	00:05:35,490	00:05:39,080	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I mean, your CV is just one of the most amazing documents I've ever read
EDL	00:05:39,550	00:05:45,920	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	[Thank you] But if you can take us for a Whirlwind tour on your experience in the commercial space. 

* Commercial Space (Iridium 铱星)
EDL	00:05:45,920	00:05:55,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Commercial space, absolutely. so I did an internship at a small engineering services company, and we've, I've got to work on NASA with with a space shuttle back at late 80s. 
EDL	00:05:55,110	00:05:58,349	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But what really got me going to commercial side was right after graduate school, 
EDL	00:05:58,349	00:06:02,446	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I got the opportunity to go to Motorola, it was firing up the Iridium lowest orbit
EDL	00:06:02,446	00:06:10,007	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	constellation proliferated (激增), lowest orbit satellites that were cross-linked and providing global connectivity in her planet
EDL	00:06:10,007	00:06:14,622	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And this was a large constellation. - very large, 66 satellites plus spares (备用)
EDL	00:06:14,622	00:06:23,406	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the goal was to build one satellite per week and launched the entire consultation of of 70, 80 satellites, including the spares in one year
EDL	00:06:23,406	00:06:24,631	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Never been done before
EDL	00:06:24,631	00:06:31,293	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And to do that, we're gonna use a large number of launch vehicles, and Motorola has never designed a spacecraft before
EDL	00:06:31,293	00:06:34,051	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So they put all that together and and back in
EDL	00:06:34,051	00:06:35,960	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	80s, 90s was this happening
EDL	00:06:35,960	00:06:38,293	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The motorola had really good plan
EDL	00:06:38,293	00:06:40,203	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They pulled in a lot of experts
EDL	00:06:40,203	00:06:41,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They pulled in subcontractors
EDL	00:06:41,900	00:06:44,340	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	like Lockheed and Raytheon who were experts in this area.
EDL	00:06:44,340	00:06:51,094	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They put together the team, and we ended up building at a rate of one spacecraft every 4.3 days. 
EDL	00:06:51,094	00:07:00,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We launched from 3 continents in just over, in 8 days, 14 satellites, we launched off all the satellite in about 18 months. 

* China, Russia
EDL	00:07:00,100	00:07:05,143	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And actually before you move on to some more of your commercial space experience, 
EDL	00:07:05,143	00:07:07,776	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I remember just talking with you at another time 
EDL	00:07:07,776	00:07:17,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	when I am perhaps I think was on this project, you already in project which took around the world to some of the other space cultures out there, like in China and an in Russia
EDL	00:07:17,900	00:07:22,636	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So I'm just wondering if you can compare and contrast a little bit of the kind of space cultures, 
EDL	00:07:22,636	00:07:29,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and that, you know that that, you have experience being part of the hours here, and then witnessing those elsewhere. 
EDL	00:07:29,110	00:07:32,523	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Absolutely what the first I noticed is, when you get in the other country, 
EDL	00:07:32,523	00:07:36,713	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	any other location is doing a Rocketry (火箭学) or spacecraft design, 
EDL	00:07:36,713	00:07:41,846	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You really gonna cross it as a type of engineer that you can relate to really well. 
EDL	00:07:41,846	00:07:45,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the people that do that are very similar no matter what culture they come from.
EDL	00:07:45,710	00:07:48,120	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I was very amazed how quickly you can make friends with
EDL	00:07:48,120	00:07:51,132	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the Russians and the chinese, anybody who was who are actually launched 
EDL	00:07:51,132	00:07:55,079	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	'cause we were launching on the Protons rocket seven at a time with the Iridium, 
EDL	00:07:55,079	00:07:57,730	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and we were launching two at a time on the chinese rockets 
EDL	00:07:57,730	00:08:02,425	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	five at a time on Delta II, which is our main launcher out of Andrew, 
EDL	00:08:02,425	00:08:07,418	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I would rotate between the lanuch bases in California, Baikonur Kazakhstan, 
EDL	00:08:07,418	00:08:09,411	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	where the Proton rocket was launched, 
EDL	00:08:09,411	00:08:11,951	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	also would go to Moscow for the integration meetings, 
EDL	00:08:11,951	00:08:17,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	over to Beijing for the Chinese integration meetings in Taiyuan for the launch base is there.
EDL	00:08:17,090	00:08:21,881	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was very interesting program, and really, I found it, the Russians and chinese. 
EDL	00:08:21,881	00:08:25,801	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	While Russians invented rockery, as we know, just the same time we did, 
EDL	00:08:25,801	00:08:27,293	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	China was coming up to curb
EDL	00:08:27,293	00:08:29,619	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're getting faster as an incredible rate,
EDL	00:08:29,619	00:08:31,238	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're getting better at an incredible rate.
EDL	00:08:31,238	00:08:33,920	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I found that both Russia and China
EDL	00:08:33,920	00:08:38,190	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Their cultures were less analytic than the American aerospace culture.
EDL	00:08:38,190	00:08:41,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They were very much driven by test, build, test, build, test cycles.
EDL	00:08:41,590	00:08:44,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I found that really in the commercial space here in US.
EDL	00:08:44,320	00:08:46,475	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We're serve pretty well admitted those type of things, 
EDL	00:08:46,475	00:08:48,946	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	when you move out of the analytics
EDL	00:08:48,946	00:08:51,402	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Don't spend year to trying to figure out exactly how to optimize a problem, 
EDL	00:08:51,402	00:08:55,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	but build something that maybe sub-optimal tested and use that result to go to the next phase 
EDL	00:08:55,530	00:09:00,470	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so we see analytics, I think of of, modeling
EDL	00:09:00,470	00:09:08,130	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so one thing we really, really... one area we are really, really good at in the US is very good computers and very good computer algorithms 
EDL	00:09:08,130	00:09:15,702	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that that let us analytically predict what a rocket would do under structural load or under guidance, navigation control algorithms, 
EDL	00:09:15,702	00:09:16,570	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	which is great
EDL	00:09:16,570	00:09:20,380	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	but it doesn't really tell you everything that could possibly happen during the flight
EDL	00:09:20,380	00:09:22,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Whereas a flight actually does tell you that.

* Funny experience: Russian Team, try to figure out what to call you
EDL	00:09:22,480	00:09:26,033	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Before we move off of this little a block what you are describing, 
EDL	00:09:26,033	00:09:30,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	this international framework for getting so many satellites up in such a short amount of time. 
EDL	00:09:30,690	00:09:34,188	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Share with our listeners, a kind of funny experience that you had 
EDL	00:09:34,188	00:09:37,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	with the Russian team when they were trying to figure out what
EDL	00:09:37,970	00:09:40,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	they should actually call you. - That's a great joy
EDL	00:09:40,410	00:09:40,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Thank you

EDL	00:09:40,690	00:09:45,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So, when I started working at Motorola, we would have every other month
EDL	00:09:45,530	00:09:47,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We would have a technical interchange meeting
EDL	00:09:47,000	00:09:49,540	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We need with either the Russian launch team or the Chinese launch team
EDL	00:09:49,540	00:09:50,696	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you have one each month. 
EDL	00:09:50,696	00:09:54,053	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	When the Russians would come to town or we would go to Moscow, 
EDL	00:09:54,053	00:09:58,136	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	we would have the stereotypical long tables with all the Russian, on one side, 
EDL	00:09:58,136	00:10:00,152	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and all of us on the other side and the translators. 
EDL	00:10:00,152	00:10:04,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	When they asked, and we introduced everybody, they got to me
EDL	00:10:04,410	00:10:08,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and I said, my name is, rusty thomas, they stopped the meeting real briefly
EDL	00:10:08,310	00:10:10,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and they started talking to translators, and they came back and
EDL	00:10:10,850	00:10:14,039	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	said is that your real name? And I said, well, Paul is my real name
EDL	00:10:14,039	00:10:20,493	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I was born Paul Thomas named after my grandfathers, but since the second or third day around Rusty has been a nick name. 
EDL	00:10:20,493	00:10:22,467	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And they went back and talk about this
EDL	00:10:22,467	00:10:25,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It, okay, we get it, Paul, Parval, that is a good name
EDL	00:10:25,000	00:10:26,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We're gonna call you Paul.
EDL	00:10:26,320	00:10:30,510	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and I said that's fine, some people would call me power, but most people here at Morotola
EDL	00:10:30,510	00:10:34,786	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	know me as Rusty, and they ended up in coming back and saying 
EDL	00:10:34,786	00:10:41,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Well, we're going to call you Paul, and the reason as we've discussed it, and and we don't have a nickname rusty here
EDL	00:10:41,680	00:10:44,800	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	in Russia, we don't feel comfortable calling anybody corrosion (腐蚀)
EDL	00:10:45,380	00:10:48,990	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So, so they decided not to call me corrosion
EDL	00:10:48,990	00:10:50,340	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I was Paul from there.
EDL	00:10:50,340	00:10:51,730	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I had been Paul on and off. 
EDL	00:10:51,730	00:10:52,413	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Since since, like, 

EDL	00:10:52,413	00:10:55,240	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	okay, because of that, it was smooth working team 
EDL	00:10:55,240	00:11:00,787	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So now I want to take you back to that Whirlwind tour of your experience in commercial space
EDL	00:11:00,787	00:11:01,731	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that I wanted you you to do
EDL	00:11:01,731	00:11:03,148	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But I took you on a diversion (转移注意力, 消遣, 改道)
EDL	00:11:03,148	00:11:04,251	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So let's get back to that
EDL	00:11:04,251	00:11:06,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You, you talk a little about the Morotola experience now moved from the world. 

EDL	00:11:06,400	00:11:13,181	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Motorola was great. Then I then I moved up to Seattle following words, the most advanced technology happening. 
EDL	00:11:13,181	00:11:17,620	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Seattle in late 90s was, was really happening place for a lot of reasons
EDL	00:11:17,620	00:11:29,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They had also a new company that was founded, called TeleDesic has some money coming from Bill Gates, Craig McCaw, tightens in the communication and computer industries.
EDL	00:11:29,830	00:11:32,750	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And they wanted to build a global lowest orbit satellite
EDL	00:11:32,750	00:11:36,642	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	constellation, to do broad-band communication, called TeleDesic. 
EDL	00:11:36,642	00:11:45,340	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We got pretty far into that design, but the technology at the time wasn't quite there miniaturization (微型化), as we know it today really wasn't there
EDL	00:11:45,690	00:11:51,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And the dotcom crash of 2000 and 2001, made it really hard for us to get a financing
EDL	00:11:51,270	00:11:54,213	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So we ended up not going forward to that program, 
EDL	00:11:54,213	00:11:57,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	even though we had got a FCC license for a lot of spectrum
EDL	00:11:57,270	00:12:00,840	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I had really good chance to be a major success.

EDL	00:12:00,840	00:12:04,131	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And it was at the space of a very compelling architecture 
EDL	00:12:04,131	00:12:13,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And moved from there, engineering services in San Diego had a really good time of some of the early days of UAV, predetering Global Hawk
EDL	00:12:13,400	00:12:23,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	got to be consulted down there for the early UAV designes, and then moved to orbital sciences, where I got into the government side a little bit.
EDL	00:12:23,410	00:12:25,614	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And then after it keeping the commercial side going. 
EDL	00:12:25,614	00:12:30,412	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	after the orbital sciences curb, I went to SpaceX, I was in 2011, 
EDL	00:12:30,412	00:12:36,436	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and worked as a senior director for Dragon production, building the capsules that go to the space station

EDL	00:12:36,436	00:12:42,343	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So it has been five years there and had just an amazing, amazing run, putting on those
EDL	00:12:42,343	00:12:51,722	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	those capsules up also got to work on the landing legs, and .... play a good part in those historic landings of those first ages. 
* Q
EDL	00:12:51,722	00:13:02,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Right, and just weeks really before this discussion are having now, a Dragon capsule did arrive at the international space station for a resupply mission
EDL	00:13:02,230	00:13:07,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So when you see that, I mean, how do you feel knowing you had been part of that

EDL	00:13:07,000	00:13:11,440	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Intense pride, absolutely, that that was at a turning point in how we do...  
EDL	00:13:11,440	00:13:17,786	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	how we do space missions, how NASA contracts for for things, how NASA moves forward, 
EDL	00:13:17,786	00:13:22,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the technology gets the cutting edge, develops it and then can move that technology
EDL	00:13:22,480	00:13:27,231	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	to companies like the SpaceX and others of the world, who can then use that to build a commercial case 
EDL	00:13:27,231	00:13:29,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and then allowing us to move on to the next place.
EDL	00:13:29,850	00:13:39,860	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	When I was at Space X, we went from doing one rocket a year, one dragon every year, to four, five, six dragons per year
EDL	00:13:39,860	00:13:44,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And now the spacecraft was ramping up (上升) to 20, 30+ launches in the given year
EDL	00:13:44,930	00:13:48,095	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's really been an incredible time to see that 
EDL	00:13:48,095	00:13:51,961	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	approach to how you do commercial space turn on and become 
EDL	00:13:51,961	00:13:56,390	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	reality and then become a success, and then become really a major success. 
EDL	00:13:56,390	00:13:57,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Where it's at right now.

* Q
EDL	00:13:58,020	00:14:00,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, so you sort of, told the story we already hear of
EDL	00:14:00,680	00:14:02,513	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	you kind of growing up professionally, 
EDL	00:14:02,513	00:14:04,875	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	along with the commercial space sector, 
EDL	00:14:04,875	00:14:08,205	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	which is just kind of amazing thing to think about. 
EDL	00:14:08,205	00:14:11,683	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But you then made a decision to say yes, 
EDL	00:14:11,683	00:14:14,654	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	when, when the offer came through to become a program manager here.
EDL	00:14:14,654	00:14:22,382	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'd like to hear that the sequence of events that lead you in this stage of your career from that the commercial activities you been in,
EDL	00:14:22,382	00:14:24,571	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and now here, as a first year PM.

EDL	00:14:24,571	00:14:26,260	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	- absolutely. - Program manager 
EDL	00:14:26,260	00:14:30,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	By chance I happened to in the early 2000s and be talking to some friends at orbital sciences
EDL	00:14:31,260	00:14:35,600	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And they said, there was a very interesting program [...] enough, was called MiTex
EDL	00:14:36,440	00:14:39,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I didn't know much about it, it was a DARPA program
EDL	00:14:39,030	00:14:44,949	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was classified what the experiments were it was, oouh we are not allowed to know it existed. The time it was used to DARPA
EDL	00:14:44,949	00:14:48,627	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	experimental program to do a demo of the technology, 
EDL	00:14:48,627	00:14:52,145	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and orbital was looking for people who had my type of background, 
EDL	00:14:52,145	00:14:56,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	a little bit of commercial, but also had the right tickets so they could do, do the work
EDL	00:14:56,430	00:14:59,257	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and they brought me out for three-month stint (规定工作时间), 
EDL	00:14:59,257	00:15:02,793	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and I would just gonna help do some analysis for that spacecraft
EDL	00:15:02,793	00:15:08,835	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I did some analysts, and after three months, look like DARPA was going to continue the program, 
EDL	00:15:08,835	00:15:10,316	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	orbital wanted to keep expanding,
EDL	00:15:10,316	00:15:12,891	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so they asked me if I would stay on as a manager 
EDL	00:15:12,891	00:15:17,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	for the, for the design of that. so I got to run the design of the of the MiTex spacecraft.
EDL	00:15:18,290	00:15:23,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And so I stayed in orbital for not three months, I ended up staying for about 8 years
EDL	00:15:23,110	00:15:27,154	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And during that time frame, we work through the MiTex spacecraft
EDL	00:15:27,154	00:15:29,533	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I got to do the design and build
EDL	00:15:29,533	00:15:32,863	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We actually took it through integration, launched it
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:36,505	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I went out to Schriever Air Force Base as a vehicle engineer 
EDL	00:15:36,505	00:15:39,196	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and got to be on council of flight for about a year and half.
EDL	00:15:39,196	00:15:41,362	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so it was a really good experience
EDL	00:15:41,362	00:15:44,610	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I, It wasn't commercial. Commerical, it was about government
EDL	00:15:44,610	00:15:48,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	taking commercial approach. As orbital is, was a very commercial company
EDL	00:15:48,400	00:15:53,862	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and this was an experimental process that wasn't a strict requirements driven program
EDL	00:15:53,862	00:15:58,232	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was there to prove some key technology that we could use in space.
EDL	00:15:58,232	00:16:02,028	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was was successful, and I, as very proud of the of the results there, 
EDL	00:16:02,028	00:16:05,243	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that kind of got me into what DARPA can do. 
EDL	00:16:05,243	00:16:14,390	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	DARPA can step into an area where, where there might not be a set need, or a set said requirements are a set funding line 
EDL	00:16:14,390	00:16:20,488	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and say this is technology that would really help the warfighters, help the country in significant ways, 
EDL	00:16:20,488	00:16:24,605	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and and we are gonna say, we're gonna do a demo, we're gonna proof that this is possible, 
EDL	00:16:24,605	00:16:28,338	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the the proof is here, if we can actually spend two or three years and some money 
EDL	00:16:28,338	00:16:30,160	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	to actually get a demonstration of a running 
EDL	00:16:30,160	00:16:33,654	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that opened my eyes to what you could really do outside the commercial world, 
EDL	00:16:33,654	00:16:36,902	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	but still using commercial approaches as much as possible, 

EDL	00:16:36,902	00:16:44,389	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So followed on from there and became a deputy PM on the GSSAP we mentioned earlier

https://www.vifindia.org/article/2020/december/17/space-situational-awareness-ssa-an-essential-strategic-requirement

EDL	00:16:44,389	00:16:49,910	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Geostationary (同步轨道) Space Situational Awareness Programme (GSSAP) is air force programming of record

EDL	00:16:49,910	00:16:51,765	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	now that is doing very well
EDL	00:16:51,765	00:17:02,510	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's up in GEO, and it is acknowledged but it has very, very, very good capability, and it is doing, getting a lot of good feedback from the people use it
EDL	00:17:02,510	00:17:05,940	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the GSSAP program are very successful
EDL	00:17:05,940	00:17:09,241	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And after it got to the critical scientific review, 
EDL	00:17:09,241	00:17:15,390	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I happened to have the opportunity to to go to Space X, they were just firing up what I've already talked about that it was
EDL	00:17:15,390	00:17:18,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was a wonderful 5 years at the end of that
EDL	00:17:18,480	00:17:28,872	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I was at Daiquiri during the operation's job of setting up the augmented reality global operations, manufacturing for the what's going to become a revolution
EDL	00:17:28,872	00:17:31,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm a positive, argument reality's gonna be a very, very big thing.

* Q
EDL	00:17:31,680	00:17:34,219	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And just a two sentenced description for listeners, 
EDL	00:17:34,219	00:17:36,560	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	you might not know what you mean by augmented reality
EDL	00:17:36,560	00:17:48,312	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	augmented reality is the ability put on glasses that will augment the information that you are seeing, real information, with computer generated 3D graphics that that actually will float in space
EDL	00:17:48,312	00:17:51,873	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You can put text, you can put graphics, you can put anything you want.
EDL	00:17:51,873	00:17:54,220	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And it was is going to be contextualized around
EDL	00:17:54,220	00:17:55,439	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	actual objects in space. 
EDL	00:17:55,439	00:17:58,459	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was not virtual reality where locks you out, and you don't see anything 
EDL	00:17:58,459	00:18:02,300	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	In argumented reality, you actually have, still see the people in the room
EDL	00:18:02,300	00:18:03,600	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We still see all the objects. 
EDL	00:18:03,600	00:18:05,025	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But it's adding information. 
* Q
EDL	00:18:05,025	00:18:14,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I have seen, I think, a multisyllabic phrase for this, software-defined holographic, light control, is that related to what you talking about?

EDL	00:18:14,010	00:18:22,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's advanced versions of argument reality and DECARY had some of the most advanced holographic light control technology out there.

EDL	00:18:22,320	00:18:31,326	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, so now my suspicion is confirm that you actually are are going to develop this star[..] enterprise at some point in your career.
EDL	00:18:31,326	00:18:36,710	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The holo tech is out there. OK. - So, getting back to how you actually got to DARPA.

* getting back
EDL	00:18:36,710	00:18:44,116	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That final turn to get me back as program manager became when the concept of the blackjack consultation, which I did not come up with
EDL	00:18:44,116	00:18:46,594	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was already been formulated by experts here
EDL	00:18:46,594	00:18:49,006	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And we'll talk a little bit more about that right after this 
EDL	00:18:49,006	00:18:55,735	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	- great, so DARPA contacted me and said, we're going to go forward with a proliferated, Low Earth Orbital architecture 
EDL	00:18:55,735	00:18:58,926	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	to start to change how we do space missions, right now
EDL	00:18:58,926	00:19:02,362	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We do space missions with very exquisite, very capable satellite, 
EDL	00:19:02,362	00:19:06,592	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that actually cost a lot of money, so therefore we can't build very many of them
EDL	00:19:06,592	00:19:13,091	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And the Low earth orbit, proliferated approach that Iridium did, back with the communications in the 90s, 
EDL	00:19:13,091	00:19:15,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and TeleDesic was trying to do
EDL	00:19:15,010	00:19:19,787	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And other companies have taken it forward, is a different approach to put 
EDL	00:19:19,787	00:19:24,807	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	smaller, lower costs and and in some ways expandable, 
EDL	00:19:24,807	00:19:26,769	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	but not as expendable as low reliability
EDL	00:19:26,769	00:19:30,326	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But the key element is small and lower-cost satellites 
EDL	00:19:30,326	00:19:35,694	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that are in very low earth orbits so that you can cover the entire earth with coverage, 
EDL	00:19:35,694	00:19:37,503	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and like we said earlier, was 60 or 70
EDL	00:19:37,503	00:19:43,830	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	satellites will usually do it to give yourself constant coverage over the earth and DARPA
EDL	00:19:43,830	00:19:47,723	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	let me know if they were going to move forward with an experiment to try to 
EDL	00:19:47,723	00:19:56,566	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	move into augmenting what these exquisite satellite can do with a LEO, low earth orbit proliferated constellation, 
EDL	00:19:56,566	00:20:00,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	when that opportunity came in, I came in, gave a talk
EDL	00:20:00,030	00:20:01,381	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and it was a match made in heaven. 
EDL	00:20:01,381	00:20:07,540	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	because it sounds like through ten thousand people in the world [heheheheh] that seems to tailor made this kind of idea
EDL	00:20:07,540	00:20:11,854	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I really do think in terms of match, in terms of what the DARPA wants to do 
EDL	00:20:11,854	00:20:16,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	with a, what these type of consolations can do in the future.
EDL	00:20:16,110	00:20:18,600	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And in my background is a really good match and
EDL	00:20:18,600	00:20:20,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm very excited to be in this position.
EDL	00:20:20,230	00:20:21,510	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And its timing is perfect. 

* Blackjack
EDL	00:20:21,510	00:20:28,820	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Let's talk about Blackjack in a little bit more detail, tell me a little bit about, you know, the kind of the elements of that
EDL	00:20:29,150	00:20:35,060	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And even before we start that, can you tell listeners and me where the name comes from? 

EDL	00:20:35,570	00:20:42,506	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Sure, the concept of of a Blackjack that instead of having sensors in space 
EDL	00:20:42,506	00:20:50,488	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that might come out of one or two or three this points of the sky, you could potentially put smaller sensors in many locations
EDL	00:20:50,488	00:20:57,570	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Give the destroyers or the surface action group, commanders of the war or the army commanders or air force
EDL	00:20:57,570	00:20:59,989	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	anybody could build it to look over the horizon 
EDL	00:20:59,989	00:21:05,918	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	with a small number of discrete sensors that they actually dot the sky in some ways, 
EDL	00:21:05,918	00:21:12,348	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	well, if you go to a casino, and you look up, you see on the ceiling, you see all the little domes, 
EDL	00:21:12,348	00:21:17,776	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	those little domes are all tiny little sensors, and they are making sure that nothing bad is going on, right
EDL	00:21:17,776	00:21:23,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the concept of Blackjack is to follow that distributed sensor approaches as you see  in a casino
EDL	00:21:23,320	00:21:31,255	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You don't have one or two large systems making sure that everything is working okay and making sure that there are no cheating going on in the casino.
EDL	00:21:31,255	00:21:34,875	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And just just for the record for our listeners, we do need to point out the DARPA
EDL	00:21:34,875	00:21:38,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	does not get all of its ideas from Las Vegas.
EDL	00:21:38,310	00:21:41,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	we don't get it all, but probably more than we should maybe
EDL	00:21:41,000	00:21:42,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	yes, absolutely
EDL	00:21:42,230	00:21:47,455	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the name came from the someone playing Blackjack would have the distributed sensor set around them, 
EDL	00:21:47,455	00:21:52,660	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so it is kind of a tongue-in-cheek (随口) name, but, but it was a good name and a good idea crossing
EDL	00:21:52,660	00:21:54,440	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We give our talks at what we're doing
EDL	00:21:54,810	00:22:02,075	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So Blackjack is just as they said a Low Earth Orbit consultation of sensors, that we're going to leverage and 
EDL	00:22:02,075	00:22:09,856	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	key element of this is leveraging the commercial space as they talk my career in the past is, you can do things very quickly
EDL	00:22:09,856	00:22:13,337	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You can do things very efficiently with a commercial approach,
EDL	00:22:13,337	00:22:17,058	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Now, let's not to say the government approach, how we've procured things in the past is always bad
EDL	00:22:17,058	00:22:25,710	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	but in some cases, you don't get the optimal solution, and you could do things in a lower cost and a faster schedule if you tackle in a different way
EDL	00:22:25,710	00:22:28,860	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So what the ideal Blackjack is it try a different approach
EDL	00:22:28,860	00:22:38,705	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	use lower orbit, use proliferated commercial satellites, especially the buses where we will marry military payloads to those commercial buses 
EDL	00:22:38,705	00:22:41,250	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and then start flying a large number of them
EDL	00:22:41,250	00:22:45,766	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so you can give that proliferated (激增) global constant custody constellation (星座), 
EDL	00:22:45,766	00:22:50,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and I say, constant custody, that means for a commander wants to look at a given spot on the earth
EDL	00:22:50,090	00:22:54,570	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	He can point the sensor to that spot immediately, because it is gonna be a satellite over head at any given time. 

EDL	00:22:54,965	00:22:58,262	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, and you use the words that, in a way we hadn't been heard before. Proliferated. 
EDL	00:22:58,262	00:23:00,769	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Just want to make sure I understand what that means in this framework. 
EDL	00:23:00,769	00:23:06,245	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Proliferating means multiple points in the space and spread out over the surface, you have to accept an open space, of course
EDL	00:23:06,245	00:23:10,826	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So any person on the, on the ground is going to be able to look up, see a Blackjack satellite, 
EDL	00:23:10,826	00:23:14,080	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	with the full constellation developed in the sky at any given time, 
EDL	00:23:14,080	00:23:17,250	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and that's the end of the reciprocal (互惠的) approach works that 
EDL	00:23:17,250	00:23:21,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	if the Blackjack satellite is always going to be able to see any point of the earth
EDL	00:23:21,430	00:23:22,395	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	at any given time. 

* Q
EDL	00:23:22,395	00:23:26,879	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	right, so it's interesting, there 's some aspects sort of GPS-like system, 
EDL	00:23:26,879	00:23:36,683	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and that you got many satellites working in a kind of coordinated fashion, delivering amazing kinds of data that would not be possible otherwise. 
EDL	00:23:36,683	00:23:40,593	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Here we are actually talking about a lot more than the several dozen [..] GPS, 
EDL	00:23:40,593	00:23:43,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	talk just a little bit more about
EDL	00:23:43,000	00:23:48,278	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the various kinds of challenges that are part of this project, 
EDL	00:23:48,278	00:23:52,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	one of them certainly is, is producing almost mass, producing very rapidly,
EDL	00:23:52,970	00:23:54,080	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	a lot of satellites,
EDL	00:23:54,080	00:23:58,050	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And so you had to talk about your experience there, but there's also going to be coordination
EDL	00:23:58,050	00:23:59,460	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	There's going to be command and control
EDL	00:24:00,030	00:24:02,645	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	What are some of these other elements that you can talk us about? 
* A
EDL	00:24:02,645	00:24:06,747	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Absolutely so first, yes, your analogy to the GPS is 100%
EDL	00:24:06,747	00:24:11,485	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That is a proliferated constellation, but it's about at a medium or medium-high altitude 
EDL	00:24:11,485	00:24:16,639	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	with Blackjack we wouldn't go very low, 500 kilometers to 1200 kilometers, 
EDL	00:24:16,639	00:24:21,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so arranged that that's just about the earth's atmosphere for these satellites

EDL	00:24:21,020	00:24:24,279	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and the trick is going to be building such a low enough
EDL	00:24:24,279	00:24:28,624	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You are gonna need more satellites and what a GPS satellite, GPS consolation would need
EDL	00:24:28,624	00:24:32,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So to do that, you're going to need mass production and to do that, you have the cost right
EDL	00:24:32,970	00:24:36,657	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You going to need to build them, and on very short time scales 
EDL	00:24:36,657	00:24:40,251	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	with a minimal amount of assembly intergration and test 
EDL	00:24:40,251	00:24:45,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and to do that, we're going to bring it as much commercial approaches we can
EDL	00:24:45,020	00:24:53,149	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	we've had an industry day, a very positive response from from over 130 companies signed up for the industry day
EDL	00:24:53,149	00:24:57,521	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And we had overturned 75 folks who want to come in and listen to us
EDL	00:24:57,521	00:25:03,652	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So we believe that that approach of going with discreet, low-cost nodes in space 
EDL	00:25:03,652	00:25:09,392	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that are almost expendable, not all expendable (一次性), but almost is going to be achievable, 
EDL	00:25:09,392	00:25:15,220	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and we're going to use that commercial and commoditized approached to the buses 
EDL	00:25:15,220	00:25:21,188	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and bring that to impedance match to the military payloads that will go on those buses also
EDL	00:25:21,188	00:25:26,158	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the other key element of this and you in a little to that a second ago is that we don't, 
EDL	00:25:26,158	00:25:35,557	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	if we're gonna launch hundreds or or more thousands of of the satellite, we don't want to require teams of multiple people per satellite monitoring them. 
EDL	00:25:35,557	00:25:44,830	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Right now, of the exquisite satellites have excellent teams of people on the ground who are making sure everything that that satellite does is monitored
EDL	00:25:44,830	00:25:49,810	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're gonna analytically predict beforehand what the response of any new script they're gonna send up, that gonna happen
EDL	00:25:49,810	00:25:55,370	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's an excellent approach, but we really want to get a autonomy into the Blackjack architecture
EDL	00:25:55,370	00:25:59,160	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And when I say autonomy, I mean, how does the mission control work?
EDL	00:25:59,160	00:26:01,346	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	How does resource planning work?
EDL	00:26:01,346	00:26:07,889	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	How does the payload in terms of what it seem work in terms of, can you move instead of raw data down to the people on the ground
EDL	00:26:07,889	00:26:12,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Can you vectorize the information and contextualize it what was important. 

* Q
EDL	00:26:12,000	00:26:15,612	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, one of the other interesting things about the Blackjack program to me is 
EDL	00:26:15,612	00:26:27,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	because you're not putting multiple billion dollar jewels up there, large just tremendously expensive assets that need to stay up there for years and years
EDL	00:26:27,000	00:26:35,180	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	here, you can do what I guess, much more frequent technology refresh, I presume some of them can be done through software
EDL	00:26:35,180	00:26:37,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Now you can just wait as we were always upgrading
EDL	00:26:37,090	00:26:39,835	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	our various applications on our computers, 
EDL	00:26:39,835	00:26:42,936	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	but this also does give you some opportunity to, you know, 
EDL	00:26:42,936	00:26:51,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	without breaking the bank putting up actually, new generations of these small satellites and still having them work within the Blackjack consolation. 

EDL	00:26:51,100	00:26:51,580	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Yeah, yeah
EDL	00:26:51,580	00:26:57,641	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and they're 2 areas there that are very important, and we're gonna chase both of those on Blackjack. 
EDL	00:26:57,641	00:27:08,797	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	first is, if you're individual nodes low earth orbit, your launch costs is lower than going at higher orbits, the weight is less, and the cost of individual satellite is less
EDL	00:27:08,797	00:27:13,811	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So we're aiming for an on-orbit cost of six million dollars per node, per Blackjack node, 
EDL	00:27:13,811	00:27:19,302	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	that includes a launch cost, which means that if you have a problem with one of those satellites, 
EDL	00:27:19,302	00:27:23,660	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	you can launch another one replace it for not a huge amount of money
EDL	00:27:23,660	00:27:30,404	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And the second piece, is the ability to do on-orbit over the year updates of the software 
EDL	00:27:30,404	00:27:36,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We're gonna put large processors, I call a Pit Boss once again going with a Blackjack approach
EDL	00:27:36,690	00:27:40,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Tried the Pit Boss is the brains on each one of the of a Blackjack nodes
EDL	00:27:40,590	00:27:44,967	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's going to have a terra-flop-class processor on it or more, 
EDL	00:27:44,967	00:27:48,862	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and it's gonna to allow us to put a lot of algorithms on space 
EDL	00:27:48,862	00:27:53,058	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and not only put a lot of algorithms in space to do the work up there with the edge computers
EDL	00:27:53,058	00:28:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But it's also gonna, we are gonna launch more processors, capabilities than we need for the first generation, because we expect to get better and
EDL	00:28:00,000	00:28:03,665	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	better with our algorithms, and algorithms typically need more and more processor
EDL	00:28:03,665	00:28:12,422	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So if you can, we talk about our work to Space X, my, my boss there also found another company called Tesla, and one of the really gool, cool models of Tesla
EDL	00:28:12,422	00:28:16,038	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	is, you have a car, and you might come out and in the morning, 
EDL	00:28:16,038	00:28:20,228	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and it's done an over-the-air update, and you have a better car the next day than you did the prior day, 
EDL	00:28:20,228	00:28:24,785	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	because they updated the software, so I'm going to follow that type of approach, 
EDL	00:28:24,785	00:28:32,328	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	putting a lot of extra capacity for the processor, so that as the algorithms get better, you get a better spacecraft essentially for free
EDL	00:28:32,328	00:28:37,350	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Although, of course, you have to pay for algorithm update, but in terms of launching a satellite, you don't need to
EDL	00:28:37,350	00:28:48,460	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and I imagine you also have to think about end of service when you talking about so many discrete parts that are in Low Earth Orbit, means, sounds like to me these are gonna be deorbit in some way or another 

EDL	00:28:48,810	00:28:50,176	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Have you given that thought?

EDL	00:28:50,176	00:29:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	absolutely, given that thought. And that goes back over the Motorola Iridium constellation, every Iridium satellite has the ability to deorbit itself at
EDL	00:29:00,000	00:29:03,524	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	the end of his life, it has a small amount of fuel reserves left. 
EDL	00:29:03,524	00:29:06,667	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Those fuel reserves aren't used for anything other than the deorbit, 
EDL	00:29:06,667	00:29:09,448	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and has enough redundancy and electronics on board, 
EDL	00:29:09,448	00:29:12,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so that it starts to have problems with its primary mission, 
EDL	00:29:12,400	00:29:15,005	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	it can fire the thrusters and bring itself down, 
EDL	00:29:15,005	00:29:20,928	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so that approach has been proven successful with with the Iridium in the commercial consultations
EDL	00:29:20,928	00:29:30,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We are gonna follow the same approach of Blackjack, and I believe there are numerous FCC filings for mega constellations of communication satellite gonna be out there. 
EDL	00:29:30,530	00:29:38,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That'll have launched even more satellites and Blackjack, they're going to be good stewards, I believe, of low earth orbit also, and put in the ability
EDL	00:29:38,970	00:29:44,813	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So that is a satellite ends its operation, like all get replaced with a better tech refry for satellite, 
EDL	00:29:44,813	00:29:48,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	it will immediately turn on the thrusters and deorbit and burn up, 
EDL	00:29:48,000	00:29:54,215	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	usually over the south pacific or somewhere relatively benign (不危及生命的), the satellites don't make a back down
EDL	00:29:54,215	00:29:57,347	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They burn up in the high atmosphere during the re-entry and make a wonderful shooting star
EDL	00:29:57,347	00:30:00,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	If you happen to know where it is [haha]

* Q
EDL	00:30:01,730	00:30:08,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So as you think about it, this is amazing to think about this is all the pieces, and you can have additions of a program
EDL	00:30:08,290	00:30:17,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It is either one or two things about it that stands out in your mind, as maybe, particularly a rich, even working on the dark program in technology
EDL	00:30:17,850	00:30:19,080	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Speaking, yes, we are. 
EDL	00:30:19,080	00:30:25,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Absolutely, so that the biggest rich, I believe, is the amount of atomic we'd like to put on this spacecraft
EDL	00:30:25,410	00:30:34,540	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I've given a metric that if we lose the ground control, as if we have a comes problem, or the some type of influence and satellites are arranged talking to the ground
EDL	00:30:34,540	00:30:43,596	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I want them to be able to operate this for twenty four hours as a consumer talking to each other through their systems and and and managing the resources
EDL	00:30:43,596	00:31:09,561	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Managing the mission is still providing whatever in the fact or our set of information, the worldwide that the people downrange without that ground infrastructure, so that could be interesting when I learned that I say the matter is one day, but really, my stretch goal is to get thirty days universal operations without talking to the consultation, while it still performs its primary mission to whoever needs to have that information that is generating
EDL	00:31:09,561	00:31:14,045	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So putting that in the place is also significantly for from the current operations
EDL	00:31:14,045	00:31:24,710	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We have an operations controls in our ground, making sure the satellite health and safety and the mission is being managed properly to one, or you don't even have a human being in the loop
EDL	00:31:24,710	00:31:39,683	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You moved the man pregnant for men, men in the loop to men on the loop, poor that the people do in the management are there to make sure and adjusted priorities as necessary course, but not there to make a second by second minute, by many decisions
EDL	00:31:39,683	00:31:43,260	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I have the spacecraft operating, and what they do that is really hard, but. 
EDL	00:31:43,260	00:31:47,216	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So a fireman for tonight be always with human beings
EDL	00:31:47,216	00:31:54,820	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're as shepherds and in the loop, and somewhere absolutely so you're a first year program manager
EDL	00:31:54,820	00:31:59,436	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Typically, program managers are here for just to three to five
EDL	00:31:59,436	00:32:01,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I have people here in the study of whoever is done
EDL	00:32:01,900	00:32:03,370	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Several tories of duty as well
EDL	00:32:03,370	00:32:05,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So people like it enough to say they come here
EDL	00:32:05,850	00:32:07,500	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They do want to reduce the go away
EDL	00:32:07,500	00:32:08,240	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They come back
EDL	00:32:08,240	00:32:23,381	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm just wondering if, as the first time program and energy with a program of this complexity and science, what you think this one program is going to be enough for you to satisfy your, your technology interest, and just because it's going to be so hard to do
EDL	00:32:23,381	00:32:26,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Or are you already imagining are taken on additional programmes? 
EDL	00:32:26,900	00:32:29,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm actually early, imagine taken on
EDL	00:32:29,290	00:32:41,967	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It does not bargain that goes back to my theme of how to get to the most cutting that gentleman of whatever you do in a career, but like text of a major program, because it could be AAhuge success, and it's gonna really lead a pilot to lower the orbit
EDL	00:32:41,967	00:33:01,280	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But once you start working in a lower orbit regime and once a duty and dark, start working and putting these systems in place, I can introduce many other programs that will leverage this type of architecture and and a successful command object once we build this global message network, this, this message is space, a space open at
EDL	00:33:01,800	00:33:05,140	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	How can you use it to actually benefit the people on the ground
EDL	00:33:05,140	00:33:05,705	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I think. 
EDL	00:33:05,705	00:33:21,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	A lot of programmer and I just, I just want to point out to listeners that, even though restless, is talking about a program like that, it is, it does not mean that it is automatically going to become what he's gonna have to really jump through a lot of hopes, and it is a lot of people that something worth doing
EDL	00:33:21,530	00:33:24,254	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So this really is essentially glimmer on the eye
EDL	00:33:24,254	00:33:28,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Mayor may not come to become AAso that's one immediate
EDL	00:33:28,270	00:33:28,855	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Sounds like you. 
EDL	00:33:28,855	00:33:29,665	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I didn't have more idea
EDL	00:33:29,665	00:33:40,653	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Yeah, I, I, I, I, Ihave been spun up with a world above in the reality on what you can do is like control hollywood graphic, like controls in area of high interest to me
EDL	00:33:40,653	00:34:02,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I believe that we are approaching that point where the holidays are allowed, not reconduct things that appearing, but the ability for systems to a transmit holographic light phase, control the light and project in a way that you are emerged in a reality that that isn't real, but it's seen the real, because your eye is getting fed the same information
EDL	00:34:02,010	00:34:04,740	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It would be if the object was actually there
EDL	00:34:04,740	00:34:19,283	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I believe that type of light control just drawn the corner, and there is a good chances going to revolutionary how we do interaction with computers and interaction with even people in the same way that the transistor revolutionized how we do computers
EDL	00:34:19,283	00:34:24,200	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I think that's are coming the next five, twenty years, and I really hope you get dark. 
EDL	00:34:24,200	00:34:28,360	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Movement and as you released in the potential applications of that training, just. 
EDL	00:34:28,360	00:34:31,350	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And to my, my meaning is a huge, but not destroying
EDL	00:34:31,350	00:34:39,189	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But the if, if you are deployed a, if you have multiple person to ploy, and you can have a holographic surgery
EDL	00:34:39,189	00:34:49,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So how, how to fix somebody in your deployed, or in a very mode, you can actually train somebody in real time and how to do something, because I can see it in three day, right in front of them
EDL	00:34:49,290	00:35:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Has it happening while the reducing american procedure, training for welfare, training for other industrial applications becomes, becomes much more advance
EDL	00:35:00,000	00:35:01,395	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Or thus, they very done me
EDL	00:35:01,395	00:35:10,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Study showing you can train somebody anywhere from two to ten times faster with algorithm is all in his olympic light approaches
EDL	00:35:10,000	00:35:19,494	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	If you, because your brain is, is, is programmed to absorb information from three day context, much faster than you are with someone talking to you or reading in a book
EDL	00:35:19,494	00:35:20,760	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you said, you see it
EDL	00:35:20,760	00:35:22,237	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You have a robot factor
EDL	00:35:22,237	00:35:26,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So I think training is going to be an area that could be revolutionized. 
EDL	00:35:26,030	00:35:30,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Another thing just came to mind, what is economic sort of discovery
EDL	00:35:30,680	00:35:36,312	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you might have a space you want to figure out the best way to arrange things in that space with this kind of technology
EDL	00:35:36,312	00:35:40,470	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Build a text out of those different ways, very efficiently, cheaply. 
EDL	00:35:40,470	00:35:46,760	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	One of my early early crew moves was that the internship will work out, work on on as a project
EDL	00:35:46,760	00:36:05,503	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And we will would well be three day cat at a time when two d cat was the standard computer redesign, and that three dimensional cat and allowed you to mark up engineering parts, and and then do photographic, virtual photographic, make sure the parts would learn through with each other
EDL	00:36:05,503	00:36:09,434	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And that was a huge boom for it really designed with a mechanical design
EDL	00:36:09,434	00:36:11,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I believe the same thing will happen
EDL	00:36:11,400	00:36:19,060	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Owners are doing this with the interactive, collaborative tools allow everybody who want to see what's happening in three days without even. 
EDL	00:36:19,060	00:36:34,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Computer screen are selling for them, and then there is one other kind of technology project that you work, which also just represents to me, just how many thousands of thousands of technology engineering issues there are when you really thinking big
EDL	00:36:34,230	00:36:47,640	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you also were in on the design of the crane operation for meeting satellites, going to connect vehicle dispenser components right after just one of the many, many. 
EDL	00:36:47,640	00:36:49,840	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So this was an interesting invention
EDL	00:36:49,840	00:36:59,587	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We worked as two or three of us at motorola, where the we had it was that motorola was pitching the ship and shoot approach a spacecraft you finished on the production line
EDL	00:36:59,587	00:37:14,306	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It went into a shipping container, said on a dog until where the Russian protesters under the landmark rush, chinese landmarks, or the, or the, the mechanism that was said of two folks needed another set of satellites, and that those launched campaigns were going
EDL	00:37:14,306	00:37:15,925	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The Russians lead seven
EDL	00:37:15,925	00:37:17,081	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And that was the case
EDL	00:37:17,081	00:37:22,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We would call photographs and photographs showed up at the sky harbor airport
EDL	00:37:22,400	00:37:24,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We will load two or three side
EDL	00:37:24,310	00:37:25,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They would fly in the Russia
EDL	00:37:25,430	00:37:30,870	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We looked up, and then we get them out to the large base, and we wanna put them on a rocket within a day or two
EDL	00:37:31,180	00:37:33,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and that's always do not help
EDL	00:37:33,030	00:37:39,940	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I entered this done right now, and it was the salad we were looking for very fast, like our times, very quick process flow and do that
EDL	00:37:39,940	00:37:45,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We needed to make seventy salaries are very close to each other, actually and quickly
EDL	00:37:45,480	00:37:56,220	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So we put together a crane, so I think we call the swing and tourist eliminator, which mounted to the floor of the Russian integration hall in bike north
EDL	00:37:56,220	00:38:01,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And we, every satellite would be brought in vertical state attached to this
EDL	00:38:01,100	00:38:14,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And then it is the Russian, korean, normally with swimming is around a little bit as a model, because you didn't have a neighborhood of salad transaction, but on the disposal, like wages, there are all very close to each other
EDL	00:38:14,010	00:38:16,260	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	She had to control the twist in the swing
EDL	00:38:16,260	00:38:16,870	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We are at the point
EDL	00:38:16,870	00:38:28,210	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We can make three of the satellites per day and have all the entire dispenser of seven satellites ready to go after three or four days of processing, and then they would be filled and be. 
EDL	00:38:28,570	00:38:31,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, so on top of everything else, you are right, right
EDL	00:38:33,110	00:38:35,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you know, you're working on things
EDL	00:38:35,690	00:38:47,550	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And many boss would work, consider to be kind of science fiction, technology fiction, though you can make these things really are there non's space technologies that you just go about? 
EDL	00:38:47,550	00:38:53,447	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Down's space will almost daily error space without the space, or as good error
EDL	00:38:53,447	00:39:09,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I do believe that the transport of human beings of planets is going to get to the point organ a bit more at the hypersonic scale, and in the not to distant futures, not in the area of research for myself, but I'm exceptionally interested
EDL	00:39:09,290	00:39:27,150	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I guess, curious on how we're going to get some new technology that seems becoming online right to the commercial space and how we might start moving people from, from, from, say, new york to sydney and an hours instead of the two of the fourteen plus hours, take right
EDL	00:39:27,520	00:39:46,642	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I think the very high speed transport, which I guess that it doesn't hit your mark, because you will probably have to go in space a little bit during part of that flight, but I still see some very high speed flight, supersonic, high supersonic speed flight has been a narrow of of interest of of significant potential, and the next ten to fifteen years
EDL	00:39:46,642	00:39:50,640	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I think there's the museum teams that are cracking dragon that would be. 
EDL	00:39:50,640	00:40:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And so sort of, ironically, thinking bigger than this way to make the world a little smaller in the sense of english, for many points at any point, be in a much shorter time than as right. 
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,456	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Blackjack will give you the message
EDL	00:40:01,456	00:40:04,740	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Networking communicated red broad band and connection with the people. 
EDL	00:40:04,740	00:40:05,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That's going to be the next step up
EDL	00:40:05,850	00:40:06,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So rusty
EDL	00:40:06,690	00:40:08,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You are technology developer
EDL	00:40:08,850	00:40:10,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You been doing that your whole life
EDL	00:40:10,030	00:40:21,658	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But you also have taken time to get into the mall of the mine said in the setting of the war fighter, the wonderfully the war fighters who are not trying to serve more capability
EDL	00:40:21,658	00:40:26,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Can you just share a little bit with listeners about your experience? 
EDL	00:40:26,270	00:40:49,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Complex, absolutely so I've been a reserved for united states navy since two thousand four, and as an intelligence officer, I was lucky enough to be selected to go to naval special offer and and actually went out during the search to synchronized desert areas with the whistle teams that help do targeting and how value how are you talking
EDL	00:40:49,430	00:40:51,276	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We did the pregnant job
EDL	00:40:51,276	00:41:01,506	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We got to go to move, move through are those areas and picked up, but quite a few of the alcohol may love, love, produce and and then put them away
EDL	00:41:01,506	00:41:14,950	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So for I feel, I feel, I feel like if I draw it down in a little greek on every, every month, very, very important part of my life, although it as a reserve is secondary. 
EDL	00:41:15,320	00:41:25,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But I also imagine that that boots on the ground experience now, as a program manager, completes the kind of liu prove that not all program managers can add
EDL	00:41:25,590	00:41:26,560	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I think it does help. 
EDL	00:41:26,560	00:41:39,180	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The area that it helps the most tennis when you're downrange with a special force, special operators, the amount of band with the amount of sensing you can get the distant amount of communication you can do is very limited
EDL	00:41:39,180	00:41:42,176	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You're typically moving that if you are so destroyed
EDL	00:41:42,176	00:41:46,370	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And what I'm trying to do, the program manager here is to give those type of point
EDL	00:41:46,370	00:42:02,141	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Sailor, soldiers, marines, whatever they are, the ability to move data at a much higher brand, with indicated data from sensors at all with the rise and not necessarily organic or unit immediately within seconds back to where they were without help, go through a grounded for structure
EDL	00:42:02,141	00:42:09,733	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So seeing how it is operated when I have been, downrange is really helped shape homes, set up the technology to for the future of a dark
EDL	00:42:09,733	00:42:11,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We can help you international nation. 
EDL	00:42:11,680	00:42:23,757	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	What's the recipe you've taken me and listeners on an amazing tour of in the summer, who has been the absolutely the last couple of decades, which is involved in space technology
EDL	00:42:23,757	00:42:26,180	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so I wanna thank you for doing that
EDL	00:42:26,180	00:42:27,360	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's really been a pleasure
EDL	00:42:27,360	00:42:28,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Well, thank you
EDL	00:42:28,020	00:42:29,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's been a bit of a great career
EDL	00:42:29,850	00:42:33,390	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm happy to be a DARPA and looking forward to the next doorstep to break down
EDL	00:42:33,390	00:42:35,720	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And where we're gonna be, gonna be cutting edge next year. 
EDL	00:42:36,320	00:42:47,077	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us, I hope you join this again for the next Voices from DARPA, 
EDL	00:42:47,077	00:42:54,056	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	for more information about Paul "rusty" Thomas, the programs he and his colleagues in the technical technology office runs

# Notes
In this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, Paul “Rusty” Thomas, a
program manager since 2017 in the Agency’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO),
chronicles how his several-decade career within the commercial space industry
has taught him a thing or two about designing, manufacturing, launching, and
operating more than 130 civilian and government satellites. At DARPA, he is
bringing that background to bear on one of the Agency’s more ambitious
space-technology projects, Blackjack, which upon completion could encompass a
mesh-like network of thousands of small and inexpensive satellites for
delivering global, all-the-time sensing, communications, and other
national-security services. With boots-on-the-ground experience in
Afghanistan, a pilot’s license, and a personal altitude of 6’8”, Rusty
projects a larger-than-life persona, illuminated by an infectious sense of
mission to innovate the way toward future-generation space technology.
