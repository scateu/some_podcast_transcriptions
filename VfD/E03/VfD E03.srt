2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,312
Sealth Technologies

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:18,432
The Internet, GPS in the palm of your hand. Autonomous operation.

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,856
Technology is a driver of our time since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War.

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:30,464
DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been a driver of Technology

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,792
Welcome to Voices from DARPA

7
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
A window at the DARPA's core of program managers

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Their job

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,448
To redefine what is possible

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,848
My name is Dan Green since 2013 I've been a program manager and DARPA's Microsystems technology office

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,152
And I'm your DARPA host

12
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Ivan Amato

13
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
Dan, tell me a little bit about your background and how it relates to what you hope to accomplish in your time here at DARPA

14
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,000
I came here through a series of fortunate events I got into science from an early age I like physics

15
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
I did physics in college

16
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
I got into semiconductor physics

17
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
So semiconductors are the

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
Materials that underpin the electronic

19
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
in all of our commercial Technologies today

20
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
And

21
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
Really fell in love with that area

22
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
At that point time which was in the in the 90s

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
When I started getting into electronics and

24
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,808
going out to grad school it was kind of a bad time to be doing electronics, because

25
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
There is a lot of maturity

26
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
And a lot of

27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,952
concern about where it was going to go from there because of

28
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,744
established players like Intel or

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,352
We're heading there hitting the stride and along came a new material system

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
Called Gallium Nitride (GaN)

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,960
Until I was part of this first wave of engineers that were brought up

32
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,592
Looking at gallium nitride to understanding its properties as it applies to transistor technology

33
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
Can you just spend a few seconds talking to us about

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
What is interesting about different kinds of semiconductors

35
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
So when you look at the history of semiconductors

36
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
straight, the transistors came out

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
from the labs of course

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
after the

39
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
the second world war, so it's been around for a long time

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
And the interesting pieces that

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
As dominant as silicon is today that was not at all obvious

42
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
When they started

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
And in fact when you look at the

44
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
The first transistors they were made of Germanium (锗)

45
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,987
And they look like crazy little contraption(新奇装置)

46
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:23,872
correct the size of a palm, essentially they jabbed a couple of

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,480
wires into this block of material and were able to extrapolate(外推) from that very

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
very rudimentary(早期) experiment that

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Hey we're really onto something here

50
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
It's obviously translated

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
to many billions dollars of

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
commercial activity now and

53
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
The complexity of this we can do things today is

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
astonishing

55
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
Really the key was

56
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,168
Going from Germanium to Silicon and a lot of the technical reasons that

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
made silicon

58
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
work

59
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
Relate to the fact that it's just

60
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
It warms combinations with other materials called oxide very easily

61
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
And so having that oxide layer

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,944
Really help control where the electrons flow

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,040
The ability to manipulate the the material structure

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
Is really what separated

65
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Silicon

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
from the other competitors of that time.

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,646
And the interesting peace that happened with the you know

68
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:12,000
the semiconductors zoo in the 80s and 90s

69
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,352
was the dramatic expansion of the materials that were able to manipulate in that matter

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
And so we went from

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,520
things like Silicon to our notice compound semiconductors where we use combinations of element

72
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
to create new material sets

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
So the first material set that

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
hit the mainstream is called gallium arsenide (砷化镓)

75
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,315
Instead of being, regular crystal just made of silicon atoms,

76
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,088
it has an alternating pattern of gallium and arsenic

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,696
Right and my understanding is going from Silicon to a Compound Semiconductor

78
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
like gallium arsenide

79
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
was hard enough

80
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,376
that it became a program at DARPA to try to

81
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
mature that material make it useful. - Absolutely right

82
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,752
DARPA made an early investment to take

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,080
What then was experimental technology of gallium arsenide

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,152
That was useful for things like amplifiers and

85
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
really scale it up

86
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
to make it manufacturable

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,208
Because they realize that it was going to enable us to do things

88
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,527
like arrays, phased-array

89
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,880
so what is a phased array phased arrays

90
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Is it is a

91
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
A combination of amplifiers in a repeated pattern

92
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
So that you can project electromagnetic waves

93
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
So that means things like

94
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
Radars that go on our

95
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
planes and ships

96
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
can leverage that capability to see what's around them and to communicate.

97
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
And what ended up happening was because of the

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,149
the defense interest in maturing that technology

99
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:34,943
and the ability to bring it to a manufacturable state

100
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,015
A lot of people realize that hey it would be useful for

101
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
commercial sector as well.

102
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,903
And so that same gallium arsenide technology that came out of the early DARPA

103
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
So-called MIMIC program

104
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
In the 90s

105
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
I was really what set off the cell phone release

106
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Because it enabled

107
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
The amplifiers that let

108
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
those small handsets that you carry around with you

109
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
to talk to

110
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
the cell phone towers.

111
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,335
And that expansion of of the semiconductors zoo we we we started with germanium

112
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
We talked about silicon we talked about gallium arsenide

113
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,450
This might be a good time to, sort of, moving to some of the programs that you've been overseeing

114
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,527
absolutely

115
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,111
gallium arsenide was was really exceptional because it showed

116
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,439
How different material properties can be by moving away from to silicon

117
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
But by no means did that exhaust the periodic table

118
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
And so as people were looking around

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
They realized

120
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
that there's a lot of other options

121
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
Late 90s and early 2000s

122
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
This was

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,311
An individual researcher actually develop the technology to grow high-quality

124
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Gallium nitride material

125
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Gallium nitride materials is special because

126
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
It. It offers a wider band gap. So that's a characteristic energy the material

127
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
And it enabled

128
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
devices to be made which could emit into the Blue

129
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
part of the electromagnetic spectrum

130
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
which was not available before.

131
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,720
That set off a whole wave in terms of lighting

132
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,095
and so we're saying that today with our pixelated stoplights and and the LEDs that we see now

133
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
in the houses

134
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,191
But the correlation that was it enable that material set

135
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
to be more widely available

136
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,103
And enable those of us in electronics domain to use it for other purposes

137
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
like high power amplifier

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Enable us to to look at

139
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Things like more efficient cell phone towers

140
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,575
But also higher power array for

141
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
The Navy and the and the Army and airforce

142
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
For the sensors and communications and the

143
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
electronic warfare equipment that we use everyday.

144
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,095
Right and I know that one of your own passions has been to try to

145
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,495
Look at the strengths of these different kinds of semiconductor materials in and then try to put them together to mix-and-match them

146
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,524
Correct. that might not have been so easy to do before

147
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:40,895
partly because their crystal structures are a little different and they might

148
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,900
not stick together well

149
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,770
so these are some of the challenges right that

150
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,015
you've been taking on as a program manager.

151
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Part of the interesting piece

152
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
with Gallium Nitride is

153
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,671
not so much that it provides all these advantages but then it works at all

154
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,999
It's a very different material set than historical semiconductors

155
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
It has a mechanical element that's a part of

156
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
The way that it operates more than just the way that it moves electronics around

157
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
It has what's known as peers' electric

158
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
And so it actually

159
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
depends upon being compressed

160
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
by the combination materials

161
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
in a certain state

162
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
to enable the electrons to exist

163
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
where we can use them.

164
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,271
So we can mix in a little aluminum for there are gallium and nitrogen

165
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
to create a different alloy and we

166
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,135
can grow those crystals right on top of each other

167
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
So that they maintain their structure from layer to layer

168
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,781
And a lot of the development that happened in the

169
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,193
early DARPA MIMIC project was enabling those techniques

170
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,863
where we can control that crystal

171
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
layering at the atomic scale

172
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
which enables us to create

173
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
these types of very finely

174
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
characterizes and structured devices

175
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
over very large area.

176
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
So we can create very complex circuits

177
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
that are structured at that atomic scale.

178
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
So where all this goes from here

179
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Because it has this

180
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,903
Funny characteristic of mechanical and electrical coupling that's different is that

181
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
There's a whole swath of degrees of freedom that haven't really makes explore with GaN

182
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
So I entered the field just as it was maturing

183
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
And worked at a company to help bring one of the initial products

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
to life in terms of

185
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
high power amplifier for the cell phone community

186
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
But my time at DARPA has really been about

187
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
Where do we go from here in terms of

188
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
leveraging all these

189
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,943
hidden attributes of gallium nitride that really haven't been

190
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
brought to the barrier yet

191
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,295
So things like scaling the gate lines down to hit the links that we do

192
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,391
And what that that enables us to do is push up higher and higher frequencies

193
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
So how do we understand that? well

194
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
The

195
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,583
The frequencies that we we commonly encounter for like our cell phone is around 2GHz

196
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,703
And really because the scaling advantages and that we can do with gallium nitride

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,543
The higher power density that we can't we can start to realize

198
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
The ability to transmit power

199
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,127
Up in the millimeter wave

200
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
So that's up

201
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
towards

202
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
30 to 300 gigahertz

203
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
It's the ability to dress that higher frequency range

204
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,497
really opens up a whole part of the electromagnetic spectrum

205
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:58,367
that we haven't been able to access before.

206
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
Why do you want to go there?

207
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,999
Because that will enable things like 5G

208
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
in the commercial sector.

209
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
There's a lot of activity right now.

210
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
That's going to help us all stream video from wherever we want.

211
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,239
But it also enables us to do different things like look at different material properties

212
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
As we interrogate what's going on with with different materials with

213
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
its different part in electromagnetic spectrum

214
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,455
So we can actually literally see the world in a different way

215
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Because we're using light at different wavelengths

216
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
the possibilities of what we can do there are just started to be explored

217
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,257
And the capabilities that we're developing with gallium nitride

218
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:34,207
are a building block and a tool to help us to get there.

219
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,071
Dan, how would you imagine the technologies

220
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,631
that you are nurturing you spoke speaking a lot about gallium nitride here.

221
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
How would image that finding traction

222
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
both in national security and civilian settings

223
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
So the

224
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,895
technologies were developing with gallium nitride

225
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
are going to be very are going to be very important

226
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
for national security because

227
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
It doesn't enable us to get into these new parts

228
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
of the electromagnetic spectrum

229
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
So that underpins

230
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
all of our capabilities when it comes to things like

231
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
communications

232
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
or sensing

233
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Coming from the civilian sector I didn't really understand until I worked

234
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
with some of the military

235
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
is that

236
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
we think why do you need to sense things

237
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
And

238
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
And we know what's down the block when we're walking down the street

239
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
But if you're in the Navy and you're on the ship in the middle of Pacific

240
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
You're in a very very dark place

241
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
And you don't know what's around you in the world

242
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
sensing becomes very important

243
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Because you're you're really out in the middle of nowhere

244
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,319
And that's part of the

245
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
The piece that's missing I think when we think about this in

246
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
context of our everyday lifes

247
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
That the military is doing things that are very different

248
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
from what we do in the commercial sector.

249
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,587
What we're doing with gallium nitride is enabling the technologies

250
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:45,375
that will help them with those particular missions

251
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,215
And what will happen at the end of the day is that once we have them

252
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
People are creative

253
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
And they will find ways to use those pieces

254
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
There are more relevant to what we doing

255
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
in our everyday lifes.

256
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,223
So what might be some of the larger societal technological in

257
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
security context in which your

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
program in interest reside?

259
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
It's a very interesting time right now in electronics

260
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
And because

261
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,231
historically the US has had such a dominant position in the development of these technologies

262
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
From the initial development of transistor Bell labs

263
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
through the

264
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
the mass roll out of

265
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
PCs from Intel.

266
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,263
And what we've seen is just in the last decade or so

267
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
Is the globalization of that technology has

268
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
spread around the world.

269
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,711
one of the byproducts of the early going where DARPA funded a lot of these gallium arsenide technologies

270
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
that rolled into our defense

271
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
defense communications

272
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
and sensing technologies

273
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
Was that we had a very comfortable

274
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
place in the world where we

275
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
could make all those components at home

276
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
and use them

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
in very controlled manners for our purposes.

278
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
And with this globalization that's taking place

279
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
because of the advent of cell phones

280
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
and mass consumer electronics

281
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
We're seeing now that

282
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
All these electronic pieces in these different developments

283
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
Are happening all over the world.

284
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
And so it really challenges us.

285
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
in the way that we

286
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
consumer electronics

287
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
and the Department of Defense.

288
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
Because now we

289
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
we don't necessarily have all of those

290
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
best components at home because there's a lot of

291
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
activity all over the world.

292
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
Until there is

293
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
there's challenges both understand what pieces

294
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
we should develop

295
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
And

296
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
can continue to own at home

297
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
And what pieces we should leverage in that global marketplace.

298
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
And how to put the the best of those products together,

299
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
so that we can commering competitive.

300
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,663
What you're talkin about here in some ways is the sort of the

301
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
technology

302
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
ecosystem the engineering ecosystem

303
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
innovation ecosystem and makes me think about

304
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
where DARPA fits into these very ecosystem

305
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
So DARPA really is fantastic and that

306
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
It has the ability to go in and make

307
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
significant investment

308
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
to advanced technologies

309
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Critical

310
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
and can really be a difference-maker

311
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,423
For instance, in gallium nitride

312
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
I mentioned

313
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
The new imports of GaN as it came along

314
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
to advancing what we can do in the RF Spectrum

315
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
And really that technology was

316
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
resound in the world

317
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Because of the LED market place.

318
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
But DARPA came along and

319
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
made a significant investment

320
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
in wide bandgap of semiconductors of which gallium nitride has won

321
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
To push the material that

322
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
That's base

323
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
For the electronics domain

324
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
And because of that early investment DARPA

325
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
has created capabilities

326
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
that are being rolled out now to the services and in

327
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
the form of new

328
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,993
radars that are going to the navy and communication systems

329
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,775
that are going around the services

330
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
And

331
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
It's also dominant

332
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
provided the backbone for

333
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
industry players that are serving commercial market as well

334
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
Dan, can you describe one

335
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,623
science fiction technology either that you read about in the past

336
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,728
you come up on your own you woken up in the middle of the night

337
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,463
with this dream of a technology

338
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
that it doesn't exist now but that you really wish

339
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
could exist?

340
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
This is what we do here cuz I spend time dreaming about different technology so

341
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,249
It's such a fascinating time

342
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,823
because a lot of these things that we formally just dreamed about are

343
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
coming to life around us.

344
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,711
The one Comic Book I did read when I was a kid was Iron Man, and so

345
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,015
We now have all these Iron Man movies but

346
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,746
What's fascinating is walking around the building

347
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:18,879
and seeing how parts of those technologies are trying to make it look

348
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,695
less and less crazy. You started to see

349
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:23,743
people are actually working on exosuits

350
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
people who are working on

351
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
how we connect the body to electronics,

352
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,423
how we actually interface with electronics.

353
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,660
So you're talking here about complex and potentially powerful technologies

354
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,311
which means they could lead

355
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
To both good and

356
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
perhaps troublesome results.

357
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,967
How do you think about the potential consequences of the technology

358
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
You're helping to develop?

359
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
So I think that's an

360
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
interesting question that we do struggle with a lot.

361
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
As we continue to expand our capability to

362
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
compute

363
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
and

364
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
project

365
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
into the electromagnetic spectrum.

366
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Really raises the ability for us to

367
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
to be always on

368
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,579
and always connected.

369
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,495
And it not only did that

370
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
erase all the issues that

371
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
received today in terms of

372
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,591
having your cell phone on all the time and

373
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,383
being that sense always on

374
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
But also this

375
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
always aware

376
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
So that there's no way to hide things

377
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,551
and so, it becomes a very open and transparent

378
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
place to be which has pluses and minuses

379
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
in terms of how we operate

380
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
as a democracy in the world.

381
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
So I think there's a lot of

382
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
implications of technology that are yet to be grappled with.

383
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
But it's also

384
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
a law of physics that technology will advance.

385
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
We will continue to explore the world so

386
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
It doesn't help us to not try to advance

387
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
And see what's what's possible

388
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
The whole point of DARPA is to prevent surprise

389
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
And really part of our job here is to go out to figure out what's possible

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
so we can start that process

391
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
of understanding it early

392
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,695
Well Dan, I really enjoyed our conversation here today

393
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Thank you, Ivan.

394
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,071
Thanks for listening and tune in next time to hear another Voice from DARPA

395
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
