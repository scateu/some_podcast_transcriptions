EDL	00:00:11,790	00:00:13,100	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Stop technology. 
EDL	00:00:13,100	00:00:30,940	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The internet GPS in the column of your hand are tonight with technology is a driver of our times since its founding in nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research agency has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:31,560	00:00:39,200	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window on the darkest core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:39,720	00:00:42,910	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	My name is , I went a mutual on your dopp a host today . 
EDL	00:00:42,910	00:00:56,280	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I am pleased to be talking with that your time roundup , who joined the dark as a program manager in twenty sixteen , first in the microsoft technology before transferring into the strategic technology , is still in may . 
EDL	00:00:56,850	00:01:06,354	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	We are recording our conversation from our respective homes as we do our part to slow the spread of coffee nineteenth , because we are not in a recording studio . 
EDL	00:01:06,354	00:01:09,100	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You made your ambient sounds like trucks or trains . 
EDL	00:01:09,100	00:01:18,703	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Let me tell you a little bit earlier in the morning , he collected three electrical engineering degrees from virginia technique , blacksburg , running his ph d in two thousand and eight . 
EDL	00:01:18,703	00:01:22,840	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Several years before that , he got seriously involved with a good new radio project . 
EDL	00:01:22,840	00:01:40,390	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's GNU, like animal , which is an open source heaven for radio hackers , makers and others interested in using software models to do a wide range of radio anchor task , communicating with satellites or controlling household drones as a visiting scholar at the university of pennsylvania . 
EDL	00:01:40,390	00:01:47,328	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And as a research scientists at the institute for defence center for communications research in prison , new jersey , TOM . 
EDL	00:01:47,328	00:01:57,020	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Further those causes , which is work on other things on architectures and algorithms in signal processing for communications and the monitoring and use of the electronic expected . 
EDL	00:01:57,350	00:02:00,665	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Thomas is much of a community builder as he is a tech guy . 
EDL	00:02:00,665	00:02:11,260	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	He has organized many conferences and workshops , and has been spreading the world like an adventurers and new technologies in wireless signal processing , among other radio techniques . 
EDL	00:02:11,260	00:02:23,180	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Town's current interest include adapted in weaken figure of radios , improving the development cycle for new single processing techniques and creating general purpose electrical systems . 
EDL	00:02:23,180	00:02:26,474	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Tomorrow , thanks for joining mysterious conversation . 
EDL	00:02:26,474	00:02:27,133	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yeah , thanks . 
EDL	00:02:27,133	00:02:28,011	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I was excited . 
EDL	00:02:28,011	00:02:43,104	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So before we dive into your portfolio group programs , which ranged from software defined radios , and we will explain to a new category of powerful , yet affordable chips for specialty computation , intense applications like signal processing . 
EDL	00:02:43,104	00:02:47,360	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Let's give listener some sense of how radio technology became your. 
EDL	00:02:47,360	00:02:52,941	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	As you mentioned , I, Igot all three degrees from a virgin attack and black spot . 
EDL	00:02:52,941	00:02:57,310	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And what happened was an unconvenient intellectual resource . 
EDL	00:02:57,310	00:03:09,382	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So I was also getting a little chairman , english literature , one of my english professors think , realized my restlessness , put me in touch with charles boston , who was a professor of electrical engineering . 
EDL	00:03:09,382	00:03:13,828	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But his wife , the freedom was a member of the effectively the english department . 
EDL	00:03:13,828	00:03:16,062	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So there are chinese connection there . 
EDL	00:03:16,062	00:03:18,092	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And I freely just walked into trouble . 
EDL	00:03:18,092	00:03:24,386	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	His office , a drug , boxing at the time and said he was a software , said he had a panda board later to do more . 
EDL	00:03:24,386	00:03:26,277	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Well , you made the most my university career . 
EDL	00:03:26,277	00:03:31,341	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I was more involved in my processors and networking , and just kind of how to make computers talk to each other . 
EDL	00:03:31,341	00:03:37,249	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And charles is a wireless guy that we can accomplish notes and start to really look at a wireless networking , so we can . 
EDL	00:03:37,249	00:03:43,470	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It took me on the test , the song , moreover , a summer period and was impressed enough that it was doing some bluetooth work . 
EDL	00:03:43,470	00:03:50,030	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This is back in two thousand so early , early in the bluetooth era in person after it became me on , I kept working on lab . 
EDL	00:03:50,030	00:03:57,986	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Do more stuff , higher frequency staff and radio propagation staff in an eventual determined to a massive degree . 
EDL	00:03:57,986	00:04:03,160	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And he called me , well funded , well , engaged with wireless stuff followers in my pitch. 
EDL	00:04:03,160	00:04:13,140	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Well , beautiful , we should all have such men tools I always love , and I hear about , you know , teachers and individuals , but you know , adults , and I like to really have had transformative effects . 
EDL	00:04:13,140	00:04:16,130	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What sounds like you like this profit was that person for you. 
EDL	00:04:16,450	00:04:22,270	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yeah , manager is the right words used for him that the number of things beyond just the skills of researcher . 
EDL	00:04:22,270	00:04:34,220	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And as an engineer that I learned from him out of people in our situations just had to behave as a adult in the , in the field as an engineer that is doing more than just the court. 
EDL	00:04:34,220	00:04:35,842	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You'd grateful that , okay . 
EDL	00:04:35,842	00:04:38,391	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So what happened along this trajectory ? 
EDL	00:04:38,391	00:04:45,105	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And as you , this interested your development , pacified as you became very much involved in the coming radio organization . 
EDL	00:04:45,105	00:04:49,459	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So what I would , most people , I think listening might not know what that is about . 
EDL	00:04:49,459	00:04:53,246	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And so I developed it just say , briefly , what is the good new radio project ? 
EDL	00:04:53,246	00:04:54,950	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And then I love to know what catalyze. 
EDL	00:04:54,950	00:05:05,171	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Near the dark , the new radio is a free and open source software framework for building software defined radio capabilities . 
EDL	00:05:05,171	00:05:16,950	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So desperate , fine radio , it is the ability to program in your computer signal processing technology , appointing mass to signals that manipulate the electronic spectrum . 
EDL	00:05:16,950	00:05:20,110	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And so we see here is that electronic spectrum . 
EDL	00:05:20,110	00:05:24,301	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Electronic are one of the four fundamental forces of the universe . 
EDL	00:05:24,301	00:05:31,440	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And we saw for radio allows us to do is right programs that manipulate one of four fundamental forces of universe . 
EDL	00:05:32,110	00:05:40,930	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And once that thought really hit me , and he had a number of business field that was that kind of all moment of all this going . 
EDL	00:05:40,930	00:05:43,330	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This is , this is incredible . 
EDL	00:05:43,740	00:05:47,310	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This is breaking open and making accessible to us . 
EDL	00:05:47,310	00:06:00,050	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And two hundreds of thousands of people around the world , they are beauty to access and control this thing that controls , as you mention drones , sadly , over cell phones or utility systems are now all connected in communication . 
EDL	00:06:00,050	00:06:04,320	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Honestly , I usually reach , feel that that is is rude in this . 
EDL	00:06:04,320	00:06:07,230	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And google radio is this tool that allows us to make. 
EDL	00:06:07,230	00:06:09,800	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That happened in the robot , oh , no time . 
EDL	00:06:09,800	00:06:20,146	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So you mentioned the world , you are having a kind of movement is your thinking about the electronic magnetic phenomenon , the world , and how you connect the interact with it . 
EDL	00:06:20,146	00:06:38,600	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So this reminds me of something that I know I want to get the timing of you have on your arm or arms tattooed the famous four equations from maximum of four equations to scribe electronically phenomena was at this time that you were moved to get those status. 
EDL	00:06:39,100	00:06:41,024	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yes , it actually wants . 
EDL	00:06:41,024	00:07:02,560	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It was thinking about those four equations , but this is an excellent equations , and that shows us as as something that we , as humans have done , which is understand this , this incredible force and what it does for us are qualified in these four , in some senses , relatively simple , but they want to , you break up down the very complicated equations . 
EDL	00:07:02,560	00:07:12,250	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And so there are the third attitude I got to reach on on each forum , and I looked down at those every , every day and and have that moment of all of what we believe that we. 
EDL	00:07:12,930	00:07:21,380	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I've already to meet you in , that is one of the best metaphors of the kind of devotion you often see to science and technology . 
EDL	00:07:21,380	00:07:22,670	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Buy program like you . 
EDL	00:07:22,670	00:07:23,970	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So very cool . 
EDL	00:07:23,970	00:07:28,490	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The second half of my question here was , so you described the new radio . 
EDL	00:07:28,490	00:07:31,030	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What is it then that got you to? 
EDL	00:07:31,380	00:07:40,737	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And what happened was in two thousand fifteen , I met bill chapel , who was the director of the microsystem office , and he invited me to a big DARPA , even called weight . 
EDL	00:07:40,737	00:07:44,354	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That was showcasing what the dark of capabilities and technology . 
EDL	00:07:44,354	00:07:46,907	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And he wanted me to come and talk about this . 
EDL	00:07:46,907	00:07:57,047	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Now , this was my first interaction with DARPA as a grassroot in electronic engineering , especially from the school like virginia attack , were well aware of dark . 
EDL	00:07:57,047	00:07:58,851	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's part of our funding source . 
EDL	00:07:58,851	00:08:01,030	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's part of growth in the research community . 
EDL	00:08:01,030	00:08:04,980	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So I met bill , and it was always in the back of my head that I love to go to dark . 
EDL	00:08:04,980	00:08:12,600	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I love to be the kind of person I can make the contributions to the technology of the country and larger the , that's what darker . 
EDL	00:08:12,600	00:08:19,990	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yeah , I always represented to me is that the most impressive , cutting edge you , this world of the quarter comes from , so it was always the back of my head . 
EDL	00:08:19,990	00:08:22,170	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I wanted to do this , but I never felt ready . 
EDL	00:08:22,170	00:08:23,380	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I might be able to figure it . 
EDL	00:08:23,380	00:08:25,730	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You know , what are not already foreign . 
EDL	00:08:25,730	00:08:26,550	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I think I am ready . 
EDL	00:08:26,550	00:08:32,320	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's time to to step up and take the opportunity to see about getting into a position like this . 
EDL	00:08:32,700	00:08:44,830	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So I ask bill , and he said , looks like , but the reason why I want to do that back to the real through the question was the elevation of focusing on this , this project in the radio , which is wonderful . 
EDL	00:08:44,830	00:09:03,558	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But I had this increase that I wanted to be able to affect more , and that's the opportunity that I saw a dark was to , instead of just coding , I was able to organize and really put real resources behind some of the ideas that were in the back of my head when I wanted to accomplish . 
EDL	00:09:03,558	00:09:06,226	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And what I thought technology could become . 
EDL	00:09:06,226	00:09:14,421	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And so yeah , so I jumped at an opportunity was made of twenty sixteen when I got to sit down for the first office meeting with crumble . 
EDL	00:09:14,421	00:09:17,918	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The program managers and kind of realized out in over my head . 
EDL	00:09:17,918	00:09:24,090	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I actually , once , when you , when you meet your fellow peers of dark parts are pretty uninspiring back to that again. 
EDL	00:09:24,090	00:09:32,574	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You might have been involved your head for a while , but you shouldn't come to embrace the job and really become quite the PM with quite an amazing portfolio . 
EDL	00:09:32,574	00:09:34,350	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's why I want to get into now . 
EDL	00:09:34,350	00:09:40,626	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So let's take a tour of the , in the fascinating programs that you and overseas , initially empty , owned . 
EDL	00:09:40,626	00:09:47,286	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And now MSTO, the two , two of the six dark technical offices , let's talk briefly about two programs . 
EDL	00:09:47,286	00:09:54,070	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The same related one goes by the name domain specific system on cheap programs , and one of the things related to me . 
EDL	00:09:54,070	00:09:59,290	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But you're clarified that goes by the name , software defined hardware . 
EDL	00:09:59,290	00:10:02,301	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So talking to me , well , the ocean , yeah , we hope to achieve with them . 
EDL	00:10:02,301	00:10:04,220	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And what the status of those programs. 
EDL	00:10:04,220	00:10:11,700	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Those who took great programs , I was able to formulate the full domain specific system on chip or DSsock program . 
EDL	00:10:11,700	00:10:24,760	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And then I worked closely with the other program manager who crafted the estate for themselves from a fine hardware , but I had been running their program for the past year when he left the agency to people on familiar with software . 
EDL	00:10:24,760	00:10:34,850	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It might seem weird that I went to DARPA and started running processor programs , but that's what the software defined in this really means is that what are the radio spectrum ? 
EDL	00:10:34,850	00:10:47,910	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And the more you want to do , the more processing power you need in order to to do all those cool , single manipulations that make sadly communications work that make five g technologies . 
EDL	00:10:48,250	00:10:52,710	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So new processors are cool to meet in this habitat . 
EDL	00:10:53,110	00:11:02,538	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The assault , it was all about trying to understand how to overcome the limitation of general purpose , embedded computing . 
EDL	00:11:02,538	00:11:12,228	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What I mean by that is taking your general purpose , install processor , which call about that processor is , it can do almost any mathematical competition . 
EDL	00:11:12,228	00:11:12,690	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You can . 
EDL	00:11:13,120	00:11:22,220	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It doesn't necessarily do anything particularly well , but we were able to use that as our programming platform for all the general radio work . 
EDL	00:11:22,690	00:11:27,647	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So we are , we were you using and slightly miss using this , this great general process . 
EDL	00:11:27,647	00:11:50,710	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So , but what we realizes your every generation of a processor coming out , we be able to do more because you can do news if they're faster , the lower power , all those cool things that were coming with more slow as you start to see some of those that no size of the future sizes of these transistors starting to come to to the end of the lines , far is just free processing power in . 
EDL	00:11:50,710	00:11:56,272	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You are waiting months or whatever , and so stealing from once in churchill , we realized the months are now . 
EDL	00:11:56,272	00:11:58,682	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's time to think the transition is running out . 
EDL	00:11:58,682	00:12:09,059	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's time to think what we she've LED earlier in our thinking and coming out it from the sino processing rules , like , you know , hazards , a lot of math that we go over and over again . 
EDL	00:12:09,059	00:12:14,660	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What if we build a hard work salary that did just that , but then we tied it down to a system on chip . 
EDL	00:12:14,660	00:12:37,360	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So lots of these different courts that all work on the same silicon chip package together that we could kind of balance this general purpose processing and special purpose computation to be able to accelerate those core math problems that we kept we keep burning into if we can make use of that , we get to accelerate our ability to control back to the control of the electronic government . 
EDL	00:12:37,800	00:12:40,170	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So that was the correspondence . 
EDL	00:12:40,170	00:12:43,360	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Now , the second part about the assault that's really important to me . 
EDL	00:12:43,360	00:12:55,933	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And one of the key concepts of a new processor to me is , if you give me a new processor without code , without a compiler , without a way to use it from software , you've literally just handed me so little fat sand . 
EDL	00:12:55,933	00:12:57,552	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And that is that all is good for . 
EDL	00:12:57,552	00:13:02,480	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So coming out from their perspective , the is also about the software tools . 
EDL	00:13:02,480	00:13:14,010	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	How do you actually make use of with no call in many core hydrogen is computation system , so we can have dozens , of course , each one of them doing different jobs of more effectively than other . 
EDL	00:13:14,010	00:13:25,410	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	How do you distribute the software down onto a trip like that without it becoming a massive burden to the developer , we couldn't rely on the general purpose processors to give us the speed . 
EDL	00:13:25,410	00:13:36,360	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So what kind of balancing knows out by having some special purpose and some general purpose and taking advantage of of the small transistor , no sizes that more slaw has produced , and I see more release . 
EDL	00:13:36,360	00:13:40,340	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The hard work is the entire silicon industry is produced for us , and then make a program. 
EDL	00:13:40,340	00:13:43,747	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That program sounds like there is really hardware component . 
EDL	00:13:43,747	00:13:53,500	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What it might be hard work century and a sense of specific models where software to find hardware sounds like you are using software to get specialized hardware. 
EDL	00:13:53,500	00:13:59,100	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yes , and the core distinction is every engineering problem is a trade off . 
EDL	00:13:59,510	00:14:07,246	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And when I go , we're seeing in both the asylum establishes , you can get program ability and high performance in the same trip . 
EDL	00:14:07,246	00:14:13,768	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And currently those are are competing objectives , so you only can get both and give high program ability . 
EDL	00:14:13,768	00:14:31,519	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And the jump of his processor , highest specialization and efficiency in the athlete , we're saying that you can actually get both , but we're giving up something , so we're not going to replace the entire process or in your work station , or your laptop is create different types of architectures that meet different needs . 
EDL	00:14:31,519	00:14:41,000	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	In my case , that the assault needs was in better processing and really hipper , specialized math processing on the signals , or or video or image . 
EDL	00:14:41,000	00:14:51,960	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	There's whatever , what SDAjust asking is a different context of problems of a space of problems , big data , machine learning , large data sets . 
EDL	00:14:51,960	00:15:12,980	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You know , talking billions of a of bate of data or billions of trolls of images , or or or social networks , are whatever , whatever we're trying to understand and computer against the challenge with that kind of computational model is moving deeper in and out of the processor . 
EDL	00:15:13,410	00:15:15,230	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's typically a limitation . 
EDL	00:15:15,230	00:15:20,920	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Often our processes are bored waiting for data to be delivered to them , and the really fast . 
EDL	00:15:20,920	00:15:26,014	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And it takes a military offload that data back into memory , so offered a fine hardware . 
EDL	00:15:26,014	00:15:40,998	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Is , how do you stuff software program , ability of the memory access models in order to make sure that you're balancing the data movement and competition , and again , without overburdening , the programmer for , for trying to specialize to this , this new architecture . 
EDL	00:15:40,998	00:15:46,270	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So that's the , the , the similarities and the subtle distinctions between the two and the two. 
EDL	00:15:46,270	00:15:50,740	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Let's settle it to another program since a little bit like software to find hardware . 
EDL	00:15:50,740	00:15:56,461	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So this one is called soccer to find the radio for a point out , and I think that might actually rules to go . 
EDL	00:15:56,461	00:15:57,355	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Go back away for you . 
EDL	00:15:57,355	00:15:58,520	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So what about that? 
EDL	00:15:58,520	00:16:02,145	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yes , the software , fine radio is still four points on . 
EDL	00:16:02,145	00:16:13,726	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This is again thinking about DSS , a new table processing framework and architecture and programming environment for doing things like software , financial processing . 
EDL	00:16:13,726	00:16:20,700	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But then you have , we had a good new radio , which was designed to take advantage of general purpose in jail . 
EDL	00:16:20,700	00:16:41,280	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Type course , we need to bridge that gap , and so what we're thinking about , what's your four point now is , how do we make a general programming environment like an radio able to target hydrogen year's processors , and in reason , why is because , as imagine general proposed , processors can do anything , just not particularly . 
EDL	00:16:41,280	00:16:51,370	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But then you have other procedures like the famous wondering that everybody talks about as AGPwith the graphics processor unit , a lot of machine learning is now done on GPU . 
EDL	00:16:51,370	00:16:54,240	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	They're good for what we call densely neurological . 
EDL	00:16:54,240	00:17:02,076	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	There's a lot of problems that are represented as dense , linear , arguable problems and floated to GPU is really well . 
EDL	00:17:02,076	00:17:06,747	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Then there's other things like few programmable gatherings or FPGA . 
EDL	00:17:06,747	00:17:11,710	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Those are really good for high throughout high eye or input pricing problems . 
EDL	00:17:11,710	00:17:21,110	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Each one of these has a role to play in different stages of of processing and entire signal working in radio had no idea how to take advantage of those . 
EDL	00:17:21,870	00:17:24,992	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So we've been looking at this problem for a while . 
EDL	00:17:24,992	00:17:41,840	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This hydrogen is crushing problem as it will lead , but the assault is coming along , and we're going , frankly , amazing stuff and in , but we also need to suffer programming environment that can take advantage of existing hydrogen users or even future hydro genius type . 
EDL	00:17:42,170	00:18:11,910	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So then if I take what you will take a step back , and I think about , because i'm also a history nerd as the maximum equations probably include , but going back to the evening to the seventy people really started to start programming in these digital single processors are DSP , you know , that was kind of the release ages of what became so far radio , and then in the nineties , there was a single speak easy , and this was actually ADODfunded project to create this , this machine called speeches that was like the first soft video . 
EDL	00:18:11,910	00:18:29,630	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So that's kind of generation , two of software for one radios when we really qualified what a mental process , all the signals and in computers , and then good news radio , I think , represents today , what the third generation is , which is a small dinner , make flexible processing stage of the singles . 
EDL	00:18:30,020	00:18:43,650	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And so we are thinking , what next is , let's , let's do good processing with program ability and mixing those together with ahead of genius processing nature of all the processes . 
EDL	00:18:43,650	00:18:46,330	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's the fourth generation of software video . 
EDL	00:18:46,640	00:18:56,010	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's what china do is make these things both again , flexible and programmable , but also take advantage of efficiencies that different types of. 
EDL	00:18:56,010	00:18:57,510	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Elements provide for us . 
EDL	00:18:57,960	00:19:05,600	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	There are so to to finish out this tour , more of the research that you are overseen , talking about a relatively small , effective . 
EDL	00:19:05,600	00:19:06,790	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It is called hatch. 
EDL	00:19:07,200	00:19:11,140	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It uses more effort in daughter terms , but he said , it really keeps me in . 
EDL	00:19:11,140	00:19:11,590	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	My heart . 
EDL	00:19:11,590	00:19:11,920	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Is dark . 
EDL	00:19:11,920	00:19:13,070	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Program manager . 
EDL	00:19:13,070	00:19:19,627	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This is a new embedded device that makes software defined radio practical . 
EDL	00:19:19,627	00:19:32,712	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So what I mean by that is to communicate to the audience , radio spectrum , the election background , you need to have the ability to come into to transition between the art of waves . 
EDL	00:19:32,712	00:19:34,590	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And as the digital processors. 
EDL	00:19:34,590	00:19:37,480	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	More programming , like a radio frequency waves in the process. 
EDL	00:19:37,480	00:19:47,480	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yeah , so what we are trying to do with hydrogen is take advantage of dark technology , one that we ran in a program called the r FPGA . 
EDL	00:19:47,480	00:19:49,794	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And that program is a lawyer academy . 
EDL	00:19:49,794	00:19:54,192	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But I talked about few programmable gatherings before FGA. 
EDL	00:19:54,192	00:19:59,517	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Those are digital processors that they can be reprogrammed to do a lot of things . 
EDL	00:19:59,517	00:20:03,002	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What are , but we do the same thing with analog signals . 
EDL	00:20:03,002	00:20:10,757	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Can we have a programmable array , a signal processing , your amplifiers and mixers and isolators and and futures . 
EDL	00:20:10,757	00:20:20,860	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	These are important building blocks in the for communicating , transmitting signals into the spectrum or receiving signals and in capturing them . 
EDL	00:20:20,860	00:20:36,099	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So I heard of that project when I came to double it , we also worked , were investing in work with zillions to create a new type of embedded of pg processor , which had embedded analytics and digital dynamic converters . 
EDL	00:20:36,099	00:20:43,241	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Now , those are how we DHO blocks that moved it between the digital world in the end of the world . 
EDL	00:20:43,241	00:20:51,514	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So we thought we could remind these r FPGA s with this in better processor , with the integrated converters . 
EDL	00:20:51,514	00:21:00,000	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That is a really amazing package that crazy and bedded software , fine radio platform for us . 
EDL	00:21:00,000	00:21:03,020	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Digital operating system on the processor . 
EDL	00:21:03,020	00:21:07,046	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It'll do the digital signal processing portion of the FPGA . 
EDL	00:21:07,046	00:21:27,155	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And it talks to this r FPGA , not a really interesting thing about us , and why we call the head truck is because it has multiple channels so you could connect sixteen and tennis to a head shock device , and something is , this is in a lecturer electronic world . 
EDL	00:21:27,155	00:21:41,831	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This is caught in a ray activity of the strawberries , or there's a lot of talk about that , especially with five g the more and tennis you have , the more it , it becomes an array that you can manipulate . 
EDL	00:21:41,831	00:21:44,900	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Well , it turns out that the collective noun for hatches . 
EDL	00:21:44,900	00:21:46,260	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So I thought I knew potential . 
EDL	00:21:46,260	00:22:06,381	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I was , because I thought that was fun , but the other really cool thing is not only easy in multi channel digital informing system , multi channel , multi function , because every antenna could be doing a different function , one could be scanning the spectrum for , for signals for interference . 
EDL	00:22:06,381	00:22:12,260	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	One could be communicating to a sort of other could be communicating to satellite frequently . 
EDL	00:22:12,950	00:22:23,620	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So I truly call it on the other thing that we're pushing on in the system is the traditional commercial software radio system , the bedrock of all of all we do . 
EDL	00:22:23,620	00:22:26,600	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But there are typically limited to about six bigger hurts . 
EDL	00:22:26,600	00:22:33,987	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What subsequent hurts is important is that where most tourist real communications happened . 
EDL	00:22:33,987	00:22:44,598	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So your TVand over their TVam FM broadcast most cell phone up until fifth generation , all cellphones open to face generation are under the six . 
EDL	00:22:44,598	00:22:48,360	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Giga hurts so six times ten to the nine cycles per second . 
EDL	00:22:48,360	00:22:49,370	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's great . 
EDL	00:22:49,370	00:22:58,716	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But what's happening now in the world is more people are trying to push into the higher spectrum , higher frequencies in the US. 
EDL	00:22:58,716	00:23:02,762	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The five g high band colleague , you'll also care , called no leader wave . 
EDL	00:23:02,762	00:23:05,950	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Those are about twenty a gaga hurts thirty seven . 
EDL	00:23:05,950	00:23:07,650	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Gaga hurt thirty nine gager hers . 
EDL	00:23:07,650	00:23:09,562	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Those are some of the new bands . 
EDL	00:23:09,562	00:23:17,300	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Those are well outside of almost people have access to , and so hydrogen is actually pushing up to cover . 
EDL	00:23:17,300	00:23:17,720	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	forty . 
EDL	00:23:17,720	00:23:23,910	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Giggle hurts , so could tune this thing up as high as the high , the high band of five , two . 
EDL	00:23:24,550	00:23:25,830	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And why is that important to me ? 
EDL	00:23:25,830	00:23:40,813	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This kind of goes back to the kenya radio foundation , what we did in canada , radio was really open this access to the document for people to change how they learn , what singles are , what , what radio waves are . 
EDL	00:23:40,813	00:23:48,580	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	We teach things differently now because of this type of technology , millimeter wave signals behave differently in the world . 
EDL	00:23:48,580	00:23:50,680	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	They , they just , they , they bounce off of things . 
EDL	00:23:50,680	00:23:52,950	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	They don't penetrate things this. 
EDL	00:23:52,950	00:23:57,090	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The range of ways of millionaire ways that you are talking about that sort of forty and gigas. 
EDL	00:23:57,090	00:24:00,449	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The thirtieth of the four days he had that type of those of these special . 
EDL	00:24:00,449	00:24:11,460	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This happens in millimeter ways , so we behave differently , and we don't have the tools to access them , and really , really have that level of engagement that we do with the lower bans . 
EDL	00:24:11,460	00:24:35,860	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And so we were hoping that we learn through kind of collective research and and just being able to have more researchers do , and their flexibility of programming the spectrum and and changing the way that they engage the spectrum , maybe hundreds of times per day to tweak , to tune something to to see how things behaved differently . 
EDL	00:24:35,860	00:24:44,450	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's the level , level of access that the device of casualties can give us two to the state of spectrum , this unknown space that works you were trying to operate. 
EDL	00:24:44,780	00:24:50,447	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Okay , so what , just a couple of things like one is , it is very interesting to hear you are making a possible . 
EDL	00:24:50,447	00:25:02,830	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The crowd source investigation in areas of the electronic expectation that had not really been that accessible to as many this program will open it up to the question now is , then , how do you connect this to say the dark mission? 
EDL	00:25:03,570	00:25:20,580	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Which means the complexity of of interacting with the large amount of them is well beyond what we can do with the numbers and resources that we have within the do d and so for us to take advantage of it . 
EDL	00:25:20,580	00:25:34,400	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	We really have to to engage the wider community and learn from them and build a mass of a research and research body that can help us tease the part . 
EDL	00:25:34,400	00:25:37,250	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	What's really important , what's not , what's effective . 
EDL	00:25:37,250	00:25:38,080	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And what is it ? 
EDL	00:25:38,590	00:25:54,640	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So what were were balancing the need for technological superiority in surprise , but with building a better understanding and engagement with this incredibly complicated , but force that we , we use for all of us stuff. 
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:26:08,104	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Right , so we're getting to the end here , but you just made me want to ask you a certain question , or someone who has been so mercy in the electronic mechanic phenomenon to the point that you actually tattooed maximum occasions on your arms . 
EDL	00:26:08,104	00:26:18,310	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And when you look out at air at the end , you're bringing in a sort of radio sensitivity in a radio kind of mine said , yeah . 
EDL	00:26:18,310	00:26:29,660	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So you know how health failed every little millimeter of the air is , so must be a kind of very rich thing to have that understanding emerging industry , in which is your sense of nature. 
EDL	00:26:29,660	00:26:38,642	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yes , I actually think it does , you know , the ultimate force operates on this level of visible late that we see through our radio waves at the community . 
EDL	00:26:38,642	00:26:42,055	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	As it said , the satellite is the phones to their wireless . 
EDL	00:26:42,055	00:26:43,460	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Senators , obviously not . 
EDL	00:26:43,460	00:26:56,960	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It is in this sweet spot for us to use , manipulate and in bad information , and so we can move this , how we , we get over information moved around the world is through electronic development force . 
EDL	00:26:56,960	00:26:58,580	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	That's the decade . 
EDL	00:26:58,580	00:27:05,120	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's not just to play with is for the second playing with ways , but it is connecting information and moving information around us . 
EDL	00:27:05,120	00:27:32,440	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So so when I think about that , what you just said , that kind of poverty , sense of the world being surrounded by electronic waves , when I really see is this , this interface of of information , which has been important to us as society , to move our , to move our stories around , to move friendships around to our economies , all that embedded in the fourth in some way . 
EDL	00:27:32,440	00:27:37,120	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And again , that's what we are trying to help understand better and expose more people. 
EDL	00:27:37,960	00:27:39,590	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	We have worked with them . 
EDL	00:27:39,590	00:27:43,140	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Nicely said , I just actually met one more question before really close out . 
EDL	00:27:43,140	00:27:45,610	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And it has to do with the internet of things . 
EDL	00:27:45,610	00:27:51,180	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	This , the billions of various gadgets , smaller and large that are striving for . 
EDL	00:27:51,180	00:27:59,980	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Since , you know , two of the electoral magnetic spectrum to give a receive signal , sensor , signal , signals in geolocation date and all kinds . 
EDL	00:28:00,370	00:28:05,010	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And the second right now , this is probably another ten thousand of these internet of things . 
EDL	00:28:05,010	00:28:06,390	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Gadgets such as one online . 
EDL	00:28:06,740	00:28:14,740	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So when you think about that explosive growth and the program , so that it seems of your programs , what's the interviewer there? 
EDL	00:28:15,320	00:28:29,908	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's been since the three , geez , like since then , nine days since the world has been this excited about wireless technology for , and part of it is IOT , because all those devices need to communicate over the spectrum . 
EDL	00:28:29,908	00:28:37,032	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And I don't go so far to say the special message , scarce resource it is , it is a renewable resource . 
EDL	00:28:37,032	00:28:40,120	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It's not like if you one hurts , it is gone forever . 
EDL	00:28:40,120	00:28:42,990	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	You can use it , but it doesn't become congested . 
EDL	00:28:42,990	00:28:43,510	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	It does . 
EDL	00:28:43,510	00:28:48,790	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	They do step on each other that what we call interference in the military campaign jamming . 
EDL	00:28:49,257	00:28:54,955	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Though these , these devices communicating this understanding of the automatic spectrum . 
EDL	00:28:54,955	00:29:09,674	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So just thinking about it from the ability to see and engage to the automatic is one of the things that cannot be necessary for us to tease apart these challenges of making these billions of devices can work and communicate together . 
EDL	00:29:09,674	00:29:26,429	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The second thing is all of the personnel we do the way what I lead to call manuva bill , being manufacturer of changing frequency is changing away forms of avoiding other signals that you can communicate all that the stuff is going to take processing power . 
EDL	00:29:26,429	00:29:28,237	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And all these IOT voices are . 
EDL	00:29:28,237	00:29:30,722	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Many of them are connected to war power . 
EDL	00:29:30,722	00:29:36,146	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	They got batteries , so you have to build better , more effective processing capabilities . 
EDL	00:29:36,146	00:29:45,942	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The process of so the radios have to be more efficient are programming and applications use of those sources , powers the scarce resource here . 
EDL	00:29:45,942	00:29:54,816	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And so that's those two key aspects of how do we use the radio spectrum efficiently , and how do we manage our battery lies on these edge processors . 
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:30:03,248	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The edge devices are better powered , both of those who can see themselves in the programs between ideas or program to the heritage program to STR. 
EDL	00:30:03,248	00:30:06,090	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Four points out trying to make can combine a lot of. 
EDL	00:30:06,090	00:30:14,010	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Well , attempts you usually are on at the four friends of many of the most important technological true jackets of these times . 
EDL	00:30:14,510	00:30:15,430	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Really exciting . 
EDL	00:30:15,430	00:30:18,070	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So i'm , we're getting gonna add to the end of this . 
EDL	00:30:18,070	00:30:24,600	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	I just wanted to give you an opportunity to let me know what question I didn't ask in your poll that I didn't ask it . 
EDL	00:30:24,600	00:30:27,780	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	And if there is a question like that asked answer. 
EDL	00:30:27,780	00:30:44,570	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Real quick side and know when the middle of of contracting for new program that we call data protection and virtual environments in this is creating a new process to solve a hard cryptographic problem to allow us to compute on a credit data . 
EDL	00:30:45,780	00:30:53,000	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So nothing about all of your , your personal data that exists in the cloud , or on another server somewhere . 
EDL	00:30:53,000	00:30:58,100	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	If it's always incriminated , then then deeper leaks start to become , I think of the past. 
EDL	00:30:58,440	00:31:03,926	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	No , that's a gorgeous program , because all of us are super anxious about the integrity of our data . 
EDL	00:31:03,926	00:31:06,081	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	But we also know that it , we can use this data . 
EDL	00:31:06,081	00:31:09,608	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Really , we might be able to really discover important things . 
EDL	00:31:09,608	00:31:10,090	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Yeah , yeah. 
EDL	00:31:10,090	00:31:24,920	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Until that , in my world of thinking about arrive and processing , and it all coming around to really , it's about controlling that leads me to the ultimate of , how do we protect that information as we're controlling? 
EDL	00:31:24,920	00:31:42,940	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	TOM were out of time , but I have to thank you for the worldwide of the discussion will recover so much of what you are overseen as the dark program manager , but also just really enjoyed hearing you talk about your views on the history of technology and how it unfolds in all the twists and all is fascinating . 
EDL	00:31:42,940	00:31:44,810	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	The users as stories of innovation . 
EDL	00:31:44,810	00:31:47,690	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So thanks for sharing all the same day. 
EDL	00:31:47,690	00:31:48,356	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	Thank you . 
EDL	00:31:48,356	00:31:55,670	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	As you can hear , i'm pretty excited and passionate about this stuff that sounds wonderful to talk to him , and hopefully. 
EDL	00:31:55,670	00:32:04,770	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	We all benefit from those kinds of passions , and then when you bring the kind of expertise bring to it , the world will potentially pro , quite likely benefit from it too . 
EDL	00:32:04,770	00:32:19,420	| VfD E35 Maxwell's Disciple |	So thanks again , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with thomas , and I hope you join us again for the next Voices from the urban , thanks also to bend celebrant for his partnership in producing this program .
