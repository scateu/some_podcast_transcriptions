EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:02,112	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Justin thanks for joining me in the studio.
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,648	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Gladtobehere Ivan
EDL	00:02:03,648	00:02:05,952	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Let's start by talking about your background
EDL	00:02:05,952	00:02:11,328	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	How you became interested in science in general and in chemistry and then synthetic biology in particular
EDL	00:02:12,096	00:02:13,632	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I actually started out it was very
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:14,912	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Physics
EDL	00:02:14,912	00:02:16,960	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I was inspired by people like Witcher
EDL	00:02:16,960	00:02:17,472	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fine men
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:24,896	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	He told these wonderful stories seem like an incredibly interesting guy actually one of the things that brought me to Caltech I thought you know
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:27,200	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	This is a place where this character could do such
EDL	00:02:27,200	00:02:28,480	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Great science
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:28,992	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The place that I want
EDL	00:02:30,272	00:02:36,672	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I quickly realized after about a week in college that I was not going to be a physicist but nevertheless I'll
EDL	00:02:36,672	00:02:37,952	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I like the hard Sciences
EDL	00:02:37,952	00:02:41,024	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So chemistry seems like a good option
EDL	00:02:41,024	00:02:45,120	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I always liked the idea in chemistry of the ability to create things
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:45,632	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Didn't exist
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:47,680	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Credit score
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:49,472	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Chemistry has an analytical sides we on
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:54,336	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Understand the world around us by studying it and also has a synthetic side which means creating new Opera
EDL	00:02:54,848	00:02:56,896	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And that was something I was really drawn to
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:02:59,456	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Interestingly enough
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:01,504	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I was sort of put off by biology
EDL	00:03:02,016	00:03:05,088	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	My biological education release formerly
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:07,136	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Pretty much ended in the 9th grade
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:13,536	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But as time went on during graduate school and post. If I went from this time where the word DNA
EDL	00:03:13,536	00:03:15,840	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Hey in a seminar titled mint do not attend
EDL	00:03:16,864	00:03:19,424	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To a point where I really started to respect the
EDL	00:03:19,424	00:03:20,448	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Remarkable
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:22,496	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Chemistry that biology does
EDL	00:03:22,496	00:03:28,384	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I ultimately concluded that no matter how good of a chemist I was that biology would always do
EDL	00:03:28,384	00:03:28,896	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Better
EDL	00:03:29,408	00:03:34,784	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So ask a question okay well can we harness the power of biological systems
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,576	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To essentially do our bidding for us
EDL	00:03:37,088	00:03:38,880	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So how can I reprogram
EDL	00:03:38,880	00:03:39,904	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	A system that
EDL	00:03:39,904	00:03:42,720	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Wants to do its own thing and get through the thing
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:43,232	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I want it
EDL	00:03:43,744	00:03:45,792	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And that led me into this area of sin
EDL	00:03:46,304	00:03:47,072	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Biology
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:51,168	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So we were interested in taking advantage of some of the properties that
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:51,680	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Bacteria
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:52,960	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Simple
EDL	00:03:52,960	00:03:55,008	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Microbes could do
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,544	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Their ability to make stuff there
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,336	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	$0.02 stuff
EDL	00:03:58,336	00:04:00,128	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I got really interested in programming
EDL	00:04:00,640	00:04:01,920	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Before we
EDL	00:04:01,920	00:04:02,688	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Who talked about
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:06,784	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The two programs that you're running here at RPI I would like to hear about the sequence of events
EDL	00:04:06,784	00:04:11,904	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That led you from your long experience at Emory as a professor
EDL	00:04:11,904	00:04:14,720	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To darp itself so how did you actually end up here
EDL	00:04:14,720	00:04:18,047	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That was a funny story I was at a meeting in
EDL	00:04:18,047	00:04:19,327	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Cold Spring Harbor New York
EDL	00:04:20,607	00:04:23,423	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Beautiful laboratory famous laboratory on Long Island
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:29,311	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Famous for molecular biology molecular biology the structure of DNA
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:35,199	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Wait we are meeting right outside of his office we got to see him walk through coming back from his tennis match
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:39,551	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I was there as part of a short course on synthetic biology
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:40,319	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Carrizo
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,855	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Organizers had brought in
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,647	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Faculty members from around
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:45,695	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The country around the world
EDL	00:04:45,695	00:04:48,511	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And about that time DARPA had an ounce
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,559	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The Living foundries Program
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:52,095	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	How much is one of the Seminole synthetic biology
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:53,631	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Here at DARPA
EDL	00:04:54,143	00:04:57,215	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Can you just tell listeners what was the Crux of that
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:05:01,055	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The Crux of that program was engineering microbes to
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:04,383	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Produce new molecules and to reduce the
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,175	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Time of the design-build
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,455	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Test learn cycle today
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:12,831	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So instead of taking a decade in a billion dollars to generate a product
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,391	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They wanted to reduce the time
EDL	00:05:15,391	00:05:16,159	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Down to
EDL	00:05:16,927	00:05:19,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Baby days weeks and reduce the cost dramatic
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:22,047	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	DARPA Hedges put out a call
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:24,607	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Nearly a hundred million dollars of investment I think
EDL	00:05:25,119	00:05:29,727	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And needless to say people at this meeting who are all in this area got really excited about it
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:31,519	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But we also or sort of
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:32,543	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Amazed by the
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,103	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The audacity Of what DARPA was asked
EDL	00:05:35,103	00:05:41,503	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I was getting really excited about this and I was talking to some of the younger faculty member so these are mostly system
EDL	00:05:41,503	00:05:44,063	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Professors that are organized the meeting and
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:45,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They had mentioned that
EDL	00:05:45,599	00:05:46,623	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Ann Arbor was
EDL	00:05:46,623	00:05:47,903	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Expanding heavily in
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,951	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The synthetic biology Arena they were looking
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:50,975	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	For program managers
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:52,255	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And
EDL	00:05:52,255	00:05:56,095	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It's the program manager I was kind of an interesting one in the sense that we're all
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:57,119	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Temporary
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:05:58,655	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Stop it doesn't hire permanent
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:02,495	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Staff is program managers we have an expiration date on badge
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:03,263	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Mine is
EDL	00:06:03,263	00:06:04,543	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	30 December 2000
EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:07,871	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	18 Lexi's yourself emergency it certainly does
EDL	00:06:07,871	00:06:11,199	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So in order to come and do this job
EDL	00:06:11,199	00:06:12,991	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You essentially have to leave
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:16,063	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What you were doing before with the expectation that this is only going to be at
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:18,879	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So for the folks that come from academics
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,695	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	He more or less have to have a tenured position if you enter
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Because early in your career
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,815	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You can't do this and being a sister
EDL	00:06:26,815	00:06:27,327	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The professor at the
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:29,375	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I just wouldn't work out but
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:32,703	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Since I already had 10 year old lot of my colleagues said you would be great
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:34,495	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You know the field
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:37,055	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You have the ability to take a break
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:40,895	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Ironically after about three years up here
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:43,455	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	On leave for memory by Dean said are you coming back
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:47,295	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And something I never thought I would say is
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,343	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So I gave up babe
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:52,671	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Tenured faculty position a lifetime appointment
EDL	00:06:53,439	00:06:58,303	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Something I worked incredibly hard tour in sawdust or the end-all-be-all of a career
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:01,887	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So I am currently
EDL	00:07:02,399	00:07:07,519	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Serving at the pleasure of the DARPA leadership and don't know what I'm going to do
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:13,919	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	All right but that also is an indication to me that you developed a certain kind of devotion and excitement about the programs
EDL	00:07:13,919	00:07:20,063	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But you are involved with maybe more so than you even expected so let's talk about the two programs the first one
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:23,391	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Goes by the short name of bricks brics
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:24,415	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Which stands for
EDL	00:07:24,927	00:07:30,815	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Biological robustness and complex settings what is it status now and what do you hope to achieve with it
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:33,631	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The origin of that program goes back
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,935	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Couple of years before I join the agent
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:41,823	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Synthetic biologist got good engineering bacteria to do what I would call parlor tricks
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:44,383	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Little cute things that work well in the laboratory
EDL	00:07:44,895	00:07:46,943	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Example was
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:49,247	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Engineering bacteria such
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,063	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That when you expose them to light they would change
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:52,831	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Color
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So you could do
EDL	00:07:53,599	00:07:54,367	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Photography
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:55,647	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You take a petri dish
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,183	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Shine light and a
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:59,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Shadows and so on and you can take bacterial
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:01,791	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You're cute
EDL	00:08:01,791	00:08:03,071	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Kind of demonstrates the possible
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:05,119	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The fields but at the end of the day
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:08,191	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It's not going to put digital cameras out of business
EDL	00:08:09,727	00:08:15,103	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I myself have been engineering organisms to follow small molecules
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,127	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	With the idea maybe that
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:19,199	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You could chase down pollutants in the environment
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,735	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Once you have a bacterium that
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,319	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Not only wanted to eat the oil but actually
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,367	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Could sense the oil and follow it around
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,135	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And if you wanted to clean up
EDL	00:08:28,159	00:08:31,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And in doing all this the question I would inevitably get ass is okay when are you going to
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:33,535	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Transition this to the
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,047	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The field
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:36,863	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Am I answer quite honestly was never
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,679	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Because the systems that we are building
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,703	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Work fine
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:42,495	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	37° C
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,287	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Petri dish
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:45,311	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Sterile
EDL	00:08:45,311	00:08:46,335	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Environment
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,639	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	With the presence of antibiotics.
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:49,919	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Any competition away
EDL	00:08:49,919	00:08:51,199	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So we were literally
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:52,223	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Cuddling
EDL	00:08:52,223	00:08:52,991	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is bacteria
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:59,391	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And they can perform in that environment but if you said Okay I want to take something that I engineered in the laboratory
EDL	00:08:59,903	00:09:03,231	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I want to put it in this contaminated site
EDL	00:09:04,255	00:09:05,535	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Clean up what was there
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:06,047	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It would never work
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:07,583	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Because
EDL	00:09:07,583	00:09:08,863	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There microorganisms
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:10,911	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Live everywhere they've established there
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,191	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Niches
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:17,567	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I soaked introducing this little week laboratory strain of e-coli
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:18,591	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It wouldn't survive
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,103	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It's just
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:20,639	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It wouldn't work
EDL	00:09:20,639	00:09:27,039	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And just on another angle was there even at that time a regulatory framework with that would enable you to go from the lab out into the field
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,319	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There is it like
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:30,623	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Many regulatory Frameworks it's a little bit
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:35,487	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Complicated but it does exist but we were so far away from that that even
EDL	00:09:35,487	00:09:37,279	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The notional idea that we would like to
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:38,559	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Do that was
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Almost out of the question is
EDL	00:09:40,095	00:09:42,399	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Regulation wasn't going to stop us
EDL	00:09:42,911	00:09:47,007	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	From being successful here it was the science itself
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:51,359	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The challenge has I saw it was we needed to be able to
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:53,407	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Engineer organisms that were
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:55,199	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Robust enough to
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:55,967	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To survive
EDL	00:09:55,967	00:09:58,271	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You of course have to deal with this problem
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:09:59,551	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Of evolution
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:04,159	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So when you have large population sizes Evolution occurs by
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Mistakes
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,951	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Okay when DNA
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:07,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Copied incorrectly
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:08,767	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It introduced
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,535	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Mistakes
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:15,935	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Call grateful for billions of years worth of mistakes aren't exactly the process work
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,239	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The public concern off
EDL	00:10:18,239	00:10:19,519	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So you're going to create a
EDL	00:10:20,031	00:10:20,799	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Superbug
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:26,431	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And my concern actually it was at the other end of the spectrum than anything we've is going to break
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,991	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Just going to be too fragile so we have to be mindful
EDL	00:10:29,759	00:10:31,551	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you want to engineer microbes that are
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:36,415	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Resilient enough to do the job but make sure that they are not innovating
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:39,231	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And one of the challenges
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There
EDL	00:10:39,999	00:10:43,327	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is this notion of engineering robustness
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:43,839	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Intersystems
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:45,119	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you talk
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:48,191	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Too Hardcore Engineers that build things like
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:48,703	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Like airplanes
EDL	00:10:49,215	00:10:50,751	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There are many ways to
EDL	00:10:50,751	00:10:52,543	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Make sure that airplanes
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,055	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fly safe
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:55,871	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Redundant systems
EDL	00:10:56,639	00:10:57,407	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Sensing
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Control a
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:10:58,687	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Actuation
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:11:02,015	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And so on so we've gotten to the point now where air travel is
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Ratably safe and there's
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:07,135	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The entire engineering disciplines that help support
EDL	00:11:07,903	00:11:10,463	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So I would talk to these Engineers who are used to working in
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Your microphysics
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,791	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	World's End say
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,583	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Okay how do you deal with
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:17,119	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Uncertainty
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:17,887	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In
EDL	00:11:17,887	00:11:18,655	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Say biological
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So is an example
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:25,823	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you're thinking about an airplane flying you can make reasonable guesses as to what environment
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:26,335	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And it's going to say
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:29,407	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The temperature range that is likely to see
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,687	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I know how high it's
EDL	00:11:30,687	00:11:36,831	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Find a fly I can model the stresses on the wing what kind of ruins it might exactly you can draw a box around
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:40,415	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Wright Engineers are very good at saying that within a certain parameter space
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:40,927	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fat
EDL	00:11:41,695	00:11:45,279	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	This should operate as expected and then beyond that
EDL	00:11:45,279	00:11:48,095	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I'm all bets maybe off but we've done a pretty good job of drawing up
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But in biology it's a lot more complicated than
EDL	00:11:53,471	00:11:54,239	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Because
EDL	00:11:54,751	00:11:55,519	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We don't
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:56,543	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Always know
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,335	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What an environment is going
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:11:59,615	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Be like
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,407	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Moreover
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,431	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You have this
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:03,967	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Pesky thing of evolution
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,479	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Whereas
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:07,295	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And physically engineered systems
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,575	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	When something breaks
EDL	00:12:09,087	00:12:10,111	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Generally the
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:10,879	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fitness
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:12,927	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	She's a biological term
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:14,975	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Of the object goes down
EDL	00:12:15,999	00:12:17,023	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Okay so let's say
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,071	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Part of the airplane brakes
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,631	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The performance of that aircraft is generally not
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:24,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Where is in biological systems
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:27,263	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Breaking is innovation
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:28,799	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So it's possible that
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:32,639	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Do mutations in an organism acquires a new phone
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:35,455	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It grows faster it out competes its
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,223	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	A colleagues
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:40,575	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	When I talk to the engineer's taking is there a g in
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:46,207	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The mechanical are the answers know that the airplane breaks it doesn't start flying twice as fast and twice as high
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:47,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Performance goes down
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:49,535	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So that was sort of
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:52,863	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	An intellectual barrier there that the people that
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,399	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Think about
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:55,935	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Engineering robust systems
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,215	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Weren't
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:58,239	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	As of yet
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:01,055	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Thinking about biology and it
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:02,335	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Brings new challenge
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:05,919	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I recognize this but I'm not an engineer so I had no idea how to
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:07,967	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So when I came to DARPA
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,783	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I had the convening power of two
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:12,063	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The purse haiku
EDL	00:13:12,063	00:13:12,831	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Sculpt
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	A program that
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:15,391	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Basically asked
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:17,439	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Can we transition
EDL	00:13:17,951	00:13:19,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Synthetic biology from
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:22,815	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Laboratory curiosity into
EDL	00:13:22,815	00:13:23,327	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The real world
EDL	00:13:24,095	00:13:26,655	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So one of the great technological advancement
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,679	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The last
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:29,215	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Decade or so
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:30,495	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,519	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The Dramatics
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:32,799	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Reduction

EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:38,943	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That's out in the

EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,247	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:44,575	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Why doing that we started to recognize that there's this in

EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It turns out that
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:56,607	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you were to count up the number of cells in your body that are yours
EDL	00:13:56,607	00:13:57,375	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Should have your DNA
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:00,191	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And then compare that to the number of
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,495	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Cells of bacteria that live
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,287	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	On your skin and in your

EDL	00:14:05,055	00:14:05,823	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Those numbers
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,639	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There's still a little debate about it but they're approximately
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:09,663	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Comfortable
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:13,759	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So you are being driven by your back

EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:26,815	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So you're essentially telling me
EDL	00:14:27,327	00:14:28,863	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But I am half bacterial
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:29,631	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	More less more
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:32,447	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So this opened up the tantalizing
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:33,215	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Impossibility
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:34,751	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That by

EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:44,223	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	An interesting aside
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:46,271	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There is a typically Hospital
EDL	00:14:46,783	00:14:47,551	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Derived

EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:49,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Called c-diff

EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:52,159	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Difficile
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,463	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Essentially what happens in
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:56,511	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Hospital settings is that when
EDL	00:14:56,511	00:14:59,583	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	People take a strong course of antibiotics
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:00,351	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Essentially
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:01,631	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Clears the bacteria out of your
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,167	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	L C diff lives
EDL	00:15:03,679	00:15:09,055	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In this very specific locations within your guts that kind of hangs out in between some cells
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,847	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And normally it's held in check by
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:12,127	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Everything else that's
EDL	00:15:12,127	00:15:16,735	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In your gut right and just because some westerns probably have heard the term we are talking about here about the
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:18,015	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The microbiome
EDL	00:15:18,015	00:15:20,575	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Right here this year the mybatis biome of the gut
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:25,183	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	When you were talking about the bacterial over all of us and that's the entire microbiome on our bodies
EDL	00:15:25,183	00:15:29,535	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I hear you're talking about the microbiome of a gaseous specifically in the gut so what
EDL	00:15:29,535	00:15:31,839	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Happens is that after antibiotic treatment
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:32,863	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Got clears out
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:33,887	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	C-diff says
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Oh my God this is great you know it's like it's expanding into a
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:39,775	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It makes people very very sick
EDL	00:15:39,775	00:15:40,799	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It can be deadly
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:43,103	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The observation was made
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:43,871	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:46,175	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Perhaps by
EDL	00:15:46,175	00:15:47,967	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Repopulating the gut
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	With
EDL	00:15:48,991	00:15:50,015	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Normal Got Back
EDL	00:15:50,015	00:15:52,319	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Bacteria you might be able to knock down a c-diff in
EDL	00:15:53,599	00:15:56,415	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So where do you get those bacteria to repopulate the gut
EDL	00:15:57,439	00:15:58,463	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Well
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,583	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The political terms these days are
EDL	00:16:03,583	00:16:05,887	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Intestinal microbiota
EDL	00:16:06,911	00:16:08,447	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What are talking about
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:13,311	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fecal material however correct I am going to be a group
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:13,823	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Transplant
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:18,175	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It works if you eliminate a microbial community
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:21,247	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You can replace it with a different community and restore
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,783	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	No
EDL	00:16:22,783	00:16:26,111	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It's great it works I mean it said something like 95%
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:27,135	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Successful
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:28,927	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But aside from just the it
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,695	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Factor
EDL	00:16:29,695	00:16:31,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you had to design a solution to this problem
EDL	00:16:32,767	00:16:34,815	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is that the best you could come up with
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,607	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That you would literally
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,655	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Take somebody's poop and stick it in you
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:39,935	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:41,727	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Can we start asking this question
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:42,495	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Could you
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,799	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Buildmore Define communities
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:46,847	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Scratch that might have the same function
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:47,871	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But
EDL	00:16:48,383	00:16:50,943	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Wouldn't carry all the extra baggage so
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:53,759	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In that poop there's a lot of other
EDL	00:16:53,759	00:16:57,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Real potential viruses and other bacteria that maybe you don't want to
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:03,999	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So we've got very interested in this idea of building microbial communities
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:06,047	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That can perform a specific function
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,583	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But have much more to find Copper
EDL	00:17:08,351	00:17:14,751	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	This would of course be a tremendous service in a public health sense because so many people have gastrointestinal
EDL	00:17:14,751	00:17:15,519	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Personal issues
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:20,895	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That seems to be related to the microbiome so if you can come up with ways that are more palatable any sense to
EDL	00:17:20,895	00:17:26,271	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To treat that would be really Department of Defense specific problem as well so when
EDL	00:17:26,271	00:17:27,551	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Soldiers deploy to place
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:29,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Iraq and Afghanistan
EDL	00:17:29,599	00:17:31,903	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They are exposed to do microbes
EDL	00:17:32,671	00:17:34,207	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Water and so on
EDL	00:17:34,207	00:17:35,487	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Travelers diarrhea
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:37,535	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Many of you out there may have suffered from it
EDL	00:17:37,535	00:17:38,559	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It's not fun
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:41,887	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And not only can it ruin a vacation but if you think about from a
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:42,911	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	DOD perspective
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:46,751	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you're taking young healthy people you're deploying them in theater
EDL	00:17:46,751	00:17:49,823	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	With the expectation that they're going to do a job right away
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:51,615	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And then they're sick
EDL	00:17:51,615	00:17:52,127	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That's no good
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:57,247	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So one way that you could think about maybe solving this problem would be to
EDL	00:17:57,247	00:17:59,039	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Find a way of engineering robust
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Community
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,831	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In the gut
EDL	00:18:00,831	00:18:02,879	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That more closely matches where they're going
EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:04,927	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And maybe you transition that
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:05,695	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Community States
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,743	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So maybe you get a tummy ache
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:09,279	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But you're here
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You can be treated
EDL	00:18:10,303	00:18:11,327	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You're fine
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:12,351	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And then
EDL	00:18:12,351	00:18:15,167	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You deployed overseas and don't have to worry about being
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:16,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Knocked out of the game
EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:17,471	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Right as you are
EDL	00:18:18,495	00:18:21,567	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you were to characterize the status of
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:22,591	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The program Prix
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:23,615	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Now how would
EDL	00:18:23,615	00:18:24,895	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	AccuWeather
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:28,991	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It's going well I'm actually very pleased so when we started that program we
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:30,271	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Realize that
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:32,575	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The science behind the microbiome
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:33,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is changing it
EDL	00:18:33,599	00:18:34,623	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Incredibly rapidly
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:40,255	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	When we launched the program we didn't say specifically that we were going to solve this
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:42,303	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Microbial engineering problem
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:44,095	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Because I felt that those problems were
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:45,631	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Quite as well defined
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	As we want
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:48,191	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So what we did was we said
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,983	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What are the tools in
EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,543	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Some technologies that we will have to develop
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,591	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	App that allow us to engineer
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,407	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Microbial communities or microbiome
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:59,199	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That can function in Campo
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,711	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Text environment
EDL	00:19:00,479	00:19:04,575	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Because we thought that there were going to be some commonality so a microbial community in your
EDL	00:19:04,575	00:19:05,343	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Your gut
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,623	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Has to deal with
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:07,647	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Changing environment
EDL	00:19:07,647	00:19:08,415	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Right one day
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,207	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I drink a Diet Coke
EDL	00:19:10,207	00:19:11,487	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I had a burrito for lunch
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,767	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Then I ate a salad
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,583	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So there's all sorts of different stuff flowing through
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:20,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Through there so what we said was if you have the ability to engineer a microbial community
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,495	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Forum 8
EDL	00:19:22,495	00:19:23,263	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Find function
EDL	00:19:23,775	00:19:26,079	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In some suitably complex environment
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,919	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We figured we would learn enough lessons that we could
EDL	00:19:29,919	00:19:30,431	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Then
EDL	00:19:30,943	00:19:32,479	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Take that to
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,503	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Maybe a different phone
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:34,783	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In a different car
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,087	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So they're going to be some primitive
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:38,623	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Commonalities
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:41,183	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In terms of the problems that you would have
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:41,695	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The salt
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,487	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To engineer a community that
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:47,071	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Weather I ultimately want to
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,863	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Re-engineer a gut microbiome
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:52,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Aura skin microbiome or a soil microbiome
EDL	00:19:52,959	00:19:55,007	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They're probably some commonalities
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:57,567	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	How many research
EDL	00:19:57,567	00:20:01,407	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Right over on the program is
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:04,223	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Probably about a dozen
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:06,015	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:07,807	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They've come up with some
EDL	00:20:07,807	00:20:09,599	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Truly creative
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,391	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Solutions to some of the challenges
EDL	00:20:12,415	00:20:14,463	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	At the beginning of the program we said
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:18,815	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We want you to engineer a community that has an impact
EDL	00:20:18,815	00:20:19,583	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	On
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:21,119	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	An organism
EDL	00:20:21,119	00:20:22,399	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In a rational
EDL	00:20:22,399	00:20:23,423	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Predictable
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:23,935	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Safe
EDL	00:20:24,447	00:20:25,215	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Robust
EDL	00:20:25,215	00:20:25,727	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Way
EDL	00:20:26,239	00:20:27,775	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We didn't specify
EDL	00:20:27,775	00:20:28,543	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What
EDL	00:20:28,543	00:20:29,823	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The test case had to be
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,847	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We left the performers
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,639	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Folks at
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:35,455	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Came with ideas Define their own space
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,991	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Wewe to find how complex
EDL	00:20:36,991	00:20:38,783	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Could be or needed to be
EDL	00:20:38,783	00:20:40,319	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But we didn't say
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,111	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Engineer the gut microbiome of
EDL	00:20:43,135	00:20:45,695	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So we got some really Creative Solutions in
EDL	00:20:45,695	00:20:46,719	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Including some that were on XP
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:49,535	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So some of the ones that I would I'd say we're a little bit
EDL	00:20:50,047	00:20:51,071	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	More in line with
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:54,143	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We kind of thought would come in was
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:55,167	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We have a group
EDL	00:20:55,167	00:20:56,191	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	At
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:56,959	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The recents
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:57,983	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Attitude at Harvard
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:58,751	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Bye-bye
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:20:59,519	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Pam silver
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:01,055	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	She and her group
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:03,615	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Now have engineered a
EDL	00:21:03,615	00:21:04,639	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Microbe
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:05,407	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,687	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Can sense inflammation
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:09,503	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And it changes color when
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,783	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It senses inflammation
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:12,831	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Shenzhen Diagnostics a diagnostic
EDL	00:21:12,831	00:21:13,343	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So at
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:15,903	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Can reside in the gut of
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,672	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They're using animals
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:17,952	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Freezing a mouse
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:20,256	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It can reside in the god of a mouse for
EDL	00:21:21,280	00:21:22,816	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Something like a hundred days
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:23,840	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Without mutating
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:27,424	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Thanks for this is one of the things that we were worried about I thought this was going to be a huge problem
EDL	00:21:28,192	00:21:29,216	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But the systems were going to meet a wife
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:32,032	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That was a pleasant surprise
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:34,336	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They've shown that you can detect
EDL	00:21:34,336	00:21:36,640	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Inflammation in the mouse gut
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,920	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Basically by looking at
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,688	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Set the color of their poop
EDL	00:21:38,688	00:21:42,528	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Poop if there's inflammation the mice poop blue
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:45,600	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So you can imagine ultimately using this as a diagnostic
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:51,488	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	One of the other more surprising test cases that a group at the University of Texas
EDL	00:21:51,488	00:21:53,280	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Led by Nancy Moran
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,304	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Came up with
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,584	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Was the
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:57,376	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Microbiome of the
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:57,888	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Honey bee
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:22:01,216	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Got so we are definitely not expecting this
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,240	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But it
EDL	00:22:02,240	00:22:03,008	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It turns out
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:05,824	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That the honey bee is a really interesting
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,336	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Test kit
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,152	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So unlike you and I who have a lot
EDL	00:22:09,664	00:22:11,712	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Of different microbes in our guts
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:16,576	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The honey bee has depending on the day somewhere around 8 or 9
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:19,136	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So much simpler
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:19,904	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What is the
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,184	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So it's not
EDL	00:22:21,184	00:22:24,000	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But it's not a thousand so we thought that this was a really
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:24,768	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Useful
EDL	00:22:24,768	00:22:26,816	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Test case because it's
EDL	00:22:26,816	00:22:29,120	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Complicated but not irreducibly,
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:35,520	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And what also is interesting about the honey bees the honey bee is a social animal
EDL	00:22:35,520	00:22:38,336	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Displays learning and memory so you can train honey bees
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:39,872	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To do tasks
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:41,152	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And so on so
EDL	00:22:41,152	00:22:42,688	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What the Texas team
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,968	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Was interested in doing
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:46,784	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Was manipulating the
EDL	00:22:46,784	00:22:49,088	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Gut microbiome of the honeybee
EDL	00:22:49,600	00:22:52,160	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To see if we could alter their learning and memory
EDL	00:22:52,928	00:22:55,232	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And it turns out that this actually work
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:58,304	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It turns out that there is something that
EDL	00:22:59,328	00:23:00,352	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Antonis the gut
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,888	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Brain access
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:03,168	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So there is any
EDL	00:23:03,168	00:23:04,960	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Credible number of
EDL	00:23:05,984	00:23:06,752	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Neurons
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:08,032	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That go from your brain and synapse
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:09,824	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Got
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,104	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you think about it
EDL	00:23:11,104	00:23:12,384	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You have the gut-brain at
EDL	00:23:13,152	00:23:15,456	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It inside the gut you have all these microbes
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:16,480	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Living in there doing
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,272	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And it turns out that
EDL	00:23:18,784	00:23:21,344	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There's essentially a gut brain microbe axis
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:24,928	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So the microbes in your gut can actually tickle your brain
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,976	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Via the molecules they produce how they interact
EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:30,048	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Absolutely amazing soda
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:35,936	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Potentially opening up a door of engineering my own gut microbiome in a way that might make me a better learner
EDL	00:23:35,936	00:23:40,544	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Okay so that would be cool not there yet but
EDL	00:23:40,544	00:23:46,432	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You know you said you weren't my only told us about 2 I know you said there's about a dozen other groups we cannot get into all of them
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:50,272	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fact I want to move on now to the to the second program which is
EDL	00:23:50,272	00:23:55,392	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fairly new and this one goes by the acronym Elm and that stands for
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:56,416	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Engineered
EDL	00:23:56,416	00:24:02,816	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Living materials and I know in an earlier discussion one of the kind of metaphors that came up as we're talking about this
EDL	00:24:02,816	00:24:05,120	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Beautiful wanna one you think of where I
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:06,144	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Forest come from
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:12,288	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And then you think of the seeds that are the beginnings of all of those trees of collectively become this incredible LAN
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Of a forest
EDL	00:24:14,080	00:24:16,384	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So what would your thinking about that sort of
EDL	00:24:16,896	00:24:18,432	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Biological
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:22,016	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Brilliance and Landscape in another way so talk to us about
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,064	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Elm what it's about
EDL	00:24:24,576	00:24:25,344	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And what the status
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,880	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	One of the Great
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:29,184	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Perks of this job is that we get a pretty
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,208	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	High level
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:30,976	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	View of the
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:35,072	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I had gone to a meeting
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:36,608	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Called biofabricate
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:39,680	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I had met a group from a company
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:40,960	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In New York called ecova
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:42,496	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And what
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,264	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Ecovative
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,800	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Was doing it
EDL	00:24:44,800	00:24:46,336	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	At the time and what is actually think
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:49,664	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The core of their business is they were taking
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fungi
EDL	00:24:51,712	00:24:53,248	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Particular mushroom
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:56,064	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And in particular The mycelial Witcher
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:24:57,088	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The parts of mushroom
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,856	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Set grow under
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:00,928	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And if you've ever walked out on your lawn one morning
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,512	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Where the hell did those come
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,536	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Front right they grow really
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,048	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fast
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,608	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I would eat oveta was doing
EDL	00:25:08,608	00:25:11,168	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Was they were taking this organism

EDL	00:25:13,216	00:25:14,752	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The cheapest agricultural waste
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:16,800	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We're talkin
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:18,080	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Corn stalks that are ground
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:20,384	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Apparently there's a market

EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:25,248	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What they would do if they take the waist
EDL	00:25:25,248	00:25:28,832	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They would take the my Celia they would put it in a mold
EDL	00:25:30,112	00:25:36,000	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	A physical mold and after a few days my silly would grow to fill the voids
EDL	00:25:36,000	00:25:38,048	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And it would get a material that
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:41,888	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Essentially has many of the properties of polystyrene
EDL	00:25:41,888	00:25:42,656	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Styrofoam head
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:43,680	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Material
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:46,240	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And they can sell this as a packing Pro
EDL	00:25:46,240	00:25:52,640	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Do my Celia of the fungal system those are more fibrous kinds of parts of a not the mushroom and body the Rye
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:58,784	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Ritenour mushrooms button in here it just kind of ends up looking almost like a
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,624	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So and I thought this was so cool
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,416	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Cool because polystyrene
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:04,928	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,744	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Holding a polystyrene cup as we speak
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is one of the most
EDL	00:26:09,024	00:26:11,328	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Useful yet pernicious substances
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,120	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In the sense that
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:14,912	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It is so inexpensive to make
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:16,192	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It is cheaper to
EDL	00:26:16,192	00:26:18,240	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Make virgin polystyrene the Nerdist
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,264	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Recycle it
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:21,056	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And it tends not to go away
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:24,384	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Where is these mushroom base materials if you throw in a compost
EDL	00:26:25,152	00:26:25,664	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They go away
EDL	00:26:26,176	00:26:28,480	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And so I was really intrigued
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,016	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	By this idea of
EDL	00:26:30,016	00:26:30,784	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Growing
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:31,296	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Materials
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,576	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,344	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	From a
EDL	00:26:33,344	00:26:34,624	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	DOD perspective
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:38,464	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I was particularly interested in this idea of
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,512	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Growing materials
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:41,280	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	On a
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:42,304	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Site
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,584	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And one of the things that
EDL	00:26:44,096	00:26:45,120	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Ecovative Folkston
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,400	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Show me was that they could
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:47,168	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Take
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:52,032	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Are mushroom materials that are not particularly dense but if you put them under Heat
EDL	00:26:52,032	00:26:55,104	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Pressure you can get a material that's more or less equivalent
EDL	00:26:55,104	00:26:55,616	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	2 fiberboard
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:57,408	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I thought this was cool
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,432	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You can essentially grow
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	These materials quickly
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:04,576	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you think about the Department of Defense we operate all over the world
EDL	00:27:05,344	00:27:06,112	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you think about
EDL	00:27:06,112	00:27:07,648	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	A rebuilding effort in
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:08,672	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Afghanistan
EDL	00:27:09,184	00:27:11,744	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And let's say you need to get a pallet of plywood there
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:17,120	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	LED ody has the world best Logistics system out there but
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:17,888	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Shipping
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:18,656	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Heavy
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,680	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Pallets of plywood
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:22,496	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Across the world in the danger zone
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Sounds to me seems
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:24,544	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If necessary
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:25,568	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But silly
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,616	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Right cost a lot
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:28,384	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Crossfuel
EDL	00:27:28,384	00:27:29,152	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It's dangerous
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:31,200	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Why couldn't you ship
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:32,480	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Accede
EDL	00:27:32,992	00:27:34,016	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Or effectively accede
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:36,064	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Starter
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:37,088	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And then grow the
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:40,416	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So you reduce the logistic burden
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:41,952	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What's the cost
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,256	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	You increase safety because you're not
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:47,328	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Find a truck inherently low value materials across the
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:50,144	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And then if you take this a step further
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:54,752	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And say well what are some other remote places we might want to eventually
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,288	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Priest materials
EDL	00:27:56,800	00:27:59,104	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If we ever decide to live on Mars
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,640	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	There's no Home Depot up there
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:04,480	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We're not going to get there by just shipping everything weed
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,760	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We're going to
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:06,528	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Have to be able
EDL	00:28:06,528	00:28:07,296	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	How to grow in
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:13,440	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So beyond program really gets at this early stage of growing material
EDL	00:28:13,952	00:28:15,232	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Oh and by the way
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:16,512	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We want the material
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:18,048	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To remain alive
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:20,608	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Sew-in packing material it's obvious
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:22,656	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Want that to remain alive
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:24,704	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	But living systems have grapes
EDL	00:28:25,728	00:28:26,496	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Bacon
EDL	00:28:26,496	00:28:27,776	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Self-repair
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:29,312	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They can sense and respond to
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:29,824	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The environment
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:34,944	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So could you imagine having a structure that a pond
EDL	00:28:34,944	00:28:36,224	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Damaged or insult
EDL	00:28:36,224	00:28:36,736	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Repairs itself
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:39,040	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In the way that you do if you get a cut
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,320	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That would be great
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:41,856	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Could you have materials that
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:45,440	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Change their properties with respect to the
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:46,208	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The
EDL	00:28:46,976	00:28:47,744	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Temperature
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:48,256	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	State
EDL	00:28:49,024	00:28:50,816	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Change the color so that they were become
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:53,888	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Reflective or absorptive if you were interested in
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,192	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So there's something
EDL	00:28:56,192	00:28:59,008	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	About maintaining the living properties
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:28:59,776	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Materials that
EDL	00:29:00,288	00:29:01,056	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Takis
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,568	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Really
EDL	00:29:02,336	00:29:03,104	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Compelling
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:06,944	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Try this absolutely amazing this is also reminding me this comes I guess out of a tradition
EDL	00:29:06,944	00:29:07,968	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Summit used to be called
EDL	00:29:07,968	00:29:08,992	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Smart materials
EDL	00:29:09,504	00:29:10,528	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Smart intelligent materials
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:16,160	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And idea there I remember being you can you build a building that might have sort of
EDL	00:29:16,672	00:29:22,816	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Reactive porosity the humidity when the meteorological conditions are and so in some
EDL	00:29:23,328	00:29:24,096	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The building itself
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,912	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Just by changing its microstructure
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,448	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Can accommodate
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:32,032	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Hayden and queen maybe you lose use less energy to heat and less energy
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,312	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Before AC
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:36,896	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Is the thing is amazing about this though is I'm imagining living
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:41,760	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Inside of a building that is living I love the thought of it but I also
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:45,856	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It also gives me the willies what's makes me feel like I might be living
EDL	00:29:45,856	00:29:47,136	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Inside of a body
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:54,048	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And I still might want you to think about that for a second and I'm wondering what should we be concerned about like if I keep food in the refrigerator
EDL	00:29:54,048	00:29:54,816	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Too long
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:29:57,888	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	It goes badly so could my house go
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:58,912	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Bad in this respect
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:04,288	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Yes these are some of the things that we've asked our performers to be thing
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,568	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Thinking about so
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:06,848	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	If you have a system
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:08,640	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	That grows
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:09,664	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	How do you control that grow
EDL	00:30:09,664	00:30:12,480	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And there's obviously a natural president
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,248	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	For this right
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,784	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Human beings grow to roughly
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:16,064	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Define shapes
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,600	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	In sizes and so on so
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:19,136	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So Nature has solved
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:19,904	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	This problem
EDL	00:30:20,928	00:30:21,952	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Controlled growth
EDL	00:30:21,952	00:30:22,464	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And development
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:24,000	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We actually have a
EDL	00:30:24,768	00:30:25,536	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Second
EDL	00:30:25,536	00:30:26,304	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Track of the
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:28,096	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Program that is getting it
EDL	00:30:28,096	00:30:28,864	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Just this
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,400	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,168	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Can we
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:33,728	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Program biological
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,264	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Systems
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,288	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To adopt
EDL	00:30:36,288	00:30:37,824	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Specific sizes
EDL	00:30:38,592	00:30:42,688	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Okay I just have to say this is one of the most miraculous things to me
EDL	00:30:42,688	00:30:43,968	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	About biology
EDL	00:30:43,968	00:30:47,552	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	About a seed about a fertilized egg because it's comes with
EDL	00:30:47,552	00:30:53,952	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Fairly simple shape and I'm looking at you Justin and you have an interesting shape of a human being
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:31:00,352	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I don't know how to take that so what did DARPA s
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:03,168	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Audacious idea to actually now try to build that
EDL	00:31:03,168	00:31:06,752	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Morpho genetic function of biology into
EDL	00:31:06,752	00:31:07,776	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Engineered materials
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:10,848	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Right so you mentioned the seeds we've been building with
EDL	00:31:10,848	00:31:13,408	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Once alive materials forever right we use would
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:18,016	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And how do we get that would we take the single this very very small seed we stick it in
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:19,296	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The ground we grow it for
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:22,368	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	What years we got this beautiful living tree that
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:23,904	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Lightshade
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:26,976	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Help heal itself all these great properties
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:32,352	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I can take CO2 out of the atmosphere and produce oxygen that we need to breathe and then what do we do
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:38,496	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	We cut the damn thing. And then we put it in a kiln we render it inert we saw it up and it
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:40,288	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Dimensional Lumber
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:42,080	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So could you think about
EDL	00:31:42,080	00:31:42,848	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Starting with
EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:43,360	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Essentially like
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,920	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The tree progenitor cell
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,200	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,480	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Grow dimensional Lumber
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:52,832	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	The cells will keep dividing in a specific developmental pattern
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,624	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	And they would know
EDL	00:31:54,624	00:31:55,904	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	They would be programmed
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:56,672	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	To go to sleep
EDL	00:31:56,672	00:31:57,440	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Dick sizes and shapes
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:00,256	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	So producing dimensional Lumber without having to
EDL	00:32:00,256	00:32:01,280	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	How to grow a tree
EDL	00:32:01,792	00:32:08,192	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Suggesting that was absolutely amazing discussion you taking me on a conceptual a journey that is just pleasing
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:08,704	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	Camino and
EDL	00:32:09,216	00:32:12,288	| Episode 12 The Neobiologist |	I just want to thank you for engaging me in this conversation
