For this episode of the Voices from DARPA podcast, we sat down with DARPA
Director,  Dr. Stefanie Tompkins, to discuss the agencyâ€™s upcoming DARPA Forward
regional event series. Held on leading research and development campuses
throughout the United States and open to all, these conferences will connect
DARPA leaders with new communities of talent and partnerships.

We also speak with  Dr. Max Shulaker from MIT, who had an early-career
opportunity to join the DARPA innovation ecosystem, and Lucia White, graduate
student at the University of Wisconsin and member of the US Space Force, who
will participate in DARPA Forward as a 2022 DARPA Riser.

EDL	00:00:02,320	00:00:04,000	| E59 |	Coming to DARPA is like grabbing the
EDL	00:00:04,000	00:00:05,920	| E59 |	nose cone of a rocket and holding on for
EDL	00:00:05,920	00:00:08,240	| E59 |	dear life
EDL	00:00:08,240	00:00:09,679	| E59 |	DARPA is a place where if you don't
EDL	00:00:09,679	00:00:11,250	| E59 |	invent the Internet you only get a b
EDL	00:00:11,250	00:00:12,880	| E59 |	[Music]
EDL	00:00:12,880	00:00:14,960	| E59 |	a DARPA program manager quite literally
EDL	00:00:14,960	00:00:17,199	| E59 |	invents tomorrow coming to work every
EDL	00:00:17,199	00:00:19,439	| E59 |	day and being humbled by that DARPA is
EDL	00:00:19,439	00:00:21,520	| E59 |	not one person or one place it's a
EDL	00:00:21,520	00:00:23,039	| E59 |	collection of people that are excited
EDL	00:00:23,039	00:00:26,000	| E59 |	about moving technology forward
EDL	00:00:26,000	00:00:27,920	| E59 |	DARPA forward is taking national
EDL	00:00:27,920	00:00:30,560	| E59 |	security innovation on the road from
EDL	00:00:30,560	00:00:33,760	| E59 |	august to december 2022 six regional
EDL	00:00:33,760	00:00:35,600	| E59 |	events held at leading research and
EDL	00:00:35,600	00:00:38,160	| E59 |	development universities nationwide will
EDL	00:00:38,160	00:00:39,840	| E59 |	connect defense advanced research
EDL	00:00:39,840	00:00:42,000	| E59 |	projects agency leaders with new
EDL	00:00:42,000	00:00:44,640	| E59 |	communities of talent and partnerships
EDL	00:00:44,640	00:00:46,079	| E59 |	the ultimate goal
EDL	00:00:46,079	00:00:48,000	| E59 |	to energize regional and national
EDL	00:00:48,000	00:00:50,640	| E59 |	innovation ecosystems fuel breakthroughs
EDL	00:00:50,640	00:00:53,199	| E59 |	in national security and help deliver
EDL	00:00:53,199	00:00:56,000	| E59 |	the u.s technological advantage
EDL	00:00:56,000	00:00:57,600	| E59 |	DARPA forward participants will hear
EDL	00:00:57,600	00:00:59,760	| E59 |	from world-renowned scientists
EDL	00:00:59,760	00:01:01,840	| E59 |	accomplished innovators and senior
EDL	00:01:01,840	00:01:04,720	| E59 |	defense leaders on new capabilities as
EDL	00:01:04,720	00:01:06,960	| E59 |	well as the rapidly evolving challenges
EDL	00:01:06,960	00:01:09,439	| E59 |	faced by war fighters we sat down with
EDL	00:01:09,439	00:01:11,520	| E59 |	the director of DARPA Dr. stephanie
EDL	00:01:11,520	00:01:13,920	| E59 |	Tompkins who will cover how the agency
EDL	00:01:13,920	00:01:16,320	| E59 |	works and how best to engage with us
EDL	00:01:16,320	00:01:18,880	| E59 |	we'll also hear from Dr. max schulocker
EDL	00:01:18,880	00:01:21,200	| E59 |	at mit who had an early career
EDL	00:01:21,200	00:01:23,680	| E59 |	opportunity to join the DARPA innovation
EDL	00:01:23,680	00:01:26,400	| E59 |	ecosystem and lucia white
EDL	00:01:26,400	00:01:28,080	| E59 |	graduate student at the university of
EDL	00:01:28,080	00:01:30,640	| E59 |	wisconsin and member of the u.s space
EDL	00:01:30,640	00:01:32,960	| E59 |	force who will participate in DARPA
EDL	00:01:32,960	00:01:36,720	| E59 |	forward as a 2022 DARPA riser
EDL	00:01:36,720	00:01:38,640	| E59 |	here's Dr. Tompkins
EDL	00:01:38,640	00:01:41,759	| E59 |	so DARPA has historically had some kind
EDL	00:01:41,759	00:01:44,960	| E59 |	of really big conference or symposium
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:47,520	| E59 |	every few years going back as far as i
EDL	00:01:47,520	00:01:49,520	| E59 |	can remember we typically hold one big
EDL	00:01:49,520	00:01:52,560	| E59 |	event somewhere west coast east coast we
EDL	00:01:52,560	00:01:54,799	| E59 |	did do one in st louis but i think what
EDL	00:01:54,799	00:01:56,240	| E59 |	characterizes all of them they're
EDL	00:01:56,240	00:01:58,719	| E59 |	fantastic events but they are events
EDL	00:01:58,719	00:02:00,880	| E59 |	that tend to drive more towards DARPA
EDL	00:02:00,880	00:02:02,880	| E59 |	insiders because if you're gonna take
EDL	00:02:02,880	00:02:04,880	| E59 |	the time and you're gonna pay the money
EDL	00:02:04,880	00:02:06,320	| E59 |	and you're gonna travel
EDL	00:02:06,320	00:02:07,920	| E59 |	you have to have some sense that there
EDL	00:02:07,920	00:02:10,318	| E59 |	is a real value for you and my worry is
EDL	00:02:10,318	00:02:12,400	| E59 |	always that there are amazing people
EDL	00:02:12,400	00:02:14,640	| E59 |	with amazing ideas hidden across the
EDL	00:02:14,640	00:02:16,400	| E59 |	country for whom we have not reached
EDL	00:02:16,400	00:02:18,879	| E59 |	that threshold where it makes sense for
EDL	00:02:18,879	00:02:21,680	| E59 |	them to invest the time to come find us
EDL	00:02:21,680	00:02:23,840	| E59 |	and so it really feels like we need to
EDL	00:02:23,840	00:02:25,920	| E59 |	find a way to come find them
EDL	00:02:25,920	00:02:28,080	| E59 |	and so you know the idea was to figure
EDL	00:02:28,080	00:02:31,120	| E59 |	out how we can regionally cover as much
EDL	00:02:31,120	00:02:33,040	| E59 |	of the united states as we could and get
EDL	00:02:33,040	00:02:34,720	| E59 |	as close as we could so that we might be
EDL	00:02:34,720	00:02:37,200	| E59 |	within just a couple hours access
EDL	00:02:37,200	00:02:39,120	| E59 |	for as many people as possible and then
EDL	00:02:39,120	00:02:40,959	| E59 |	we've asked the host institutions these
EDL	00:02:40,959	00:02:43,680	| E59 |	amazing research universities if they
EDL	00:02:43,680	00:02:46,000	| E59 |	would ignite their communities you know
EDL	00:02:46,000	00:02:47,920	| E59 |	whether they are science communities or
EDL	00:02:47,920	00:02:49,519	| E59 |	whether they're entrepreneurial and
EDL	00:02:49,519	00:02:52,400	| E59 |	startups all across not just their home
EDL	00:02:52,400	00:02:55,040	| E59 |	city but across their region as far out
EDL	00:02:55,040	00:02:57,280	| E59 |	as they possibly can so we can try to
EDL	00:02:57,280	00:02:58,800	| E59 |	bring people together that we've never
EDL	00:02:58,800	00:03:01,440	| E59 |	met before and maybe find the next
EDL	00:03:01,440	00:03:02,959	| E59 |	world-changing idea that we would have
EDL	00:03:02,959	00:03:05,519	| E59 |	missed if we didn't do dart before
EDL	00:03:05,519	00:03:07,440	| E59 |	DARPA forward is hosting events at
EDL	00:03:07,440	00:03:09,599	| E59 |	colorado state university
EDL	00:03:09,599	00:03:11,840	| E59 |	washington state university
EDL	00:03:11,840	00:03:14,239	| E59 |	the ohio state university
EDL	00:03:14,239	00:03:16,480	| E59 |	georgia institute of technology
EDL	00:03:16,480	00:03:18,480	| E59 |	texas a m university
EDL	00:03:18,480	00:03:20,560	| E59 |	and the university of california san
EDL	00:03:20,560	00:03:21,920	| E59 |	diego
EDL	00:03:21,920	00:03:23,920	| E59 |	the conferences are an opportunity for
EDL	00:03:23,920	00:03:26,319	| E59 |	new talent and familiar partners to find
EDL	00:03:26,319	00:03:28,560	| E59 |	inspiration and contribute to the DARPA
EDL	00:03:28,560	00:03:31,040	| E59 |	mission to make pivotal investments in
EDL	00:03:31,040	00:03:33,120	| E59 |	breakthrough technologies for national
EDL	00:03:33,120	00:03:34,319	| E59 |	security
EDL	00:03:34,319	00:03:36,319	| E59 |	we look for somebody with a really
EDL	00:03:36,319	00:03:38,720	| E59 |	adventurous spirit obviously
EDL	00:03:38,720	00:03:40,080	| E59 |	we're looking for people who are deeply
EDL	00:03:40,080	00:03:41,840	| E59 |	technically competent because they
EDL	00:03:41,840	00:03:43,680	| E59 |	actually have to understand whether or
EDL	00:03:43,680	00:03:45,360	| E59 |	not the things they want to do are
EDL	00:03:45,360	00:03:47,760	| E59 |	possible or you know as we like to say
EDL	00:03:47,760	00:03:49,760	| E59 |	just barely on the right side of
EDL	00:03:49,760	00:03:51,920	| E59 |	impossible we're looking for people who
EDL	00:03:51,920	00:03:54,799	| E59 |	are passionate who have this real sense
EDL	00:03:54,799	00:03:56,959	| E59 |	of urgency to make a difference because
EDL	00:03:56,959	00:03:58,480	| E59 |	they are the ones who are leading the
EDL	00:03:58,480	00:04:00,239	| E59 |	way so we we're looking for people who
EDL	00:04:00,239	00:04:02,239	| E59 |	get up every morning with a sense of
EDL	00:04:02,239	00:04:03,760	| E59 |	what they have to do
EDL	00:04:03,760	00:04:05,840	| E59 |	and this idea that they are running up
EDL	00:04:05,840	00:04:08,000	| E59 |	against time to get it done i really do
EDL	00:04:08,000	00:04:10,239	| E59 |	think it's this sense of urgency that
EDL	00:04:10,239	00:04:13,120	| E59 |	everything in the agency helps to create
EDL	00:04:13,120	00:04:15,040	| E59 |	and you know with that urgency we also
EDL	00:04:15,040	00:04:16,798	| E59 |	have new people coming in and new people
EDL	00:04:16,798	00:04:19,040	| E59 |	leaving all the time which allows fresh
EDL	00:04:19,040	00:04:21,040	| E59 |	ideas to come through so tolerance for
EDL	00:04:21,040	00:04:23,360	| E59 |	risk willingness to say yes to just
EDL	00:04:23,360	00:04:25,199	| E59 |	about anything those kinds of things are
EDL	00:04:25,199	00:04:27,280	| E59 |	important but i think the urgency is a
EDL	00:04:27,280	00:04:29,840	| E59 |	huge driver that enables the rest of it
EDL	00:04:29,840	00:04:32,160	| E59 |	with DARPA forward the agency has newly
EDL	00:04:32,160	00:04:34,479	| E59 |	ignited the spark of innovation
EDL	00:04:34,479	00:04:37,120	| E59 |	DARPA inspires in a new generation the
EDL	00:04:37,120	00:04:39,040	| E59 |	desire to help change the world for the
EDL	00:04:39,040	00:04:41,360	| E59 |	better and recognition that working with
EDL	00:04:41,360	00:04:44,240	| E59 |	DARPA is a way to do it the most obvious
EDL	00:04:44,240	00:04:46,479	| E59 |	way to get involved early on for example
EDL	00:04:46,479	00:04:48,160	| E59 |	if you're a graduate student or a very
EDL	00:04:48,160	00:04:50,400	| E59 |	young brand new researcher is to do it
EDL	00:04:50,400	00:04:51,759	| E59 |	through DARPA projects that already
EDL	00:04:51,759	00:04:53,199	| E59 |	exist you're probably not going to be
EDL	00:04:53,199	00:04:54,320	| E59 |	leading them you're going to be part of
EDL	00:04:54,320	00:04:56,960	| E59 |	the team but it is a great way to get a
EDL	00:04:56,960	00:04:58,400	| E59 |	sense of what it's like to work on a
EDL	00:04:58,400	00:05:00,479	| E59 |	DARPA problem i think that is the kind
EDL	00:05:00,479	00:05:02,560	| E59 |	of thing that has been what we're told
EDL	00:05:02,560	00:05:04,000	| E59 |	really important for a lot of the people
EDL	00:05:04,000	00:05:05,840	| E59 |	who are involved with DARPA and we find
EDL	00:05:05,840	00:05:07,280	| E59 |	out that they had some kind of early
EDL	00:05:07,280	00:05:09,039	| E59 |	involvement as a student researcher for
EDL	00:05:09,039	00:05:12,080	| E59 |	example on a project but we are actually
EDL	00:05:12,080	00:05:14,400	| E59 |	going to be releasing some information
EDL	00:05:14,400	00:05:16,320	| E59 |	on a new initiative where we're going to
EDL	00:05:16,320	00:05:18,320	| E59 |	be looking at more
EDL	00:05:18,320	00:05:20,880	| E59 |	ways to pull people in early and we
EDL	00:05:20,880	00:05:23,280	| E59 |	certainly have different kinds of early
EDL	00:05:23,280	00:05:25,520	| E59 |	career opportunities so we have things
EDL	00:05:25,520	00:05:27,039	| E59 |	like the young faculty award program
EDL	00:05:27,039	00:05:28,880	| E59 |	which really focuses on
EDL	00:05:28,880	00:05:31,039	| E59 |	faculty who are in sort of the first
EDL	00:05:31,039	00:05:32,639	| E59 |	seven years for example of their
EDL	00:05:32,639	00:05:35,919	| E59 |	academic career or the equivalent level
EDL	00:05:35,919	00:05:37,600	| E59 |	of experience if you happen to be in
EDL	00:05:37,600	00:05:39,360	| E59 |	industry we call it the young faculty
EDL	00:05:39,360	00:05:41,199	| E59 |	award program it doesn't have to be just
EDL	00:05:41,199	00:05:44,080	| E59 |	for faculty members but the idea is that
EDL	00:05:44,080	00:05:46,560	| E59 |	we release a call for proposals
EDL	00:05:46,560	00:05:49,120	| E59 |	once a year different topics every year
EDL	00:05:49,120	00:05:51,360	| E59 |	and we try to use the program to help
EDL	00:05:51,360	00:05:53,360	| E59 |	those people really get immersed in the
EDL	00:05:53,360	00:05:54,960	| E59 |	DARPA culture and we introduce them to
EDL	00:05:54,960	00:05:56,639	| E59 |	bigger DARPA programs and bigger DARPA
EDL	00:05:56,639	00:05:58,240	| E59 |	communities with the hope that they're
EDL	00:05:58,240	00:05:59,680	| E59 |	going to want to keep on doing this
EDL	00:05:59,680	00:06:01,280	| E59 |	after the program's over
EDL	00:06:01,280	00:06:03,600	| E59 |	one of the things we started doing a
EDL	00:06:03,600	00:06:05,520	| E59 |	couple of DARPA conferences ago was a
EDL	00:06:05,520	00:06:07,600	| E59 |	program called DARPA risers and what we
EDL	00:06:07,600	00:06:10,000	| E59 |	do is we're looking for young rising
EDL	00:06:10,000	00:06:11,759	| E59 |	stars people who are working in
EDL	00:06:11,759	00:06:13,600	| E59 |	defense-related work they may not even
EDL	00:06:13,600	00:06:14,960	| E59 |	know it but the idea is that the
EDL	00:06:14,960	00:06:16,240	| E59 |	research that they're doing is relevant
EDL	00:06:16,240	00:06:18,400	| E59 |	to defense problems and they look like
EDL	00:06:18,400	00:06:20,160	| E59 |	people who really have the potential to
EDL	00:06:20,160	00:06:21,600	| E59 |	have that kind of darkest spirit that
EDL	00:06:21,600	00:06:23,680	| E59 |	we're always looking for and so across
EDL	00:06:23,680	00:06:25,840	| E59 |	all six events both DARPA program
EDL	00:06:25,840	00:06:28,479	| E59 |	managers and our host institutions and
EDL	00:06:28,479	00:06:30,319	| E59 |	all of their stakeholder partners have
EDL	00:06:30,319	00:06:33,199	| E59 |	nominated DARPA risers so
EDL	00:06:33,199	00:06:34,400	| E59 |	we're looking forward to meeting all of
EDL	00:06:34,400	00:06:36,560	| E59 |	them and we do also hope to stay in
EDL	00:06:36,560	00:06:38,400	| E59 |	touch with these risers not just the
EDL	00:06:38,400	00:06:40,080	| E59 |	ones that we're nominating for this
EDL	00:06:40,080	00:06:42,319	| E59 |	particular round but for all future
EDL	00:06:42,319	00:06:43,680	| E59 |	conferences and essentially create a
EDL	00:06:43,680	00:06:45,360	| E59 |	much broader community of people from
EDL	00:06:45,360	00:06:47,440	| E59 |	which we can draw potentially for future
EDL	00:06:47,440	00:06:49,599	| E59 |	dropper program managers or DARPA
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,599	| E59 |	researchers who are funded by DARPA or
EDL	00:06:51,599	00:06:53,120	| E59 |	DARPA support staff
EDL	00:06:53,120	00:06:55,440	| E59 |	DARPA risers are up and coming standouts
EDL	00:06:55,440	00:06:57,440	| E59 |	in their fields whose research is
EDL	00:06:57,440	00:06:59,360	| E59 |	related to national security and
EDL	00:06:59,360	00:07:01,520	| E59 |	demonstrates the potential to lead to
EDL	00:07:01,520	00:07:03,919	| E59 |	technological surprise the heart of
EDL	00:07:03,919	00:07:05,440	| E59 |	DARPA's mission
EDL	00:07:05,440	00:07:07,520	| E59 |	the risers program provides individuals
EDL	00:07:07,520	00:07:09,120	| E59 |	in the early stages of their research
EDL	00:07:09,120	00:07:12,000	| E59 |	career with a unique opportunity to be
EDL	00:07:12,000	00:07:14,240	| E59 |	recognized for their notable work and to
EDL	00:07:14,240	00:07:17,039	| E59 |	present their ideas directly to DARPA
EDL	00:07:17,039	00:07:19,120	| E59 |	the risers program provides individuals
EDL	00:07:19,120	00:07:20,720	| E59 |	in early stages of their research
EDL	00:07:20,720	00:07:23,199	| E59 |	careers with a unique opportunity to be
EDL	00:07:23,199	00:07:25,360	| E59 |	recognized for their notable work and to
EDL	00:07:25,360	00:07:28,000	| E59 |	present their ideas directly to DARPA
EDL	00:07:28,000	00:07:30,319	| E59 |	major lucia white was recently nominated
EDL	00:07:30,319	00:07:34,000	| E59 |	to serve in the 2022 DARPA forward class
EDL	00:07:34,000	00:07:35,759	| E59 |	and will be presenting her work at the
EDL	00:07:35,759	00:07:37,840	| E59 |	texas a m event
EDL	00:07:37,840	00:07:40,160	| E59 |	here she discusses her background how
EDL	00:07:40,160	00:07:42,560	| E59 |	this opportunity will impact her career
EDL	00:07:42,560	00:07:44,720	| E59 |	and how she hopes to give back from a
EDL	00:07:44,720	00:07:47,039	| E59 |	young age i was always fascinated with
EDL	00:07:47,039	00:07:49,280	| E59 |	space and looking up at the sky at night
EDL	00:07:49,280	00:07:51,120	| E59 |	and then both of my parents were
EDL	00:07:51,120	00:07:53,280	| E59 |	engineers so i guess it kind of runs in
EDL	00:07:53,280	00:07:55,840	| E59 |	my blood to want to be a scientist or an
EDL	00:07:55,840	00:07:58,080	| E59 |	engineer and that's how i found myself
EDL	00:07:58,080	00:07:59,840	| E59 |	going to the air force academy and
EDL	00:07:59,840	00:08:02,240	| E59 |	majoring in biology i'm getting another
EDL	00:08:02,240	00:08:03,840	| E59 |	master's degree so i can go teach
EDL	00:08:03,840	00:08:06,160	| E59 |	biology back at my alma mater so i'm
EDL	00:08:06,160	00:08:07,919	| E59 |	really excited about that
EDL	00:08:07,919	00:08:10,400	| E59 |	project tasty is the first plant fungal
EDL	00:08:10,400	00:08:12,639	| E59 |	experiment on the international space
EDL	00:08:12,639	00:08:15,360	| E59 |	station we're going to look at how we
EDL	00:08:15,360	00:08:17,360	| E59 |	can improve plant growth and
EDL	00:08:17,360	00:08:20,000	| E59 |	microgravity because plants grow kind of
EDL	00:08:20,000	00:08:22,560	| E59 |	wimpy in space because they don't have
EDL	00:08:22,560	00:08:24,160	| E59 |	gravity that they're used to here on
EDL	00:08:24,160	00:08:27,360	| E59 |	earth so it's difficult for root systems
EDL	00:08:27,360	00:08:28,560	| E59 |	to grow
EDL	00:08:28,560	00:08:30,479	| E59 |	with my research i work with a
EDL	00:08:30,479	00:08:33,599	| E59 |	beneficial microbe called trichoderma
EDL	00:08:33,599	00:08:35,919	| E59 |	hazianum and that microbe kind of acts
EDL	00:08:35,919	00:08:38,159	| E59 |	like a space miracle grow if you will or
EDL	00:08:38,159	00:08:40,240	| E59 |	at least we're hoping it will so when a
EDL	00:08:40,240	00:08:42,640	| E59 |	plant is stressed it builds resiliency
EDL	00:08:42,640	00:08:44,640	| E59 |	in the plant root system and in the
EDL	00:08:44,640	00:08:47,680	| E59 |	plant itself so we're hoping that these
EDL	00:08:47,680	00:08:50,240	| E59 |	plants in space they'll grow much better
EDL	00:08:50,240	00:08:52,560	| E59 |	and be able to sustain
EDL	00:08:52,560	00:08:55,440	| E59 |	for DARPA forward DARPA program managers
EDL	00:08:55,440	00:08:57,760	| E59 |	and faculty at universities near each
EDL	00:08:57,760	00:09:00,240	| E59 |	event identified a small group of early
EDL	00:09:00,240	00:09:02,880	| E59 |	career scientists and engineers to join
EDL	00:09:02,880	00:09:06,399	| E59 |	the 2022 DARPA risers cohort i had an
EDL	00:09:06,399	00:09:08,640	| E59 |	interest in project cornucopia so i
EDL	00:09:08,640	00:09:10,560	| E59 |	reached out to their project lead dr
EDL	00:09:10,560	00:09:14,000	| E59 |	molly john and she was the one that
EDL	00:09:14,000	00:09:16,240	| E59 |	nominated me i'm just gonna interject
EDL	00:09:16,240	00:09:17,760	| E59 |	here with the shameless voices from
EDL	00:09:17,760	00:09:19,120	| E59 |	DARPA plug
EDL	00:09:19,120	00:09:20,959	| E59 |	we highlighted Dr. john's work in a
EDL	00:09:20,959	00:09:23,279	| E59 |	previous episode called the future of
EDL	00:09:23,279	00:09:24,160	| E59 |	food
EDL	00:09:24,160	00:09:25,920	| E59 |	meals from microbes
EDL	00:09:25,920	00:09:27,760	| E59 |	check it out if you can
EDL	00:09:27,760	00:09:30,000	| E59 |	okay now back to our regularly scheduled
EDL	00:09:30,000	00:09:32,640	| E59 |	podcast i feel being a DARPA riser will
EDL	00:09:32,640	00:09:35,360	| E59 |	allow me more opportunities to pursue
EDL	00:09:35,360	00:09:37,440	| E59 |	the research that i really want to do i
EDL	00:09:37,440	00:09:40,560	| E59 |	hope to give back by one day being a
EDL	00:09:40,560	00:09:42,880	| E59 |	project lead at DARPA i'm really
EDL	00:09:42,880	00:09:44,800	| E59 |	passionate about the space flight
EDL	00:09:44,800	00:09:47,839	| E59 |	environment but more specifically for
EDL	00:09:47,839	00:09:50,160	| E59 |	problems here on earth such as food
EDL	00:09:50,160	00:09:53,440	| E59 |	security issues and climate change i'm
EDL	00:09:53,440	00:09:56,080	| E59 |	really excited about going down to texas
EDL	00:09:56,080	00:09:58,640	| E59 |	a m not only to present my research but
EDL	00:09:58,640	00:09:59,680	| E59 |	to also
EDL	00:09:59,680	00:10:01,519	| E59 |	you know talk to other people and see
EDL	00:10:01,519	00:10:03,600	| E59 |	what other research is going on as well
EDL	00:10:03,600	00:10:06,000	| E59 |	a lot of networking and a lot of things
EDL	00:10:06,000	00:10:08,399	| E59 |	that maybe be applicable to what i'm
EDL	00:10:08,399	00:10:10,800	| E59 |	actually doing and can help my research
EDL	00:10:10,800	00:10:12,640	| E59 |	dr max schulacker is an assistant
EDL	00:10:12,640	00:10:14,480	| E59 |	professor in electrical engineering and
EDL	00:10:14,480	00:10:16,560	| E59 |	computer science at mit
EDL	00:10:16,560	00:10:19,600	| E59 |	he was a 2015 DARPA riser and currently
EDL	00:10:19,600	00:10:22,480	| E59 |	serves as a DARPA program performer
EDL	00:10:22,480	00:10:24,880	| E59 |	our focus is in the
EDL	00:10:24,880	00:10:27,279	| E59 |	broad area of this new kind of
EDL	00:10:27,279	00:10:28,800	| E59 |	discipline that we like to call nano
EDL	00:10:28,800	00:10:31,200	| E59 |	systems which is basically taking new
EDL	00:10:31,200	00:10:32,399	| E59 |	technologies
EDL	00:10:32,399	00:10:35,440	| E59 |	whether they be materials or devices or
EDL	00:10:35,440	00:10:38,480	| E59 |	sensors and figuring out new ways to
EDL	00:10:38,480	00:10:40,560	| E59 |	integrate them into a larger system in
EDL	00:10:40,560	00:10:42,399	| E59 |	order to perform some new type of
EDL	00:10:42,399	00:10:44,399	| E59 |	application one example could be a new
EDL	00:10:44,399	00:10:46,480	| E59 |	type of sensor that we integrate at a
EDL	00:10:46,480	00:10:48,480	| E59 |	very large scale to do some
EDL	00:10:48,480	00:10:49,839	| E59 |	you know healthcare diagnostic
EDL	00:10:49,839	00:10:50,959	| E59 |	application
EDL	00:10:50,959	00:10:52,800	| E59 |	another example could be the work i'm
EDL	00:10:52,800	00:10:54,880	| E59 |	very fortunate to be doing with DARPA
EDL	00:10:54,880	00:10:57,120	| E59 |	would be integrating multiple different
EDL	00:10:57,120	00:10:59,120	| E59 |	new technologies in order to build
EDL	00:10:59,120	00:11:00,720	| E59 |	three-dimensional chips for
EDL	00:11:00,720	00:11:02,720	| E59 |	high-performance computing applications
EDL	00:11:02,720	00:11:05,600	| E59 |	at starbus hope that 20 years from now
EDL	00:11:05,600	00:11:06,800	| E59 |	people will look back at the
EDL	00:11:06,800	00:11:08,880	| E59 |	conversations we had during the DARPA
EDL	00:11:08,880	00:11:11,120	| E59 |	forward series and recognize the
EDL	00:11:11,120	00:11:13,200	| E59 |	germination of ideas that created a
EDL	00:11:13,200	00:11:16,240	| E59 |	better future the DARPA riser experience
EDL	00:11:16,240	00:11:19,920	| E59 |	it really was a defining and extremely
EDL	00:11:19,920	00:11:21,920	| E59 |	impactful moment for me in my career and
EDL	00:11:21,920	00:11:23,839	| E59 |	also in my larger ambitions for what i
EDL	00:11:23,839	00:11:25,920	| E59 |	want to try and achieve professionally
EDL	00:11:25,920	00:11:27,920	| E59 |	and the impact i wanted to have DARPA
EDL	00:11:27,920	00:11:30,560	| E59 |	was a pretty intimidating agency to me
EDL	00:11:30,560	00:11:32,720	| E59 |	perhaps by design it was the heavy
EDL	00:11:32,720	00:11:34,880	| E59 |	hitting place where if you wanted to do
EDL	00:11:34,880	00:11:36,959	| E59 |	something really really tough but have
EDL	00:11:36,959	00:11:39,600	| E59 |	the resources to execute a real vision
EDL	00:11:39,600	00:11:42,640	| E59 |	that was the place to go and when i went
EDL	00:11:42,640	00:11:43,360	| E59 |	to
EDL	00:11:43,360	00:11:45,360	| E59 |	the DARPA wait what event as a DARPA
EDL	00:11:45,360	00:11:47,680	| E59 |	riser it was really remarkable because i
EDL	00:11:47,680	00:11:49,600	| E59 |	got to meet so many different program
EDL	00:11:49,600	00:11:51,760	| E59 |	managers the deputy director of DARPA
EDL	00:11:51,760	00:11:53,600	| E59 |	the director of DARPA at the time
EDL	00:11:53,600	00:11:55,760	| E59 |	and it really showed me two things one
EDL	00:11:55,760	00:11:57,920	| E59 |	is that there are people behind the
EDL	00:11:57,920	00:12:00,480	| E59 |	agency who really make it work and it's
EDL	00:12:00,480	00:12:02,639	| E59 |	a remarkable group of people who believe
EDL	00:12:02,639	00:12:04,880	| E59 |	in the mission and work just as hard as
EDL	00:12:04,880	00:12:06,560	| E59 |	the performers to make the program
EDL	00:12:06,560	00:12:08,639	| E59 |	successful so that was great to see and
EDL	00:12:08,639	00:12:10,560	| E59 |	it was also really exciting to see that
EDL	00:12:10,560	00:12:13,200	| E59 |	the goal of DARPA in my opinion of every
EDL	00:12:13,200	00:12:15,839	| E59 |	program manager i talked to was to do
EDL	00:12:15,839	00:12:18,720	| E59 |	really impactful work our programs and
EDL	00:12:18,720	00:12:21,200	| E59 |	our people are part of DARPA for just a
EDL	00:12:21,200	00:12:23,279	| E59 |	few years so we're looking for new
EDL	00:12:23,279	00:12:24,880	| E59 |	talent and new partners in the
EDL	00:12:24,880	00:12:27,839	| E59 |	innovation ecosystem what i learned and
EDL	00:12:27,839	00:12:29,440	| E59 |	was really impressed upon me at that
EDL	00:12:29,440	00:12:30,959	| E59 |	event and all my interactions with DARPA
EDL	00:12:30,959	00:12:32,000	| E59 |	since then
EDL	00:12:32,000	00:12:33,839	| E59 |	has been that DARPA works very
EDL	00:12:33,839	00:12:35,920	| E59 |	differently that mantra of DARPA hard
EDL	00:12:35,920	00:12:37,680	| E59 |	problem is something that i think is
EDL	00:12:37,680	00:12:40,160	| E59 |	really in DARPA's dna it's where if you
EDL	00:12:40,160	00:12:42,240	| E59 |	have a very difficult problem that would
EDL	00:12:42,240	00:12:45,040	| E59 |	have very high impact DARPA is willing
EDL	00:12:45,040	00:12:46,959	| E59 |	to kick that journey with a performer
EDL	00:12:46,959	00:12:48,480	| E59 |	and also support it to the level in
EDL	00:12:48,480	00:12:50,160	| E59 |	which it needs to be supported to see it
EDL	00:12:50,160	00:12:53,279	| E59 |	successful it really got me very excited
EDL	00:12:53,279	00:12:55,360	| E59 |	about working with DARPA and luckily i
EDL	00:12:55,360	00:12:56,800	| E59 |	was able to do so in the years
EDL	00:12:56,800	00:12:59,600	| E59 |	afterwards we continued working with our
EDL	00:12:59,600	00:13:01,600	| E59 |	program manager to define you know what
EDL	00:13:01,600	00:13:03,279	| E59 |	the next step in that journey should
EDL	00:13:03,279	00:13:05,839	| E59 |	look like with his guidance and support
EDL	00:13:05,839	00:13:07,360	| E59 |	were able to shape what a new program
EDL	00:13:07,360	00:13:10,000	| E59 |	would look like so it was a pretty
EDL	00:13:10,000	00:13:12,320	| E59 |	painless path to go from the DARPA riser
EDL	00:13:12,320	00:13:14,079	| E59 |	to a performer
EDL	00:13:14,079	00:13:16,880	| E59 |	the only thing that matters is the merit
EDL	00:13:16,880	00:13:18,959	| E59 |	of the idea that you present kind of how
EDL	00:13:18,959	00:13:21,279	| E59 |	feasible of a project you're proposing
EDL	00:13:21,279	00:13:22,959	| E59 |	and how big of an impact it will be
EDL	00:13:22,959	00:13:24,720	| E59 |	otherwise it doesn't really matter who
EDL	00:13:24,720	00:13:26,000	| E59 |	you come from if you've worked with
EDL	00:13:26,000	00:13:28,880	| E59 |	doctor before or not DARPA hard problems
EDL	00:13:28,880	00:13:30,880	| E59 |	collaborative culture technical
EDL	00:13:30,880	00:13:33,839	| E59 |	excellence here's Dr. Tompkins again one
EDL	00:13:33,839	00:13:35,040	| E59 |	of the joys of being at DARPA is you
EDL	00:13:35,040	00:13:36,560	| E59 |	tend to be excited about just about
EDL	00:13:36,560	00:13:39,199	| E59 |	everything so we should
EDL	00:13:39,199	00:13:41,360	| E59 |	caveat this by reminding everybody that
EDL	00:13:41,360	00:13:44,399	| E59 |	we have about 250 active programs
EDL	00:13:44,399	00:13:46,560	| E59 |	at any moment in time and we're starting
EDL	00:13:46,560	00:13:48,800	| E59 |	about 50 new ones a year
EDL	00:13:48,800	00:13:50,320	| E59 |	so it's not just about having a hard
EDL	00:13:50,320	00:13:52,160	| E59 |	time having favorites is that we have so
EDL	00:13:52,160	00:13:54,160	| E59 |	much going on and
EDL	00:13:54,160	00:13:56,160	| E59 |	by definition if we approved it to go
EDL	00:13:56,160	00:13:58,079	| E59 |	forward it means we're excited about it
EDL	00:13:58,079	00:14:00,160	| E59 |	but the kinds of things that might be of
EDL	00:14:00,160	00:14:02,160	| E59 |	interest to people coming to DARPA
EDL	00:14:02,160	00:14:03,120	| E59 |	forward
EDL	00:14:03,120	00:14:04,399	| E59 |	often these are going to be things that
EDL	00:14:04,399	00:14:06,880	| E59 |	have spillover potential to society so
EDL	00:14:06,880	00:14:08,160	| E59 |	they're not just national security
EDL	00:14:08,160	00:14:09,920	| E59 |	problems but they're the kinds of things
EDL	00:14:09,920	00:14:11,920	| E59 |	that might affect their lives as just
EDL	00:14:11,920	00:14:14,240	| E59 |	individual humans and so the kinds of
EDL	00:14:14,240	00:14:16,000	| E59 |	things there are the things that we're
EDL	00:14:16,000	00:14:17,920	| E59 |	doing in the world of supply chains and
EDL	00:14:17,920	00:14:19,199	| E59 |	logistics
EDL	00:14:19,199	00:14:20,800	| E59 |	and it's sort of funny because these are
EDL	00:14:20,800	00:14:22,079	| E59 |	things that traditionally everyone
EDL	00:14:22,079	00:14:24,160	| E59 |	thinks is really boring
EDL	00:14:24,160	00:14:25,519	| E59 |	we're not setting world records in
EDL	00:14:25,519	00:14:27,120	| E59 |	anything we're trying to fix the stuff
EDL	00:14:27,120	00:14:28,800	| E59 |	behind the scenes that nobody ever
EDL	00:14:28,800	00:14:30,800	| E59 |	really gives any thought to i think the
EDL	00:14:30,800	00:14:32,560	| E59 |	pandemic's done a good job of helping
EDL	00:14:32,560	00:14:34,240	| E59 |	people to realize how important supply
EDL	00:14:34,240	00:14:36,079	| E59 |	chains really are and darp has actually
EDL	00:14:36,079	00:14:37,920	| E59 |	been thinking about this of course for
EDL	00:14:37,920	00:14:39,760	| E59 |	quite a while we've had a number of
EDL	00:14:39,760	00:14:42,800	| E59 |	investments historically in the idea of
EDL	00:14:42,800	00:14:44,720	| E59 |	rather than transporting things in the
EDL	00:14:44,720	00:14:47,120	| E59 |	idea of making what you need where and
EDL	00:14:47,120	00:14:49,440	| E59 |	when you need it from whatever local
EDL	00:14:49,440	00:14:51,440	| E59 |	resources you can get a hold of and so
EDL	00:14:51,440	00:14:52,959	| E59 |	the most extreme examples would be
EDL	00:14:52,959	00:14:54,639	| E59 |	things like our atmospheric water
EDL	00:14:54,639	00:14:56,880	| E59 |	extraction program where you want to be
EDL	00:14:56,880	00:14:58,639	| E59 |	able to extract water directly from the
EDL	00:14:58,639	00:15:01,600	| E59 |	air even the most arid desert air that
EDL	00:15:01,600	00:15:03,680	| E59 |	you could imagine
EDL	00:15:03,680	00:15:05,600	| E59 |	we have two different programs focused
EDL	00:15:05,600	00:15:08,320	| E59 |	on extracting resources either from
EDL	00:15:08,320	00:15:10,320	| E59 |	waste materials such as plastics or
EDL	00:15:10,320	00:15:12,399	| E59 |	again from the air and from water to
EDL	00:15:12,399	00:15:14,639	| E59 |	create food
EDL	00:15:14,639	00:15:17,199	| E59 |	very much focused on nutrition starting
EDL	00:15:17,199	00:15:19,839	| E59 |	to think about taste so we might not yet
EDL	00:15:19,839	00:15:21,440	| E59 |	be ready for uh you know kind of the
EDL	00:15:21,440	00:15:23,440	| E59 |	eating competition where everybody dives
EDL	00:15:23,440	00:15:25,600	| E59 |	in but we're making some really exciting
EDL	00:15:25,600	00:15:26,399	| E59 |	progress
EDL	00:15:26,399	00:15:28,720	| E59 |	on things that could be transformative
EDL	00:15:28,720	00:15:30,320	| E59 |	in that world we've been working for
EDL	00:15:30,320	00:15:33,279	| E59 |	years on being able to develop medicines
EDL	00:15:33,279	00:15:35,199	| E59 |	pharmaceuticals right where you need
EDL	00:15:35,199	00:15:37,120	| E59 |	them and it just seems like there's kind
EDL	00:15:37,120	00:15:39,279	| E59 |	of a wave of technology that's making
EDL	00:15:39,279	00:15:40,639	| E59 |	this available that's allowing us to
EDL	00:15:40,639	00:15:42,560	| E59 |	think about more and more things at the
EDL	00:15:42,560	00:15:44,240	| E59 |	same time we have other program managers
EDL	00:15:44,240	00:15:45,759	| E59 |	who are thinking about how how you do
EDL	00:15:45,759	00:15:48,240	| E59 |	transport things so you're going to have
EDL	00:15:48,240	00:15:50,079	| E59 |	to move something from point a to point
EDL	00:15:50,079	00:15:52,000	| E59 |	b do we have different ways of doing
EDL	00:15:52,000	00:15:53,839	| E59 |	that so the liberty lifter program is
EDL	00:15:53,839	00:15:56,720	| E59 |	example of an aircraft that's much
EDL	00:15:56,720	00:15:58,560	| E59 |	larger than any seaplane that's ever
EDL	00:15:58,560	00:16:00,560	| E59 |	been built before that might have a
EDL	00:16:00,560	00:16:02,800	| E59 |	completely different space
EDL	00:16:02,800	00:16:05,600	| E59 |	in the whole trade space of logistics
EDL	00:16:05,600	00:16:06,800	| E59 |	and
EDL	00:16:06,800	00:16:08,160	| E59 |	we also have people who are just
EDL	00:16:08,160	00:16:10,720	| E59 |	thinking about the complexity of supply
EDL	00:16:10,720	00:16:12,079	| E59 |	chains in general so we have a new
EDL	00:16:12,079	00:16:13,920	| E59 |	program looking at supply and demand
EDL	00:16:13,920	00:16:16,320	| E59 |	networks and how we can stress test them
EDL	00:16:16,320	00:16:18,160	| E59 |	so you know who would have thought that
EDL	00:16:18,160	00:16:20,000	| E59 |	maybe your sixth or seventh tier
EDL	00:16:20,000	00:16:21,600	| E59 |	supplier if something goes wrong with
EDL	00:16:21,600	00:16:23,759	| E59 |	one of them it could cause all kinds of
EDL	00:16:23,759	00:16:28,160	| E59 |	problems to your major dod manufacturers
EDL	00:16:28,160	00:16:29,199	| E59 |	because we don't have that kind of
EDL	00:16:29,199	00:16:31,360	| E59 |	insight and the idea is that we can
EDL	00:16:31,360	00:16:32,959	| E59 |	automatically develop that insight in
EDL	00:16:32,959	00:16:35,040	| E59 |	real time and be able to do stress tests
EDL	00:16:35,040	00:16:36,480	| E59 |	to figure out where things would break
EDL	00:16:36,480	00:16:38,160	| E59 |	and how far we can take the system and
EDL	00:16:38,160	00:16:40,320	| E59 |	how we could fix it so lots of stuff
EDL	00:16:40,320	00:16:43,440	| E59 |	going on in that world and
EDL	00:16:43,440	00:16:44,800	| E59 |	while there's more and more and more
EDL	00:16:44,800	00:16:46,079	| E59 |	we'll kind of leave it with that topic
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:47,040	| E59 |	because i think there's a lot of
EDL	00:16:47,040	00:16:48,480	| E59 |	richness there that
EDL	00:16:48,480	00:16:50,639	| E59 |	might excite the DARPA forward community
EDL	00:16:50,639	00:16:52,320	| E59 |	we work with
EDL	00:16:52,320	00:16:54,480	| E59 |	all kinds of organizations and all kinds
EDL	00:16:54,480	00:16:56,240	| E59 |	of people wherever we can find the
EDL	00:16:56,240	00:16:57,759	| E59 |	talent and people who are willing to
EDL	00:16:57,759	00:16:58,880	| E59 |	roll up their sleeves and work like
EDL	00:16:58,880	00:17:00,480	| E59 |	crazy we're willing to have them be part
EDL	00:17:00,480	00:17:02,399	| E59 |	of the DARPA family
EDL	00:17:02,399	00:17:04,240	| E59 |	we encourage anyone interested in
