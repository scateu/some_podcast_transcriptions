EDL	00:02:04,928	00:02:05,696	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's so good to have you
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:07,744	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's my pleasure to be here
EDL	00:02:08,256	00:02:10,304	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Let's start by talking about your background
EDL	00:02:10,304	00:02:13,376	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Bachelor's degree in physics when US Naval Academy and that's
EDL	00:02:13,376	00:02:14,144	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Suggest to me
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:17,984	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That you arrived at the Academy with some interest in science and the Navy
EDL	00:02:18,752	00:02:19,520	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So where did those interest
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:25,664	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well I think my interest in science and engineering really came from
EDL	00:02:26,176	00:02:30,784	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	My father I was raised in a family that had a lot of engineer so that was
EDL	00:02:30,784	00:02:32,320	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's kind of an expected thing and
EDL	00:02:32,832	00:02:34,880	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I did pretty well in those subjects
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:40,512	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Although I didn't really know what that meant like most students but I was kind of good at it and
EDL	00:02:40,512	00:02:42,304	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	One thing about the Naval Academy
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:46,912	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	80% of everybody was an engineer in those days so it wasn't a hard choice
EDL	00:02:48,448	00:02:51,264	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I would guess that your interest in plasma physics so that's what you
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,032	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You studied in your graduate
EDL	00:02:52,544	00:02:58,176	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Which is Central to the process of nuclear fusion somehow emerge from your time serving on a nucleus
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:00,480	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Submarine which relies on nuclear fission for its
EDL	00:03:00,480	00:03:01,248	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Propulsion
EDL	00:03:01,248	00:03:02,784	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I think you said to me one time that day
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:04,320	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	When you did a lot of boiling of water
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,392	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Tell me about asserted that that connection you have with both fission and fusion
EDL	00:03:07,904	00:03:09,696	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah well it was
EDL	00:03:09,696	00:03:11,488	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I was an interest of mine
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:14,048	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Just as I got into engineering the whole
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:19,680	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Nuclear industry and and using fission to to make power and of course being in the Navy
EDL	00:03:19,680	00:03:22,752	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The opportunity go on a submarine and
EDL	00:03:22,752	00:03:23,520	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And serve
EDL	00:03:24,032	00:03:26,592	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Was really the attraction that's what got me into it
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:28,384	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The diffusion piece
EDL	00:03:28,896	00:03:31,200	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Actually came about from
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:34,784	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Experience I had at the Los Alamos in the summertime
EDL	00:03:34,784	00:03:36,576	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I'm and I have to confess
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:41,184	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I did that solely to get out of spending a hot summer in Maryland
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:41,952	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yelling at
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:42,720	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Freshman
EDL	00:03:43,232	00:03:48,864	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I look for ways to get out of that and one of the options was to do a research assistantship at
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,656	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	At Los Alamos National Lab
EDL	00:03:50,656	00:03:53,728	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I ended up working with a group in
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,008	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Plasma physics
EDL	00:03:55,008	00:03:56,032	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Doing Fusion work
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:03:58,592	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And the key piece that was
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,128	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Just breakthrough for me is
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:06,784	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It was the first time that I was in a laboratory and we are trying to do something where we didn't know how it was going to turn out
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:12,928	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Previous to that in classrooms Laboratories or those science fairs in high school
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:16,256	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You were usually just trying to make something work
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:19,839	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But you knew the answer it was just could you make it
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:20,351	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Happen
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,167	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And it was at Los Alamos where I finally
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:23,935	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Saw
EDL	00:04:23,935	00:04:27,519	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We were doing experiments and I realized he's really bright people
EDL	00:04:27,519	00:04:32,895	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They hope they knew it was happening but the reality was we did experiments to find out and then we adjusted
EDL	00:04:32,895	00:04:36,991	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that was very exciting to me was to see this whole idea of
EDL	00:04:36,991	00:04:38,527	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Really doing research
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,599	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To explore as opposed to just
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:43,647	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Just get something right so you could get a grade on a
EDL	00:04:44,159	00:04:44,671	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hyatt Estero
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A lab report
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:46,975	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it was sort of
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:47,999	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Excitement about
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:49,279	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Discovery release
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:51,839	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This morning about nature totally changed my
EDL	00:04:51,839	00:04:55,423	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	My whole View and that's what led to me choosing to do that for grads
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:56,959	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's cool I when I got out of the Navy
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:03,103	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then after your service and education you went off into the defense industry for a while you work on
EDL	00:05:03,103	00:05:03,615	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Such things as
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,151	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Underwater shocks
EDL	00:05:05,151	00:05:05,663	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	System
EDL	00:05:06,175	00:05:07,199	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Energy weapons
EDL	00:05:07,199	00:05:08,479	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Encounter rocket armor
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:10,271	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And laser-based instrumentation
EDL	00:05:10,783	00:05:12,063	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I also The Fantasticks
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:16,415	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Phenomena and Technologies
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:18,463	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then you went into a more academic.
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:19,743	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Still defense
EDL	00:05:19,743	00:05:20,511	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Centric setting a
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,023	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Penn State
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,351	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then somewhere along the way you intersect
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,143	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	With DARPA so can you
EDL	00:05:26,143	00:05:32,543	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Intersection haven't actually my intersection happened when I left grad school and I joined the
EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:34,847	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The small company called Advanced power Technologies
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,383	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	In industry
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:43,039	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Which was the small company where you mentioned some of those projects in undersea shock programs
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:44,319	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	For listening
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:47,135	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Who don't. Know what that means how would you describe that
EDL	00:05:47,135	00:05:53,279	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's by the way I've had more fun than anybody should as far as the kind of range of projects we get to do
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:57,119	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What we were looking at was the whole idea of cannae
EDL	00:05:57,119	00:06:01,983	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Create an undersea Shockwave which means basically light off an explosive underwater
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:05,823	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But do it in a way that we could shape those shockwaves
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,615	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	All pile up on top of each other
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:10,431	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And smash something like
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:10,943	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Am I
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,759	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So we're actually looking at mine clearance doing that
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:14,271	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Attend
EDL	00:06:14,783	00:06:21,183	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That was an idea that we we sold to DARPA as something that they would be interested in seeing it
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:21,951	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If we could make it work
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:25,279	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that became my introduction to DARPA
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:29,887	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So what I'm reading from that thing is that you were what in darkness because you were performers
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:35,519	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yes and performers are those who end up getting research contracts working on some program
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:38,847	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So you were a performer work on that particular project and then
EDL	00:06:38,847	00:06:39,615	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I presume that
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:43,967	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You met other program managers may be enough director and that led to a discussion
EDL	00:06:44,735	00:06:49,087	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah we we actually did a number of programs
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:53,439	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I probably had three or four DARPA programs as a performer during those years
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:59,071	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Then when I transition to the applied research lab at Penn State we picked up a couple of more
EDL	00:06:59,583	00:07:04,447	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So I had had an ongoing relationship actually through multiple organizations
EDL	00:07:04,447	00:07:07,007	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Of being a performer doing DARPA program
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:11,871	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And exactly as you described is actually a
EDL	00:07:11,871	00:07:15,967	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A former pm and then at the time Deputy office director kind lot
EDL	00:07:16,735	00:07:21,599	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Kind of pulled me aside and wanted to see hey what I be interested in actually
EDL	00:07:21,599	00:07:24,671	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Coming to this side of the table and
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:27,743	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Conceiving ideas and being a program manager at DARPA
EDL	00:07:27,743	00:07:34,143	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay and you quite evident evidently did come over here if I just go deep to your program manager patient
EDL	00:07:34,143	00:07:35,679	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The website to vim at work
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Talk to you more directly I learned that you have
EDL	00:07:37,215	00:07:37,983	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Three programs on
EDL	00:07:39,263	00:07:41,311	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Two of them the blue wolf
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:43,871	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Program in the hunter program they both have to do with
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:46,687	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Unmanned underwater systems
EDL	00:07:46,687	00:07:49,503	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then there's one very multisyllabic
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:50,783	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Program
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:52,319	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The cross domain
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,855	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Maritime surveillance
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:55,135	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And targeting program
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:56,927	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Or known in short
EDL	00:07:57,439	00:07:58,207	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	As City mask
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:08:00,511	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's really a program which
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:04,607	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Zeroes in on that systems of systems idea
EDL	00:08:04,607	00:08:07,423	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Of course which the other two programs kind of feed into is
EDL	00:08:07,935	00:08:09,983	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Component systems of those systems of systems
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:12,543	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So maybe we can talk about
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,103	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	City Mastin this whole idea of
EDL	00:08:15,615	00:08:17,919	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Systems of systems which really is a
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,687	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Phim
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,711	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Throughout
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:21,503	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	DARPA you'll see that
EDL	00:08:21,503	00:08:23,807	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Kind of category is defining
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:25,343	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Many programs throughout the
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:26,367	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	VI technical office
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:27,391	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So tell me
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,695	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What rhymes with
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:30,207	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This concept
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:36,607	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Absolutely in a exactly in fact and this is what kind of need about DARPA this is what I talked
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:39,423	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Dakine about as she was talking about bringing me in
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:40,447	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What's to look at
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We have this initiative
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:47,871	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To do system of systems we want to look at a maritime version would you do that
EDL	00:08:47,871	00:08:48,383	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:52,991	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	First you gotta understand what do we mean by System of systems and
EDL	00:08:53,503	00:08:55,295	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's really this idea that
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:09:00,159	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	As our defense has matured over the last few decades
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,719	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And we make more and more capable platform
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:06,815	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Set a good example would be saying airplane or a submarine
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:10,655	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	These are becoming very sophisticated platforms
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:12,191	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Very capable
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,727	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But they're also occur
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,239	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Expensive
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,311	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They also take a long time to make
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,615	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And what we're finding is
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:22,175	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To make them even better
EDL	00:09:22,175	00:09:23,711	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Cost a lot of money
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:28,831	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And time and you don't necessarily get that much more capability than you had
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:32,927	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If you will it's kind of creating like an ass and topaz
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:35,743	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You put more effort into it it's getting incrementally better
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:43,167	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And the horse seems to be a limit of how much yeah yeah that it's it's tipping over
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:45,983	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The whole idea that is
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:52,639	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Is there a better way to look at things to say if I really want to do with DARPA supposed to do which is
EDL	00:09:53,151	00:09:54,175	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Major
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,967	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Capability games and big straw
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,527	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Is there a different way to look at
EDL	00:09:59,295	00:10:00,831	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And one of the ideas is
EDL	00:10:01,599	00:10:03,391	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well how about if we distribute
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,975	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Some of the functions that are on this planet
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:09,279	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Farm so if you think about a platform
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:10,559	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What does it have to do
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,583	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It has two cents
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:14,655	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It has to defend itself
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:20,799	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If I platform you might be like that craft aircraft or a submarine
EDL	00:10:20,799	00:10:21,311	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Exactly
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:28,735	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it has these functions I needs to sense it needs to communicate it needs to defend itself
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,551	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It needs to do data processing
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:36,671	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And if I put that all there it's great I concentrate it but now
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,951	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	As I said it's this
EDL	00:10:38,463	00:10:42,559	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Incremental games and each time I make a change it affects the other stuff
EDL	00:10:43,327	00:10:43,839	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What if I
EDL	00:10:44,351	00:10:48,959	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Do the term we call where we disaggregate I take these functions say the sensing
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:51,007	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:55,359	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I put it on a lower-cost platform say like an unmanned system
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:56,383	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That I can put
EDL	00:10:56,383	00:10:57,407	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Farther away
EDL	00:10:58,175	00:11:02,783	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So now I get an even greater sensing because instead of being stuck on my platform
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,063	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's now
EDL	00:11:04,575	00:11:07,647	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Farther away and in broader and maybe I multiple
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:12,255	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Or even up in the air so high up in the air exactly so I get high to buy advantages
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,839	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The key pieces is I still have I have to be able to communicate
EDL	00:11:17,119	00:11:19,167	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But if I can do that and
EDL	00:11:19,167	00:11:23,007	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And handle the networking part to make all these things work together
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:26,847	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well now I'm really, using my adversary a difficulty
EDL	00:11:27,359	00:11:29,663	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Instead of doing what they're doing now which is
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:32,991	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Wearing lots of money into being able to go after these
EDL	00:11:32,991	00:11:35,807	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Single platforms that are high value
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:42,975	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now they have to decide she do I go after this sensor thing well if I get that censor well if there's two others or three
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,487	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	3 more
EDL	00:11:44,767	00:11:49,375	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay you got a little bit of my sensing but I'm still going and oh by the way the main
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:52,447	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Aircraft or ship is still going
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:55,519	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so it forces them to now
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,055	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Spread their forces
EDL	00:11:57,055	00:11:58,079	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To cover more things
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,639	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And this whole idea is
EDL	00:12:01,663	00:12:03,199	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Try to do this in a way that
EDL	00:12:04,223	00:12:07,039	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	My total cost is less than what I would for
EDL	00:12:07,039	00:12:08,319	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	For just a single platform
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:10,111	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But my capability is much
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,647	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Priest
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:14,207	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And the problems I caused for the other side or much
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:17,023	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It sounds to me that it also add syrup to things like
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:19,583	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Versatility and resilience
EDL	00:12:19,583	00:12:21,119	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Answer the versatility now you can
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:24,447	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Mix and match all kinds of different things into these systems of system
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,983	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	At the same time
EDL	00:12:25,983	00:12:28,543	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	One thing is taken out of the other you still have the
EDL	00:12:28,543	00:12:29,311	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Brazilian swear
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:34,431	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You're not thinking of him you're mad absolutely now you've right on because
EDL	00:12:34,431	00:12:38,783	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That whole idea of you know I'll talk about it is adaptability
EDL	00:12:39,551	00:12:41,087	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Maybe I want to change my mix
EDL	00:12:42,367	00:12:48,767	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	In real-time which means hey we know what the mission is and we need some better let's say jamming caper
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:49,791	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Ability or something
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:52,351	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I can put that in the mix
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,631	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Much easier than
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,215	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Change it out on the whole platform you kind of get what you get
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,263	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well now these are interchangeable parts
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,335	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And you hit it on the head with resiliency
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:03,359	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It means
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:07,967	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They have more things to deal with and so if they take care of one or two of them
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:13,855	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know we like to use the term we degrade gracefully as opposed to either I'm all good
EDL	00:13:13,855	00:13:14,879	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Or I'm done I'm done
EDL	00:13:15,903	00:13:18,719	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And the other way it's adaptable is overtime
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	In the sense of
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:23,071	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey technology is changing
EDL	00:13:23,071	00:13:24,863	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's one of the biggest fact
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Actors for this
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,655	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Is
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:32,799	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We see it in our commercial world all the time and new iPhones are coming out new capabilities Udo
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:34,591	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Web filming a movie I do all this stuff
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:40,223	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I want my military systems to be able to adapt on those time scales
EDL	00:13:40,223	00:13:41,503	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	As opposed to
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:45,855	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Going to be five years before we can build the next airplane
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:48,159	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If I'm more discreet and disaggregated
EDL	00:13:48,671	00:13:50,207	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's easier to change those parts out
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,767	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So both over long scale and and Realty
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:55,583	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's another thing I've been hearing about you a tarp another
EDL	00:13:55,583	00:13:57,631	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Replaces the technology Cycles or just
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,679	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Speeding up so much and so there is a century
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:00,191	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Person getting much more
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:02,495	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Agile in turning that psycho
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:03,519	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Faster without
EDL	00:14:04,799	00:14:05,823	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Expensive amount of time
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,615	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Has taken in the past
EDL	00:14:07,615	00:14:09,151	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Do that to go from version 1 to 2
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:10,431	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Before so
EDL	00:14:10,943	00:14:12,735	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I guess this is in the maritime domain
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:18,879	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Can you be absolutely it affects all the domains and one of the issues there is you'll hear us use the term
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:20,671	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah one of the challenges
EDL	00:14:20,671	00:14:21,183	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Disney faces
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,719	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Composability
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:24,511	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How can I get better
EDL	00:14:25,535	00:14:26,559	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Quickly
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:27,839	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Pulling these things in
EDL	00:14:28,607	00:14:30,911	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And making them so that they go to vit gather
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:35,775	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Easily and I don't have to do lots and lots of engineering and testing
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:38,079	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To put these two things together
EDL	00:14:38,079	00:14:40,127	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's part of the system of systems
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:43,711	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Challenges is getting good at being able to rapidly compose
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,223	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Pulley system
EDL	00:14:44,735	00:14:49,343	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay so for some reason as you were talking about the desegregation I was I was thinking about a human body
EDL	00:14:49,343	00:14:51,647	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Do you know which is a system of system
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:52,927	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	System of the liver
EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:54,719	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That's the system of cells
EDL	00:14:55,231	00:14:57,791	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And if that were desegregated actually weeds
EDL	00:14:57,791	00:15:01,375	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And it would still be a living body would then be just an amazing
EDL	00:15:01,375	00:15:01,887	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Task
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,959	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Command and communication and integration
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,495	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Kind of a weird metaphor perhaps
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:10,847	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But it seems to pretend you're so if you're taking apart what has been an integral
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:11,871	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	System like a carrier
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:14,687	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And you're now disaggregating this into all kinds of pieces
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,735	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What about that integration
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:17,503	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That sounds like
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:23,903	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The hard problem absolutely in and you've done two things and I like the body example because the easiest thing to think of
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:27,487	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	About is you know your eyes are primary sensor in our nose
EDL	00:15:28,255	00:15:30,303	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How much better could you surveil
EDL	00:15:30,815	00:15:33,119	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If you had a set of eyes that were
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:34,143	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Udo
EDL	00:15:34,143	00:15:39,519	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	50 yards in front of you and you had an extra nose that you could put out there that's what we're trying to do
EDL	00:15:40,799	00:15:42,847	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But now you hit it on the head is
EDL	00:15:43,359	00:15:43,871	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:47,455	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It works good my body because those nerve endings
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:53,599	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know they only have to go from my brain down to my nose or my eyes that's not too far now I'm putting it out there
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,159	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it puts a premium
EDL	00:15:56,159	00:15:57,695	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	On being able to set up
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:16:02,559	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Effective communication paths that are reliable
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,863	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Because otherwise
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:11,263	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What good is that knows it's just sitting out there that could smell everything but if it can't get it back to the brain
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:12,031	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Its of no value
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,567	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so you
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:17,151	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Tide in when we talk about the system of systems programs
EDL	00:16:17,663	00:16:19,455	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Sometimes people a squirrel
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:24,831	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You're not really developing a lot of new technology you're kind of using existing stuff and they're exactly right
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:27,135	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The DARPA hard part that
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:27,903	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Challenges
EDL	00:16:28,415	00:16:30,463	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah but I've got to do this now
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:32,511	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And make these reliable
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,815	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Communications
EDL	00:16:34,815	00:16:36,095	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And networking
EDL	00:16:36,095	00:16:40,703	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And and functions you know now I've got instead of two eyes I've got four
EDL	00:16:41,215	00:16:44,287	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well I've got to have a brain now that can handle that which means
EDL	00:16:44,799	00:16:48,895	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How do I sequence things and do things because I'm getting more information
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:53,503	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's a good analogy to see what we're trying to do with the system assist
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,063	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Right and again
EDL	00:16:56,575	00:16:57,343	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We talked about.
EDL	00:16:57,343	00:16:58,111	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Eberhard
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:00,671	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We're talkin about systems of systems when you are
EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:02,207	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Entertaining very ambitious
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:03,231	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Ideas like this
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:03,743	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Word connect
EDL	00:17:04,511	00:17:05,791	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We trying to make them so
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:09,631	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What all so then comes in here or issues then of communications
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:11,423	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Security I mean
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:15,007	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I might want to try to spoof the system or I might want to try to
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:17,567	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Jam it and so suddenly
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:20,127	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	These kinds of considerations
EDL	00:17:20,127	00:17:20,895	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Become part of your overall
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,943	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Oh absolutely
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:23,711	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Becomes a huge
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,991	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Because
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:27,295	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I can't afford to have somebody Co-op
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:28,575	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,367	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	My forward eyeballs and
EDL	00:17:30,367	00:17:31,647	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Turn them to look to the wrong Direct
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:33,183	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now they're no good to me
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:34,719	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so
EDL	00:17:34,719	00:17:40,863	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's a good example of Technology were taking advantage of things but you always have to then look at what's the counter-move
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,143	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,423	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And and do this traitor
EDL	00:17:43,423	00:17:47,775	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And by the way this is why we're doing this at DARPA it's not a hundred percent certain
EDL	00:17:48,543	00:17:50,335	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But this is the way to fight in the future
EDL	00:17:50,847	00:17:55,967	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It's our hypothesis and there's a lot of evidence suggests if you can do it it's a great way
EDL	00:17:56,735	00:17:59,295	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But that's a big if and that's why we're doing the research
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,599	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To see can we really make the
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,879	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This work NBC
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:03,647	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Secure
EDL	00:18:03,647	00:18:05,695	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And reliable and all these things that
EDL	00:18:07,231	00:18:07,743	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Rice cereal
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:11,071	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Probing what is possible in an in
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:11,839	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If it is past
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:12,351	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Even if it is
EDL	00:18:12,863	00:18:13,631	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Desirable in the Rye
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:18,239	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	When you do get together with other program managers hear other other profession
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,007	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hope you're at DARPA
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:21,311	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How to talk about systems of cyst
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:24,127	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Who are you talking with what other what are some of the other I guess
EDL	00:18:24,127	00:18:25,407	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Programs that you think of
EDL	00:18:25,919	00:18:27,711	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	When the systems of systems category
EDL	00:18:28,479	00:18:33,343	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah and it's fine there's kind of two variants that I do so when I talk to other
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:34,367	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What I would call
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:40,511	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	True systems assistance PM's another program managers who are doing other system assistance program
EDL	00:18:41,791	00:18:42,559	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,095	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	In the defense Sciences office
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,887	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	John paskewitz
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,935	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He's really looking at
EDL	00:18:47,935	00:18:51,007	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey can I come up with mathematical constructs
EDL	00:18:51,519	00:18:54,079	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To help me do that composition instead of
EDL	00:18:54,847	00:18:58,687	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey I think this looks good let's try it and now let's go from there
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,991	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So we talked a lot about
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:06,111	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey how can I have machine learning and intelligence help meme
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:08,159	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Pull this stuff together
EDL	00:19:09,183	00:19:12,255	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	An interesting Lee we almost always end up with
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:12,767	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Logistic
EDL	00:19:13,791	00:19:15,327	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Because one of the issues is
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:17,887	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now I've got more things Fredo
EDL	00:19:17,887	00:19:18,399	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Park
EDL	00:19:19,167	00:19:25,055	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How do I get them there and how do I sustain them you know the body works well the eyeballs come with the head
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:26,847	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And it's a nice package
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,663	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now I've got these two extra eyeballs out there
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:34,271	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Who's going to hold on to those and keep them care and fed etcetera
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:37,855	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The other way though that I talked to PM's about programs
EDL	00:19:37,855	00:19:38,623	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Is
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:39,903	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How does there
EDL	00:19:39,903	00:19:43,999	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Particular technology so maybe they're making a better unmanned aircraft
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:45,535	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Or
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,815	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A better sonar
EDL	00:19:47,583	00:19:53,983	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Where does that fit into the system assist the weird of those systems fitting where do they fit in and that's where we
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:56,031	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We've had really fun dialogue because
EDL	00:19:56,543	00:19:59,103	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Often that's one of the big problems for technology
EDL	00:20:00,639	00:20:05,503	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Somebody can come up with a great idea for a better sonar and they'll work on that and they'll develop it
EDL	00:20:06,527	00:20:08,831	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But then it kind of ends up on the
EDL	00:20:08,831	00:20:10,367	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Porch of the Pentagon with
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,415	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We have this great sonar but
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:18,303	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Where do I put it and how should I employ it in an in do I buy 10 of them or do you know
EDL	00:20:19,071	00:20:22,911	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What's interesting in system of systems you're starting to think about the whole
EDL	00:20:23,423	00:20:24,191	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And it helps
EDL	00:20:24,191	00:20:28,287	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Guide some things to say you know what we really need that sonar to do
EDL	00:20:28,799	00:20:29,311	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Is
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:32,383	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Be able to look wider not necessarily farther
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,407	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Or
EDL	00:20:33,919	00:20:37,759	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Different things that might help direct their work but at the same time
EDL	00:20:37,759	00:20:40,319	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We're giving them a great story to say
EDL	00:20:40,319	00:20:42,367	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Here's where it fits in and my gosh
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:42,879	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Does it make it
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,927	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Write something interesting dialect
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:45,951	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You're putting out
EDL	00:20:45,951	00:20:47,999	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Potential Technologies
EDL	00:20:47,999	00:20:49,023	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Capabilities
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,559	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But then you're getting back information
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:51,071	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	From the field
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:52,351	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The Commanders
EDL	00:20:52,351	00:20:53,375	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The Wharf I right
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:55,935	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Who actually giving you feedback and saying this is what we
EDL	00:20:55,935	00:20:58,495	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Really need her this is what we've experienced than then
EDL	00:20:58,495	00:21:00,287	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Aviator perhaps in that dynamic
EDL	00:21:00,287	00:21:01,055	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You come up with something
EDL	00:21:01,055	00:21:01,823	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It really does
EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:02,591	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Further
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:07,711	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Absolutely and what's unique in this program that I've done that I've never done in my research
EDL	00:21:08,223	00:21:08,991	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Career before
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:14,623	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We actually spent a lot of time working with the Navy and organizations to
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:15,135	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To create
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:17,952	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A very sophisticated
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:19,744	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Warfighting scenario
EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:21,536	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Very realistic based on
EDL	00:21:22,048	00:21:23,328	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Excerpts from war plans
EDL	00:21:24,608	00:21:26,912	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To guide our research and that's not
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:29,216	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Normally done we usually kind of think
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:34,848	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay I'll look at an engagement and this would help me defeat this aircraft if they came against me
EDL	00:21:35,616	00:21:41,760	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Very rare to look at it in terms of hey what would I do to win the war and that's the phrase We like to eat
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:46,368	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey this is great and that's a nice technology but does it help me win the war
EDL	00:21:47,136	00:21:49,440	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's not usually a question that we ask
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:51,744	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know usually just say doesn't make me
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,280	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Faster stronger better
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:55,328	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yasso
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:57,120	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Bring in some language in here
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,984	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	There's there's another phrase that I've heard
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,288	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Round DARPA and I think it must
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:05,312	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Relate to this mess
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:06,080	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Mosaic
EDL	00:22:06,848	00:22:09,408	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Warfare how does that relate to systems of systems
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:14,016	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Yeah Mosaic Warfare is it in some sense it's
EDL	00:22:14,016	00:22:18,624	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	It is a different name for system a system certainly
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,392	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Sister Sister
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,416	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Fits into it
EDL	00:22:20,416	00:22:22,976	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But it's this whole idea of
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:25,280	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Bringing lots of pieces together
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:27,328	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And no individual piece
EDL	00:22:27,328	00:22:30,656	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Does everything or tells the story but collectively
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,936	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You now
EDL	00:22:32,448	00:22:32,960	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Get
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:33,984	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The picture
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:36,032	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And what's interesting is
EDL	00:22:36,800	00:22:39,360	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You can afford to lose a few pieces
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,384	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And you still get the
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:40,896	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The picture
EDL	00:22:41,408	00:22:43,712	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And that's this idea of being able to
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:44,480	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To compose
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,528	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To make your mosaic
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:49,088	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Tell a different message or in our case
EDL	00:22:49,088	00:22:52,160	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Do a different function
EDL	00:22:52,160	00:22:53,184	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	For the military
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:55,488	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And be able to
EDL	00:22:56,000	00:22:58,304	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Put that together make it do that
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:23:00,096	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Rearrange the pieces now.
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:03,680	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Does something different tells a different story so to speak
EDL	00:23:04,192	00:23:08,288	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And it can withstand the fact that like I said if a few pieces get knocked out
EDL	00:23:08,800	00:23:09,568	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You're not done
EDL	00:23:10,080	00:23:12,384	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it's really that same idea but
EDL	00:23:12,384	00:23:14,944	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	What I like with the Mosaic is when you talk about this
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,736	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	The imagery of
EDL	00:23:16,736	00:23:18,528	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey I can rearrange this tell difference
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,064	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Stories to me that means
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:22,624	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I can recompose and do a
EDL	00:23:22,624	00:23:23,136	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Permission
EDL	00:23:23,648	00:23:25,184	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Right now in a sense that's been
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:27,744	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Going on for a long time I will we have
EDL	00:23:27,744	00:23:30,816	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Different military services they different capabilities they working
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:33,120	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Any kind of different domains and so you can almost think
EDL	00:23:33,120	00:23:37,216	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You're from from a general point of view there there there has been this kind of mosaic
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:38,496	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Thinking but
EDL	00:23:39,008	00:23:40,288	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Here we're also
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:41,312	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Bring that downward
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:45,408	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Absolutely and there's a little bit
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:45,920	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Udoka
EDL	00:23:46,432	00:23:49,760	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Nothing's new but we're trying to take it to a greater limit
EDL	00:23:50,528	00:23:55,136	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And and one of the biggest differences there is is we're really trying to bring in
EDL	00:23:55,648	00:23:57,696	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Unmanned systems with mancis
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:01,792	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And and again create this much more
EDL	00:24:02,304	00:24:03,840	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Rapid adaptive
EDL	00:24:04,352	00:24:05,376	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Because yes
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,680	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Things have changed but usually it would take
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:09,984	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Decades to say oh we're going to
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:13,312	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Fight this way differently and I'm going to use it
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:18,432	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This kind of system differently and in many years it'll come out and we'll put it together
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:19,968	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so you get
EDL	00:24:19,968	00:24:21,760	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Very static
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,552	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Kind of in how you operate
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,112	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	This is to be much more fluid
EDL	00:24:26,112	00:24:30,208	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	So it it's your right it's an extension but really trying to take it to that limit
EDL	00:24:30,720	00:24:32,256	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You have had the
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:33,280	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Experience in
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:33,792	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Akadema
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:35,840	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I'm a student side of things
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:37,888	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You had industry experience
EDL	00:24:38,400	00:24:39,168	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Your
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,960	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Now working in a government setting
EDL	00:24:40,960	00:24:43,520	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	In particular therapist I'm just wondering now
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,056	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How you view
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:45,824	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	DARPA
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:46,848	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And the way it operates
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:50,176	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	In the overall Innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:56,064	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I'm aware where does it fit you know we have the services that have more traditional hey we've got
EDL	00:24:56,064	00:25:02,208	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	These products and we need to get better so we'll do kind of product Improvement if you will as opposed to
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,512	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Darp is hay
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,280	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I'm going to
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:08,352	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Create a whole new line of product in terms of
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:09,888	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A whole new capability
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:12,704	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so it's the defense department Venture House
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:14,496	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And really that's the way we operate
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:18,080	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Fairly quickly pull ideas together
EDL	00:25:18,080	00:25:22,176	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You then have an opportunity to make your case you need to baby due
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:25,504	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A small project to get some data to
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,296	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To backup your supposition
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:29,344	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But then you go forward
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:31,904	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And you meet with the tech Council and in a very
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:32,928	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Short
EDL	00:25:33,440	00:25:33,952	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Time
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:39,328	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You'll get an answer that says yes let's go forward and now you're Off to the Races
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,608	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	To really make this happen
EDL	00:25:41,120	00:25:47,520	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Bytech cancel you're referring to what I understand here for program managers are sometimes very harrowing experiences
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:49,312	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Where you have to go in front of
EDL	00:25:49,312	00:25:55,712	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Leadership and really make the case for why the research is worthy why it could have benefit to taxpayers and Nash
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:58,784	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Social Security and I think one of the things I was hearing when you use this
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:26:00,832	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	VCR venture-capital kind of
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:03,136	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Analogy is that they're all so I think it's
EDL	00:26:03,136	00:26:04,672	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Unusual willingness
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:05,952	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Even expectation
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:08,256	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That there will be failure along the way
EDL	00:26:08,256	00:26:10,560	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Because if you're going to really move
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,328	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Forward
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,608	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Not just incrementally
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:17,984	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Big step maybe even leaps that you're going to fail along the way
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:20,032	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Tortoise had absolutely
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:21,824	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Just like as a venture capitalist
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:26,432	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If you show up and say hey I've got a way to get you 10% on your money
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,712	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They're not interest
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,320	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	They can go to the bank or somewhere and get that what they want to see is
EDL	00:26:32,832	00:26:34,624	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How do I ten-fold my money
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,184	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Same idea with DARPA
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:38,976	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	But when you're doing things like that
EDL	00:26:39,744	00:26:45,376	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hey if it was that easy everybody be doing it so that you have to be taking risk you have to be
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:49,728	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Pushing for things that you know haven't been done and you're not sure
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:51,008	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	100% if they can be
EDL	00:26:52,288	00:26:53,312	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay well so weird
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:57,408	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Getting toward the end of our time here but for some reason I'm feeling a little mean
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:27:01,760	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And so at gym I'm going to ask you since we've just been talking about the value of
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:05,344	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	If you've got a failure story to share with us
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:13,024	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well it turns out I probably have several but I'll use one because it actually ties back to an old DARPA
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:16,864	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Project this was when we were I mentioned earlier some of that underwater shock
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:19,680	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Process we had
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:20,960	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Hilton apparatus
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:23,776	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	With a lot of if you will think of it is
EDL	00:27:23,776	00:27:25,568	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	A bunch of little cannons
EDL	00:27:25,568	00:27:28,640	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	You know maybe sixteen of them all on a big rack
EDL	00:27:28,640	00:27:29,920	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That we lowered into the water
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:32,224	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then the idea was we would
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:35,040	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Shoot these off and and try to do the timing right
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:35,808	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Right to make a shock
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:36,832	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:41,952	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	We lured it in the water and we hit the button then we got the first shot and we thought that way
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:42,464	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That was great
EDL	00:27:43,232	00:27:44,512	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Nice big bubble in the water
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,328	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And then we hit the thing again and
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:49,376	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Well we didn't notice anything and
EDL	00:27:49,376	00:27:50,656	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Another time and
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:55,520	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	After a few times you finally decide to guess it's not working and so we asked the guy to
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:57,312	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Bring the crane up in
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,360	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	He pulled it up and there was
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:06,272	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	I think maybe one wire still dangling from the end of it and we had blown this thing completely this
EDL	00:28:06,272	00:28:06,784	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Smithereens
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:12,160	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	And I think it took divers about 2 weeks to go find all the parts that we had
EDL	00:28:12,928	00:28:16,512	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Sprung all over the bottom of this cory that we were testing in and
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,560	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	That was not a
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,608	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Completely atypical day of
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,888	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	How test go sometime
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:28,800	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Okay but you learn some lessons we did we change the way we
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,360	| Episode 14 The Mix-and-Matcher |	Just another day in technology development
