EDL	00:00:11,580	00:00:17,760	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Stop technology , the internet GPS in the column of your hand on tournament. 
EDL	00:00:19,120	00:00:30,210	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nightmare video in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:30,570	00:00:39,260	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window on the dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:39,920	00:00:42,750	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	My name is ivan , a motto and arm your dark bowls
EDL	00:00:43,140	00:00:57,001	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio weight shen , a program manager since twenty fourteen industry information office , weighed earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in computer science from the university
EDL	00:00:57,001	00:00:58,227	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Called , from your birthday
EDL	00:00:58,227	00:01:14,080	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	He then attended the university of in college park , which is just about twenty miles from where we are sitting in dark headquarters , where he received his massive screen computer science and particularly to double weight work at the m it linking laboratory in the human language technology group
EDL	00:01:14,640	00:01:16,990	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	You can tell from the portfolio programs
EDL	00:01:16,990	00:01:37,680	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	He runs the dark that he is fascinated by language , both of the human kind end of the computer , and you can tell also that it is driven by a very dark ASvision of computers and human beings were working together in ways that extend what either type of intelligence , look , computer intelligence or human intelligence can do on its own
EDL	00:01:37,680	00:01:40,470	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So thanks , wait for joining me in the studio today
EDL	00:01:40,470	00:01:41,120	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Thanks , I will
EDL	00:01:42,120	00:01:44,020	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So let's start up by talking about you
EDL	00:01:44,020	00:01:49,310	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Wait a little bit about your background and how you ended up at. 
EDL	00:01:49,310	00:01:50,140	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Been twenty fourteen
EDL	00:01:50,580	00:02:09,424	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Sure , so in a dark has a long string of research and communicating with computers and various forms and involved in the number of those programs over many years from from day's been a graduate student through through my time at lincoln
EDL	00:02:09,424	00:02:18,560	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And we sort of natural progression , I was working on a program as a program , and I knew the program manager really well
EDL	00:02:18,560	00:02:27,280	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And he said , hey , you know , you should think about coming the job , but you know , this is an opportunity to do things that you can't possibly do in the job that you're currently at. 
EDL	00:02:28,170	00:02:47,910	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Before we dive in some of the dark programs you oversee , I am hoping you can let us in on some of the overarching ideas you have about human minds and computer mines and language , perhaps in the context of these times of our times , when so much of what we do involves people interacting. 
EDL	00:02:47,910	00:03:01,110	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Computers , you know , sort of the history of this is the in our computers were good at various kinds of things that humans were good at doing mathematical calculations without errors in a repeated and very quickly
EDL	00:03:01,640	00:03:06,960	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	But the fact this is that we didn't quite know how to honest that to solve problems we really care about
EDL	00:03:06,960	00:03:20,554	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So any serious problem , like decision making of any kind in a global scale policy , anything that you might think of in a requiring human expertise to do , you know that wasn't something that we would engage computers and right
EDL	00:03:20,554	00:03:33,840	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It's just now that we're thinking about having computers , drive cars , and that's a very basic function that , you know , we trust large portions of our population to do and comes naturally to human beings with some practice
EDL	00:03:34,470	00:03:46,750	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	But computers are just getting to the point where they can sense the world well enough that they can do that , and they can make decisions that are your commentary with what human being can do on these very basic tasks
EDL	00:03:47,160	00:04:00,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And a number of us want computers to be smarter because we want them to be companions that can help us do things right , and we want them to help us solve problems that are really , really hard for us and make decisions that are much more complicated
EDL	00:04:00,030	00:04:01,810	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And then just driving a car , for instance. 
EDL	00:04:01,810	00:04:02,239	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	right
EDL	00:04:02,239	00:04:12,115	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So let me just stop you on understanding of computers making decisions because in a fertilize of me , I cannot really always pass out how I make my own decisions
EDL	00:04:12,115	00:04:15,540	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	I presume , bringing in different kinds of data , different elements
EDL	00:04:15,540	00:04:21,460	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And then there are some kind of algorithm going on my own head by which IImake a decision about where i'm going to go to day
EDL	00:04:21,460	00:04:24,360	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We're from going to buy this item , forces that item
EDL	00:04:24,730	00:04:33,540	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So can you talk to me a little bit about what is it takes to put that mystery into working in a working way into a computer? 
EDL	00:04:33,540	00:04:37,590	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	The mystery of decision , like it isn't necessarily the case that we want to make him a decision making
EDL	00:04:37,590	00:04:38,131	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It anyway
EDL	00:04:38,131	00:04:41,148	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Human beings are always great making decisions
EDL	00:04:41,148	00:04:53,928	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	You know , you know about the study of children , and whether or not they'll take a sneakers bar now versus waiting for thirty minutes and then getting five sneakers bars , and in a day , which tuesday is the satisfaction now
EDL	00:04:53,928	00:04:57,156	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so we have authorities in our own decision making
EDL	00:04:57,156	00:05:00,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It makes us make decisions that are so optimistic
EDL	00:05:00,030	00:05:02,790	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Our own outcomes , right
EDL	00:05:02,790	00:05:09,890	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And this happens at a huge scale that happens when we make political decisions that happen when we make economic decisions
EDL	00:05:09,890	00:05:24,280	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And someone is so full , and what you hopefully is the ability to make better decisions , given an outcome goal that you are based on better data and better understanding of of the processes under the heart
EDL	00:05:24,630	00:05:26,220	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And that's why things computers can help. 
EDL	00:05:26,220	00:05:31,630	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Well , I, Ifor one would personally like to be in a position where , where I can make better decisions in my own personal life
EDL	00:05:31,630	00:05:36,470	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	If we can do that also on national and geopolitical scales , all the better
EDL	00:05:36,470	00:05:40,350	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So all the power to you wait , I see in that political ambition
EDL	00:05:40,350	00:05:45,310	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So what I like to do now is just talk to you live with a report photo of programme
EDL	00:05:45,310	00:05:52,530	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	What would you start with the moments program and tells a little bit about what that is about , and what its statistics now has. 
EDL	00:05:52,530	00:05:53,750	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	News a few times , yes
EDL	00:05:53,750	00:05:57,190	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So the premise behind the magic programmers is really very simple
EDL	00:05:57,570	00:06:05,490	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It's the first data after on the internet that we can't quite get a hold of or make sense of for investigator purposes
EDL	00:06:05,960	00:06:12,950	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So our program concept was , how do we help people who are doing investigations online
EDL	00:06:12,950	00:06:20,170	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And we started with human trafficking , because human trafficking is something that were the point of sale was almost always online , at least for sex trafficking
EDL	00:06:21,110	00:06:35,430	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We started with that particular domain because we notice that the data online , you know , people buy and sell human beings online and visit a grotesque and overt at the same time
EDL	00:06:36,170	00:06:43,430	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And yet , because of the volume of the data that out there , because it's , it's hiding in a huge sea of even more data
EDL	00:06:43,790	00:06:47,950	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It's actually really hard for investigators to explore it. 
EDL	00:06:47,950	00:06:54,480	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Effectively , it is not just the data that seems as kind of most of us think of as the normal web , which is index by normal. 
EDL	00:06:54,480	00:06:55,070	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	正确的是。
EDL	00:06:55,070	00:07:04,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	In other places that try it and places like the deep web and the dark web and play , this is that commercial search indexes don't spend a lot of time dealing with
EDL	00:07:04,470	00:07:10,400	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And you know , our only real view into that data is through commercial search engine
EDL	00:07:10,400	00:07:20,930	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We rely on them to index and make available to search the contents that online , and it's not indexed or available through google is very likely you never gonna see
EDL	00:07:20,930	00:07:30,178	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so portions of the dark web , where a lot of crime happens , portions of the deep webb were lots of ADS for sexual for prostitution exist
EDL	00:07:30,178	00:07:34,370	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	A lot of that isn't fully index by our commercial , certains
EDL	00:07:34,370	00:07:49,120	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so the promise of the program was collected right data , and then automatically organized a data in such a way that we can explore that data and most importantly , generate leads and take instances of a bad activity
EDL	00:07:49,540	00:08:10,000	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so we have been working for the last almost three years now to build a system that would help investigators one chase down leads that they have , but too , also , they lead to automatically , potentially , potentially adds that are associated with trafficking so that they can prioritize their investigations
EDL	00:08:10,000	00:08:15,450	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so the concept here is in a sort of back to the theme of human machine interaction
EDL	00:08:15,450	00:08:26,350	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	The concept here is , how do you help the investigator get to the data that sailing and further particular investigation , and then how do you help them analyse data that they can possibly analyze on their own
EDL	00:08:26,720	00:08:40,196	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And one of the key findings that program was the pricing behaviors of organizations that involved in trafficking different than the pricing behaviors of in normal , independent contractor prostitutes
EDL	00:08:40,196	00:09:04,526	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And you can detect those , and you can detect those patterns , but you can see that by reading an individual and online , you have to look collectively at a whole bunch of ADS uh author by the same person , sometimes tens of thousands of these ADS in order to understand the statistical pattern of health price , risky behaviors differently than the average in that marketplace
EDL	00:09:04,526	00:09:14,040	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's the kind of question that's very , very hard for an individual to answer without analytics that help them do that analysis of religion and data and weight has. 
EDL	00:09:14,040	00:09:21,880	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	This tool mexico went to against the kind of deliverable that imagine we all want , which is sort of taking down sex trafficking rings or other criminal. 
EDL	00:09:21,880	00:09:27,530	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Yeah , so in a way , since the beginning of this program , we have been engaged
EDL	00:09:27,530	00:09:40,919	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Law enforcement agencies across the country and really across the world , we have users in the UKand canada and australia and other places , not just the united states who every day working with these tools to arrest people
EDL	00:09:40,919	00:09:49,760	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	This morning , we have hundreds of arrests that have been credited to the use of magic store and a number different convictions that happened out. 
EDL	00:09:49,760	00:09:53,870	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Well , great a sense ago , at least they slightly improved worlds by a mammoths
EDL	00:09:53,870	00:09:54,770	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's great news
EDL	00:09:54,770	00:09:58,070	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Let's segregate to another one of your programs
EDL	00:09:58,070	00:10:01,202	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	The data driven discovery of models programs
EDL	00:10:01,202	00:10:03,406	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So we wait , what do you try to do with this
EDL	00:10:03,406	00:10:05,420	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And what is the status of this one? 
EDL	00:10:05,420	00:10:15,440	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Yes , the fundamental thought in this program is that , you know , when we want to construct an empirical model of how the world works , we use data to do that nowadays
EDL	00:10:15,440	00:10:16,894	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We stayed everywhere
EDL	00:10:16,894	00:10:28,913	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so the bottle networks to construct models of how the world's isn't , the , you know , isn't any longer the collection of the data itself necessarily process of constructing the model
EDL	00:10:28,913	00:10:39,625	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That process is something that's relegated to people who are typically called data scientists from machine learning people , statisticians , people with that kind of title associated with him
EDL	00:10:39,625	00:10:57,544	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And though that the effort involved in constructing those models is huge rights , hundreds of thousands of millions of effort , largely because the data's massive , largely because how they model that data statistically requires lots of expertise in the areas of statistics and machine learning
EDL	00:10:57,544	00:11:03,520	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so what we basically said is he , let's that out of the hands of those kinds of experts and automatic. 
EDL	00:11:03,520	00:11:04,937	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Let's motivate this reason
EDL	00:11:04,937	00:11:10,430	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	I wanted to want to hear about this , but also I want to listen to have a little bit more of a concrete sense
EDL	00:11:10,430	00:11:12,380	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We've been talking in certain general terms
EDL	00:11:12,380	00:11:14,002	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Yeah , models and and systems
EDL	00:11:14,002	00:11:21,680	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Uh , what might be some of the specific phenomenon that you're talking about for this kind of model development programs. 
EDL	00:11:21,680	00:11:33,364	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Just to give you a couple of problems that or can't create , the people have been thinking , what is , you know , how would you given different kinds of general types of various forms of weight
EDL	00:11:33,364	00:11:55,830	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	How would you predict the yield of those varieties of weight and different environmental that requires a model , and if you could do that , you could know what a plane , any given year , depending on what you expect for the weather and the demand of rain in the particular soil location , you could make decisions that were much smarter than we make now
EDL	00:11:56,350	00:12:00,714	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so one of the problems that we're working on is , how do we
EDL	00:12:00,714	00:12:18,730	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	How do we predict copyright based on data and I data can come from general type data can confirm environmental observations of centers are like taking pictures of crop fields , making come from , you know , your farmers , all my neck that tells you , you know , three months from now , what the weather is likely to be the season
EDL	00:12:19,660	00:12:29,759	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So those kinds of data can build a predictive model of what kind of crop yields you , and if you can do that , you can need of highly affect the outcomes of agriculture
EDL	00:12:29,759	00:12:31,860	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's just one kind of creative example. 
EDL	00:12:31,860	00:12:48,310	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We probably can also link this to a big mission of double , which is a and enhancing national security when we , even when we're talking about food that relates to things like food securities of we can , we will keep our food supply of constant , and at levels we need that actually
EDL	00:12:48,310	00:12:50,210	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And it does a conductor across the night. 
EDL	00:12:50,210	00:12:54,428	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's right , it , it helps us to predict political instability
EDL	00:12:54,428	00:12:57,315	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	For instance , in countries that we care about
EDL	00:12:57,315	00:13:00,946	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So those kinds of models are are always , it is important
EDL	00:13:00,946	00:13:03,028	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Social , political models are important
EDL	00:13:03,028	00:13:03,407	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	right
EDL	00:13:03,407	00:13:16,830	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Can you predict whether or right is going to work , and can you predict that unrest , political and rest of a certain type is going to result ten days from now in some kind of bad event , those are the kinds of things that you like to build models. 
EDL	00:13:16,830	00:13:23,598	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	What is the challenge that of getting a kind of computer with access to all kinds of data to generate those models
EDL	00:13:23,598	00:13:31,650	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	I don't know where the human mind comes into this , but to generate those models from the data and in perfect sort of massive information that are available. 
EDL	00:13:31,650	00:13:35,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So there's sort of two real problems that we have to content
EDL	00:13:35,030	00:13:38,970	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So first of all , we have too much data of too many different kinds
EDL	00:13:38,970	00:13:48,060	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so the problem with that is that we don't know which combinations of the data are likely to explain the particular outcome that we care about , care about crop yields
EDL	00:13:48,060	00:13:57,119	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We need to know that temperatures are a funeral of days prior to a particular event also said , with croppy alcohol standards later , right
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:14:03,502	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's a kind of thing that , you know , require expertise and agriculture to be able to know computers
EDL	00:14:03,502	00:14:07,661	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Don't know that there is where sympathizes comes battery , battery
EDL	00:14:07,661	00:14:10,726	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So what computers can do is calculate statistics
EDL	00:14:10,726	00:14:19,732	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We can estimate how well correlated a particular value available is where particular kind of data is to a particular outcome we care about
EDL	00:14:19,732	00:14:31,246	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so computers can discover patterns that human beings have a hard time figuring out on their , but human beings are also very good at figuring out that some of these patterns aren't real
EDL	00:14:31,246	00:14:34,494	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Some of these parents are what we call chance correlation
EDL	00:14:34,494	00:14:43,979	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so what we would like to do in order to build a really effective model is to find variable because the matter factors that affect the outcome of crop yields
EDL	00:14:43,979	00:14:54,730	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	For instance , we like to be able to do that automatically , but because some subject matter expertise is involved , we need the help of human being to help curry this process
EDL	00:14:55,090	00:15:00,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so in the district program , the goal is to make it at the day. 
EDL	00:15:00,030	00:15:03,530	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Leader driven discovery , he has some models program , the deterioration program. 
EDL	00:15:03,530	00:15:17,270	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	The goal that program is to fundamentally change the category of labor from statistician , the machine learning expert that constructs the model to machine plus subject matter expert , to construct the model
EDL	00:15:17,740	00:15:21,560	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so the idea is that we have a machine that automatically test
EDL	00:15:21,560	00:15:22,890	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So how about your models
EDL	00:15:22,890	00:15:29,794	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And it does so an efficient way , and , you know , in general , for most of these problems are infinitely many models that could be used
EDL	00:15:29,794	00:15:50,700	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so the question is how you find the right , one machines are very good at doing that testing and automatic fashion , and if they can work with human beings to constrain the kinds of models that they explore , they can potentially find models very , very quickly , very effectively without the need for export machine learning personnel , or did the scientists. 
EDL	00:15:51,420	00:15:58,360	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Well , sleeping , so let's move to the third program , the quantitative crisis response programs
EDL	00:15:58,360	00:16:00,640	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Again , a little bit of description program
EDL	00:16:00,640	00:16:02,060	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And what kind of program is making it? 
EDL	00:16:02,470	00:16:17,480	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So the golden QCRquantitated crisis response program was to figure out how information affects people and to build a way to measure that that is the fundamental goal in our program
EDL	00:16:17,850	00:16:30,488	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So you know , with social media and fake news and propaganda being distributed by organizations like right , argo was to figure out , how does that turn into a radicalization outcome
EDL	00:16:30,488	00:16:36,532	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	How was it that videos online , convert people into fighters on the battlefield
EDL	00:16:36,532	00:16:53,920	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So what we've been doing that crime is building models again of how human beings respond to propaganda , and how effective the spirit of propaganda are by looking at measurements of how people react in places like social media
EDL	00:16:54,670	00:17:08,108	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so the fundamental goal there is to build a recall measure of effectiveness , which is really way to measure concrete outcomes associated with various pieces of information that I put out their very speech of propaganda that put out there
EDL	00:17:08,108	00:17:19,080	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So , you know , in the last couple of years , what we see is that our organizations like ice is , can reach millions of people through social media , and they effectively recruit a small number of them
EDL	00:17:19,080	00:17:24,100	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	But still , you know , when you can recruit millions more percentages , add up to a lot of fighters
EDL	00:17:24,100	00:17:33,855	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And and so the question is , how did they do that on the one hand , and how effective are we stopping them , or at , you know , are they actually achieving that outcome
EDL	00:17:33,855	00:17:56,795	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	He said , and so what we've been building is essentially a gauge is essentially a meter that says , oh , today , that messages that you put out has a air degree of potential for radicalizing people than the one that you put , and why that matters is that it allows us people who are interested in covering recognition to estimate how well we are doing it , preventing that radicalization from happening
EDL	00:17:56,795	00:18:00,000	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Recently , building a meter that allows us to know. 
EDL	00:18:00,000	00:18:06,638	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We're doing well or poorly , so they're the one thing that seems to apply
EDL	00:18:06,638	00:18:11,410	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Maybe all of these programs is that idea of economic
EDL	00:18:11,410	00:18:27,258	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	How can human beings and their machines and their computers and all of their online resources , how can all of these things work together , economic and a symbolic way so that we derive knowledge and wisdom for from all of this interaction
EDL	00:18:27,258	00:18:36,598	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It reminds me of real account of the early days , year of garbage , and particularly thinking of one of our more famous and early program managers
EDL	00:18:36,598	00:18:38,466	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Joseph carl , rob , net legislator
EDL	00:18:38,466	00:18:44,924	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Most people know jessica legal letter and who was even back in the sixties when it was a program manager
EDL	00:18:44,924	00:18:50,449	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Here was articulating this idea of a symbolism between human beings and machines
EDL	00:18:50,449	00:18:51,680	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	I'm just wanting to
EDL	00:18:51,680	00:18:55,740	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Has it failed to be a program manager , and it was working in this long , long. 
EDL	00:18:56,160	00:19:06,240	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	A traditional durban , well , it first was humbling when you look at the history of program managers are darker , and the various things that dark is produced over its lifespan
EDL	00:19:06,240	00:19:19,600	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We are all humbled by the great outcomes those folks had in the programs that they were produced out of here , you know , most of us try to do our job , but all of us are thinking bigger than the things that we could donate our own
EDL	00:19:19,600	00:19:31,320	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And that's the thing , the dark benjamins and all of us , right , is the opportunity lawyer in his research , that's much larger than anyone's research organization can do. 
EDL	00:19:31,320	00:19:39,410	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Before we , we close out of our conversation , and I think is relatively with what you just said it might like you to come to stand back from any particular program
EDL	00:19:39,410	00:20:05,765	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And it may be sure with us , some of what you observe since twenty fourteen , as a program manager , about doctors role in the overall innovation ecosystem , and as an eco system and includes many players and stakeholders , scientists and engineers in an academic industry and government loves those among the stakeholders , entrepreneurs , inventor , capitalists , the science policy community
EDL	00:20:05,765	00:20:11,530	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	The ecosystem involves players in the commercial and environmental , defence and other sectors
EDL	00:20:12,420	00:20:16,750	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So where do you think the arab fits into this overall , you know. 
EDL	00:20:16,750	00:20:18,320	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Innovation , dynamic
EDL	00:20:18,320	00:20:19,910	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Well , it is interesting , right
EDL	00:20:19,910	00:20:40,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So there are a lot of , obviously , even within the USgovernment , there are a number of organizations from basic research , the fund applied research , the fund , various projects along that continuum , and I think darker , has a very unique role that spends the gap between basic research and polite science
EDL	00:20:40,650	00:20:57,690	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Often times we are looking for the applications that seem impossible , whether it's in a launching drawings of a flying aircraft , or , you know , detecting a human trafficking online , all of these things are things that we are emerging
EDL	00:20:57,690	00:20:59,580	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Capability three or four years ago
EDL	00:21:00,030	00:21:16,190	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Now , he proved to be possible , and so darkness in a very unique place that allows us to push the technology beyond the theoretical stages to the point where we can actually see where the , where the applications are going to be
EDL	00:21:16,190	00:21:25,780	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So we're not builders of the ultimate technology right at the end of the day , we found the research , and that research eventually becomes part of another form
EDL	00:21:25,780	00:21:45,390	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	But if you look at the in a progression of robotics and self driving cars , all of those AI technologies were created out of dark programs early on and have , subsequently , you know , a ten year horizon after that , you know , become prototypes of industry has been able to take it up
EDL	00:21:45,390	00:21:47,250	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So we serve a very crucial role
EDL	00:21:47,700	00:21:53,430	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And the reason that we can serve that role is to fall on the program managers themselves
EDL	00:21:53,430	00:22:02,625	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	These folks come with the ideas , and they can see the horizon they been working in the research they understand , and the basic research is happening in that field. 
EDL	00:22:02,625	00:22:06,207	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So you have the same position , you , you have boots on the ground
EDL	00:22:06,207	00:22:10,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Let's write a particular of technology strategy coming from. 
EDL	00:22:10,030	00:22:11,280	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's right , and we don't stay long
EDL	00:22:11,280	00:22:15,260	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And part of the reason we can stay long is that we are going to lose view of the horizon
EDL	00:22:15,260	00:22:18,560	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	If we do right , we need to be back in the gulf of that research
EDL	00:22:19,040	00:22:21,780	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And so all of us are here for the temporary period time
EDL	00:22:21,780	00:22:26,090	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And I think that was a brilliant design in terms of how we structure darker
EDL	00:22:26,620	00:22:40,300	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	The other thing I would say is that the funding amount and the catalysts that dark or provides in terms of scope of programs is at the right levels to be able to do the kinds of projects that we can do is g demonstrators , and there's early prototype
EDL	00:22:40,630	00:22:52,000	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Those are things that are really , really hard to do without a high level of investment , because they often involve multiple disciplines from multiple fields and or the edge of something
EDL	00:22:52,330	00:23:03,370	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	But that something requires them to all work together to build it and to build the early stage prototypes of it fail multiple times , potentially in the process of doing that. 
EDL	00:23:03,370	00:23:07,110	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Yeah , you bring up with the failure in the tolerance for failure here to me
EDL	00:23:07,110	00:23:24,690	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's one of the most interesting things that are up , because they're not all that many other stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem that can actually afford to do that if your company , you might be able to feel a little bit , but you've got to build a deliver a technology you've got to be able to deliver it eventually
EDL	00:23:24,690	00:23:25,480	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Words here
EDL	00:23:25,480	00:23:41,130	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	I guess program managers like you can probe technology possibilities and determine is that something that is has good likelihood of moving for another word you can take the down for others who then might take it to write exactly. 
EDL	00:23:41,130	00:23:45,240	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So I worked and started borrowed prior to going linking , and one of the things I can tell you
EDL	00:23:45,240	00:23:55,595	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	There is that , you know , there's actually relatively little tolerance , the kinds of risks that you can tolerate are not the same as the kinds of risks that we can tolerate
EDL	00:23:55,595	00:24:03,030	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Here , a double , the concrete idea that you haven't started better , be better , be actionable is a product in three to four years
EDL	00:24:03,030	00:24:16,138	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Otherwise , in others , there is no , no sense of funding that there is also a business related risk , execution related risk , but technology risk can be the biggest portion of that a dark , but we can take technology risks , science risks
EDL	00:24:16,138	00:24:20,850	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And I think that's actually the fundamental thing that it allows us to do what we do. 
EDL	00:24:20,850	00:24:26,571	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So we'd like other program managers , and you are a technology developer
EDL	00:24:26,571	00:24:31,726	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Your exercise isn't your science , engineering and kind of technology , imagination to innovation
EDL	00:24:31,726	00:24:36,396	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	What might be possible and really determining whether , in fact , it is , or might not be
EDL	00:24:36,396	00:24:44,430	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So i'm just wondering if there is a kind of fictional technology that you might have been thinking about , who knows , since you were a kid , but you wish. 
EDL	00:24:46,090	00:24:47,670	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	But isn't yet real
EDL	00:24:48,180	00:24:50,700	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Well , so that's that's a fun one
EDL	00:24:50,700	00:25:04,950	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	You know , being a language person , the thing that , and when they worked on a train solution for many years , you know , for years , we've been a certain driving towards the this kind of bubble , fish kind of capability
EDL	00:25:04,950	00:25:05,280	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Do you know
EDL	00:25:05,280	00:25:06,320	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	I mean that
EDL	00:25:06,320	00:25:13,530	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So if you have , you never read the safari books by a double settings , he tried to sky to the galaxy and so on
EDL	00:25:14,210	00:25:17,880	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	You know , in the various inner steller spaces , right
EDL	00:25:17,880	00:25:19,380	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Everybody speaks a different language
EDL	00:25:19,760	00:25:36,870	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So the solution that this is the bubble fish is the fish that you put in your area , and suddenly you can hear your own language , you know , the translation , the perfect translation of , you know , all of these alien species university and the universal translator , right , is exactly from start record
EDL	00:25:37,810	00:25:53,380	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Well , you know , that what's really fascinating in the last couple years because of the work that's going on a deep neural networks , and the cool work is been going both and dark , offended research and and commercially funded work
EDL	00:25:53,380	00:25:54,910	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	We're really getting closer that
EDL	00:25:54,910	00:26:10,000	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So there was this paper last year by google and described the use multiple languages to do translation , translation , translating from multiple languages into language and training those translators from various different
EDL	00:26:10,000	00:26:20,508	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And what they discovered is that the ignorant networks learn kind of a universal , synthetic representation of language is part of the process of training
EDL	00:26:20,508	00:26:21,675	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	That's emerging
EDL	00:26:21,675	00:26:34,060	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It's an emergent how these new networks were built , and so what it leads to , in long run is potentially actually having a universal translator , and that is going to be a really cool. 
EDL	00:26:34,530	00:26:38,700	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And just give it a shot , if you wanna give listeners in any idea what you mean by normal. 
EDL	00:26:39,420	00:26:43,810	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Yeah , so , so we use the terminal network
EDL	00:26:43,810	00:26:47,630	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	It actually has very little to do with neurons , as in the south
EDL	00:26:48,720	00:27:00,900	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	But these are models of how your noodles work , sort of very prominent of models of how your neurons in your brain work that are composed together to form little small brain like unit
EDL	00:27:01,360	00:27:16,550	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And what the google guys did was they figured out how to build a normal network that could take information from multiple languages , and essentially regularized into a form that would allow it to translate in english
EDL	00:27:16,970	00:27:33,640	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And that in a media at the form , which is just in some layer in the middle of this rather large network , you know , happens to have properties that look the same across multiple languages , meetings that it's effectively like the shared synthetics of different language. 
EDL	00:27:34,630	00:27:39,659	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Fascinating , well , thanks for explaining that sounds like we might be going from the idea of fictional
EDL	00:27:39,659	00:27:45,227	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	The universal translator is something that we might actually all of us be able to use , hopefully or at all
EDL	00:27:45,227	00:27:48,640	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Seven point four billion dollars on the plant might be able to talk
EDL	00:27:48,640	00:27:52,495	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And I tried in the thousands of languages that we speak
EDL	00:27:52,495	00:28:00,000	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	So wait , we have covered a lot of fascinating ground here , and I just want to thank you for this engaging conversation
EDL	00:28:00,000	00:28:00,930	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	WOW , thank you
EDL	00:28:00,930	00:28:02,790	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	Evan is great talking to you
EDL	00:28:02,790	00:28:05,812	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us
EDL	00:28:05,812	00:28:19,780	| VfD E09 The Datamancer |	I hope you join us again for the next Voices from the other for more information about weight , his programs and the other break through technology start is working on visit , dark at that mill
