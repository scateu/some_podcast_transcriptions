EDL	00:00:11,570	00:00:30,520	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Stuff technology, the internet, GPS in the column of your hand are tonight with technologies, a driver of our times since its founding a one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight, in the midst of the cold war, DARPA, the defence advanced research projects agency, has been a driver
EDL	00:00:31,680	00:00:40,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA a window onto dark as core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible
EDL	00:00:40,600	00:00:43,250	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	My name is, I have an motto, one of your doctor host
EDL	00:00:43,250	00:01:06,830	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio with the paul thomas, known since his day one as rusty, because he arrived in the world with since september twenty seventeen, rusty has been a program manager in the agency's tactical technology officers, which has a pension for pursuing all delicious vehicular technologies for the air, space and oceanic domains
EDL	00:01:06,830	00:01:20,257	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Already, russia has made his mission a doctor to do what he to develop new concept that will deliver more resilience, global reach and network to connectivity, by way of new space systems
EDL	00:01:20,257	00:01:31,560	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Rusty, join starbucks from decorate DAQRI, an organized this company, even though it doesn't like a cocktail where he served as the executive vice president for global operations
EDL	00:01:31,560	00:01:58,169	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	He also held positions in a slew of commercial space companies, among them spaces and verbal sciences has been in on the design management of an amazing portfolio of space related programs, including the space x dragon spacecraft, the dark of micro satellite technology experiment, or my text, the original law earth or but satellite constellation and the US, air force jail sydney's space situational awareness program
EDL	00:01:58,169	00:02:13,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	His initial training for all claim in the form of a master science degree in our space engineering from the university of texas, austin, and a bachelor of scientific degree in iran, astronaut engineering from, after I say, well, let me say to you
EDL	00:02:13,320	00:02:17,060	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Paul, rusty thomas, welcome to the Voices from the opportunity of thanks
EDL	00:02:17,060	00:02:18,160	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I was great to bear today
EDL	00:02:18,160	00:02:23,810	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Thank you for helping me before we get started on your life adventure, on the forefront of space technology
EDL	00:02:23,810	00:02:28,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I want nursing on something that will not come through in your voice or words
EDL	00:02:29,040	00:02:32,910	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	At six feet, eight inches tall, you are among the toilets
EDL	00:02:32,910	00:02:36,490	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	People at dark, though we are markedly not even the toilets
EDL	00:02:36,490	00:02:42,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It does make me wonder though, how you managed to fit into those seen shows when you were on the producer crew team
EDL	00:02:42,430	00:02:51,700	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And if your fuel costs, when you find your own paper to code, a plane are higher than it would be if a five foot ANGguy like me were the balance. 
EDL	00:02:51,700	00:02:55,840	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Well, yeah, so it does cause me a lot of pain on their planes these days
EDL	00:02:55,840	00:02:56,875	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That is, that is true
EDL	00:02:56,875	00:03:04,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But ottawa being taught was greater group in the game, and I learned to play basketball for some reasons, kind of good at it because of that
EDL	00:03:04,100	00:03:08,170	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So baby is a good thing of raw, and i'll take it. 
EDL	00:03:08,170	00:03:15,700	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	All right, well, one of the things I always want to hear from program managers who are with me in the studio, where they got their start
EDL	00:03:15,700	00:03:20,347	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And they're whether interest came from in science, engineering and technologies
EDL	00:03:20,347	00:03:22,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I would put that question to you. 
EDL	00:03:22,590	00:03:24,720	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay yeah, great, I will love my own space engineering
EDL	00:03:24,720	00:03:32,673	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	She said, and like a lot of our space engineers, grown up in the seventies, nearly eighties, really saw what NASA was doing my great school ahead
EDL	00:03:32,673	00:03:37,440	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That has special readers who are equal and see the history of what NASA don't even back in sixties
EDL	00:03:37,440	00:03:41,170	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I remember the point of those in great detail when I was a kid
EDL	00:03:41,170	00:04:08,890	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But the real kick for me became a career day that my schools have been made great, where they actually pulled my father, and I realized my dad, mechanical engineer and his grandfather, his, my grandfather, his father, a civil engineer, had been doing some pretty interesting things are entire career, and they were staying on the cutting edge of of what was going on my desk network for general electric in the plastic industry when that was getting bigger than sixties and seventies, and my grandfather had worked for northwest and put in all year fields
EDL	00:04:08,890	00:04:21,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And when they are doing it, pacific growth through the, through the four weeks in fifties, he also helped design the regarding at the airports, so had two generations of of insurance behind me in a career day
EDL	00:04:22,390	00:04:29,790	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I actually have my dad was one of the people presenting, and he wanted to the different types of engineering, and at the bottom of a list was error space
EDL	00:04:29,790	00:04:33,694	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I did not know that was an option and always on click for that
EDL	00:04:33,694	00:04:42,939	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The aerospace engineering is something I could do, and I could focus on it and continue on and do our lives on my dad doing in terms of, in terms of really innovative idea
EDL	00:04:42,939	00:04:45,960	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	If things are in new concepts that could be suffering
EDL	00:04:45,960	00:04:50,940	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So with that, I was installed for for indiana and produced a great school
EDL	00:04:50,940	00:04:53,550	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So I jumped at the opportunity to accept that there
EDL	00:04:53,550	00:04:58,200	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So while I prove we had quite a few amazing professors, I wanted them
EDL	00:04:58,200	00:05:10,186	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Professor and sunny give us talks about how you could do no better new career as an engineer, especially if you stay on the coordination and advanced technology advanced what humanity can do
EDL	00:05:10,186	00:05:11,001	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Look back my head
EDL	00:05:11,001	00:05:12,835	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Those words are wrong with me
EDL	00:05:12,835	00:05:14,650	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Feel at twenty, keep moving to
EDL	00:05:14,650	00:05:16,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Where is the most of this technology
EDL	00:05:16,320	00:05:18,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	How can I help the most? 
EDL	00:05:18,020	00:05:21,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Well, those sound like two great lines of influence
EDL	00:05:21,090	00:05:22,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I mean, you know, we died in a teacher like that
EDL	00:05:23,410	00:05:35,490	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And where have you went with so one of the things that I would like you to hear is to take on our listeners on a kind of worldwide tories, you can really do well too much on any one thing you done
EDL	00:05:35,490	00:05:39,080	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I mean, you're CVis just one of the most amazing documents i've
EDL	00:05:39,550	00:05:45,920	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But if you can take us for a worldwide tour on your experience in the commercial space. 
EDL	00:05:45,920	00:05:54,470	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Commercial space absolutely so I didn't internship at a small engineering services company, and we've got to work on NASA with with a special technology
EDL	00:05:54,470	00:05:55,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It is
EDL	00:05:55,110	00:06:02,446	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But what really got me going to commercial side was right after graduate school, I got the opportunity to go tomorrow was firing up the radium lowest orbit
EDL	00:06:02,446	00:06:09,340	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Constellation proliferated, lowest orbit satellites that were crossed, linked and providing global connectivity
EDL	00:06:09,340	00:06:10,007	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And her plan
EDL	00:06:10,007	00:06:14,622	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And this was a large, constantly, very large, sixty six adults of plus papers
EDL	00:06:14,622	00:06:23,406	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the goal was to build one satellite per week and launched the entire consultation of of young seventy excellence, including the spare in one year
EDL	00:06:23,406	00:06:24,631	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Never been done before
EDL	00:06:24,631	00:06:31,293	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And to do that, we're going to use a large number of, and motorola and never designed to spacecraft before
EDL	00:06:31,293	00:06:34,051	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So they put all that together and and background
EDL	00:06:34,051	00:06:35,960	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Eighty nineties was happening
EDL	00:06:35,960	00:06:38,293	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The of the motorola had really good plan
EDL	00:06:38,293	00:06:40,203	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They pulled in a lot of experts
EDL	00:06:40,203	00:06:41,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They pulled in some contractors
EDL	00:06:41,900	00:06:45,040	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Lucky and written on who were experts in this area
EDL	00:06:45,040	00:06:52,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They put together the team, and we ended up building at a rate of one spacecraft every four point three days
EDL	00:06:52,530	00:07:00,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We launched from three containers on this, and in eight days, fourteen satellites, we wash off all the satellite and but it. 
EDL	00:07:00,100	00:07:17,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And exactly before you move on to some more of your commercial space experience, I remember just talking with you at another time when I am proposed to use on this project, you really in project which took around the world to some of the other space cultures out there, like in china and an in russia
EDL	00:07:17,900	00:07:29,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So i'm just wondering if you can compare and contrast a little bit of the kind of space cultures, and that, you know that that you have experience being part of the hours here, and then witnessing those elsewhere. 
EDL	00:07:29,110	00:07:45,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Absolutely what the first analysis, when you get in the other country, any other location is doing a rocket tree or space represent you really grow up across it as type of engineering that you can really do really well if the people that do that are, there are very someone who matter what culture they come from
EDL	00:07:45,710	00:07:48,120	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I was very amazed how quickly you make friends
EDL	00:07:48,120	00:08:17,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The russians are the chinese, anybody who was who are actually launched as we will launch in on the protons rocket seven at a time on the patriot, and we launched two of the time on the chinese rockets at five times on delhi, that which is the main launcher advantage, I would rotate between the lunch bases in california, bike nor kazakhstan, where the rock was launched, also go to mask of integration meetings over two of our beijing for the chinese english meetings in taiwan for lunch based there
EDL	00:08:17,090	00:08:27,293	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We was very interesting program, and really, I found it, the russians and chinese, while russians invented rockery, as we know, just the same time we did, china was coming up to curb
EDL	00:08:27,293	00:08:29,619	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're getting faster as an incredible rate
EDL	00:08:29,619	00:08:31,945	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're getting better at an incredible rate
EDL	00:08:31,945	00:08:33,920	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I found both russia in china
EDL	00:08:33,920	00:08:38,190	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Their cultures were less analytical in the american aerospace culture
EDL	00:08:38,190	00:08:41,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They were very much driven by test, build, test, build, test cycles
EDL	00:08:41,590	00:08:44,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I found it really in the commercial space here in us
EDL	00:08:44,320	00:08:48,946	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We'll serve pretty wonderful videos type of things when you move out of the analytics
EDL	00:08:48,946	00:08:52,608	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Don't spend year to trying to figure out exactly how to optimize
EDL	00:08:52,608	00:08:55,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It may be a sub optimal tested in the news that resort. 
EDL	00:08:55,530	00:09:00,470	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	faith and so we see analytics, I think of of, 妈的，我应该牛仔裤加厚的。
EDL	00:09:00,470	00:09:16,570	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Is that so one thing we really wanna, really, really, really good at in the USis very good computers and a very good computer algorithms that that let us analytically be predict what a rocket would do under structural load or under guidance, navigation control hours, which is great
EDL	00:09:16,570	00:09:20,380	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But it doesn't really tell you everything that could possibly happen during the flight
EDL	00:09:20,380	00:09:22,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Where is the flight actually does tell you that? 
EDL	00:09:22,480	00:09:37,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Before we move off of this little a black weird describing, you need this international framework for getting so many satellites up in such a short time share with every listeners kind of funny experience that you had with the russian team when they were trying to figure out what. 
EDL	00:09:37,970	00:09:40,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They should actually call you as a great joy
EDL	00:09:40,410	00:09:40,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Thank you
EDL	00:09:40,690	00:09:45,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So, so when I started working at motorola, we would have every other month
EDL	00:09:45,530	00:09:47,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We would have a technology changes
EDL	00:09:47,000	00:09:49,540	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We need to see the russian launch team or the chinese launch team
EDL	00:09:49,540	00:10:04,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you have one when the russians would come to tunnel when we've got a mascot, we would have the stereotypical long tables with all the russian, someone's side, all of us on your side in the trains when they asked, and we introduced everybody, they got to me
EDL	00:10:04,410	00:10:07,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I said, when I was rescued, thomas, they stopped the meeting
EDL	00:10:07,310	00:10:10,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Robert briefly, and they started talking to translators, and they came back
EDL	00:10:10,850	00:10:14,039	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And is that your real name, and I said, well, pulls my real name
EDL	00:10:14,039	00:10:22,467	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I was born paul thomas anniversary grandfathers, but since the second, third day and around russia's benignant name, and they went back and talk about this
EDL	00:10:22,467	00:10:25,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It, okay, we get paul, paul, that is a good name
EDL	00:10:25,000	00:10:25,300	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We're gonna
EDL	00:10:25,300	00:10:26,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Call you paul
EDL	00:10:26,320	00:10:30,510	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and as it was fine, some people who can call you power, but most people are more over
EDL	00:10:30,510	00:10:41,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	No musician, and they came back and saying that, well, we're going to call it palm, and the reasons we've discussed it, and and we don't have a nickname rusty here
EDL	00:10:41,680	00:10:44,800	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And in russia, we don't feel comfortable calling
EDL	00:10:45,380	00:10:48,990	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So, so they decided not to come in corruption
EDL	00:10:48,990	00:10:50,340	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I was paul from there
EDL	00:10:50,340	00:10:51,730	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I had been a poll on. 
EDL	00:10:51,730	00:10:55,240	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Since since, like, okay, because of that, it was smooth working team yesterday
EDL	00:10:55,240	00:11:00,787	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So now I want to take you back to that will win the tour of marshall space
EDL	00:11:00,787	00:11:01,731	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Like, what is you to do
EDL	00:11:01,731	00:11:03,148	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But I took him on a diversion
EDL	00:11:03,148	00:11:04,251	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So let's get back to that
EDL	00:11:04,251	00:11:07,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You, you talk to live it about the model experience now moved from the world. 
EDL	00:11:07,400	00:11:17,620	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Great, then I then I moved up to see out of following words, the most important technology, seattle, in late nineties, was, was really happening place for a lot of reasons
EDL	00:11:17,620	00:11:29,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They are also a new company that was found that cottage has the money convenient from field bill gates of criminal call for tightens in the communication and computer industries
EDL	00:11:29,830	00:11:32,750	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And they wanted to build a global lower football
EDL	00:11:32,750	00:11:45,340	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Saturday, said, like constellation, to do broad bank communication, we got pretty fun that design, but the technology, the time was, was, wasn't quite their military session, as we know today really wasn't there
EDL	00:11:45,690	00:11:51,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And the dotcom crash of two thousand two made it really hard for a secret of financing
EDL	00:11:51,270	00:11:57,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So he ended up not going forward that program, even though we had got no CClicense for a lot of spectrum
EDL	00:11:57,270	00:12:00,840	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I had really good chance to be AAman major success
EDL	00:12:00,840	00:12:13,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And it was at the space of a very compelling architecture and moved from there and did engineering services in santiago had a really good time of some of the early days of UAVis prejudging
EDL	00:12:13,400	00:12:23,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Global hawk got to be consulted down there for the early UAVdesign, and then moved to orbital sciences, where I got into the government side
EDL	00:12:23,410	00:12:37,436	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And then after it keeping the commercials are going after the orbital sciences occur, I went to space six hours in two thousand and eleven and worked as a senior director for driving, building the capsules go to the space station
EDL	00:12:37,436	00:12:42,343	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So i've spent five years there and had distant, amazing, amazing run, putting on those
EDL	00:12:42,343	00:12:50,960	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Those capsules up also got to work on the lining legs and the and see and and play a good party of christopher claimed in those of. 
EDL	00:12:50,960	00:13:02,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	First data, right, and just weeks really before this discussion are having now, a dragon capital did arrive at the international space station for a resupply mission
EDL	00:13:02,230	00:13:05,760	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So when you see that the media had, you feel now when the two. 
EDL	00:13:06,290	00:13:22,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Parliament intense pride, absolutely, that that was at a turning point in how we do it, how we do space missions, how NASA contracts for for things, how NASA moves forward, the technology gets the cutting edge, develops it and then can move that technology
EDL	00:13:22,480	00:13:29,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Two companies like the space exists of the world, who can then use that to build a commercial case and then allow enough to move on to the next place
EDL	00:13:29,850	00:13:39,860	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	When I was at space x, we went from doing one rocket year, one dragon every year, two to four, five, six dragons per year
EDL	00:13:39,860	00:13:44,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And now the spacecraft was rapped up to twenty thirty plus launches in the given year
EDL	00:13:44,930	00:13:56,390	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's really been an incredible time to that approached how you do commercial space turn on and become reality and then become a success, and then become really a major success. 
EDL	00:13:56,390	00:13:57,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Where is that right now
EDL	00:13:58,020	00:14:00,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, so you serve told the we are already here
EDL	00:14:00,680	00:14:22,382	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	If you kind of growing up professionally, along with the commercial space sector, which is just kind of amazing thing to think about you then made a decision to say yes, when, when the officer came through to become a program, yeah, I like to hear that the secrets of events that let you in this stage of your career from that the united commercial activities you been in
EDL	00:14:22,382	00:14:26,260	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And now here, as a first year PM absolute program manager and. 
EDL	00:14:26,260	00:14:30,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	By chance I happened to in the early two thousand and be talking to some friends at robert sciences
EDL	00:14:31,260	00:14:35,600	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And they said, there was a very interesting program was found that called my tax
EDL	00:14:36,440	00:14:36,870	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I did no
EDL	00:14:36,870	00:14:39,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Materiality was a dark program
EDL	00:14:39,030	00:14:44,949	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was classified what the experiment's war battles was will never know that existing the time it was used to dark
EDL	00:14:44,949	00:14:56,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The experimental program to do a demo of the technology and orbital was looking for people who had my type of background, a little bit of commercial, but also had the right tickets so they could do, do the work
EDL	00:14:56,430	00:15:02,793	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and they brought me out for three months then, and I would just gonna help do some analysis for that spacecraft
EDL	00:15:02,793	00:15:10,316	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I did some analysts, and after three months, look like dark was going to continue the program overall wanted to keep expanding
EDL	00:15:10,316	00:15:17,930	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So they asked me if I stay on as a manager for the, for the design that so I got to run the design of the of the michael spacecraft
EDL	00:15:18,290	00:15:23,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And so I stayed in an overall, for now three months, I ended up to everybody years
EDL	00:15:23,110	00:15:27,154	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And during that time frame, we work through the middle spacecraft
EDL	00:15:27,154	00:15:29,533	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I got to do the design and build
EDL	00:15:29,533	00:15:32,863	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We actually took the integration, launched it
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:39,196	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I went out to shiver for space as a vehicle engineer and got to be on council on flight for about year
EDL	00:15:39,196	00:15:41,362	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And f, so it was a really good experience
EDL	00:15:41,362	00:15:44,610	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I, Iwasn't commercial commercially, but it wasn't government
EDL	00:15:44,610	00:15:46,775	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Taking commercial approach is all about
EDL	00:15:46,775	00:15:48,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was a very commercial company
EDL	00:15:48,400	00:15:53,862	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and this was an experimental process that wasn't a strict requirements remain program
EDL	00:15:53,862	00:15:58,232	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was there to prove some key technology that we could use in space
EDL	00:15:58,232	00:16:16,650	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was was successful, and I, as very proud of the of the results there, that kind of got me into what dark can do, dark can step into an area where, where there might not be a set need, or a set said requirements are a set funding line and say this is technology
EDL	00:16:16,650	00:16:17,460	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It would really help
EDL	00:16:17,460	00:16:44,389	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The wolf fire helped the country and in significant ways, and and say, rogan, rogen do a democratic proof that this is possible, that the proof is here, if we can actually spend two or three years and some money, the actually good demonstration of a running that opened my eyes to what you could really do outside the commercial world, but still using commercial approach as much as possible, so followed on foreign and became a deputy pyongyang met on the GSAprogramme mentioned earlier
EDL	00:16:44,389	00:16:49,910	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Geostationary special awareness program is air force programming record
EDL	00:16:49,910	00:16:51,765	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Now that is doing very well
EDL	00:16:51,765	00:17:02,510	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's up in jail, and it is acknowledged that it is very, very, very good capability, and it is doing in a lot of good from the people using
EDL	00:17:02,510	00:17:05,940	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the GSAprogram are very successful
EDL	00:17:05,940	00:17:15,390	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And after it got to the critical scientific review, I happened to have the opportunity to to go to a space, except they were just found out we talked about that it was
EDL	00:17:15,390	00:17:18,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was a wonderful five years at the end of that
EDL	00:17:18,480	00:17:28,872	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I was at degree during the operation job of setting up the owner, reality global operations, manufacturing for the what's going to become AArevolution
EDL	00:17:28,872	00:17:30,276	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm a positive argument
EDL	00:17:30,276	00:17:31,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Reality can be a very, very big. 
EDL	00:17:31,680	00:17:36,560	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And just a two sentenced description for listeners, you might not know what you mean by augmented. 
EDL	00:17:36,560	00:17:48,312	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The home in the reality is the ability put on glasses that will organize the information in real information with, with computer generated three d graphics that that actually will float in space
EDL	00:17:48,312	00:17:51,873	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You can put text, you can put graphics, you can put anything you want
EDL	00:17:51,873	00:17:54,220	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And it was is going to be contextual
EDL	00:17:54,220	00:18:02,300	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Natural objects in space was not virtual reality where locks you out, and you don't see anything and algorithm, you actually still see the people in the room
EDL	00:18:02,300	00:18:03,600	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We still see all the objects. 
EDL	00:18:03,600	00:18:14,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But it's adding information, and I have seen, I think, a motorcyclist phrase for this software defined holographic, like control that related to what you talking about. 
EDL	00:18:14,010	00:18:22,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The advanced versions of argument rarely and degree had some of the most advanced holographic, like control technology. 
EDL	00:18:22,320	00:18:31,326	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, so now my suspicion is confirm that you actually are are going to develop this district enterprise at some point
EDL	00:18:31,326	00:18:36,710	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And how that example is that it gets, yes, so getting back to how you actually got the two drop. 
EDL	00:18:36,710	00:18:44,116	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That final turn to get me back as program manager became when he concept of the blackjack consultation, which I did not come up with
EDL	00:18:44,116	00:18:46,594	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was already been formulated by expertise
EDL	00:18:46,594	00:18:58,926	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And i'll talk a little bit more about that right after this great, so dark, contacted me and said, we're going to go forward with a proliferated, lower, thorough architecture to start to change how we do space missions right now
EDL	00:18:58,926	00:19:06,592	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We do space mission varieties with very capable satellite, exactly caused a lot of money, so therefore we can't build very many of them
EDL	00:19:06,592	00:19:15,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And the lawyers are preferred to approach that already indeed, but with the communications and in the nineties, and television was trying to do
EDL	00:19:15,010	00:19:26,769	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And other companies have taken weight forward is a different approach to put smaller, lower costs and and sometimes expandable, but not expendable, slow reliability
EDL	00:19:26,769	00:19:37,503	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But the key element, small and lower costs satellites that are in very lower orbits so that you can cover the entire earth with coverage, and likely satellite was a six year semi
EDL	00:19:37,503	00:19:43,830	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Satellites will usually do it to give yourself constant coverage over the and and double
EDL	00:19:43,830	00:20:00,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Let me know if they were going to move forward with an experiment to try to move into organizing what these eggs with satellite can do with a lower storm proliferated constellation when that opportunity came in, I came in, gave a talk
EDL	00:20:00,030	00:20:07,540	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It was a match made november day because it sounds like this ten thousand people in the world that seems to have made this kind of idea
EDL	00:20:07,540	00:20:16,110	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I really do think in terms of match, in terms of what the job wants to do with the and in what these type of consolations can do in the future
EDL	00:20:16,110	00:20:18,600	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And in my background is, it's a really good match on
EDL	00:20:18,600	00:20:20,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm very excited to be in this position
EDL	00:20:20,230	00:20:21,510	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	This is time is perfect. 
EDL	00:20:21,510	00:20:28,820	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Let's talk about black jack in a little bit more detail, tell me a little bit about, you know, the kind of the elements of that
EDL	00:20:29,150	00:20:35,060	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And even before we started, can you tell listeners and me where the name comes from? 
EDL	00:20:35,570	00:20:50,488	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Sure, the concept of of a black jacket that instead of having sensors in space that might come out of wonder to with this points of the sky, you could potentially put smaller sensors in many locations
EDL	00:20:50,488	00:20:57,570	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Give the destroyers or the surface action group commanders of the world or the army commanders or air force
EDL	00:20:57,570	00:21:17,776	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Anybody they build it look over the rising with a small number of description source that they actually doubt the sky in some ways, while we go to a casino, and you look up, you see on the ceiling, you see all the little domes, those little dorms roll, tiny little sensors, and then making sure that nothing bad is going on, right
EDL	00:21:17,776	00:21:23,320	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the concept of black jack is to follow that distributed sensor approaches to see an excellent
EDL	00:21:23,320	00:21:31,255	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You don't have one or two large systems making sure that everything is working okay and making sure that there are no cheating going on in the, in the excel. 
EDL	00:21:31,255	00:21:34,875	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And just just for the record for our listeners, we do need to point out the dark
EDL	00:21:34,875	00:21:37,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It does not get all of its ideas from us. 
EDL	00:21:37,310	00:21:40,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Biggest, we don't look at all, but probably more than we should
EDL	00:21:40,400	00:21:42,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It maybe, yes, absolutely
EDL	00:21:42,230	00:21:52,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So the name came from the summer playing blackjack would have the distributed sensor said, so it is kind of a tongue and cheap name, but, but it was a good name and a good idea
EDL	00:21:52,100	00:21:52,660	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	crossings
EDL	00:21:52,660	00:21:54,440	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We give our talks and what we're doing
EDL	00:21:54,810	00:22:09,856	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So black jackets, this yesterday said a lower storage consultation of some, sir said, we're going to leverage and key elementaries leveraging the commercial space as they talk my grandpa in the past is, you can do things very quickly
EDL	00:22:09,856	00:22:13,337	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You can do things very efficiently with a commercial approach
EDL	00:22:13,337	00:22:17,058	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Now, let's not to say the government approach, however, it occurred things
EDL	00:22:17,058	00:22:25,710	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The best is always bad, but in some cases, you don't get the optimal solution, and you could do things in a lower cost and a faster schedule if you tackle in a different way
EDL	00:22:25,710	00:22:28,860	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So what the ideal black jack is a try different approach
EDL	00:22:28,860	00:22:41,250	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You use lower orbit, use proliferated commercial satellites, especially the buses where we will marry military payloads to those commercial buses and then start flying a large number of them
EDL	00:22:41,250	00:22:50,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you can give that proliferated global custody consultation, and I say, consequently, that means for a commander wants to look at a given spot on earth
EDL	00:22:50,090	00:22:54,570	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	He can point the sensor to that spot immediately, because it could be a satellite operation. 
EDL	00:22:54,965	00:22:59,435	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, and you use the words that, in a way had been here before proliferated is one of my transition
EDL	00:22:59,435	00:23:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	What that means? 
EDL	00:23:00,000	00:23:07,245	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	In this framework, proliferating means multiple points of in the space and spread out over the surface of the other sector of the space, of course
EDL	00:23:07,245	00:23:21,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So any person on the, on the ground is going to be able to look up, see a black with the council confliction developed in the sky any given time, and that's the end of the reciprocal approach works that if the black jack satellite is always going to be also any point of the earth. 
EDL	00:23:21,430	00:23:35,913	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	At any given time, right so century since there is there some aspects so sort of of GPS like system, and that you got many satellites working in a kind of coordinated fashion, delivering amazing kinds of inner data that would not be possible
EDL	00:23:35,913	00:23:43,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Otherwise, he reacts to talking about a lot more than the several dozen rider GPS talk just a little bit more
EDL	00:23:43,000	00:23:52,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The various kinds of challenges that are part of this project, one of them certainly is, is producing almost mass, producing very rapidly
EDL	00:23:52,970	00:23:54,080	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	A lot of satellites
EDL	00:23:54,080	00:23:58,050	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And so you had to talk about your experience there, but there's also going to be coordination
EDL	00:23:58,050	00:23:59,460	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	There's going to be command and control
EDL	00:24:00,030	00:24:01,980	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	What are some of these other elements that you. 
EDL	00:24:01,980	00:24:06,747	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Talk is about absolutely so first, while yesterday's analogy, the GPS is honest person
EDL	00:24:06,747	00:24:21,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That is a preliminary conclusion, but it's about at a medium or medium, high altitude with black jack won't go very low, five hundred kilometers to twelve hundred columns, so arranged that that's just about the earth's atmosphere for these outlet
EDL	00:24:21,020	00:24:24,279	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and the trick is going to be building such a low enough
EDL	00:24:24,279	00:24:28,624	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You can need more satellites and what a GPS satellite would GPS consolation would need
EDL	00:24:28,624	00:24:32,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So to do that, you're going to need mass production and to do that, you have the cost right
EDL	00:24:32,970	00:24:45,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You going to need to build them, and on very short time skills with a minimal amount of a simply immigration and test and do that, we're going to bring it as much commercial approaches
EDL	00:24:45,020	00:24:53,149	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We, we've had an injury day, a very positive response from from over one hundred and thirty companies signed up for the industry day
EDL	00:24:53,149	00:24:57,521	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And we had overturned seventy five folks who want to comment and let them just
EDL	00:24:57,521	00:25:20,188	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So we believe that that approach of going with discreet, low cost notes in space that are almost expendable, not expensive, but almost is going to be achievable, and we're going to that that commercial and commodities approached the buses and bring that to impose match to the, the, the military pilots that will go on those buses
EDL	00:25:20,188	00:25:22,128	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Also, the other key element of this
EDL	00:25:22,128	00:25:36,557	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I knew a little bit of that second ago is that we don't, if we're gonna, launch hundreds or or more thousands of of the satellite, we don't want to require teams of multiple people per satellite monitoring
EDL	00:25:36,557	00:25:44,830	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And right now the exit have excellent teams of people on the ground who are making sure everything that that satellite does is monitored
EDL	00:25:44,830	00:25:49,810	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're gonna inevitably predict beforehand what the response of any new script
EDL	00:25:49,810	00:25:55,370	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's an excellent approach, but we really want to get a tournament into the black jack architecture
EDL	00:25:55,370	00:25:59,160	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And when I say economy, I mean, how does the mission control work
EDL	00:25:59,160	00:26:01,346	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	How does resource planning work
EDL	00:26:01,346	00:26:07,889	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	How does the payload in terms of what it seem work in terms of, can you move instead of raw data down to the people on the ground
EDL	00:26:07,889	00:26:12,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Can you recognize the information and could actually, it was important. 
EDL	00:26:12,000	00:26:26,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, when the other interesting thinks about the blackjack program to me is because you're not putting in a multiple billion dollar jewels up their large juice, expensive assets that need to stay up there for years
EDL	00:26:26,000	00:26:35,180	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Nearly here, you can do what I guess, much more frequent technology refresh, as presumes somewhat I can be done through software
EDL	00:26:35,180	00:26:37,090	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Now you can just wait or with upgrade
EDL	00:26:37,090	00:26:51,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Reading are various applications on our computers, but this also does give you some opportunity to, you know, without breaking the bank putting up actually, new generations of these small satellites and still having the work within the black jack consolation. 
EDL	00:26:51,100	00:26:51,580	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Yeah, yeah
EDL	00:26:51,580	00:27:08,797	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and they're too early there that are very important and organized both of those on black jack first is, if your individual lawyers orbit your large costs is lower than going at higher rabbits, you're waited less, and the cost of individual satellite is less
EDL	00:27:08,797	00:27:23,660	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So we're aiming for an orbit six million dollars per note per black jet note that includes a launch cost, which means that if you have a problem with one of those satellites, you can launch another one replaced flood huge amount of money
EDL	00:27:23,660	00:27:36,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And in the second piece, is there the the ability to do on our own orbit over the air of days of the software working about large, I call a pit boss once again going with a black jack approach
EDL	00:27:36,690	00:27:40,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Tried the pit boss is the brains on each one of the of a black jack notes
EDL	00:27:40,590	00:27:53,058	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's going to have a terrific class processor on it or more, and it's going to allow us to put a lot of algorithms on space and normally put a lot of allegations and space to do the work up there with the authentic computers
EDL	00:27:53,058	00:28:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But it's also gonna run a launch, more process, repeat building than we need the first generation, because we expect to get better
EDL	00:28:00,000	00:28:03,665	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That was our algorithms and algorithms typically need more processor
EDL	00:28:03,665	00:28:12,422	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So if you can, we talk about our work to basics, my, my boss, there also found another company called tesla, and one of the really girl called models of tesler
EDL	00:28:12,422	00:28:31,728	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It is, you have a car, and you might come out and in the morning, and I started over there update, and you have a better car the next day, and you did the priority, because if i've had a lot of work, so i'm going to follow that type of approach, putting a lot of extra capacity for the processor, so that as the algorithms get better, you get a better spacecraft essentially for free
EDL	00:28:31,728	00:28:37,350	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Although, of course, you have to pay for algorithm update, but in terms of launching, you said that, you know. 
EDL	00:28:37,350	00:28:48,040	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	and I imagine you also have to think about end of service when you talking about so many discrete parts that are in lower therapy means, sounds like to me the desk and deal with some 沐浴露。
EDL	00:28:48,040	00:28:48,460	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	那都是。
EDL	00:28:48,810	00:29:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Have you given that thought, absolutely, given that thought, and that goes back over the motorola radium consolation every year, rhythmic has the ability to deal with itself
EDL	00:29:00,000	00:29:20,928	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But the end of his life, it has a small amount of fuel reserves left that those few reserves are used for anything else other than the orbit, and has enough redundancy and electronics on board, so that it starts to have problems with it can still far the thrusters and bring itself down, so that approach has improved, successful with with the original in the commercial consultations
EDL	00:29:20,928	00:29:29,718	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We're going to follow the same approach of object, and I believe there are numerous FCCviolence for mega consultations of communication
EDL	00:29:29,718	00:29:38,970	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Satellite is not the other that have launched even more satellites and black jack, they're going to be good of lawyers, or, but also, and put in the ability
EDL	00:29:38,970	00:29:49,412	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So as a satellite ends its operation, like organic, replace with a better technique for satellite, it will immediately turn on infrastructure and do usually over the south
EDL	00:29:49,412	00:29:54,215	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	This africa summarized relatively bunny, the small cell lights don't make a pack down
EDL	00:29:54,215	00:29:57,347	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They burn up in the high and the spirit during the story
EDL	00:29:57,347	00:30:00,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I haven't nobody else, and there may be many of 这没得说。
EDL	00:30:01,730	00:30:08,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So as you think about it, this is amazing to think about this is all the pieces, and you can have additions of a program
EDL	00:30:08,290	00:30:17,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It is either one or two things about it that stands out in your mind, as maybe, particularly a rich, even working on the dark program in technology
EDL	00:30:17,850	00:30:19,080	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Speaking, yes, we are. 
EDL	00:30:19,080	00:30:25,410	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Absolutely, so that the biggest rich, I believe, is the amount of atomic we'd like to put on this spacecraft
EDL	00:30:25,410	00:30:34,540	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I've given a metric that if we lose the ground control, as if we have a comes problem, or the some type of influence and satellites are arranged talking to the ground
EDL	00:30:34,540	00:30:43,596	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I want them to be able to operate this for twenty four hours as a consumer talking to each other through their systems and and and managing the resources
EDL	00:30:43,596	00:31:09,561	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Managing the mission is still providing whatever in the fact or our set of information, the worldwide that the people downrange without that ground infrastructure, so that could be interesting when I learned that I say the matter is one day, but really, my stretch goal is to get thirty days universal operations without talking to the consultation, while it still performs its primary mission to whoever needs to have that information that is generating
EDL	00:31:09,561	00:31:14,045	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So putting that in the place is also significantly for from the current operations
EDL	00:31:14,045	00:31:24,710	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We have an operations controls in our ground, making sure the satellite health and safety and the mission is being managed properly to one, or you don't even have a human being in the loop
EDL	00:31:24,710	00:31:39,683	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You moved the man pregnant for men, men in the loop to men on the loop, poor that the people do in the management are there to make sure and adjusted priorities as necessary course, but not there to make a second by second minute, by many decisions
EDL	00:31:39,683	00:31:43,260	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I have the spacecraft operating, and what they do that is really hard, but. 
EDL	00:31:43,260	00:31:47,216	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So a fireman for tonight be always with human beings
EDL	00:31:47,216	00:31:54,820	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They're as shepherds and in the loop, and somewhere absolutely so you're a first year program manager
EDL	00:31:54,820	00:31:59,436	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Typically, program managers are here for just to three to five
EDL	00:31:59,436	00:32:01,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I have people here in the study of whoever is done
EDL	00:32:01,900	00:32:03,370	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Several tories of duty as well
EDL	00:32:03,370	00:32:05,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So people like it enough to say they come here
EDL	00:32:05,850	00:32:07,500	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They do want to reduce the go away
EDL	00:32:07,500	00:32:08,240	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They come back
EDL	00:32:08,240	00:32:23,381	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm just wondering if, as the first time program and energy with a program of this complexity and science, what you think this one program is going to be enough for you to satisfy your, your technology interest, and just because it's going to be so hard to do
EDL	00:32:23,381	00:32:26,900	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Or are you already imagining are taken on additional programmes? 
EDL	00:32:26,900	00:32:29,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm actually early, imagine taken on
EDL	00:32:29,290	00:32:41,967	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It does not bargain that goes back to my theme of how to get to the most cutting that gentleman of whatever you do in a career, but like text of a major program, because it could be AAhuge success, and it's gonna really lead a pilot to lower the orbit
EDL	00:32:41,967	00:33:01,280	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But once you start working in a lower orbit regime and once a duty and dark, start working and putting these systems in place, I can introduce many other programs that will leverage this type of architecture and and a successful command object once we build this global message network, this, this message is space, a space open at
EDL	00:33:01,800	00:33:05,140	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	How can you use it to actually benefit the people on the ground
EDL	00:33:05,140	00:33:05,705	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I think. 
EDL	00:33:05,705	00:33:21,530	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	A lot of programmer and I just, I just want to point out to listeners that, even though restless, is talking about a program like that, it is, it does not mean that it is automatically going to become what he's gonna have to really jump through a lot of hopes, and it is a lot of people that something worth doing
EDL	00:33:21,530	00:33:24,254	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So this really is essentially glimmer on the eye
EDL	00:33:24,254	00:33:28,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Mayor may not come to become AAso that's one immediate
EDL	00:33:28,270	00:33:28,855	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Sounds like you. 
EDL	00:33:28,855	00:33:29,665	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I didn't have more idea
EDL	00:33:29,665	00:33:40,653	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Yeah, I, I, I, I, Ihave been spun up with a world above in the reality on what you can do is like control hollywood graphic, like controls in area of high interest to me
EDL	00:33:40,653	00:34:02,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I believe that we are approaching that point where the holidays are allowed, not reconduct things that appearing, but the ability for systems to a transmit holographic light phase, control the light and project in a way that you are emerged in a reality that that isn't real, but it's seen the real, because your eye is getting fed the same information
EDL	00:34:02,010	00:34:04,740	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It would be if the object was actually there
EDL	00:34:04,740	00:34:19,283	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I believe that type of light control just drawn the corner, and there is a good chances going to revolutionary how we do interaction with computers and interaction with even people in the same way that the transistor revolutionized how we do computers
EDL	00:34:19,283	00:34:24,200	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I think that's are coming the next five, twenty years, and I really hope you get dark. 
EDL	00:34:24,200	00:34:28,360	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Movement and as you released in the potential applications of that training, just. 
EDL	00:34:28,360	00:34:31,350	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And to my, my meaning is a huge, but not destroying
EDL	00:34:31,350	00:34:39,189	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But the if, if you are deployed a, if you have multiple person to ploy, and you can have a holographic surgery
EDL	00:34:39,189	00:34:49,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So how, how to fix somebody in your deployed, or in a very mode, you can actually train somebody in real time and how to do something, because I can see it in three day, right in front of them
EDL	00:34:49,290	00:35:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Has it happening while the reducing american procedure, training for welfare, training for other industrial applications becomes, becomes much more advance
EDL	00:35:00,000	00:35:01,395	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Or thus, they very done me
EDL	00:35:01,395	00:35:10,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Study showing you can train somebody anywhere from two to ten times faster with algorithm is all in his olympic light approaches
EDL	00:35:10,000	00:35:19,494	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	If you, because your brain is, is, is programmed to absorb information from three day context, much faster than you are with someone talking to you or reading in a book
EDL	00:35:19,494	00:35:20,760	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you said, you see it
EDL	00:35:20,760	00:35:22,237	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You have a robot factor
EDL	00:35:22,237	00:35:26,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So I think training is going to be an area that could be revolutionized. 
EDL	00:35:26,030	00:35:30,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Another thing just came to mind, what is economic sort of discovery
EDL	00:35:30,680	00:35:36,312	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you might have a space you want to figure out the best way to arrange things in that space with this kind of technology
EDL	00:35:36,312	00:35:40,470	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Build a text out of those different ways, very efficiently, cheaply. 
EDL	00:35:40,470	00:35:46,760	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	One of my early early crew moves was that the internship will work out, work on on as a project
EDL	00:35:46,760	00:36:05,503	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And we will would well be three day cat at a time when two d cat was the standard computer redesign, and that three dimensional cat and allowed you to mark up engineering parts, and and then do photographic, virtual photographic, make sure the parts would learn through with each other
EDL	00:36:05,503	00:36:09,434	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And that was a huge boom for it really designed with a mechanical design
EDL	00:36:09,434	00:36:11,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I believe the same thing will happen
EDL	00:36:11,400	00:36:19,060	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Owners are doing this with the interactive, collaborative tools allow everybody who want to see what's happening in three days without even. 
EDL	00:36:19,060	00:36:34,230	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Computer screen are selling for them, and then there is one other kind of technology project that you work, which also just represents to me, just how many thousands of thousands of technology engineering issues there are when you really thinking big
EDL	00:36:34,230	00:36:47,640	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you also were in on the design of the crane operation for meeting satellites, going to connect vehicle dispenser components right after just one of the many, many. 
EDL	00:36:47,640	00:36:49,840	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So this was an interesting invention
EDL	00:36:49,840	00:36:59,587	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We worked as two or three of us at motorola, where the we had it was that motorola was pitching the ship and shoot approach a spacecraft you finished on the production line
EDL	00:36:59,587	00:37:14,306	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It went into a shipping container, said on a dog until where the russian protesters under the landmark rush, chinese landmarks, or the, or the, the mechanism that was said of two folks needed another set of satellites, and that those launched campaigns were going
EDL	00:37:14,306	00:37:15,925	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The russians lead seven
EDL	00:37:15,925	00:37:17,081	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And that was the case
EDL	00:37:17,081	00:37:22,400	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We would call photographs and photographs showed up at the sky harbor airport
EDL	00:37:22,400	00:37:24,310	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We will load two or three side
EDL	00:37:24,310	00:37:25,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	They would fly in the russia
EDL	00:37:25,430	00:37:30,870	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We looked up, and then we get them out to the large base, and we wanna put them on a rocket within a day or two
EDL	00:37:31,180	00:37:33,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And and that's always do not help
EDL	00:37:33,030	00:37:39,940	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I entered this done right now, and it was the salad we were looking for very fast, like our times, very quick process flow and do that
EDL	00:37:39,940	00:37:45,480	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We needed to make seventy salaries are very close to each other, actually and quickly
EDL	00:37:45,480	00:37:56,220	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So we put together a crane, so I think we call the swing and tourist eliminator, which mounted to the floor of the russian integration hall in bike north
EDL	00:37:56,220	00:38:01,100	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And we, every satellite would be brought in vertical state attached to this
EDL	00:38:01,100	00:38:14,010	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And then it is the russian, korean, normally with swimming is around a little bit as a model, because you didn't have a neighborhood of salad transaction, but on the disposal, like wages, there are all very close to each other
EDL	00:38:14,010	00:38:16,260	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	She had to control the twist in the swing
EDL	00:38:16,260	00:38:16,870	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We are at the point
EDL	00:38:16,870	00:38:28,210	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We can make three of the satellites per day and have all the entire dispenser of seven satellites ready to go after three or four days of processing, and then they would be filled and be. 
EDL	00:38:28,570	00:38:31,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Okay, so on top of everything else, you are right, right
EDL	00:38:33,110	00:38:35,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So you know, you're working on things
EDL	00:38:35,690	00:38:47,550	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And many boss would work, consider to be kind of science fiction, technology fiction, though you can make these things really are there non's space technologies that you just go about? 
EDL	00:38:47,550	00:38:53,447	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Down's space will almost daily error space without the space, or as good error
EDL	00:38:53,447	00:39:09,290	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I do believe that the transport of human beings of planets is going to get to the point organ a bit more at the hypersonic scale, and in the not to distant futures, not in the area of research for myself, but i'm exceptionally interested
EDL	00:39:09,290	00:39:27,150	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I guess, curious on how we're going to get some new technology that seems becoming online right to the commercial space and how we might start moving people from, from, from, say, new york to sydney and an hours instead of the two of the fourteen plus hours, take right
EDL	00:39:27,520	00:39:46,642	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I think the very high speed transport, which I guess that it doesn't hit your mark, because you will probably have to go in space a little bit during part of that flight, but I still see some very high speed flight, supersonic, high supersonic speed flight has been a narrow of of interest of of significant potential, and the next ten to fifteen years
EDL	00:39:46,642	00:39:50,640	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And I think there's the museum teams that are cracking dragon that would be. 
EDL	00:39:50,640	00:40:00,000	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And so sort of, ironically, thinking bigger than this way to make the world a little smaller in the sense of english, for many points at any point, be in a much shorter time than as right. 
EDL	00:40:00,000	00:40:01,456	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Black jack will give you the message
EDL	00:40:01,456	00:40:04,740	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Networking communicated red broad band and connection with the people. 
EDL	00:40:04,740	00:40:05,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	That's going to be the next step up
EDL	00:40:05,850	00:40:06,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So rusty
EDL	00:40:06,690	00:40:08,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You are technology developer
EDL	00:40:08,850	00:40:10,030	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You been doing that your whole life
EDL	00:40:10,030	00:40:21,658	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But you also have taken time to get into the mall of the mine said in the setting of the war fighter, the wonderfully the war fighters who are not trying to serve more capability
EDL	00:40:21,658	00:40:26,270	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Can you just share a little bit with listeners about your experience? 
EDL	00:40:26,270	00:40:49,430	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Complex, absolutely so i've been a reserved for united states navy since two thousand four, and as an intelligence officer, I was lucky enough to be selected to go to naval special offer and and actually went out during the search to synchronized desert areas with the whistle teams that help do targeting and how value how are you talking
EDL	00:40:49,430	00:40:51,276	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We did the pregnant job
EDL	00:40:51,276	00:41:01,506	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We got to go to move, move through are those areas and picked up, but quite a few of the alcohol may love, love, produce and and then put them away
EDL	00:41:01,506	00:41:14,950	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So for I feel, I feel, I feel like if I draw it down in a little greek on every, every month, very, very important part of my life, although it as a reserve is secondary. 
EDL	00:41:15,320	00:41:25,590	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	But I also imagine that that boots on the ground experience now, as a program manager, completes the kind of liu prove that not all program managers can add
EDL	00:41:25,590	00:41:26,560	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I think it does help. 
EDL	00:41:26,560	00:41:39,180	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	The area that it helps the most tennis when you're downrange with a special force, special operators, the amount of band with the amount of sensing you can get the distant amount of communication you can do is very limited
EDL	00:41:39,180	00:41:42,176	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	You're typically moving that if you are so destroyed
EDL	00:41:42,176	00:41:46,370	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And what i'm trying to do, the program manager here is to give those type of point
EDL	00:41:46,370	00:42:02,141	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Sailor, soldiers, marines, whatever they are, the ability to move data at a much higher brand, with indicated data from sensors at all with the rise and not necessarily organic or unit immediately within seconds back to where they were without help, go through a grounded for structure
EDL	00:42:02,141	00:42:09,733	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	So seeing how it is operated when I have been, downrange is really helped shape homes, set up the technology to for the future of a dark
EDL	00:42:09,733	00:42:11,680	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	We can help you international nation. 
EDL	00:42:11,680	00:42:23,757	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	What's the recipe you've taken me and listeners on an amazing tour of in the summer, who has been the absolutely the last couple of decades, which is involved in space technology
EDL	00:42:23,757	00:42:26,180	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	so I wanna thank you for 会员。
EDL	00:42:26,180	00:42:27,360	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's really been a pleasure
EDL	00:42:27,360	00:42:28,020	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	Well, thank you
EDL	00:42:28,020	00:42:29,850	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	It's been a bit of a great career
EDL	00:42:29,850	00:42:33,390	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	I'm happy to be a darker and looking forward to the next doorstep to break down
EDL	00:42:33,390	00:42:35,720	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And where we're going to be going to get next year. 
EDL	00:42:36,320	00:42:58,690	| VfD E21 Mr. Thousand Satellites |	And thanks listeners for sharing this time with us, I hope you join this again for the next Voices from the urban, for more information about called rusty thomas, the programs he and his colleagues in the technical technology office runs and the other breakthrough technologies dark, is working on visit, dark that no.
