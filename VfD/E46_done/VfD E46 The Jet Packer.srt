2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,740
Stealth technology, the internet, GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:32,540
Technology is a driver of our times since its founding at 1958, in the midst of the cold war, doubt that offends advanced research has been a driver of technology

4
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,040
Welcome to Voices from DARPA

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,820
A window into DARPA's core of program managers, their job to redefine what is possible

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,230
My name is Ivan Amato.

7
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,120
And I am your DARPA host today

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:01:02,060
I am pleased to be talking with Alexander Walan, a program manager since 2017 in the technical technology, obviously, we are recording our conversations from our respective locations to comply with company restrictions, because we are not in a recording studio

9
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,170
You might hear everything, sounds like traffic and birds

10
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:13,933
And as it so happens, insect noises from this year's brood(孵化) of 17 years cicadas(蝉), which are just everywhere here in my location

11
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:18,113
Alexander, or 'Xander', as he is more often known,

12
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:23,641
brought to DARPA his interests in developing and demonstrating advanced aircraft technologies,

13
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:30,536
rapid design and prototyping for moving concepts as quickly as possible to operational practicality are

14
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,619
also parts of his modest surrounding

15
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:38,271
Xander has had his hands on the challenge of a vertical landing and take off or VTOL technology

16
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:48,510
and demos of lighter-than-air aircraft that are capable of being navigable and having extended flight at stratospheric(同温层) altitudes of 11 12 miles and above that

17
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:56,630
His main programmatic focus today is with the program known as CRANE, short for Control of Revolutionary Aircraft, with Novel Effectors

18
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:11,090
Before joining DARPA's team of program managers, Xander searched for 22 years as an officer in the air force, beginning at 1995 and stretching all the way to 2017 when he began his DARPA years just before joining DARPA

19
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:19,502
He served as the program manager at the Air force Research Laboratory, oversaw bright technology portfolio over 70 projects designed for transition to the war fighter

20
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:32,130
He also held positions in the F35 joint program office and the combined joint task force parliament, which between 2005 and 2013, helped manage the threat of improvised explosive devices in the war in Afghanistan

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:43,900
He also worked in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for aquisition, and that he will tell you later, he has had quite the adventurer and getting close up looks at aircraft of other nations, including China

22
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,136
Xander, has four degrees

23
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:54,030
Three of them are in aeronautic engineering, including a doctor of engineering degree from George Washington University

24
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,780
His 4th degree is an MBA from the University of Massachusetts

25
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,220
One more thing, Xander is a new father with a ten week old baby girl, Alexander Walan, though I shall call you Xander from here on out

26
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,190
Thank you for joining me in this discussion and a huge congratulations on your new baby daughter

27
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,397
Well, thank you very much

28
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:16,226
It's great to be here. Xander, before we talk about your technology development work at the DARPA

29
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:22,100
But I would like to get some sense of how you became the sort of person ends up as a program manager

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:35,917
I can tell from your three aeronautical engineering degrees that flying technologies were on your mind by the time you are undergraduate of the University of Minnesota, what can you tell me about the influences in your whether at home or at school

31
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:40,150
And I just think you had mentors(导师) that led to this interest.

32
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,500
Well, thank you that a great question

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,120
I think I combine this by my father

34
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:58,470
So growing up every year, my father's pilots and my three sisters and my brother and the car, when we go to the Chicago Air & Water Show and watch the blue angels of thunder bird and watch all sort of the airplanes

35
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,280
My [..] about the time I was in fifth grade and beyond, the only gifts I wanted for Christmas on my birthday

36
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,680
were encyclopedia of military airplanes, so I've always been interested in flight

37
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,930
My father used to take me to go watch the warbirds land at the local airport when they do flyover in the air shows

38
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:26,890
And so I really inherited from him a lot of their planes and as I graduated high school went into the college, I knew I wanted to be an engineer.

39
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,380
And so I just put those two together and studying aircraft and flight and that sort of things

40
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,169
Now during your education

41
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,350
You also added in a masters in business administration

42
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm assuming that this is a clue to what you, kind of, have had in mind for the long haul visions, and what you want to do professionally.

43
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:54,633
As a young officer in the air force of managing relatively small programs, and I noticed my counterparts in industry, I was always interested in the technology

44
00:04:54,633 --> 00:05:00,000
But there are all these other concerns that had managed budgets that manage people they had worry about accounting

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,505
And so I actually wanted to understand that side of the business side of it of running a program

46
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:13,654
And so I started my MBA and found out I loved finance, I loved the accounting aspect. I study economics in my spare time.

47
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:28,449
Now, So I got into an initially understanding the other side of the table as I was managing in programs, and then turned out that I love that part of it as well, and I think it helped inform how I craft programs to the kind of understanding of what the contract

48
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,140
on my counterpart in industry has to deal with. Above and beyond just the technology challenges.

49
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:41,230
When I saw that you had the MBA degree, I was thinking, well, you know, that has got to be really helpful in your world in DARPA, because in sort of best

50
00:05:41,230 --> 00:06:03,684
I've got no program managers and what that role. I mean it is emitted is like you're running in a corporate energy of full fledged corporately, where the kinds of issues of just running businesses and staying on budget, and all of the logistics of that are particularly, it's not just finding people who do cool technology, but it's also managing all that

51
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:08,320
So the MBA just seems like a perfect addition to the technical training.

52
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:18,580
I think it is, and also thinks like market research and marketing now is one thing to, have a great idea, but to be able to sell it and get people excited about it and market research

53
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:26,273
understanding what else is going on and how you fit into a marketplace where there's a new weapon or a interesting piece technology.

54
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:31,102
To lose the type of things that I strive(努力) to learn, when I was in the UMS.

55
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:34,980
And I think I've tried to incorperate that background into my projects.

56
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,700
So now let's move to your DARPA adventure

57
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,240
And I always love to hear the how I got to double a story

58
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,540
I guess that of almost all of the program managers that have spoken with for this particle

59
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,560
So let me ask you mean that you seek out a job, a doctor, did someone a doctor seek

60
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,020
You will have to get here.

61
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,000
So little bit of boats

62
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,526
So when I returned from afghanistan in two thousand and nine, it spent ten months corner influences opposed the device work

63
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:05,971
We are feeling new technology with long hours with tiring

64
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:15,772
It was exciting, and it went back to my old job in the penalty after about a month and went to my boss and said, this job is a learn easier than I remember

65
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,339
Do you have anything tougher

66
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,824
And he just got a call from double looking for a deputy program manager, and so I set up an interview

67
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:26,390
And it turns out that David interviews there was a snowstorm

68
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,920
I have to leave six blocks away from DARPA at the time

69
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,180
So I watched six plus in a snowstorm to do an interview with the TTOoffice director

70
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:50,115
And at the time it was, I was in interviewer for, but I was excited, and so I ended up being a deputy program manager for two years at the DARPA of duty transition when the work's mother for assignments finished on my career

71
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:53,210
But from that point four, I knew that we want to come back

72
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:59,750
So I had the opportunity to reach, in a view as a civilian and get higher line in twenty seventeen after my first dynamic.

73
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,740
Thanks for letting me know about that entry and into the agency

74
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,930
Love the detail with the snowstorm

75
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,620
So in twenty seventeen, as you just said, you joined DARPA

76
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:19,790
Tactical technology of now, more than any office that offers developed technologies that move in a way around the ground and see in the air space

77
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,100
And in one of the now completed programs you work on

78
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,290
So let's talk about the past a little bit first before we talk about cream

79
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:41,288
You can't program that wants coffee adaptable later than aircraft program or ALTA, and it did get some attention at 2019 when people across the country war crawling their necks, it and reporting strange white dots high overhead

80
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:56,360
The agency posted on facebook in late june of that year, twenty one thousand nine hundred and three test balloons have been to navigate from eastern cross country beginning cabinet maryland, and then ended with safe landings in northern california

81
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:15,730
So can you prefer to explain the technology you need that altered was designed to meet and and tell me what you can't about what is achieved in the autumn, piling questions, and you are also interested what you were thinking when mere reports were coming in from around the country about these sightings

82
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:22,700
Weight, let's start actually with what the program you know, was about, and what technology needs, you would hope it would deliver

83
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,870
And then what is it sad is now?

84
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,800
Right to these variety of programming, I was, I was lucky enough to inherit that

85
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,790
So previous program manager has started that

86
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:40,193
And as what is the deputy for a few months and took their program over and what we are trying to do, there is doing a low cost strategic vehicle

87
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:47,706
So strategist theoretically, above sixty thousand feet, there are big advantages of you going to get a flying vehicle up there

88
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,970
Commercial airliners don't fly up there

89
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:56,340
And as he gave from sixty to seventy nine thousand feet, you get a good to view a lot of the earth from up there

90
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,820
So it, we call them suitor, satellites or suitor

91
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,000
late.

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,840
This, for context, were, were probably talking here eleven, twelve miles and above, right?

93
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,050
Absolutely, yes, until the air is very thin upturn it, you build

94
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:26,310
These are lighter than their vehicles, almost more like a spacecraft, and you do an aircraft is there is, I'm so for a low cost in the occasion, processing, navigation and timing and a low cost of surveillance platform that was very appealing to the military

95
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:35,890
So we, we did this program, and we actually did a test flight about a year before that that graduates, an exercise or full cross country for that flight

96
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,410
We flew out of utah smaller port enough

97
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:53,633
The volunteer going to laugh, and we are taking pictures, and we began to notice that the brand and we appear and disappear based on the song, and there are very large vehicles, hundreds of feet across, but they're very far away

98
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,066
So it's very disorienting

99
00:10:55,066 --> 00:11:03,390
And the copy engineers and I looked at each other and said, dramatically, think that you, so we sort of suspect those gonna happen

100
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,910
So we were very trying to be very forthcoming

101
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,840
We, we felt with the FA.

102
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,910
We did social media post thing we're gonna do

103
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,313
And the really, the only bet was how far across the country wouldn't get before the first you are so excited

104
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:21,446
I think we made it on the way that they know how before we get our first

105
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:31,990
You'll so, so that was fun, but we actually participate in with the army, and that we are ground units to communication exercises while we are gone over the us

106
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,333
And we are specific points we are navigating from a military technology

107
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:44,800
I think we demonstrate a very low cost, reactive way to sort of supplement satellites and build a local network on western world world

108
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,580
And you believe the flag constellation from one cotton it across

109
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,970
So I think we are very successful in, and I know about the army in the navy to have activities that are building on our success and.

110
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,410
Great, so some chance of early degree of transition to potential and universe users

111
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,100
That's always the trophy that dropped ones with its programs

112
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:14,640
I wanted to well out just a bit more, because there is one very cool aspect of the, the technology that just wanted to hear a little bit more about

113
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,420
That's just the navigation aspect, because of I recall one way that you achieve

114
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:31,970
Navigation is by changing the of the balloons in order to take advantage of a university of different air currents and conditions at different attitudes

115
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,260
And I write about that, and if so, just tell us a little bit more headache.

116
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:46,237
Yes, of the fundamental theory of why you can navigate with these balloons that the winds in the strategic fear are a very catholic and turbulent

117
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:48,552
And so winds going one direction

118
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:53,706
And at a few thousand fear bowler below, the letter began the other direction

119
00:12:53,706 --> 00:13:00,660
And so you know what they're doing, you can kind of you can change out to by moving, basically pumping air under the balloon

120
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,300
And it, you can make it go up or down

121
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,680
And we got zero mass because we are not actually changing

122
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,320
The massive vehicle were bringing iran or venting it off

123
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,290
And then the complementary piece of advantage where you want to know the windsor loft?

124
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:12,900
So we are

125
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:24,570
She also a windsor of sensor, that use a laser actually measures the molecule movement of the air at seventy five thousand feet above the

126
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,656
And to do that, we took a piece of technology that NASA demonstrated that way

127
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:36,828
About fifteen hundred pounds and research for dinner or table and shrunk it down to something about the size of a coffee can await fifty pounds

128
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:51,550
And we demonstrated a low power satellite thief, lazier to connect three measure wins at three, five thousand feet and above, and the direction that you wanted to figure out if you wanted to assign to send, depending which direction you want to go.

129
00:13:51,550 --> 00:14:01,531
Wow, it's amazing to think about the vehicle that says that can remove her up and down in the atmosphere column to take advantage of different wind conditions as they, it's really, truly amazing

130
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,501
Now, let's move onto another program

131
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:13,390
You had worked on this one that had the goal of delivering an aircraft prototype capable of vehicle that is worker takeoff and landing, like it has never been done before

132
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,160
Xander, what were you hoping to achieve this program?

133
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,906
Great question

134
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:40,074
So we actually had a program called vital eggs or lightning strike that was supposed to be a high speed vertical take off learning aircraft and by high speed three hundred and three hundred and fifty nine, which is about one hundred and fifty, if it is not faster than a helicopter or something like AVtwenty two top roller at the end of the day, that program ended up not going to fly

135
00:14:40,074 --> 00:15:13,798
We ran into the challenges with electoral higher proportion and an enlightener that actually got a lot of active investment in both commercial government said, I think we, we advanced it to allow you a fair amount of that program, but that's a, that's a great example of a program that didn't end up complaining international media machine, but we actually discovered where the technology needed to events, and we spend the and work with industry to, to push some of the generator technology and some of the, some of the underlying technology that would enable that kind of aircraft in the future

136
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:32,660
So, so we continue to work with folks and support the air force in their journey, prime and ever, but high speed fixed wing combines all the attributes like a helicopter, the efficiency of a traditional aircraft, and that's still something that there is altha to go do

137
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:42,530
And so we advanced some of the technology, but a legendary was still most of our configuration of what technologies have to mature before already for leaving capability.

138
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,100
Right, and you know what I love about your description

139
00:15:45,100 --> 00:16:11,520
There was that it really is touch upon one of the signature aspects of the DARPA model, which is to take on extremely challenging a technology problems with the hope, you know, that you actually will get to the technology, finish line the generation ahead of time, but also with the understanding that if you don't, you learn all along the way that there is a value to that, and that helps you point in the direction or point away from what others be

140
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,150
That is so that in the end, it helps to work in accelerate a technology vision to to a good finish line

141
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:27,830
Let me know there when on your current program, queen, control of revolutionary aircraft with novel effectives

142
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,080
In july, the agency and asked the first three words in the program

143
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,950
And I'm gonna, let you talk about what I think

144
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:44,040
In short, the idea is a ploy was called active flow control, such that one can seal an aircraft without the need of movable services

145
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,750
Tell us the story of the queen program, the problem, need or capability that you invasion it will address

146
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,180
And what is the set of the program?

147
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:02,324
When I was starting the cream program and installing it through my leadership, I used the example of an episode five versus award award aircraft

148
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:08,756
And I said he took an error in automatic engineer from one thousand nine hundred and forty and seventy five

149
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:19,732
He could do all the equations and tell you how to how far the move detail left, right, the rotters, how we control aeroplanes are not fundamentally changed in over one hundred years

150
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:26,180
Now that engineer from nineteen fourteen would have no idea how the challenge and work you were understand, right, are in their

151
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:36,298
But fundamentally, we are still designing airplanes the same way we did one hundred years ago, and that's by moving little bit of air foil open down or left and right, and that works pretty well

152
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,050
But what you find is from a design

153
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,178
It really limits your imagination

154
00:17:40,178 --> 00:18:10,400
And and so what we wanted to do with crane was take a technology in this case at the flow control, just basically blowing little bit of air over the wind as strategic locations, and that technology between the wire, but in wind tunnels and bring an academy for over thirty years, we wanted to create program that the aircraft designers to think differently and to work on the tools and the methodology to develop new and other ideas and give them the time space to do that

155
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,640
And so that's what we try to do on crane is, is really given the designers the freedom to think outside the box

156
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:26,370
And in one of the ways we did that, as we specifically said at the beginning of the program, don't come to us with an idea what they are planned look like

157
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:37,870
We've been the first year doing experiments doing when tunnels doing high power computing, we want to examine in dozens of different ideas, and then, as a group, decide what's the most compelling

158
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,961
Dama, what should the airplane look like

159
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,242
And I, that was unusual

160
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,906
I had a bit of my leadership to give me more time of friend

161
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:50,294
And I said, if we go slow in the beginning, we'll get in much better product, middle faster

162
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:50,550
the.

163
00:18:50,550 --> 00:19:06,720
Xander, so you are really just getting these programs momentum going, and it sounds like it said, the first years can be really gathering IDyes, then bring the teams together, performers together to think about what would be the good next steps it takes

164
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,120
But as you just sort of game out, the entire program is dramatically what you expect will happen, how to learn for.

165
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,400
Right, let us get a great question

166
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:48,831
So what about a year in the program that we're eleven months, and we've had three contractors who have started with over dozen different ideas and concepts of water prices should look like we have spent for last to eleven months doing winter and testing to on high park computing, building brand new tools, and in kind of working as a team to develop this new revolutionary concept of over the next month or so, we're going to start downstairs selecting to one or two ideas, and those who were going from what we are crawling, which we call face zero interface one

167
00:19:48,831 --> 00:20:02,150
And that is what will actually do the off the flying air vehicle will start doing, drawing your identify subsidies, and then you start to get an idea really of what is your look like, and what demonstrated

168
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,320
And the things were going to demonstrate us

169
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,600
We think, with this technology, we can make our plans to lighter

170
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:23,996
We can potentially do new interesting and manufacturers, and that we can be changed the way we design them and the way they look, but we can actually show improvements and weight and range and take off capability by thinking outside the box and applying this new technology

171
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,310
And so what will do that

172
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:30,112
And then, from there were plenty downstairs, single airplane, and they will do that detail

173
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:39,090
Design will start construction, and then in three to four years, we actually have flying prototype out of flying in demonstrating some these breathers.

174
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:48,854
Yeah, you know, this is also reminding me a little bit of hydrodynamics may be air dynamics in nature a little bit, you know of thinking of things like the like sharks

175
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:56,100
Can I do that has these little denticles, you know, which are all the best throwing eddie flows and turbulence in a sort of thing

176
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,990
It makes the shark much more efficient

177
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,660
Swimmer, biological analogies that some of your performers are bringing into the next.

178
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:11,230
Yeah, so that's really interesting, because that's one of the one of the things you find earlier on is early in aviation

179
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,022
We try to mimic birds

180
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:30,003
And it was until the right brother's basically broke out proportion suffered from lift that we are able to keep flight and then over the best hundred years where we found is that the projects, you know what they're doing, because they, they can very small changes to the wings, especially storing bird

181
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:32,352
We've ever watched hawker eagle

182
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,178
It are very slight changes

183
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:47,800
They can begin to great removals with very, and so we have actually got some concepts that sort of borrow, that idea that that, rather than brute force, you're using big pieces of metal moving up

184
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,296
But if you effectively just change the way the error appears, you'll make little changes

185
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,732
The error you can, you can remove

186
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,168
And what I call more elegant manner

187
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:18,880
And so it's go from where we started trying to mimic birds to actually getting back to worry about the technology that computing resources actually model how to do that, because it is much more challenging when you try to try to do that, anyone would think, but there are really energies to the way nature is above that the wrong and how actually be able to sort of.

188
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,619
Okay, just a couple of more questions, and then I will bring our discussion as it were in for lending

189
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,681
Forgive me with that

190
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:30,209
I'm asked to sort of imagining little, and they're forgiving me for that too

191
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:38,089
But several decades ago, and you're going to do, these are shows, and you probably screaming things like, well, that's cool to your dad

192
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:40,278
And now here you are a DARPA or manager

193
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:42,060
I'm in a seriously cool tech

194
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:52,410
She obviously thinks it could have some value in the context of defence, but in a serious idea of a new way of producing or creating navigation

195
00:22:52,410 --> 00:23:07,210
And but when you allow yourself to sort of imagine the coolest technologies that you dreamt about, even if they're not double related with what comes to mind, like what kind of error and article technologies have you dropped

196
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,590
You wish could be so, but not.

197
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,808
For me personally, the most exciting thing out there, the thing that we've all been promised are where our jet packs rate

198
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:26,820
And so we actually did a good approval, and we have a small business initiative to look at it will be called battlefield personal mobility

199
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:36,520
So the idea is, if I am a soldier, and I want to move five or ten miles is a way I can do that without being and point to point to the air

200
00:23:36,900 --> 00:24:05,409
And so we're gonna do several smaller words to look at some innovative things to include quiet paragraphers, personal level, helicopters and potentially some version of jet packs in a military context to say, if I need to move five or ten miles, can soldiers get off the road to get a get away from large vehicles and move around freely, so that sort of a really exciting thing and innocent technology

201
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:08,871
Let's just now emerging that might make that more practical

202
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,440
We got a lot of work

203
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,730
Batteries regard the rebecca is now quite capital or drowned

204
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:23,280
Yellow things can scale up, potentially to be something that men portable and transport, so still not there

205
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:31,520
But I think if you can do the personal mobility where you basically carry your own little vehicle and are able to move around five or ten miles

206
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,520
I think that it's a really exciting kind of opportunity to be.

207
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,970
Well, that gets it just well for me, because you know, the jet pack comes up even in a lot of correspondence with DARPA

208
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,740
But let's start like, okay, you can do it

209
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,710
You can do it

210
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,300
What about the jet pack

211
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:54,540
So as entrepreneur helping to deliver the jet pack, I think your name will go down quite well in the history of DARPA a party, the history of technology of general

212
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:00,545
So may you succeed in helping to deliver the jet pack, shifting direction just a bit

213
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:11,080
I'd like to ask you to reflect on your experience as a DARPA program manager in a place of darker, which is so notable in the overall innovation ecosystem

214
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:27,260
And this is kind of an interesting time to ask the question, because there is just tons and tons of discussion, both domestically and in other countries, about trying to emulate dolphin, whether it's an immune energy and intelligence, they are already even in the permanent transportation

215
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:33,180
There is a proposal now to create a transportation eccentric arab event research project agency

216
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:43,930
So I'm just wondering your opinion, what are some of the institutional and cultural characteristics of that you, we'll be most challenging for others to emulate, replicate.

217
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:55,490
I am working that I've had the opportunity or adopt work a couple of projects with foreign governments on funding nations who are talking about sending throne garbage

218
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:18,020
And they often ask the same elizabeth two things, at least that I've seen that are that are really enabling and motivating the first as poor managers, we know, are a short time when it, typically two to five years, we have to start a project in and get moving in and really do do exciting work

219
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,700
And then after that, we're going to be basically thinking, have to go find another job in a summer on comment

220
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:33,100
And so what that means is one you very motivated to take an idea or find it, and make sure you really ready to go, and you can execute in the time fashion

221
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,900
And the second thing is to more complicated project, and it's going to take a little blanker

222
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:50,095
You really are motivated to to make sure that it turns out footing because the person coming next week behind you to take that program over may not love it as much as you love it right to the gatsby is gonna be compelling and scattered

223
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:57,130
Besides a technically the method to release in the second, I think, enabled and seeing the DARPA it does is one out of free the face

224
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:04,526
Well, I was not afraid to basically stop program weight, weight through and say, you know what this was harder than we thought

225
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:10,130
Let's take a step back, and when I stop doing this, maybe think about a better way to do it

226
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,130
And I think we do that in TTOAfair amount of wealth, our big successes

227
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:34,035
And so we're willing to to invest in things that that we think are disruptive and wealth willing to take changes that mean that panel, and that's a lot easier said than done and being willing to fail, and knowing that you will be looked as a failure if the program runs in the technology issues that is success

228
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:37,150
That you've discovered a new technology, road work.

229
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:58,640
Thanks for sharing some of your insights and observations about the innovation culture at DARPA, especially like the way to describe the positive value of the agency EX from, you know, both delivering an original technology vision, but also from discovering road blocks that still must be overcome, you know, to reach the finish line

230
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,190
So very cool about that

231
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,580
And now, before we do close, I do monitor

232
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,590
Just we visit a little bit your air force korea before coming to durban

233
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,230
Can you share a little more about?

234
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,660
Sure, I was in your first officer for twenty two years, primarily engineering focused

235
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,830
I had a relevant opportunity as my first assignment

236
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,410
I was sent to the national air and space intelligence center

237
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,324
And where's a chinese fighter aircraft hour

238
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:52,500
So I got to look at four new aircraft and try to deduce their capabilities and have the opportunity as secondary tenant to attend the first error, chinese public aerial and nineteen ninety six, and that's received a deal that I let you know before I love their planes, and so I got it to look at four aircraft, and they move over and worked at one seventeen

239
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:02,320
B two has the opportunity to die during electronics when we lost in the first seventeen got to participate and figure out why that happened and how to avoid

240
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:31,648
Since that had the opportunity work on a lot of fixed rain aircraft, some special mission things, and one of the things I think, therefore, is really offered in an opportunity is, I got a new job every three or four years, and I got to take new challenges and work a variety of programs in a variety of the and try to take all of that background, knowledge and pilot into this four year to our doubt, to figure out what went well

241
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:37,549
It doesn't go well and where the gaps are capability, so had a great opportunity in their first day

242
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:45,912
They gave me a lot of opportunity every three or four years to get a brand new, challenging job, and that's when I think that exciting your bookstore poses, it's very similar

243
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:49,020
You got a very fixed window, you got a clear authorities

244
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,100
Did you take the backing of your boss near your total go

245
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,090
Do something amazing.

246
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,360
That would be a great conversation

247
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,030
You have taken my imagination or laughed

248
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,980
Thank you so much.

249
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,790
For sharing the time with me, or it's been a pleasure, and there's a few things in life

250
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:10,070
I like talking about more than my programs or my new baby girls

251
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,220
Thank you for the opportunity.

252
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:18,010
Well, the best of luck to you in your wife and raising this new life you brought into the world

253
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,440
And I also want to thank you listeners for learning us your ears

254
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,702
I hope you join us again for the next Voices from DARPA, thanks

255
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:44,550
Also, the time shortage for his partnership, introducing this program, for more information about alexander valley programs, he and his colleagues in the technical technology officer TTO, run in the many other way through technologies DARPA is working on visit, darpa.mil
