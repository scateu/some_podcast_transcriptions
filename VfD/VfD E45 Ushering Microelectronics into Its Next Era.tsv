EDL	00:00:13,580	00:00:19,540	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Still , technology , the internet GPS in the palm of your hand , are tonight with operation
EDL	00:00:22,450	00:00:24,770	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Technology is a driver of our times
EDL	00:00:24,770	00:00:40,639	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , doubt the defence advanced research projects agency has been a driver of welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto one of the country's most consequential places and cultures of innovation
EDL	00:00:40,639	00:00:45,520	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	My name is iphone a model in a mutual host in this episode of Voices from carbon
EDL	00:00:45,850	00:00:50,060	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The future of majority is most iconic technology micro electronics
EDL	00:00:53,860	00:01:02,472	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	In february nineteen fifty eight , by the queue of a department of defence directive in innovation , in the process of innovation itself was born
EDL	00:01:02,472	00:01:15,645	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	It was known as the advanced research project agency within the years , time two engineers won a taxi instruments in dallas and want a fair trial semiconductor , and would later be known as value independently implemented
EDL	00:01:15,645	00:01:31,897	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The words first integrated circuit , the age of micro electronics was about to be no electronic trips are everywhere in our lives , in the technologies that they enable help utterly transform the world and how we live in it , selling , that is your magical
EDL	00:01:31,897	00:01:40,320	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	That's a joint news for chief operating officer of the semiconductor industry , which furthers the interest of the two hundred billion dollars sector. 
EDL	00:01:40,830	00:01:46,490	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The technology is so excited in so sophisticated for nearly everybody
EDL	00:01:46,890	00:01:55,710	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	What chips do is magic is magic for most people technologically , but it's also what cheap to do in our it for our lives
EDL	00:01:55,710	00:02:06,500	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And just just a standing communications , we have say that the role chips playing in health care solutions and keeping us happy and healthy
EDL	00:02:06,500	00:02:18,910	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And and now , with the pandemic helping us learn remotely , helping us work remotely , it's really chips are really wonderful , the most awesome innovations. 
EDL	00:02:19,230	00:02:20,240	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Of mankind
EDL	00:02:20,910	00:02:41,452	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	But in recent years , several challenges have been converging , the threat with some jarring breaks on the evolution of semiconductor technology and the micro electronic stage is a set of challenges that poses risk for US, industry and national security , because , like the rest of society , the technology influenced landscape of defence is a thick with ships
EDL	00:02:41,452	00:02:57,993	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	That's why twenty seventeen darkness leaders and program managers and the agencies microsystem technology rolled out what , even by diaper standards , is an ambitious and far reaching research pursuit is called the electronic researchers initiative
EDL	00:02:57,993	00:03:08,700	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Year I for short , it's five year point five billion dollar portfolio of some thirty programs now involving many hundreds of researchers in laboratory throughout academy industry
EDL	00:03:10,800	00:03:15,013	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Microscopes ，the director of dark is microsystem technology
EDL	00:03:15,013	00:03:23,440	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Others want to make you understand what ERISabout , he says , is through the lens of one of the most principles of the electronics. 
EDL	00:03:23,810	00:03:31,230	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Let's talk about moral law , because it really is hard to have a discussion about the micro electronics without talking about more than more
EDL	00:03:31,230	00:03:47,980	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	In one thousand , nine hundred and sixty five , I think it was made a project , the number of transistors and a trip was going to double every year would have been doubling every year and would keep doubling for up some current time
EDL	00:03:47,980	00:03:52,390	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	I think we should learn that get changed to eighteen to twenty four months
EDL	00:03:52,390	00:03:55,020	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So there was some fine tuning of that argument
EDL	00:03:55,380	00:04:00,000	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And according to project how long that was going to be
EDL	00:04:00,000	00:04:11,462	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	He didn't actually talk about the technology that was making that be true , but sure enough , that has been true ever since then , and has been maintained for a very uncreative time
EDL	00:04:11,462	00:04:22,343	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	But the fundamental drivers for more or something called to emerging , which means that I am making transistor smaller and smaller all the time
EDL	00:04:22,343	00:04:53,570	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	People have known that for decades , literally decades , that this could not extend forever , the scale , in part , in any case , could make sense forever , because we get down to a point where you just reach atomic limits , you can't make things more and smaller because you get them down to essentially smallest as these structures can physically , there have been many , many other practical problems on the way , but we have more or less reached the point where these scaling limits are pregnant
EDL	00:04:53,570	00:04:54,280	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Fun of
EDL	00:04:54,280	00:04:57,580	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	We can do much better in terms of physical size
EDL	00:04:57,580	00:05:08,330	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Are they were doing now they iphone that I am recording this conversation on is using a five nine meter process
EDL	00:05:08,640	00:05:12,770	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Five , nine meters is a tens of them
EDL	00:05:13,410	00:05:16,300	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So I get down too much less than that
EDL	00:05:16,300	00:05:19,540	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And I know we can progress beyond that point
EDL	00:05:20,150	00:05:29,373	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So people are inevitably want to continue their own an appetite for electronics being better and better all the time
EDL	00:05:29,373	00:05:39,170	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	There is a general feeling that they'll be to satisfaction if we want to raise the fire and say , well , this is good as it won't be getting any better than. 
EDL	00:05:39,170	00:05:54,840	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	When denizens of dark here , something like we are reaching the end of the error in which more is locked and describe the rate of progressive semiconductor technology , they go something like , if that's what you think that what new ideas and capabilities do , we need to develop to transcend those limitations
EDL	00:05:55,480	00:05:56,960	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This is where the electronics were
EDL	00:05:56,960	00:06:04,010	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Surgeons in the shadow comes in russia points to four big enterprise trends that underlined the need for the initial. 
EDL	00:06:09,170	00:06:20,960	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	One is the electronics , micro electronics , and I use that turn broadly to include things like photographs and so forth
EDL	00:06:20,960	00:06:29,800	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Micro electronics is just becoming increasingly important to our road to the commercial road , and to the defence world
EDL	00:06:30,210	00:06:39,210	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	As an example , people like to talk about the difference between a really exceptional jet fighter that the defensive world might care about , and not so good
EDL	00:06:39,210	00:06:44,240	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	One is primarily determined by the electronics and nothing else
EDL	00:06:44,550	00:06:47,450	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So electronics become really , really important
EDL	00:06:50,730	00:07:00,000	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Second , big trend is driven by economies of scale , the number of places in which one actually manufactured
EDL	00:07:00,000	00:07:03,508	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So I tried to the founder user code tips going down
EDL	00:07:03,508	00:07:09,022	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	There used to be dozens , and what the passage of time is become smaller and smaller
EDL	00:07:09,022	00:07:14,787	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And now we reach the point of world wide , you can easily count on your fingers
EDL	00:07:14,787	00:07:23,060	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	On one hand , the number of state of the art foundations that pulls the financial node , silicon devices in world
EDL	00:07:23,360	00:07:27,120	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And the problem with that is not just the thrill and fuel of them
EDL	00:07:27,120	00:07:31,070	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The problem is that many of these have moved off shore
EDL	00:07:31,670	00:07:37,950	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	so the united states has concerned over where is where this really important track, 就是给他看房。
EDL	00:07:43,640	00:08:11,610	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The third thing is that there is increasing , and if it kills with the foreign supply , there is this concern about hardware security , just as there is in the software world , there is concerned and hard when you design and build and distribute a product in electronics , the thing that is fabricated may not be exactly what you thought of words
EDL	00:08:12,390	00:08:28,020	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So there are other ways in which there there are potential vulnerabilities that happen anywhere from the design stepped through hollywood sustainment , which means you have to live what tracks you , you build sometimes for decades
EDL	00:08:28,700	00:08:53,720	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	so all of these concerns have increased good time 灯，and then the fourth and final issue is as well , trying to become more important , and as it becomes smaller and as there are more transistors than everything we depend , the process of designing those circuits has gone to be incredibly expensive
EDL	00:08:54,240	00:09:03,090	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And so this is one of these problems that is built on success as we make things better and better
EDL	00:09:03,410	00:09:05,100	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	We make them more more complex
EDL	00:09:05,570	00:09:08,520	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And that complexity is killing us from our cost and employee
EDL	00:09:09,070	00:09:11,030	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So how do you get around that
EDL	00:09:11,030	00:09:29,410	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So these four things together are really the entrepreneurs which rolled up to think about the existence of an effort which eventually became called the transfer surgeons initial to to focus on these kinds of problems and see what we could from a technology standpoint
EDL	00:09:29,410	00:09:34,130	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	What option is we could build help making province in these areas that I mention
EDL	00:09:34,560	00:09:40,280	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Raymond , twenty , seventeen , was the initiation by twenty eighteen
EDL	00:09:40,280	00:09:44,190	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	We were talking about europe in a third planned way
EDL	00:09:44,190	00:09:51,250	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	In fact , the first funding from government happened in the dedicated , fundamentally nineteen
EDL	00:09:51,250	00:09:54,689	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So here we are today , we propose to five year plan
EDL	00:09:54,689	00:09:58,128	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So here we are today getting to be more than that
EDL	00:09:58,128	00:10:00,000	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Well , definitely more than that
EDL	00:10:00,000	00:10:04,620	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Half way through that plane , more like sixty seventy percent of the way. 
EDL	00:10:05,550	00:10:17,850	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	All of these concerns have been simmering for many years , but with the specific year of twenty seventeen in which dark , committed to taking on an orange journey as huge as ERIIasked mark if there was a catalogue factor
EDL	00:10:18,270	00:10:27,197	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	He pointed to report by peaker , the president's council advisers for science , and which is part of the white house office of science and technology policy
EDL	00:10:27,197	00:10:30,430	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	He said the report underscore the vulnerability he just mentioned. 
EDL	00:10:30,430	00:10:39,631	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Many of these things have been developed over year's decades , even the trend , for example , to fewer and fewer founderies
EDL	00:10:39,631	00:10:44,610	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	You can go back to the eighties , and people were already concerned about
EDL	00:10:44,960	00:10:57,690	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	But there's a difference between saying we have fifty or seventy five thousand reason for not careful in ten years that we might have only have , as many britain will put down to five
EDL	00:10:57,690	00:11:00,030	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And it looks like we're gonna be down to
EDL	00:11:00,030	00:11:07,060	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	He said , in others , a moment at which these things finally become aware to a broader community
EDL	00:11:07,580	00:11:12,860	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And IPKSreport in twenty seventeen was the defining moment for that day. 
EDL	00:11:13,370	00:11:25,150	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So you arrive thirty plus programs in its portfolio , hundreds of scientists and engineers at work a five year time course , now into its fourth year , a billion and half dollar
EDL	00:11:25,150	00:11:29,147	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And spoiler alert , syria's talk now open europe two point
EDL	00:11:29,147	00:11:31,013	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Oh , first things first
EDL	00:11:31,013	00:11:34,744	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So what is the electronics research initiative
EDL	00:11:34,744	00:11:38,557	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And just what is there's very much to tell in a short part case
EDL	00:11:38,557	00:11:44,930	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	But there are a half dozen technology seems among europe's economic super thirty plus programs
EDL	00:11:44,930	00:11:45,910	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Again , mark rusk. 
EDL	00:11:45,910	00:11:49,880	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So a couple of these themes are about , how do you process information
EDL	00:11:50,320	00:12:01,170	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	How do you compute , in particular , because we are very focused , dropper and an empty on what's called it applications
EDL	00:12:01,510	00:12:08,980	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So things that are happening maybe far , far away from a data , senior things that are happening
EDL	00:12:08,980	00:12:13,370	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The soldier discount might hold in a draft and might hold in their hand
EDL	00:12:13,690	00:12:15,560	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	These things are very important to us
EDL	00:12:15,900	00:12:22,550	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So two of the areas are increasing information processing , dancing efficiency
EDL	00:12:22,550	00:12:29,730	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	That means , can I make computers that are more efficient than process information and do it with much , much less power
EDL	00:12:30,580	00:12:32,590	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	That's really what we mean by efficiency
EDL	00:12:32,590	00:12:41,200	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And in the second area has just runs , particularly even since twenty seventeen , that's making decisions at the edge faster
EDL	00:12:41,650	00:12:43,940	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So think of that is being hard
EDL	00:12:43,940	00:12:54,990	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	You employ artificial intelligence , technologists , prices , information to competitions , but to actually read a decision about about what to go do
EDL	00:12:55,460	00:13:18,820	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	But again , on the context of something that's going that where you are going to do quiet at a data center , miles miles away , but you're going to have to make that decision for going the other big group of programs are three of my kind of agricultural together , and they have to do with , how do you do microsoft and immigration
EDL	00:13:18,820	00:13:21,830	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So how do you build olympics
EDL	00:13:21,830	00:13:28,310	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This is really becoming important , and it's where some of the most exciting ideas in what trunks are happening right now
EDL	00:13:28,730	00:13:38,530	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The first of these three years is about a complete change that happening where we are going from two dimensional or dress
EDL	00:13:38,530	00:13:43,770	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The wavelength dies , you know , in the greatest circuits live on two dimensions to three dimensions
EDL	00:13:44,100	00:14:19,950	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This is driven by the fact that we're reaching limits , having to do with inner to report and moving data from one silicon transistor to the next , and the only real way around that problem is to go from the two dimensional , three dimensional world , where there are many , many more internets , which kind of leads to the second area , which is okay and mention this , we have the tremendous problem with design we have been on circuits with billions of transistors , literally buildings of transistors
EDL	00:14:19,950	00:14:23,748	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	How do you design the circuit with billions of transistors
EDL	00:14:23,748	00:14:26,206	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And if I make it three dimensional
EDL	00:14:26,206	00:14:28,887	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Oh , my god , that's going to make it worse
EDL	00:14:28,887	00:14:32,910	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So how are you going to deal with the new ways of doing our trucks
EDL	00:14:32,910	00:14:46,350	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And then the surgery , which mean I be obvious as being part of this , but we think of it as part of it , is this other area that I talked about for hardware security if I design something , and then I go build it
EDL	00:14:46,350	00:14:49,610	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Maybe I fit , maybe I assemble it in some fashion
EDL	00:14:50,000	00:14:54,610	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	I want to make sure that does exactly what I decided to do , nothing more , nothing less
EDL	00:14:54,610	00:14:55,610	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So how do that
EDL	00:14:55,920	00:14:59,260	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And how do you make sure that every stage of this process is secure
EDL	00:15:00,000	00:15:04,196	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Those three areas are connected with microsystems and aggression
EDL	00:15:04,196	00:15:19,196	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And there is one more areas we care about specific examples of microsystem applications there are emerging , and there is probably no single one that's more important to us right now as a country , what are you then
EDL	00:15:19,196	00:15:22,680	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The revolution is going on in communications
EDL	00:15:22,680	00:15:38,690	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	You might say five g but dark attention , think about sixty and seventy , not changing necessarily the next wave of cell phone community , but the wave after that , or even two after that
EDL	00:15:38,690	00:15:45,460	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So all of these things are really the six areas have been the focus of what we work on in the era. 
EDL	00:15:46,020	00:15:53,520	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Just the names of a few ERIprograms , along with their sometimes vincible acronyms , suggest the complexity of the task
EDL	00:15:53,520	00:16:13,960	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Here's when technologies for mixed mode , auto scale , integrated circuits or tea music , that's the program that is on the challenges of designing and making chips that could receive since modify management , otherwise engage the wide range of sensor command , control and other electronic magnetic signals , without which military operations would not be possible
EDL	00:16:14,310	00:16:18,870	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Here is another for tonight in the package for extreme scalability or the paper program
EDL	00:16:19,190	00:16:21,860	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This one is all about integrating for tonight components
EDL	00:16:21,860	00:16:31,740	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Resigning a data managing devices that use full towns instead of electrons into microsystems to push performance gains beyond what's possible with electronic components alone
EDL	00:16:31,740	00:16:50,240	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Here is another this once notice the lifelong learning machines , if successful , this program will deliver new artificial intelligence , chip architectures and machine learning techniques that will underlie systems that can let people learn continuously and increasingly expert while performing tasks such as driving cars and doing science
EDL	00:16:50,860	00:16:55,490	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Who's one of my favorites , partly because it's acronym thief , sounds like dark side
EDL	00:16:55,490	00:16:57,020	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Billions of the star wars
EDL	00:16:57,480	00:17:01,677	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This is short for system security , international , greater to hardware and firm
EDL	00:17:01,677	00:17:11,890	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Well , it's an ERIprogram that focuses on security and defence against hackers by developing new hardware architectures that are inherently amusing to software based tax
EDL	00:17:11,890	00:17:14,550	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Okay , let me imagine just one more eye program
EDL	00:17:15,120	00:17:19,370	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This is called medicines , which stands for a millimeter wave digital rays
EDL	00:17:19,860	00:17:27,446	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This one is all about a race of electrical , tiny , tiny and tennis to be more specific that can operate at super duper high frequencies
EDL	00:17:27,446	00:17:48,418	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This is a sort of technology that is likely to become the basis of the sixty and seventh generation of communications device that will follow the current new generation of five g the arrives , just the latest expression of drug has lifelong coevolution with semiconductor science and technology
EDL	00:17:48,418	00:17:50,902	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Semiconductor industry associations
EDL	00:17:50,902	00:18:00,140	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	John knew for chronicles some of the touch , and explains why government industry partnerships are , must have components of the innovation ecosystem , not just nice to have component. 
EDL	00:18:00,140	00:18:13,600	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Our industry is is firstly competitive , and at that , at least the authorities of great innovation breaks through the competition could creates environment where you can be innovative
EDL	00:18:14,160	00:18:22,060	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	But for the most basic kinds of precompetitive research , it is very hard for companies to collaborate
EDL	00:18:22,400	00:18:37,356	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	First of all , it can be widely expensive , but we need to have a place where we can come together as competitors to find these new basic innovations to to make these new basic innovations
EDL	00:18:37,356	00:18:45,330	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And double has a long history of collaborating with with our industry , industry guard to get new breakthroughs
EDL	00:18:45,330	00:18:53,770	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	A dark of funded contract to the narratives enabled scientists at leading universities to research the new transistor design known. 
EDL	00:18:54,130	00:19:10,010	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Thin fat short for a fin field effect transistor that refers to a transformative transition design that enabled manufacturers to add complexity and density to circuits by building transistors vertically up from the otherwise player geometric wafers and chips and ships. 
EDL	00:19:10,010	00:19:13,695	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Without this break through , our industry would assault them
EDL	00:19:13,695	00:19:18,072	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	We would not be where we are today , terms of cheap innovation
EDL	00:19:18,072	00:19:42,890	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Then there's subsequent white band gap , some big documentaries developed by duty DARPA in collaborates with industry , helped to a rapidly events gain technology into an industrial relevant when it is now a part of all major , or if the semiconductor device manufacturer portfolios and is a market where the us is. 
EDL	00:19:42,890	00:19:56,346	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Dominate GAN GAN that stands for gallian night , which is a semiconductor like silicon , but in which electrons can be made to move faster into emit higher frequency and higher power electronic magnetic waves
EDL	00:19:56,346	00:20:07,840	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	These are the source of basic physical properties that , for one thing about us , electronic warfare technology to effectively see further and generator proves more effectively than can advertise the. 
EDL	00:20:07,840	00:20:25,415	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And in in there is this gallery at last night , transistor innovation driven by it doubt and industry in the nineteen eighties , getting out outside transistors enabled hand held phones to establish the critical communication links to cell phone towers
EDL	00:20:25,415	00:20:32,148	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And at least three most cellphones contained a small piece of that technology to perform this circumstances
EDL	00:20:32,148	00:20:49,080	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So , in addition to fostering investments in technology use for national security , the ripple effect from these kinds of research had been felt across the foreign summer doctor applications , and will continue to do so with the communications , health care
EDL	00:20:49,080	00:20:53,270	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Transfersfederal quantum five p in. 
EDL	00:20:54,690	00:21:06,153	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Even though many dark european advances have made their way into civilian technology , the programs that lead to them are designed to strengthen us defense capabilities , the d and darker stands with defence
EDL	00:21:06,153	00:21:07,851	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Jim levels are much decorated
EDL	00:21:07,851	00:21:17,321	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Chief engineer for advanced electronic strategy as the defence technology has contributed to the evolution of electronics in both defence in civilian applications
EDL	00:21:17,321	00:21:32,760	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Prior to his lucky to work , he spent twenty six years beginning a nineteen eighty one with IBM with background that libs has a privileged porch for determining the electronics challenges that the civilian and defense secretary share , and the challenges that are specific applications. 
EDL	00:21:32,760	00:21:42,830	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The defence industrial base has unique regulatory challenges that the current , the commercial sector really does not have right that the two sectors are very different business models
EDL	00:21:43,630	00:21:52,236	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The commercial sector is very market driven , with a large demand driven by projects that are ultimately purchased by consumers
EDL	00:21:52,236	00:21:55,520	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Think about laptops and tablets and smartphones
EDL	00:21:56,310	00:22:11,050	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The defence sector is very mission driven , providing that national security with systems and platforms operating at harsh environments in every domain , an air and sea space , land and cyber
EDL	00:22:11,050	00:22:24,290	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So this leads to unique challenges and concerns about the performance , the availability , the trustworthy is any affordability of the electronic our defence systems rely on. 
EDL	00:22:24,290	00:22:31,880	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	In the course of his work , labor's two has had some touch points with darker , the latest one involving the electronics researchers in. 
EDL	00:22:31,880	00:22:51,880	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	More than ever , a strong domestic marketing , australia's industrial base is really critical to national security , and we will know the dark has long history farm , successfully addressing these challenges in the american electronics area , the benefit negatively security , but also the critical sector
EDL	00:22:51,880	00:23:12,330	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	You know , this certainly LED to significant advancements during the first three waves of popular chinese innovation over the last three years later the year , but based on the current challenges that we've been facing , droppers air programs are really leading the way in addressing those challenges to both technical and economic
EDL	00:23:13,130	00:23:18,090	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And this is really leading the way into the fourth wavelengths innovation
EDL	00:23:18,090	00:23:22,850	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So europe , advancing democratic transparency that we all need in the future , right
EDL	00:23:22,850	00:23:29,650	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So you think about new microsystems design and micro system , me , new materials and new architectures
EDL	00:23:30,270	00:23:31,840	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And he helped the real focus
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,490	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Here is on systems in application
EDL	00:23:33,490	00:23:37,190	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	It's not just on based technology and advice scaling
EDL	00:23:37,660	00:23:43,630	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	It's about what are the future systems in what are the applications across the whole technology
EDL	00:23:44,330	00:23:57,940	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So in our european programs have really made significant contributions to the electronics needs of the defence industry , and certainly leveraging a significant commercial investments in advance micronics
EDL	00:23:58,320	00:24:03,264	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So overall , the impact to the defense industrial base has really been significant
EDL	00:24:03,264	00:24:23,692	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Right , we continue to transition these capabilities developed under europe in our programs to address our challenges , and to also deliver rapid cutting edge in a solution that what really makes this so successful is the public private partnership model that they have created right to do
EDL	00:24:23,692	00:24:30,030	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	It brings together the commercial sector , the defense industrial base , university researchers
EDL	00:24:30,030	00:24:35,810	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And , of course , you know , the duty to dress all these challenges , and our researchers are fully engaged. 
EDL	00:24:36,220	00:24:46,800	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	It's injured as DNA to be full end of the programs that currently runs , while also looking down the road to identify what's next , microsystem technology of structure , mark rescue. 
EDL	00:24:47,230	00:25:00,690	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	We are recognizing that europe ends about the twenty two times from , and we would like to continue to develop cutting edge ideas , new ideas beyond that point
EDL	00:25:00,690	00:25:10,000	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So the effort that we're proposing and developing what we call here , I took me now , and it really is in a couple of different directions
EDL	00:25:10,000	00:25:13,663	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	We're asking ourselves from a racist standpoint
EDL	00:25:13,663	00:25:29,180	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	What are the areas that were not doing now that are emerging , maybe have a marginal australia for years as critical areas that we should , one of those is thinking about new ways of manufacturing of electronics
EDL	00:25:29,180	00:25:46,660	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And what , ultimately , I think we're interested in thinking about it is in these then three dimensional circuits that we think will be the center of the fourth wave of electronics
EDL	00:25:46,660	00:25:47,560	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	How do you? 
EDL	00:25:48,210	00:26:04,730	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Waska thinks of the morale advances in semiconductor manufacturing as having unfolded in three waves , with a fourth one on its way , the first wave called geometric scaling , was all about making transit stories every smaller and packing them ever more densely that lasted until late nineteen eighties
EDL	00:26:04,730	00:26:19,360	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	That's when the second way of the scaling on the way that one focus on overcoming the challenges of interconnecting , all of these individual microscopic devices into every more capable and processors by the early years of the new millennium , the individual flood were played
EDL	00:26:19,360	00:26:24,560	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Transistors on chips were getting vastly small , down to tens of atoms across
EDL	00:26:24,560	00:26:31,473	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This meant that the transistors were reaching the edge of my noodles , beyond which they could no longer reliably behave
EDL	00:26:31,473	00:26:37,421	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Is gates that allow or block electronic flow in the context of digital , this meant a transistor of these
EDL	00:26:37,421	00:26:44,192	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	My new sizes could suddenly shift from representing a zero to a one that is where the third way of a scaling comes in
EDL	00:26:44,192	00:26:46,450	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This one marked by those three dimensional
EDL	00:26:46,890	00:26:49,650	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Now comes that fourth wave , the one that ear eye is all about
EDL	00:26:50,310	00:26:51,800	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	One thing is for sure , says risk
EDL	00:26:52,140	00:26:54,500	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This will not be business as usual when it comes to many. 
EDL	00:27:00,000	00:27:09,746	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	They're going to be built in entirely different ways , and they may not be manufactured quite as much as assembled
EDL	00:27:09,746	00:27:11,813	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So how do you compose them
EDL	00:27:11,813	00:27:15,300	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	How do you assemble , and how do you enter connect them
EDL	00:27:15,660	00:27:34,190	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So what really interesting ideas have been developed recently , and things like pretty printing and edited manufacture , and those things leaders towards building electronics and electronic systems in entirely different ways from
EDL	00:27:34,190	00:27:46,080	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	But we're doing now certainly different , but also , maybe , maybe much higher capabilities when viewers in terms of things like the interconnect volumes by intense list
EDL	00:27:46,850	00:27:58,850	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So that's wondering a second area that I think is captured our attention as of late , is thinking more about electronics that live sort of in each environments
EDL	00:27:58,850	00:28:01,472	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Would you think of is harsh environments
EDL	00:28:01,472	00:28:09,674	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	The most obvious one is space , the electronics that is produced for yourself on , for example , doesn't do very well in a space environment
EDL	00:28:09,674	00:28:16,180	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Space applications are becoming more , more precautions for both commercial and government needs
EDL	00:28:16,180	00:28:23,290	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	This will become more , more of an issue , but as such as radiation and space , it's also things like high temperature
EDL	00:28:23,290	00:28:35,007	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So you are , again , australia's generally does not operate both paradigm districts , just point one number , but there are many applications that we care about
EDL	00:28:35,007	00:28:37,342	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	That would benefit from our tracks
EDL	00:28:37,342	00:28:38,640	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	That was much more about
EDL	00:28:39,570	00:28:45,960	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So those are areas that at least provide examples of the kinds of things that we would like to be looking at an era 。
EDL	00:28:45,960	00:29:03,680	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Two point out , there is an entire other dimension that I wanted to mention as well , and that is prototyping and really coming up with new ways in which we can move very rapidly from invention to production
EDL	00:29:04,110	00:29:17,950	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And I think it goes very well with the steam of three day , had a genius migration because building the infrastructure , building the circuits is increasingly difficult
EDL	00:29:17,950	00:29:33,091	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	So if you are coming , as we're coming up with new manufacturing process , we would like to be able to explore those manufacturing processes to build systems quickly and invest in which are much more successful
EDL	00:29:33,091	00:29:44,330	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Then perhaps it is possible today , taking on that responsibility of setting up an infrastructure to do that is something we're giving a very hard look at , right. 
EDL	00:29:44,330	00:29:55,330	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	John , due for the semiconductor industry association for one , is optimistic that even if more slow appears out , the kind of RNDthat ERIis supporting will keep advance is going a place. 
EDL	00:29:55,670	00:30:00,030	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And well , in a morse log in summer , guards may be running its course
EDL	00:30:00,030	00:30:08,740	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	I am confident that the new , you know , bring through its new architectures , new design , new materials will be able to continue to look forward
EDL	00:30:08,740	00:30:16,650	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	And NSYERIis so important because it's focused on all these new exercise when it comes to architectural design materials. 
EDL	00:30:16,650	00:30:23,811	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	We all know first hand how much micro electronic technology has changed the world over the last six years
EDL	00:30:23,811	00:30:25,090	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	It is transformed
EDL	00:30:25,090	00:30:37,510	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Socialists , have we do business , how we play , how we fight wars , the current global shortages in electronics supply chain is showcasing the centrality of this technology to our lives
EDL	00:30:37,890	00:30:56,570	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	Japan has called evil with micro electronics technology , with its electronics researchers initiative and its followed european , european less , and to take the micro electronics miracle into a new and more expensive , thanks listeners for sharing this time with me
EDL	00:30:56,570	00:31:20,440	| VfD E45 Ushering Microelectronics into Its Next Era |	I hope you join us again for the next Voices from drug , thanks also to TOM shortage for his partnership and producing this problem for more information about the electronics with surgeons initiative , the agencies , microsystem technology , others , as well as all the group , is other projects visit to know and for links that enabled you to download this podcast
