EDL	00:00:25,833	00:00:27,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
EDL	00:00:28,375	00:00:30,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:30,666	00:00:33,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA
EDL	00:00:33,000	00:00:36,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A window on to DARPA's core of program managers
EDL	00:00:36,041	00:00:37,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Their job ...
EDL	00:00:37,583	00:00:39,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To redefine what is possible

EDL	00:00:39,625	00:00:42,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host
EDL	00:00:42,458	00:00:45,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio Carrie Bernstein
EDL	00:00:45,791	00:00:48,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A program manager since 2012
EDL	00:00:48,083	00:00:52,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In DARPA's Micro Systems Technology Office

EDL	00:00:52,166	00:00:58,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	among the agency 6 technical offices that is devoted to doing more with electrons photons and electromagnetism
EDL	00:00:58,583	00:01:00,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's been possible in the history of technology

EDL	00:01:01,666	00:01:05,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Carry's curiosity and Science and Technology knows no bounds
EDL	00:01:05,250	00:01:10,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	What is background in the micro lectronics industry has everything to do with a mission he has taken on a DARPA
EDL	00:01:11,125	00:01:12,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	More than anyone
EDL	00:01:12,416	00:01:15,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	He's been pushing Technologies to reduce or even eliminate
EDL	00:01:16,250	00:01:21,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The vulnerabilities to are billions of micro Electronics chips to things like hacking counterfeiting cloning
EDL	00:01:22,375	00:01:27,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Tampering and other nefarious actions that are just no good at all for National Security
EDL	00:01:28,541	00:01:29,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Prior coming to DARPA
EDL	00:01:29,833	00:01:31,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Carry, an electrical engineer by training
EDL	00:01:32,375	00:01:38,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Like more than 30 years at IBM where he worked on a dizzying array of technical subjects including 
EDL	00:01:38,791	00:01:40,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Microprocessor circuit design
EDL	00:01:40,583	00:01:44,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	High-performance Low-power Devices Circuits and Architectures
EDL	00:01:44,416	00:01:50,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	New technologies that could replace the basic logic switches that underlie almost all of chips today
EDL	00:01:50,291	00:01:55,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Three-Dimensional chip integration and the ways radiation can damage chips
EDL	00:01:55,166	00:01:56,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Carry has co-authored
EDL	00:01:56,458	00:02:00,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Text books on circuit design, he holds 155 patents
EDL	00:02:00,541	00:02:01,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And is a fellow of the
EDL	00:02:01,541	00:02:03,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Institute of electrical and electronics engineers

EDL	00:02:04,375	00:02:06,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Carry, It's my pleasure to have you in the studio today
EDL	00:02:06,916	00:02:07,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That's really mine, Thanks.

* Origin

EDL	00:02:08,458	00:02:14,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I'm always fascinated by the way people get interested in science and technology if there was some transformative moment or
EDL	00:02:14,625	00:02:17,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Key person in your life that pointed you in that direction
EDL	00:02:18,208	00:02:19,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Ivan it's sort of an ax
EDL	00:02:19,458	00:02:21,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And if one of the most fortunate.
EDL	00:02:21,791	00:02:22,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Accidents I've ever known
EDL	00:02:23,041	00:02:24,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So you can it's a little kid I was always
EDL	00:02:25,125	00:02:26,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Very interested in astronomy
EDL	00:02:27,416	00:02:27,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Astrophysics
EDL	00:02:28,458	00:02:30,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And God bless my daddy
EDL	00:02:30,750	00:02:32,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	He didn't understand any of the lecture
EDL	00:02:32,541	00:02:34,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But I'd identify famous astronomers

EDL	00:02:34,833	00:02:35,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Who's coming to
EDL	00:02:35,625	00:02:39,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Lecture at the University Chicago or University of Illinois and he would take

EDL	00:02:39,458	00:02:39,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Was Wonderful
EDL	00:02:41,000	00:02:41,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And uh...

EDL	00:02:42,250	00:02:44,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I went to college anticipating, I would study astrophysics

EDL	00:02:45,583	00:02:46,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Astronomy
EDL	00:02:46,625	00:02:47,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And

EDL	00:02:47,375	00:02:49,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I come from a family of fairly modest means
EDL	00:02:49,666	00:02:51,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And it became very apparent that
EDL	00:02:51,208	00:02:52,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I needed to
EDL	00:02:52,000	00:02:53,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Be able to pick up my college cost

EDL	00:02:54,291	00:02:55,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:02:55,041	00:02:59,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Astronomers and astro physicist just were not in real high demand at the time  

EDL	00:02:59,416	00:03:00,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So I looked around in my credits
EDL	00:03:00,958	00:03:01,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And apply to 
EDL	00:03:01,958	00:03:03,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To electrical engineering
EDL	00:03:03,500	00:03:04,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And a normal physics

EDL	00:03:04,791	00:03:06,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The night embarked(从事) on a career of engineering
EDL	00:03:07,083	00:03:08,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And was the most wonderful accident I've ever made

* Q:

EDL	00:03:09,666	00:03:13,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Let's talk about that move you made that pivot into electrical
EDL	00:03:14,000	00:03:20,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And really electronic engineering as it turned out right so you can cuz you ended up going to IBM one of the most storyed
EDL	00:03:20,416	00:03:25,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	companies and organizations when it comes to certain the entire history of micro-electronics
EDL	00:03:25,250	00:03:30,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I just would be interested in hearing about the numerous hats that you did wear there and
EDL	00:03:31,166	00:03:33,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	kind of, what you learned about that technology

EDL	00:03:33,458	00:03:34,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Timing is so much
EDL	00:03:34,750	00:03:37,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And at the time that I graduated college
EDL	00:03:38,583	00:03:41,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The technology that we use in current, uh, computing
EDL	00:03:41,666	00:03:42,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	CMOS
EDL	00:03:42,666	00:03:45,850	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Was just in its infancy and just for listeners who might not know 
EDL	00:03:45,850	00:03:49,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	that that's such a familiar term if you're in that micro electronic
EDL	00:03:49,083	00:03:50,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	world the CMOS stands for what, Carry?

** CMOS joke
EDL	00:03:50,875	00:03:51,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I've always wondered
EDL	00:03:52,666	00:03:56,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	CMOS stands for complementary
EDL	00:03:56,500	00:03:58,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Metal-oxide-semiconductor
EDL	00:03:58,291	00:04:00,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And this is this is sort of that the work
EDL	00:04:00,333	00:04:06,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	horse technology that underlies pretty much any chip that any of our listeners might have in their computers were were
EDL	00:04:06,750	00:04:07,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is there a predominant(主要的)
EDL	00:04:08,791	00:04:10,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	[...]
EDL	00:04:10,083	00:04:11,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	CMOS
EDL	00:04:11,083	00:04:12,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Field-effect transistors
EDL	00:04:12,875	00:04:14,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	was the technology called bipolar(双极性)
EDL	00:04:14,916	00:04:17,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The bipolar was very power-hungry
EDL	00:04:17,250	00:04:19,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the power was really limiting
EDL	00:04:19,291	00:04:19,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	How much you could do with it.

EDL	00:04:20,291	00:04:23,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So when I first entered the space
EDL	00:04:23,625	00:04:24,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	CMOS was just starting out
EDL	00:04:25,666	00:04:27,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I had the great fortune of
EDL	00:04:28,250	00:04:29,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Joining IBM
EDL	00:04:29,541	00:04:32,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And IBM was leading the field in the development of
EDL	00:04:33,875	00:04:34,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Processes
EDL	00:04:34,916	00:04:36,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Circuit design
EDL	00:04:36,166	00:04:37,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Architecture
EDL	00:04:37,458	00:04:39,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For truly high performance computing
EDL	00:04:39,750	00:04:41,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's over a career of 30 years
EDL	00:04:42,333	00:04:43,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I enjoyed this
EDL	00:04:43,875	00:04:45,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	This incredible ride
EDL	00:04:45,416	00:04:48,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Bringing through new materials new applications
EDL	00:04:48,208	00:04:51,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Producing the technology that went into machines that we used to play chess
EDL	00:04:52,291	00:04:53,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Play Jeopardy
EDL	00:04:53,333	00:04:54,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Quite a ride

EDL	00:04:54,625	00:04:57,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's two things about your experience there that fast they make
EDL	00:04:57,958	00:05:01,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	One is that you became part of that IBM team
EDL	00:05:01,541	00:05:07,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	With a bachelor's in electrical engineering right this was from Washington University in St. Louis and then you've got several

** Don't even have a masters 学历

EDL	00:05:07,916	00:05:12,572	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Ph.Ds worth of education while you were there because you don't have a Ph.D here. 
EDL	00:05:12,572	00:05:14,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Ivan I don't even have a masters
EDL	00:05:14,333	00:05:15,636	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Don't even have a masters. 
EDL	00:05:15,636	00:05:20,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	but when I see you in actions, oh my gosh, right, it didn't clearly you got everything that that any of them
EDL	00:05:20,708	00:05:22,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	hyper-educated people here have
EDL	00:05:22,500	00:05:23,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	but you learned it
EDL	00:05:23,791	00:05:25,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Kind of in-situ you in the in the industry

EDL	00:05:26,375	00:05:27,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It was ...
EDL	00:05:27,125	00:05:28,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A matter of luck
EDL	00:05:29,166	00:05:29,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	that
EDL	00:05:30,208	00:05:33,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	when I entered the field the industry was moving so fast
EDL	00:05:33,791	00:05:35,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	that for me to take time away to
EDL	00:05:35,583	00:05:36,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to take time out
EDL	00:05:36,583	00:05:38,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to go for my graduate degree

EDL	00:05:38,125	00:05:39,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	was actually putting me behind
EDL	00:05:40,166	00:05:44,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because I was not getting to participate in all the game-changing new process

EDL	00:05:44,791	00:05:46,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And chip design technologies
EDL	00:05:46,833	00:05:48,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	that were being produced

EDL	00:05:48,625	00:05:50,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So I did take a few graduate courses
EDL	00:05:50,916	00:05:53,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And at that point decided no I really want to
EDL	00:05:53,500	00:05:54,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Being on the
EDL	00:05:54,250	00:05:55,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The ground floor stuff
EDL	00:05:55,541	00:05:57,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	(right) I just never look back
EDL	00:05:57,083	00:06:00,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I've been very fortunate to be surrounded by just incredible human beings

** rising tide raises all ships

EDL	00:06:00,916	00:06:04,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	there's this notion of a rising tide raises all ships

EDL	00:06:04,750	00:06:08,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I've been so fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by truly incredible
EDL	00:06:08,833	00:06:11,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	human beings.. that continues here

EDL	00:06:11,166	00:06:14,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's one other thing that I think emerge probably largely out of your ID
EDL	00:06:14,750	00:06:15,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Am experience
EDL	00:06:16,041	00:06:18,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And that's your hundred and fifty-five
EDL	00:06:18,833	00:06:22,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Who knows by now maybe this week you got another one
EDL	00:06:22,166	00:06:24,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Tell me a little bit about
EDL	00:06:24,208	00:06:26,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Some of the ones say that
EDL	00:06:26,791	00:06:31,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Sick in your mind most that you're most proud of or that perhaps had the most consequence
EDL	00:06:32,166	00:06:34,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Perhaps the one that sticks out in my mind
EDL	00:06:34,708	00:06:35,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The
EDL	00:06:35,458	00:06:36,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Foremost
EDL	00:06:36,250	00:06:37,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is general purpose
EDL	00:06:38,041	00:06:38,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Registers
EDL	00:06:38,791	00:06:39,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	for high performance
EDL	00:06:39,833	00:06:40,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Computing
EDL	00:06:40,583	00:06:44,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At the time and you'll have to explain that for me and what does that mean
EDL	00:06:44,958	00:06:45,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So
EDL	00:06:46,750	00:06:48,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Clearly and thread parallel machines
EDL	00:06:49,041	00:06:52,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's simultaneous need for the same data in multiple locations
EDL	00:06:52,875	00:06:53,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In microprocessor
EDL	00:06:54,416	00:06:55,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And at the time
EDL	00:06:55,708	00:06:57,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The notion was well let's keep

EDL	00:07:10,791	00:07:14,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Allowed us to simultaneously access the same data
EDL	00:07:14,125	00:07:15,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And send it to
EDL	00:07:15,166	00:07:16,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Different locations
EDL	00:07:16,416	00:07:17,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At the same time
EDL	00:07:17,958	00:07:18,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:07:19,000	00:07:22,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It it found its way into a lot of very high performance
EDL	00:07:22,333	00:07:23,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Which computer application
EDL	00:07:23,875	00:07:24,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	If I was to this day
EDL	00:07:24,625	00:07:27,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And went when did you make this development and get this patent
EDL	00:07:28,458	00:07:33,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Early my career is one of one of my first one said sometime in the 80s
EDL	00:07:33,083	00:07:34,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Yes, late 80s.
EDL	00:07:34,375	00:07:40,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Okay so let's not move to your DARPA adventure and another thing I really like to learn about from PMs
EDL	00:07:40,750	00:07:44,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	is the mechanism by which you ended up getting here
EDL	00:07:44,333	00:07:49,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So some .. a program manager and office director at a conference
EDL	00:07:49,958	00:07:55,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Others just were in love with DARPA for years and years and they kind of made the initial
EDL	00:07:55,625	00:07:56,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I reach out
EDL	00:07:56,625	00:07:58,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	How how did you actually end up here
EDL	00:07:59,708	00:08:01,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So without going Kiki on you
EDL	00:08:01,750	00:08:04,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Over the 30 years that I was at IBM
EDL	00:08:04,833	00:08:06,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	This this happened about seven years ago
EDL	00:08:08,166	00:08:09,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	About 7 years ago
EDL	00:08:09,958	00:08:11,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There was a
EDL	00:08:11,458	00:08:14,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I was involved of course in the design and
EDL	00:08:14,541	00:08:15,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Fabrication
EDL	00:08:16,208	00:08:17,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	of high performance
EDL	00:08:17,875	00:08:18,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	computing elements
EDL	00:08:19,666	00:08:20,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:08:20,416	00:08:22,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Became apparent there was a class of
EDL	00:08:22,500	00:08:23,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Defects
EDL	00:08:23,250	00:08:24,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The class of failures
EDL	00:08:24,791	00:08:25,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That were
EDL	00:08:25,833	00:08:27,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Exquisitely difficult
EDL	00:08:27,333	00:08:28,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to
EDL	00:08:28,125	00:08:28,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	diagnosis
EDL	00:08:29,666	00:08:31,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And very difficult to image
EDL	00:08:32,708	00:08:34,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or to 
EDL	00:08:34,000	00:08:34,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Try to Define
EDL	00:08:35,291	00:08:37,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But none the less they impacted the yield 
EDL	00:08:37,833	00:08:38,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Performance
EDL	00:08:38,625	00:08:39,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And in some cases
EDL	00:08:39,875	00:08:41,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Even had the ability to change
EDL	00:08:41,666	00:08:42,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	What the
EDL	00:08:42,458	00:08:44,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Computer chip was supposed to do
EDL	00:08:44,041	00:08:48,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	 so you're talking about defects that really go all the way down to sort of the
EDL	00:08:48,583	00:08:51,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Micron scale the transistor level element level
EDL	00:08:51,916	00:08:58,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Scale of of these chips right? - You're exactly right and I am not smart enough to be a high-level 
EDL	00:08:58,333	00:08:59,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	achitect I was very much
EDL	00:08:59,875	00:09:01,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A hardware engineer
EDL	00:09:01,416	00:09:03,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Very much about the hardware the physical design
EDL	00:09:04,208	00:09:10,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And fabrication of the actually - [..] and again to give the listeners vision of this I believe we're probably talking
EDL	00:09:10,083	00:09:15,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	about defects that could be the size of like individual biological cells 50 microns across
EDL	00:09:15,208	00:09:16,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Even smaller
EDL	00:09:16,250	00:09:17,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Indeed
EDL	00:09:17,000	00:09:19,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Indeed and as technology scale
EDL	00:09:19,583	00:09:22,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The size of the defects that were vulnerable to also
EDL	00:09:22,916	00:09:23,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Continue
EDL	00:09:23,666	00:09:24,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to shrink so 
EDL	00:09:24,416	00:09:25,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's essentially
EDL	00:09:25,458	00:09:26,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to keep
EDL	00:09:26,250	00:09:27,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A very very clean environment
EDL	00:09:28,541	00:09:29,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So
EDL	00:09:29,291	00:09:32,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It became clear to me that there was a class of defects
EDL	00:09:32,625	00:09:33,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That we were vulnerable to
EDL	00:09:34,166	00:09:36,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Not just from a yield or functional point of view
EDL	00:09:36,708	00:09:38,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But that potentially someone malicious
EDL	00:09:38,791	00:09:41,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Could intentionally assert upon a process
EDL	00:09:41,833	00:09:43,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or a pond design
EDL	00:09:43,875	00:09:44,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to
EDL	00:09:44,666	00:09:45,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Perhaps
EDL	00:09:46,708	00:09:47,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Compromise
EDL	00:09:48,000	00:09:51,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The component or its function or its reliability its lifetime
EDL	00:09:52,333	00:09:54,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Make a long story short I
EDL	00:09:54,125	00:09:55,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Became a
EDL	00:09:55,416	00:09:56,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Contractor
EDL	00:09:56,166	00:09:57,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Consultant to DARPA
EDL	00:09:57,708	00:10:01,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And - and with this consulting era
EDL	00:10:01,041	00:10:06,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or phase of your intersection with DARPA was that begin to define the kinds of programs
EDL	00:10:06,416	00:10:07,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That you ultimately would end up
EDL	00:10:08,458	00:10:09,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Running
EDL	00:10:09,500	00:10:15,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	With the aim of addressing the concerns that you learned about when you're ... - indeed initially it was
EDL	00:10:15,125	00:10:16,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To consult an existing program
EDL	00:10:17,416	00:10:18,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:10:18,208	00:10:18,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I
EDL	00:10:19,458	00:10:21,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Became involved in actually doing things
EDL	00:10:22,041	00:10:22,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To computer chips
EDL	00:10:23,333	00:10:24,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And then
EDL	00:10:24,833	00:10:27,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The DARPA program would hire
EDL	00:10:27,166	00:10:29,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Reverse Engineers to try to find
EDL	00:10:29,708	00:10:30,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	What was done
EDL	00:10:31,500	00:10:32,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:10:32,541	00:10:33,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We continue to make progress
EDL	00:10:34,583	00:10:35,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At both.
EDL	00:10:35,333	00:10:35,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Detecting
EDL	00:10:36,375	00:10:38,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Identifying those
EDL	00:10:38,916	00:10:41,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Those features which couldn't couldn't be detected
EDL	00:10:42,000	00:10:42,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:10:43,291	00:10:44,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	One thing led to another and after
EDL	00:10:45,583	00:10:48,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	After about a year of consulting, DARPA finally said why aren't
EDL	00:10:48,416	00:10:49,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	you come to DARPA
EDL	00:10:49,416	00:10:51,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So I retired from IBM at that point
EDL	00:10:51,750	00:10:52,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Then came to DARPA
EDL	00:10:52,750	00:10:53,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To assume
EDL	00:10:54,041	00:10:56,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The swim lane, if you will, the swim lane of
EDL	00:10:56,583	00:10:57,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	hardware security
EDL	00:10:57,875	00:10:59,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Right and released
EDL	00:10:59,166	00:11:01,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Three of your programs and the names of them really kind of
EDL	00:11:01,958	00:11:07,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Reflect just some of the goal that you have had in mind that I've been working toward
EDL	00:11:07,083	00:11:11,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	some referring to Trusted Integrated Circuits which is known as
EDL	00:11:11,208	00:11:13,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In the short form is Trust
EDL	00:11:13,500	00:11:17,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Integrity and Reliability of Integrated Circuits known as IRIC
EDL	00:11:17,333	00:11:21,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the Supply-chain Hardware Integrity for Electronics Defense
EDL	00:11:21,666	00:11:22,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Which
EDL	00:11:22,458	00:11:25,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is .. known in short as SHIELD
EDL	00:11:25,000	00:11:29,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Each one has its own individual aspects but together there's a certain kind of theme
EDL	00:11:29,625	00:11:31,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I'm wondering if you can actually sort of talked about them
EDL	00:11:31,916	00:11:33,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Collectively
EDL	00:11:33,208	00:11:36,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And of course diving into each one as you might
EDL	00:11:36,291	00:11:38,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Feel so inclined - indeed
EDL	00:11:38,583	00:11:39,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	God bless our warfighters
EDL	00:11:40,375	00:11:41,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It is critical now
EDL	00:11:42,166	00:11:43,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For us
EDL	00:11:43,208	00:11:44,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To make sure that
EDL	00:11:44,708	00:11:48,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Not just the mission is successful that that were protecting the warfighters
EDL	00:11:48,833	00:11:50,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	executing at mission
EDL	00:11:50,083	00:11:51,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The electronic components
EDL	00:11:51,625	00:11:53,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We used to support that mission
EDL	00:11:54,208	00:11:55,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Need to be
EDL	00:11:55,750	00:11:57,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Authentic
EDL	00:11:57,000	00:12:01,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We need to make sure that those parts do no more and no less than they're supposed to
EDL	00:12:01,125	00:12:04,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But they were built where they claim to be when they were claimed to be
EDL	00:12:04,416	00:12:07,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We have to make sure that they last for the full stated lifetime
EDL	00:12:08,041	00:12:09,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We have to make sure that
EDL	00:12:09,541	00:12:10,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There is no
EDL	00:12:10,833	00:12:14,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Nothing done to that component during the supply chain during distribution
EDL	00:12:15,208	00:12:17,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But there are no Trojan horses
EDL	00:12:17,000	00:12:18,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or Easter eggs
EDL	00:12:18,125	00:12:19,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	If you will better built in
EDL	00:12:19,791	00:12:22,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And this is challenging right to rebuke because in the
EDL	00:12:22,875	00:12:25,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Creation of a chip in the fabrication of a chip
EDL	00:12:25,666	00:12:27,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's so many players
EDL	00:12:27,208	00:12:28,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's so many different places that
EDL	00:12:29,250	00:12:30,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And somebody can have your fingers on it
EDL	00:12:31,041	00:12:32,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That that you really need some way of tracking ...
EDL	00:12:32,833	00:12:33,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That's exactly right
EDL	00:12:34,375	00:12:35,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Once Upon a Time
EDL	00:12:35,666	00:12:38,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Chain of custody was a sufficient means
EDL	00:12:38,500	00:12:39,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Up tracking
EDL	00:12:39,750	00:12:42,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The authenticity and integrity of our component
EDL	00:12:42,833	00:12:44,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But micro-electronics
EDL	00:12:44,375	00:12:45,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Has indeed become global
EDL	00:12:46,166	00:12:49,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And right about the time that I warned DARPA
EDL	00:12:50,000	00:12:51,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That there could be
EDL	00:12:51,541	00:12:53,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	An issue in the space
EDL	00:12:53,833	00:12:55,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The electronics
EDL	00:12:55,125	00:12:56,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Space indeed
EDL	00:12:56,166	00:12:56,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Went global
EDL	00:12:56,916	00:12:58,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	This the design is
EDL	00:12:58,458	00:13:00,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We're not the only smart
EDL	00:13:00,000	00:13:00,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	people in the world
EDL	00:13:01,541	00:13:02,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And so
EDL	00:13:02,291	00:13:03,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because of this
EDL	00:13:03,041	00:13:04,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It was critical
EDL	00:13:04,583	00:13:06,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That we develop those tools necessary
EDL	00:13:07,416	00:13:08,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to
EDL	00:13:08,708	00:13:09,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To be able to
EDL	00:13:09,958	00:13:11,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Confirm the Integrity of the
EDL	00:13:12,791	00:13:18,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	One of the most audacious trajectory that you've been taking and I get it just amazes me the progress that you and your performers have been making
EDL	00:13:19,958	00:13:20,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is
EDL	00:13:20,708	00:13:21,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	With
EDL	00:13:21,750	00:13:24,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Tiny little triplets about the size of
EDL	00:13:24,041	00:13:25,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Glitter particles
EDL	00:13:25,333	00:13:27,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I don't want to say anything more cuz I want you to
EDL	00:13:27,625	00:13:29,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Tell listeners that just what you been up to with your
EDL	00:13:29,958	00:13:31,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	performers on this task
EDL	00:13:31,208	00:13:33,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Before you even go there
EDL	00:13:33,000	00:13:34,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I'm reminded that
EDL	00:13:34,291	00:13:36,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's one thing to come up with a challenge
EDL	00:13:36,583	00:13:37,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But it's quite another
EDL	00:13:38,375	00:13:39,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To go
EDL	00:13:39,416	00:13:39,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Execute
EDL	00:13:40,416	00:13:41,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to go accomplish
EDL	00:13:41,458	00:13:42,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Such a challenge
EDL	00:13:42,750	00:13:44,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And to be clear the heroes in the space
EDL	00:13:45,291	00:13:47,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Are the performers that DARPA has
EDL	00:13:47,875	00:13:48,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	hired
EDL	00:13:48,625	00:13:49,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Be a contract
EDL	00:13:49,666	00:13:51,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To go solve this issue
EDL	00:13:51,458	00:13:54,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I'm astounded daily just
EDL	00:13:54,000	00:13:54,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	the
EDL	00:13:55,291	00:13:58,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	creativity the amount of themselves that they pour into the [...]
EDL	00:13:58,875	00:14:01,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	they skip holidays, they stay home over
EDL	00:14:02,458	00:14:02,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	they, they work
EDL	00:14:03,458	00:14:06,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	through Christmas sometimes in order to deliver
EDL	00:14:06,041	00:14:07,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Products
EDL	00:14:07,041	00:14:07,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	such as those
EDL	00:14:08,333	00:14:10,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The one that you're referring to , SHIELD
EDL	00:14:10,375	00:14:11,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The threat space is large
EDL	00:14:11,916	00:14:12,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The threat space
EDL	00:14:13,208	00:14:16,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of micro electronic component begins in design
EDL	00:14:16,041	00:14:17,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It goes right through fabrication
EDL	00:14:18,083	00:14:22,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And then after fabrication and packaging it goes through distribution
EDL	00:14:22,666	00:14:24,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	SHIELD is a taggant (标签剂, 原意"为了预防不法使用 而在炸药添加的物质,使它在爆炸后能被辨认出来")
EDL	00:14:25,000	00:14:25,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shield
EDL	00:14:25,750	00:14:28,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is is a means of authenticating
EDL	00:14:28,291	00:14:29,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The parts that
EDL	00:14:29,333	00:14:29,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We
EDL	00:14:30,375	00:14:33,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Use it are most sensitive applications they have
EDL	00:14:33,166	00:14:34,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To be the correct part
EDL	00:14:34,708	00:14:38,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For a number of reasons the existing authentication technologies were
EDL	00:14:38,791	00:14:40,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	necessary but not
EDL	00:14:40,333	00:14:40,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	sufficient
EDL	00:14:41,375	00:14:43,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So SHIELD is a microscopic taggant(标签剂)
EDL	00:14:43,666	00:14:47,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We hope to get it into the world records here before we are all done
EDL	00:14:48,041	00:14:51,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But it is used to make sure that this is the part
EDL	00:14:52,125	00:14:53,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	that we intended
EDL	00:14:53,666	00:14:54,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to go into
EDL	00:14:54,916	00:14:55,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	our defenses
EDL	00:14:56,708	00:14:58,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It has five special sauces
EDL	00:14:58,791	00:14:59,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The first
EDL	00:14:59,791	00:15:02,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is a hardware root of trust
EDL	00:15:02,625	00:15:04,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Every single microscopic

EDL	00:15:23,083	00:15:24,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The 3rd
EDL	00:15:24,125	00:15:25,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is sensors that sense
EDL	00:15:26,166	00:15:26,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	If
EDL	00:15:26,916	00:15:29,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The SHIELD ship has been corrupted
EDL	00:15:29,250	00:15:30,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Compromised
EDL	00:15:30,791	00:15:33,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Could [doucled] any given way
EDL	00:15:34,625	00:15:35,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The 4th
EDL	00:15:35,375	00:15:36,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is an antenna
EDL	00:15:36,666	00:15:38,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because it's way too small
EDL	00:15:38,458	00:15:38,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Contact
EDL	00:15:39,458	00:15:43,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And so because that we have to talk to with RF - You mean physical contact is just too small
EDL	00:15:43,333	00:15:43,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That's correct
EDL	00:15:44,833	00:15:46,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	V is
EDL	00:15:46,375	00:15:47,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Self destruct capability
EDL	00:15:47,916	00:15:49,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But if you attempt to remove it
EDL	00:15:49,458	00:15:50,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	From The Host
EDL	00:15:50,250	00:15:51,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Component
EDL	00:15:51,000	00:15:52,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It will cease to be functional
EDL	00:15:53,541	00:15:54,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The part is powered
EDL	00:15:55,333	00:15:56,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	By the
EDL	00:15:56,625	00:15:58,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	By the interrogator
EDL	00:15:58,583	00:16:00,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It is completely seperated from 
EDL	00:16:00,250	00:16:01,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	from the host component
EDL	00:16:01,500	00:16:03,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The goal is that at any time
EDL	00:16:04,041	00:16:04,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At any place
EDL	00:16:05,333	00:16:06,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	An untrained operator
EDL	00:16:06,875	00:16:10,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	with no special equipment in this case being just an iPhone or smartphone
EDL	00:16:11,458	00:16:13,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Can test the integrity of their components
EDL	00:16:14,041	00:16:15,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At any time and place
EDL	00:16:15,583	00:16:16,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And get immediate
EDL	00:16:16,583	00:16:17,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Trustworthy
EDL	00:16:17,625	00:16:18,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Results
EDL	00:16:18,375	00:16:18,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For free
EDL	00:16:19,666	00:16:21,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	SHIELD cost one tenth of a cent
EDL	00:16:22,250	00:16:25,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the entire operation would cost less than $0.01
EDL	00:16:26,083	00:16:26,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Every time
EDL	00:16:26,833	00:16:28,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	You wished authenticate the part
EDL	00:16:29,125	00:16:32,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	When you authenticate the part it also reports the GPS location
EDL	00:16:32,708	00:16:35,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the TCP IP network address
EDL	00:16:35,541	00:16:36,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of where it was tested
EDL	00:16:37,333	00:16:38,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In this way
EDL	00:16:38,375	00:16:40,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At least for the most
EDL	00:16:40,416	00:16:40,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Serious
EDL	00:16:41,416	00:16:43,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Over counterfeit(伪造者) in clone threats
EDL	00:16:43,750	00:16:46,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We believe we have a very cost effective solution
EDL	00:16:46,791	00:16:48,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The goal is to make sure that
EDL	00:16:48,833	00:16:50,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Counterfeiting and cloning
EDL	00:16:50,625	00:16:51,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Becomes
EDL	00:16:51,666	00:16:52,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Too expensive
EDL	00:16:52,708	00:16:53,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	and takes too long
EDL	00:16:53,958	00:16:55,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For the bad guy
EDL	00:16:55,750	00:16:59,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Right absolutely amazing description I mean this sounds to me like a bat
EDL	00:16:59,875	00:17:01,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The highest of high technology
EDL	00:17:01,916	00:17:04,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A certain length in the synthesis the way you're mixing and matching
EDL	00:17:04,708	00:17:09,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Different kinds of Technologies also is just to me one of the things that characterizes
EDL	00:17:09,083	00:17:15,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A lot of what's going on here at DARPA - one thing I'm somewhat of a pain in the rear to my performers about
EDL	00:17:15,208	00:17:18,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because I'm just a knuckle-dragger hardware engineer
EDL	00:17:18,291	00:17:19,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Everything we do
EDL	00:17:19,583	00:17:21,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	You have to be able to hold it in your hand
EDL	00:17:22,125	00:17:23,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And this is a program
EDL	00:17:23,666	00:17:29,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Especially this program where it's not rainbows coming out of keyboards are unicorns sleeping over Terminals 
EDL	00:17:29,208	00:17:30,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	and magic will happen
EDL	00:17:30,833	00:17:32,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	This has to be
EDL	00:17:32,125	00:17:32,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Deterministic
EDL	00:17:33,416	00:17:34,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Quantitative
EDL	00:17:34,666	00:17:37,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Very analytic real engineering
EDL	00:17:37,750	00:17:40,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And after the initial technologies were developed
EDL	00:17:40,833	00:17:41,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	SHIELD
EDL	00:17:41,583	00:17:42,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is about
EDL	00:17:42,375	00:17:43,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Good engineering
EDL	00:17:43,625	00:17:44,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We've engineered
EDL	00:17:44,666	00:17:45,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A beautiful product
EDL	00:17:45,666	00:17:48,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	All right well since you're all about that kind of ground truthing
EDL	00:17:48,500	00:17:50,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Where are we at with the with this
EDL	00:17:51,333	00:17:53,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Program with these tiny little
EDL	00:17:53,375	00:17:55,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Triplets how would you characterize the status
EDL	00:17:56,166	00:17:57,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	SHIELD is a 3-phase program
EDL	00:17:58,500	00:18:00,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Phase one was to go develop
EDL	00:18:00,791	00:18:02,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Those five core Technologies
EDL	00:18:02,833	00:18:04,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because they really did not exist
EDL	00:18:04,625	00:18:06,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At that scale all five
EDL	00:18:06,416	00:18:07,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Have been demonstrated to be
EDL	00:18:07,958	00:18:08,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Functional
EDL	00:18:09,000	00:18:12,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Phase two is the integration of those technologies
EDL	00:18:12,583	00:18:13,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Into the shield
EDL	00:18:13,833	00:18:14,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Prototype
EDL	00:18:15,125	00:18:16,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Phase 3 of the program
EDL	00:18:16,916	00:18:18,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Which is the field test
EDL	00:18:19,458	00:18:20,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of Shield
EDL	00:18:20,750	00:18:21,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Will begin
EDL	00:18:21,791	00:18:23,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Early in 2018
EDL	00:18:23,833	00:18:25,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The field testing
EDL	00:18:25,125	00:18:27,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is supported by
EDL	00:18:28,166	00:18:32,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Some wonderful companies that we won't identify right now that have volunteered their supply chain
EDL	00:18:33,041	00:18:34,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And we will do things
EDL	00:18:34,333	00:18:35,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	What's the components
EDL	00:18:35,333	00:18:36,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Windshield attached
EDL	00:18:36,625	00:18:38,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And use their supply chains
EDL	00:18:38,916	00:18:41,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And we will see how effective Shield is
EDL	00:18:41,250	00:18:43,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In catching compromises
EDL	00:18:43,291	00:18:44,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So Kerry, we've talked about
EDL	00:18:44,833	00:18:45,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Shield
EDL	00:18:45,583	00:18:51,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I do want to go back to to the other programs that you work on one of them is completed now and one of them is still in progress it was
EDL	00:18:52,250	00:18:55,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Start with trusted integrated circuits (TRUST) https://www.DARPA.mil/program/trusted-integrated-circuits
EDL	00:18:55,041	00:18:56,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	which I believed is
EDL	00:18:56,041	00:18:58,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	kind of one of the earliest programs you took on.
EDL	00:18:58,375	00:19:03,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	TRUST was the program that I actually began supporting before I entered DARPA
EDL	00:19:03,000	00:19:04,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Trust was a program
EDL	00:19:04,541	00:19:07,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To make sure that we could verify
EDL	00:19:07,083	00:19:10,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	that a part is doing no more and no less than it is supposed to do
EDL	00:19:11,458	00:19:13,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Trust was a large program
EDL	00:19:13,750	00:19:15,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Lots and lots of achievements
EDL	00:19:15,791	00:19:17,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We developed microscopes
EDL	00:19:17,333	00:19:19,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We develop solutions
EDL	00:19:19,375	00:19:22,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For pulling netlist(网表) if you will
EDL	00:19:22,791	00:19:24,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	the schematic from chips
EDL	00:19:24,250	00:19:26,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To make sure that the schematic is what it's supposed to
EDL	00:19:27,041	00:19:30,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We look at both COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) product
EDL	00:19:30,916	00:19:32,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	As well as Gods parts
EDL	00:19:32,958	00:19:34,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Government-owned components
EDL	00:19:34,750	00:19:37,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We looked at field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)
EDL	00:19:38,083	00:19:39,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	As well as ASIC(专用芯片)
EDL	00:19:40,125	00:19:41,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The output of that program
EDL	00:19:42,416	00:19:44,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is installed in a number of agencies
EDL	00:19:44,458	00:19:45,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	All over the country
EDL	00:19:46,250	00:19:47,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And still being [...]
EDL	00:19:48,041	00:19:52,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Ready when you mentioned ASIC, field programmable gate array (FPGA), those are just names for
EDL	00:19:52,666	00:19:55,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	other kinds of categories of integrated circuits
EDL	00:19:55,208	00:19:57,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That have different capabilities
EDL	00:19:57,000	00:20:01,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	But all of which are used today and all of which we really need to feel very confident about - that is correct
EDL	00:20:01,625	00:20:03,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So that's TRUST and that completed
EDL	00:20:03,916	00:20:07,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A year or two ago when did that ... - yes, it included
EDL	00:20:07,250	00:20:08,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	About
EDL	00:20:08,041	00:20:09,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	18 month ago
EDL	00:20:09,041	00:20:13,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So obviously there's parts of the spirit of that program that are part of SHIELD
EDL	00:20:13,666	00:20:18,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And the other program I just wanted to say a little bit about this one continues
EDL	00:20:18,500	00:20:23,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Today and that's the integrity and reliability of integrated circuits program or IRIS
EDL	00:20:24,416	00:20:26,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The question that Iris answered was
EDL	00:20:27,208	00:20:29,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	If indeed we know that this component
EDL	00:20:30,041	00:20:31,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Has not been compromised
EDL	00:20:31,583	00:20:32,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In its function
EDL	00:20:32,833	00:20:35,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Can we still be assured that it has not been compromised
EDL	00:20:35,666	00:20:36,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And its integrity
EDL	00:20:37,208	00:20:38,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	How do we make sure with
EDL	00:20:38,750	00:20:40,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	With a low sample size
EDL	00:20:40,791	00:20:43,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That this component indeed fulfills
EDL	00:20:43,625	00:20:44,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Its lifetime spec
EDL	00:20:44,875	00:20:45,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Its reliability
EDL	00:20:46,666	00:20:48,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That it is up to the task
EDL	00:20:48,708	00:20:49,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	A performing
EDL	00:20:50,250	00:20:52,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For $20,000 an hour
EDL	00:20:52,583	00:20:54,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or 100000 power in hours
EDL	00:20:54,375	00:20:55,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Or whatever the spec is
EDL	00:20:55,875	00:20:57,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That mission that is critical
EDL	00:20:57,666	00:20:58,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	2
EDL	00:21:00,000	00:21:01,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To the defense
EDL	00:21:01,791	00:21:03,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That it's installed in
EDL	00:21:03,041	00:21:08,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Okay and this is to defend against such things as counterfeiting practice
EDL	00:21:08,625	00:21:14,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	where an old chip might be taken out of some unit it might then be blacktop right where new kind of
EDL	00:21:14,083	00:21:20,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	packaging is put on with new printing looks new but in fact it's old and so might not be able to actually live
EDL	00:21:20,208	00:21:21,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Up to its
EDL	00:21:21,000	00:21:22,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	the spec that a user expects
EDL	00:21:22,500	00:21:23,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	That's correct Ivan
EDL	00:21:23,541	00:21:25,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Just like human beings age
EDL	00:21:25,583	00:21:26,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In automobiles rust
EDL	00:21:27,375	00:21:29,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There's a lifetime to electronic components
EDL	00:21:29,958	00:21:30,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:21:30,708	00:21:34,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The lifetime must be ... we depend on that lifetime when the system
EDL	00:21:35,333	00:21:35,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is built
EDL	00:21:36,333	00:21:38,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	For that part to execute its function
EDL	00:21:39,416	00:21:41,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Even without the malicious intent
EDL	00:21:41,958	00:21:44,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	We need to know we need to be able to
EDL	00:21:44,291	00:21:45,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Very quickly assess
EDL	00:21:46,583	00:21:48,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The reliability
EDL	00:21:48,375	00:21:48,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of a part
EDL	00:21:49,416	00:21:50,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	and currently
EDL	00:21:50,666	00:21:52,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The reliability science
EDL	00:21:52,208	00:21:53,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is is a
EDL	00:21:53,000	00:21:54,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is very involved
EDL	00:21:54,791	00:21:55,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Painful
EDL	00:21:55,791	00:21:58,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Long-term goal
EDL	00:21:58,875	00:21:59,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And so
EDL	00:21:59,625	00:22:00,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	IRIS
EDL	00:22:00,416	00:22:01,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Looked
EDL	00:22:01,166	00:22:02,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To try to
EDL	00:22:02,708	00:22:04,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Improve the turnaround
EDL	00:22:04,500	00:22:05,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	and the testing
EDL	00:22:05,250	00:22:05,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Reliability
EDL	00:22:06,541	00:22:10,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I want to move to a couple of other questions before we we close out
EDL	00:22:10,125	00:22:15,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	One of them is really I want you to reflect a little bit about micro electronics
EDL	00:22:15,000	00:22:16,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	As a technology in your
EDL	00:22:16,791	00:22:19,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	roll, your several decades roll in
EDL	00:22:20,375	00:22:26,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Pushing that technology forward and doing whatever you can to ensure the integrity and safety of it
EDL	00:22:26,000	00:22:29,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And you know with some programs even moving forward thinking about
EDL	00:22:29,833	00:22:34,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Next generations of micro-electronic devices even in the nanoscale area
EDL	00:22:34,708	00:22:38,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	So so that we continue to have a
EDL	00:22:38,291	00:22:40,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Progressive technology in micro-electronics
EDL	00:22:40,875	00:22:48,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	As you think about all of that me what excites you about this category of technology and, Kerry ,what concerns you about it
EDL	00:22:48,541	00:22:51,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I've been few months ago I had the
EDL	00:22:51,083	00:22:52,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Privilege of
EDL	00:22:52,875	00:22:56,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Spending a week with a 311th Fighter Squadron
EDL	00:22:56,208	00:22:57,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	At Holloman Air Force Base
EDL	00:22:57,750	00:22:58,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In New Mexico
EDL	00:22:59,041	00:23:01,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And after spending a week of them sharing
EDL	00:23:01,333	00:23:02,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	With me
EDL	00:23:02,375	00:23:03,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	What they do
EDL	00:23:03,625	00:23:05,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I have the opportunity at the end of that week
EDL	00:23:05,958	00:23:06,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To describe
EDL	00:23:06,708	00:23:08,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To them what I do
EDL	00:23:08,500	00:23:09,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And that's when it hit me
EDL	00:23:10,291	00:23:13,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	My son is training to be an A-10
EDL	00:23:14,125	00:23:14,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Fighter pilot
EDL	00:23:15,666	00:23:16,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	The warthog
EDL	00:23:17,458	00:23:19,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And when I
EDL	00:23:19,250	00:23:20,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Got in front of the audience
EDL	00:23:20,791	00:23:21,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	They all look like Mikey
EDL	00:23:22,333	00:23:23,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	They all look like
EDL	00:23:23,875	00:23:24,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	My son
EDL	00:23:25,125	00:23:26,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And, I mean, it's hard
EDL	00:23:26,916	00:23:29,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's even hard now to talk about it
EDL	00:23:30,500	00:23:31,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It's not just
EDL	00:23:33,083	00:23:35,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	As a DARPA program manager
EDL	00:23:35,125	00:23:36,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	or as an engineer
EDL	00:23:37,666	00:23:38,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	As a parent
EDL	00:23:38,958	00:23:40,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	How many people
EDL	00:23:40,250	00:23:42,375	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Everyone, of course, wishes the best
EDL	00:23:43,583	00:23:44,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Our warfighters
EDL	00:23:44,875	00:23:46,125	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	How many people actually
EDL	00:23:47,166	00:23:49,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	are in the position to do something about it
EDL	00:23:49,958	00:23:51,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	It was one of the greatest
EDL	00:23:51,500	00:23:52,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	epiphanies (顿悟)
EDL	00:23:52,291	00:23:53,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of my time at DARPA
EDL	00:23:54,083	00:23:55,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	was to realize that
EDL	00:23:56,125	00:23:57,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I've been trusted
EDL	00:23:57,916	00:23:58,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	With
EDL	00:23:58,666	00:23:59,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	All this
EDL	00:24:00,208	00:24:00,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Resource
EDL	00:24:01,500	00:24:02,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And funding
EDL	00:24:03,291	00:24:04,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:24:04,041	00:24:04,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Security
EDL	00:24:05,583	00:24:06,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And
EDL	00:24:06,625	00:24:07,875	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Given everything I need
EDL	00:24:08,416	00:24:10,208	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To go do what I know needs
EDL	00:24:10,208	00:24:10,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to be done
EDL	00:24:10,958	00:24:12,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	If I fail it's my fault
EDL	00:24:12,333	00:24:13,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Because this
EDL	00:24:13,250	00:24:15,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	God bless this agency is giving me it's giving me
EDL	00:24:15,833	00:24:16,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Everything
EDL	00:24:16,583	00:24:18,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I need to succeed and it's all on me
EDL	00:24:19,166	00:24:20,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And that's what's driven me and
EDL	00:24:21,208	00:24:22,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	In front of an audience like that
EDL	00:24:23,500	00:24:24,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	They deserve no less
EDL	00:24:25,041	00:24:26,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Thanks for that.
EDL	00:24:26,583	00:24:33,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	You've been here since 2012 so you've been here longer than a lot of program managers and you probably are coming toward the tail end
EDL	00:24:33,000	00:24:34,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	When are you leaving
EDL	00:24:34,000	00:24:35,291	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	September of
EDL	00:24:36,041	00:24:37,583	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	September 18th
EDL	00:24:37,583	00:24:44,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I'm not actually sure you're even going to be able to see SHIELD through all the way to the end I know that that's you're gonna go
EDL	00:24:44,000	00:24:47,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	most of the way but I'm I imagine you're going to be handing off some of the final
EDL	00:24:47,333	00:24:47,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Testing
EDL	00:24:48,333	00:24:54,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	I'm just wondering with six years of of participation in this agency which is part of the the
EDL	00:24:54,750	00:24:55,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:24:56,541	00:25:02,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	What you have learned about it as an organization and as a culture in technology
EDL	00:25:03,208	00:25:04,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	DARPA is a incredible place
EDL	00:25:05,250	00:25:06,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Just incredible
EDL	00:25:06,250	00:25:07,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Place
EDL	00:25:07,041	00:25:10,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Of course it's a human organization so it's given to
EDL	00:25:10,625	00:25:12,666	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	All the variation that
EDL	00:25:12,666	00:25:13,416	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Human
EDL	00:25:13,416	00:25:13,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Endeavor
EDL	00:25:14,458	00:25:16,750	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Introduces but it's such a rare place
EDL	00:25:17,250	00:25:19,041	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To be given the opportunity
EDL	00:25:19,041	00:25:19,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	To go
EDL	00:25:19,833	00:25:21,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Develop those ideas
EDL	00:25:21,625	00:25:22,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Which you know
EDL	00:25:23,416	00:25:24,166	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Can be made to work
EDL	00:25:24,708	00:25:26,333	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is a once in a life-time
EDL	00:25:26,750	00:25:28,541	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Do you have any thoughts about
EDL	00:25:28,541	00:25:31,083	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	a post-DARPA phase of of your professional adventure
EDL	00:25:31,625	00:25:33,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	There are certain capabilities
EDL	00:25:33,916	00:25:35,458	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	This nation urgently needs
EDL	00:25:35,958	00:25:38,791	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	And I'm pouring the concrete(混凝土) in those holes
EDL	00:25:38,791	00:25:40,833	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	As quickly as I possibly can
EDL	00:25:40,833	00:25:43,625	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	My intent when I complete my DARPA post
EDL	00:25:44,166	00:25:48,000	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Is to be able to move into a position where I will be allowed to continue
EDL	00:25:48,750	00:25:49,250	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	to pour that concrete
EDL	00:25:50,541	00:25:56,958	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Well I for one will be excited to watch you as you take your programs through to the point that you will be able
EDL	00:25:56,958	00:25:59,500	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Able to end to see what you do
EDL	00:25:59,500	00:26:05,916	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	When you leave here now bringing your DARPA experience, maybe perhaps back into the private sector and industry whatever you might do
EDL	00:26:05,916	00:26:08,708	| VfD E17 Guardian of the Chips |	Where was I wish you the best of luck
