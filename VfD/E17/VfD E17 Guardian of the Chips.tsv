* Intro
EDL	00:00:12,083	00:00:17,666	| VfD_E17 |	Stealth technology, the Internet GPS in the palm of your hand, autonomous operation
EDL	00:00:18,666	00:00:24,791	| VfD_E17 |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding in 1958 in the midst of the Cold War
EDL	00:00:24,791	00:00:25,291	| VfD_E17 |	DARPA
EDL	00:00:25,833	00:00:27,875	| VfD_E17 |	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
EDL	00:00:28,375	00:00:30,250	| VfD_E17 |	has been a driver of technology
EDL	00:00:30,666	00:00:33,000	| VfD_E17 |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA
EDL	00:00:33,000	00:00:36,041	| VfD_E17 |	A window on to DARPA's core of program managers
EDL	00:00:36,041	00:00:37,083	| VfD_E17 |	Their job ...
EDL	00:00:37,583	00:00:39,125	| VfD_E17 |	To redefine what is possible

EDL	00:00:39,625	00:00:42,458	| VfD_E17 |	My name is Ivan Amato and I'm your DARPA host
EDL	00:00:42,458	00:00:45,791	| VfD_E17 |	And today I'm pleased to have with me in the studio Carrie Bernstein
EDL	00:00:45,791	00:00:48,083	| VfD_E17 |	A program manager since 2012
EDL	00:00:48,083	00:00:52,166	| VfD_E17 |	In DARPA's Micro Systems Technology Office

EDL	00:00:52,166	00:00:58,583	| VfD_E17 |	among the agency 6 technical offices that is devoted to doing more with electrons photons and electromagnetism
EDL	00:00:58,583	00:01:00,875	| VfD_E17 |	It's been possible in the history of technology

EDL	00:01:01,666	00:01:05,250	| VfD_E17 |	Carry's curiosity and Science and Technology knows no bounds
EDL	00:01:05,250	00:01:10,625	| VfD_E17 |	What is background in the micro lectronics industry has everything to do with a mission he has taken on a DARPA
EDL	00:01:11,125	00:01:12,416	| VfD_E17 |	More than anyone
EDL	00:01:12,416	00:01:15,750	| VfD_E17 |	He's been pushing Technologies to reduce or even eliminate
EDL	00:01:16,250	00:01:21,875	| VfD_E17 |	The vulnerabilities to are billions of micro Electronics chips to things like hacking counterfeiting cloning
EDL	00:01:22,375	00:01:27,250	| VfD_E17 |	Tampering and other nefarious actions that are just no good at all for National Security
EDL	00:01:28,541	00:01:29,833	| VfD_E17 |	Prior coming to DARPA
EDL	00:01:29,833	00:01:31,875	| VfD_E17 |	Carry, an electrical engineer by training
EDL	00:01:32,375	00:01:38,791	| VfD_E17 |	Like more than 30 years at IBM where he worked on a dizzying array of technical subjects including 
EDL	00:01:38,791	00:01:40,583	| VfD_E17 |	Microprocessor circuit design
EDL	00:01:40,583	00:01:44,416	| VfD_E17 |	High-performance Low-power Devices Circuits and Architectures
EDL	00:01:44,416	00:01:50,291	| VfD_E17 |	New technologies that could replace the basic logic switches that underlie almost all of chips today
EDL	00:01:50,291	00:01:55,166	| VfD_E17 |	Three-Dimensional chip integration and the ways radiation can damage chips
EDL	00:01:55,166	00:01:56,458	| VfD_E17 |	Carry has co-authored
EDL	00:01:56,458	00:02:00,041	| VfD_E17 |	Text books on circuit design, he holds 155 patents
EDL	00:02:00,541	00:02:01,541	| VfD_E17 |	And is a fellow of the
EDL	00:02:01,541	00:02:03,625	| VfD_E17 |	Institute of electrical and electronics engineers

EDL	00:02:04,375	00:02:06,416	| VfD_E17 |	Carry, It's my pleasure to have you in the studio today
EDL	00:02:06,916	00:02:07,708	| VfD_E17 |	That's really mine, Thanks.

* Origin

EDL	00:02:08,458	00:02:14,625	| VfD_E17 |	I'm always fascinated by the way people get interested in science and technology if there was some transformative moment or
EDL	00:02:14,625	00:02:17,416	| VfD_E17 |	Key person in your life that pointed you in that direction
EDL	00:02:18,208	00:02:19,458	| VfD_E17 |	Ivan it's sort of an ax
EDL	00:02:19,458	00:02:21,791	| VfD_E17 |	And if one of the most fortunate.
EDL	00:02:21,791	00:02:22,541	| VfD_E17 |	Accidents I've ever known
EDL	00:02:23,041	00:02:24,583	| VfD_E17 |	So you can it's a little kid I was always
EDL	00:02:25,125	00:02:26,916	| VfD_E17 |	Very interested in astronomy
EDL	00:02:27,416	00:02:27,916	| VfD_E17 |	Astrophysics
EDL	00:02:28,458	00:02:30,750	| VfD_E17 |	And God bless my daddy
EDL	00:02:30,750	00:02:32,541	| VfD_E17 |	He didn't understand any of the lecture
EDL	00:02:32,541	00:02:34,833	| VfD_E17 |	But I'd identify famous astronomers

EDL	00:02:34,833	00:02:35,625	| VfD_E17 |	Who's coming to
EDL	00:02:35,625	00:02:39,458	| VfD_E17 |	Lecture at the University Chicago or University of Illinois and he would take

EDL	00:02:39,458	00:02:39,958	| VfD_E17 |	Was Wonderful
EDL	00:02:41,000	00:02:41,750	| VfD_E17 |	And uh...

EDL	00:02:42,250	00:02:44,583	| VfD_E17 |	I went to college anticipating, I would study astrophysics

EDL	00:02:45,583	00:02:46,083	| VfD_E17 |	Astronomy
EDL	00:02:46,625	00:02:47,375	| VfD_E17 |	And

EDL	00:02:47,375	00:02:49,666	| VfD_E17 |	I come from a family of fairly modest means
EDL	00:02:49,666	00:02:51,208	| VfD_E17 |	And it became very apparent that
EDL	00:02:51,208	00:02:52,000	| VfD_E17 |	I needed to
EDL	00:02:52,000	00:02:53,541	| VfD_E17 |	Be able to pick up my college cost

EDL	00:02:54,291	00:02:55,041	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:02:55,041	00:02:59,416	| VfD_E17 |	Astronomers and astro physicist just were not in real high demand at the time  

EDL	00:02:59,416	00:03:00,958	| VfD_E17 |	So I looked around in my credits
EDL	00:03:00,958	00:03:01,958	| VfD_E17 |	And apply to 
EDL	00:03:01,958	00:03:03,500	| VfD_E17 |	To electrical engineering
EDL	00:03:03,500	00:03:04,291	| VfD_E17 |	And a normal physics

EDL	00:03:04,791	00:03:06,583	| VfD_E17 |	The night embarked(从事) on a career of engineering
EDL	00:03:07,083	00:03:08,625	| VfD_E17 |	And was the most wonderful accident I've ever made

* Q:

EDL	00:03:09,666	00:03:13,500	| VfD_E17 |	Let's talk about that move you made that pivot into electrical
EDL	00:03:14,000	00:03:20,416	| VfD_E17 |	And really electronic engineering as it turned out right so you can cuz you ended up going to IBM one of the most storyed
EDL	00:03:20,416	00:03:25,250	| VfD_E17 |	companies and organizations when it comes to certain the entire history of micro-electronics
EDL	00:03:25,250	00:03:30,666	| VfD_E17 |	And I just would be interested in hearing about the numerous hats that you did wear there and
EDL	00:03:31,166	00:03:33,458	| VfD_E17 |	kind of, what you learned about that technology

EDL	00:03:33,458	00:03:34,750	| VfD_E17 |	Timing is so much
EDL	00:03:34,750	00:03:37,291	| VfD_E17 |	And at the time that I graduated college
EDL	00:03:38,583	00:03:41,666	| VfD_E17 |	The technology that we use in current, uh, computing
EDL	00:03:41,666	00:03:42,166	| VfD_E17 |	CMOS
EDL	00:03:42,666	00:03:45,850	| VfD_E17 |	Was just in its infancy and just for listeners who might not know 
EDL	00:03:45,850	00:03:49,083	| VfD_E17 |	that that's such a familiar term if you're in that micro electronic
EDL	00:03:49,083	00:03:50,875	| VfD_E17 |	world the CMOS stands for what, Carry?

** CMOS joke
EDL	00:03:50,875	00:03:51,625	| VfD_E17 |	I've always wondered
EDL	00:03:52,666	00:03:56,500	| VfD_E17 |	CMOS stands for complementary
EDL	00:03:56,500	00:03:58,291	| VfD_E17 |	Metal-oxide-semiconductor
EDL	00:03:58,291	00:04:00,333	| VfD_E17 |	And this is this is sort of that the work
EDL	00:04:00,333	00:04:06,750	| VfD_E17 |	horse technology that underlies pretty much any chip that any of our listeners might have in their computers were were
EDL	00:04:06,750	00:04:07,500	| VfD_E17 |	Is there a predominant(主要的)
EDL	00:04:08,791	00:04:10,083	| VfD_E17 |	[...]
EDL	00:04:10,083	00:04:11,083	| VfD_E17 |	CMOS
EDL	00:04:11,083	00:04:12,375	| VfD_E17 |	Field-effect transistors
EDL	00:04:12,875	00:04:14,916	| VfD_E17 |	was the technology called bipolar(双极性)
EDL	00:04:14,916	00:04:17,250	| VfD_E17 |	The bipolar was very power-hungry
EDL	00:04:17,250	00:04:19,291	| VfD_E17 |	And the power was really limiting
EDL	00:04:19,291	00:04:19,791	| VfD_E17 |	How much you could do with it.

EDL	00:04:20,291	00:04:23,125	| VfD_E17 |	So when I first entered the space
EDL	00:04:23,625	00:04:24,916	| VfD_E17 |	CMOS was just starting out
EDL	00:04:25,666	00:04:27,541	| VfD_E17 |	And I had the great fortune of
EDL	00:04:28,250	00:04:29,000	| VfD_E17 |	Joining IBM
EDL	00:04:29,541	00:04:32,583	| VfD_E17 |	And IBM was leading the field in the development of
EDL	00:04:33,875	00:04:34,916	| VfD_E17 |	Processes
EDL	00:04:34,916	00:04:36,166	| VfD_E17 |	Circuit design
EDL	00:04:36,166	00:04:37,458	| VfD_E17 |	Architecture
EDL	00:04:37,458	00:04:39,250	| VfD_E17 |	For truly high performance computing
EDL	00:04:39,750	00:04:41,833	| VfD_E17 |	It's over a career of 30 years
EDL	00:04:42,333	00:04:43,875	| VfD_E17 |	I enjoyed this
EDL	00:04:43,875	00:04:45,416	| VfD_E17 |	This incredible ride
EDL	00:04:45,416	00:04:48,208	| VfD_E17 |	Bringing through new materials new applications
EDL	00:04:48,208	00:04:51,791	| VfD_E17 |	Producing the technology that went into machines that we used to play chess
EDL	00:04:52,291	00:04:53,333	| VfD_E17 |	Play Jeopardy
EDL	00:04:53,333	00:04:54,625	| VfD_E17 |	Quite a ride

EDL	00:04:54,625	00:04:57,958	| VfD_E17 |	There's two things about your experience there that fast they make
EDL	00:04:57,958	00:05:01,541	| VfD_E17 |	One is that you became part of that IBM team
EDL	00:05:01,541	00:05:07,916	| VfD_E17 |	With a bachelor's in electrical engineering right this was from Washington University in St. Louis and then you've got several

** Don't even have a masters 学历

EDL	00:05:07,916	00:05:12,572	| VfD_E17 |	Ph.Ds worth of education while you were there because you don't have a Ph.D here. 
EDL	00:05:12,572	00:05:14,333	| VfD_E17 |	Ivan I don't even have a masters
EDL	00:05:14,333	00:05:15,636	| VfD_E17 |	Don't even have a masters. 
EDL	00:05:15,636	00:05:20,708	| VfD_E17 |	but when I see you in actions, oh my gosh, right, it didn't clearly you got everything that that any of them
EDL	00:05:20,708	00:05:22,500	| VfD_E17 |	hyper-educated people here have
EDL	00:05:22,500	00:05:23,791	| VfD_E17 |	but you learned it
EDL	00:05:23,791	00:05:25,583	| VfD_E17 |	Kind of in-situ you in the in the industry

EDL	00:05:26,375	00:05:27,125	| VfD_E17 |	It was ...
EDL	00:05:27,125	00:05:28,666	| VfD_E17 |	A matter of luck
EDL	00:05:29,166	00:05:29,666	| VfD_E17 |	that
EDL	00:05:30,208	00:05:33,250	| VfD_E17 |	when I entered the field the industry was moving so fast
EDL	00:05:33,791	00:05:35,583	| VfD_E17 |	that for me to take time away to
EDL	00:05:35,583	00:05:36,583	| VfD_E17 |	to take time out
EDL	00:05:36,583	00:05:38,125	| VfD_E17 |	to go for my graduate degree

EDL	00:05:38,125	00:05:39,666	| VfD_E17 |	was actually putting me behind
EDL	00:05:40,166	00:05:44,791	| VfD_E17 |	Because I was not getting to participate in all the game-changing new process

EDL	00:05:44,791	00:05:46,833	| VfD_E17 |	And chip design technologies
EDL	00:05:46,833	00:05:48,125	| VfD_E17 |	that were being produced

EDL	00:05:48,625	00:05:50,416	| VfD_E17 |	So I did take a few graduate courses
EDL	00:05:50,916	00:05:53,500	| VfD_E17 |	And at that point decided no I really want to
EDL	00:05:53,500	00:05:54,250	| VfD_E17 |	Being on the
EDL	00:05:54,250	00:05:55,541	| VfD_E17 |	The ground floor stuff
EDL	00:05:55,541	00:05:57,083	| VfD_E17 |	(right) I just never look back
EDL	00:05:57,083	00:06:00,916	| VfD_E17 |	I've been very fortunate to be surrounded by just incredible human beings

** rising tide raises all ships

EDL	00:06:00,916	00:06:04,250	| VfD_E17 |	there's this notion of a rising tide raises all ships

EDL	00:06:04,750	00:06:08,833	| VfD_E17 |	And I've been so fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by truly incredible
EDL	00:06:08,833	00:06:11,166	| VfD_E17 |	human beings.. that continues here

EDL	00:06:11,166	00:06:14,750	| VfD_E17 |	There's one other thing that I think emerge probably largely out of your ID
EDL	00:06:14,750	00:06:15,500	| VfD_E17 |	Am experience
EDL	00:06:16,041	00:06:18,333	| VfD_E17 |	And that's your hundred and fifty-five
EDL	00:06:18,833	00:06:22,166	| VfD_E17 |	Who knows by now maybe this week you got another one
EDL	00:06:22,166	00:06:24,208	| VfD_E17 |	Tell me a little bit about
EDL	00:06:24,208	00:06:26,250	| VfD_E17 |	Some of the ones say that
EDL	00:06:26,791	00:06:31,125	| VfD_E17 |	Sick in your mind most that you're most proud of or that perhaps had the most consequence
EDL	00:06:32,166	00:06:34,208	| VfD_E17 |	Perhaps the one that sticks out in my mind
EDL	00:06:34,708	00:06:35,458	| VfD_E17 |	The
EDL	00:06:35,458	00:06:36,250	| VfD_E17 |	Foremost
EDL	00:06:36,250	00:06:37,541	| VfD_E17 |	Is general purpose
EDL	00:06:38,041	00:06:38,791	| VfD_E17 |	Registers
EDL	00:06:38,791	00:06:39,833	| VfD_E17 |	for high performance
EDL	00:06:39,833	00:06:40,583	| VfD_E17 |	Computing
EDL	00:06:40,583	00:06:44,416	| VfD_E17 |	At the time and you'll have to explain that for me and what does that mean
EDL	00:06:44,958	00:06:45,708	| VfD_E17 |	So
EDL	00:06:46,750	00:06:48,541	| VfD_E17 |	Clearly and thread parallel machines
EDL	00:06:49,041	00:06:52,875	| VfD_E17 |	There's simultaneous need for the same data in multiple locations
EDL	00:06:52,875	00:06:53,666	| VfD_E17 |	In microprocessor
EDL	00:06:54,416	00:06:55,208	| VfD_E17 |	And at the time
EDL	00:06:55,708	00:06:57,250	| VfD_E17 |	The notion was well let's keep
EDL	00:06:57,250	00:07:00,041	| VfD_E17 |	Keep interrogating a memory over and over and
EDL	00:07:00,041	00:07:01,083	| VfD_E17 |	Send its results
EDL	00:07:01,083	00:07:02,625	| VfD_E17 |	To each of the separate place
EDL	00:07:02,625	00:07:03,625	| VfD_E17 |	This is where it might be needed
EDL	00:07:04,166	00:07:05,666	| VfD_E17 |	The GPR
EDL	00:07:05,666	00:07:06,958	| VfD_E17 |	The general purpose register
EDL	00:07:07,458	00:07:08,000	| VfD_E17 |	Invention
EDL	00:07:08,750	00:07:10,041	| VfD_E17 |	How did I develop with her
EDL	00:07:10,041	00:07:10,791	| VfD_E17 |	13
EDL	00:07:10,791	00:07:14,125	| VfD_E17 |	Allowed us to simultaneously access the same data
EDL	00:07:14,125	00:07:15,166	| VfD_E17 |	And send it to
EDL	00:07:15,166	00:07:16,416	| VfD_E17 |	Different locations
EDL	00:07:16,416	00:07:17,208	| VfD_E17 |	At the same time
EDL	00:07:17,958	00:07:18,500	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:07:19,000	00:07:22,333	| VfD_E17 |	It it found its way into a lot of very high performance
EDL	00:07:22,333	00:07:23,083	| VfD_E17 |	Which computer application
EDL	00:07:23,875	00:07:24,625	| VfD_E17 |	If I was to this day
EDL	00:07:24,625	00:07:27,958	| VfD_E17 |	And went when did you make this development and get this patent
EDL	00:07:28,458	00:07:33,083	| VfD_E17 |	Early my career is one of one of my first one said sometime in the 80s
EDL	00:07:33,083	00:07:34,375	| VfD_E17 |	Yes, late 80s.
EDL	00:07:34,375	00:07:40,750	| VfD_E17 |	Okay so let's not move to your DARPA adventure and another thing I really like to learn about from PMs
EDL	00:07:40,750	00:07:44,000	| VfD_E17 |	is the mechanism by which you ended up getting here
EDL	00:07:44,333	00:07:49,958	| VfD_E17 |	So some .. a program manager and office director at a conference
EDL	00:07:49,958	00:07:55,083	| VfD_E17 |	Others just were in love with DARPA for years and years and they kind of made the initial
EDL	00:07:55,625	00:07:56,625	| VfD_E17 |	I reach out
EDL	00:07:56,625	00:07:58,666	| VfD_E17 |	How how did you actually end up here
EDL	00:07:59,708	00:08:01,250	| VfD_E17 |	So without going Kiki on you
EDL	00:08:01,750	00:08:04,291	| VfD_E17 |	Over the 30 years that I was at IBM
EDL	00:08:04,833	00:08:06,875	| VfD_E17 |	This this happened about seven years ago
EDL	00:08:08,166	00:08:09,416	| VfD_E17 |	About 7 years ago
EDL	00:08:09,958	00:08:11,458	| VfD_E17 |	There was a
EDL	00:08:11,458	00:08:14,541	| VfD_E17 |	I was involved of course in the design and
EDL	00:08:14,541	00:08:15,583	| VfD_E17 |	Fabrication
EDL	00:08:16,208	00:08:17,875	| VfD_E17 |	of high performance
EDL	00:08:17,875	00:08:18,916	| VfD_E17 |	computing elements
EDL	00:08:19,666	00:08:20,416	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:08:20,416	00:08:22,500	| VfD_E17 |	Became apparent there was a class of
EDL	00:08:22,500	00:08:23,250	| VfD_E17 |	Defects
EDL	00:08:23,250	00:08:24,291	| VfD_E17 |	The class of failures
EDL	00:08:24,791	00:08:25,833	| VfD_E17 |	That were
EDL	00:08:25,833	00:08:27,333	| VfD_E17 |	Exquisitely difficult
EDL	00:08:27,333	00:08:28,125	| VfD_E17 |	to
EDL	00:08:28,125	00:08:28,875	| VfD_E17 |	diagnosis
EDL	00:08:29,666	00:08:31,958	| VfD_E17 |	And very difficult to image
EDL	00:08:32,708	00:08:34,000	| VfD_E17 |	Or to 
EDL	00:08:34,000	00:08:34,791	| VfD_E17 |	Try to Define
EDL	00:08:35,291	00:08:37,333	| VfD_E17 |	But none the less they impacted the yield 
EDL	00:08:37,833	00:08:38,625	| VfD_E17 |	Performance
EDL	00:08:38,625	00:08:39,375	| VfD_E17 |	And in some cases
EDL	00:08:39,875	00:08:41,666	| VfD_E17 |	Even had the ability to change
EDL	00:08:41,666	00:08:42,458	| VfD_E17 |	What the
EDL	00:08:42,458	00:08:44,041	| VfD_E17 |	Computer chip was supposed to do
EDL	00:08:44,041	00:08:48,583	| VfD_E17 |	 so you're talking about defects that really go all the way down to sort of the
EDL	00:08:48,583	00:08:51,916	| VfD_E17 |	Micron scale the transistor level element level
EDL	00:08:51,916	00:08:58,333	| VfD_E17 |	Scale of of these chips right? - You're exactly right and I am not smart enough to be a high-level 
EDL	00:08:58,333	00:08:59,333	| VfD_E17 |	achitect I was very much
EDL	00:08:59,875	00:09:01,416	| VfD_E17 |	A hardware engineer
EDL	00:09:01,416	00:09:03,708	| VfD_E17 |	Very much about the hardware the physical design
EDL	00:09:04,208	00:09:10,083	| VfD_E17 |	And fabrication of the actually - [..] and again to give the listeners vision of this I believe we're probably talking
EDL	00:09:10,083	00:09:15,208	| VfD_E17 |	about defects that could be the size of like individual biological cells 50 microns across
EDL	00:09:15,208	00:09:16,250	| VfD_E17 |	Even smaller
EDL	00:09:16,250	00:09:17,000	| VfD_E17 |	Indeed
EDL	00:09:17,000	00:09:19,583	| VfD_E17 |	Indeed and as technology scale
EDL	00:09:19,583	00:09:22,916	| VfD_E17 |	The size of the defects that were vulnerable to also
EDL	00:09:22,916	00:09:23,666	| VfD_E17 |	Continue
EDL	00:09:23,666	00:09:24,416	| VfD_E17 |	to shrink so 
EDL	00:09:24,416	00:09:25,458	| VfD_E17 |	It's essentially
EDL	00:09:25,458	00:09:26,250	| VfD_E17 |	to keep
EDL	00:09:26,250	00:09:27,750	| VfD_E17 |	A very very clean environment
EDL	00:09:28,541	00:09:29,291	| VfD_E17 |	So
EDL	00:09:29,291	00:09:32,125	| VfD_E17 |	It became clear to me that there was a class of defects
EDL	00:09:32,625	00:09:33,833	| VfD_E17 |	That we were vulnerable to
EDL	00:09:34,166	00:09:36,708	| VfD_E17 |	Not just from a yield or functional point of view
EDL	00:09:36,708	00:09:38,791	| VfD_E17 |	But that potentially someone malicious
EDL	00:09:38,791	00:09:41,083	| VfD_E17 |	Could intentionally assert upon a process
EDL	00:09:41,833	00:09:43,125	| VfD_E17 |	Or a pond design
EDL	00:09:43,875	00:09:44,666	| VfD_E17 |	to
EDL	00:09:44,666	00:09:45,666	| VfD_E17 |	Perhaps
EDL	00:09:46,708	00:09:47,208	| VfD_E17 |	Compromise
EDL	00:09:48,000	00:09:51,583	| VfD_E17 |	The component or its function or its reliability its lifetime
EDL	00:09:52,333	00:09:54,125	| VfD_E17 |	Make a long story short I
EDL	00:09:54,125	00:09:55,416	| VfD_E17 |	Became a
EDL	00:09:55,416	00:09:56,166	| VfD_E17 |	Contractor
EDL	00:09:56,166	00:09:57,208	| VfD_E17 |	Consultant to DARPA
EDL	00:09:57,708	00:10:01,041	| VfD_E17 |	And - and with this consulting era
EDL	00:10:01,041	00:10:06,416	| VfD_E17 |	Or phase of your intersection with DARPA was that begin to define the kinds of programs
EDL	00:10:06,416	00:10:07,958	| VfD_E17 |	That you ultimately would end up
EDL	00:10:08,458	00:10:09,000	| VfD_E17 |	Running
EDL	00:10:09,500	00:10:15,125	| VfD_E17 |	With the aim of addressing the concerns that you learned about when you're ... - indeed initially it was
EDL	00:10:15,125	00:10:16,666	| VfD_E17 |	To consult an existing program
EDL	00:10:17,416	00:10:18,208	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:10:18,208	00:10:18,708	| VfD_E17 |	I
EDL	00:10:19,458	00:10:21,541	| VfD_E17 |	Became involved in actually doing things
EDL	00:10:22,041	00:10:22,791	| VfD_E17 |	To computer chips
EDL	00:10:23,333	00:10:24,083	| VfD_E17 |	And then
EDL	00:10:24,833	00:10:27,166	| VfD_E17 |	The DARPA program would hire
EDL	00:10:27,166	00:10:29,208	| VfD_E17 |	Reverse Engineers to try to find
EDL	00:10:29,708	00:10:30,500	| VfD_E17 |	What was done
EDL	00:10:31,500	00:10:32,541	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:10:32,541	00:10:33,833	| VfD_E17 |	We continue to make progress
EDL	00:10:34,583	00:10:35,333	| VfD_E17 |	At both.
EDL	00:10:35,333	00:10:35,875	| VfD_E17 |	Detecting
EDL	00:10:36,375	00:10:38,166	| VfD_E17 |	Identifying those
EDL	00:10:38,916	00:10:41,250	| VfD_E17 |	Those features which couldn't couldn't be detected
EDL	00:10:42,000	00:10:42,791	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:10:43,291	00:10:44,833	| VfD_E17 |	One thing led to another and after
EDL	00:10:45,583	00:10:48,416	| VfD_E17 |	After about a year of consulting, DARPA finally said why aren't
EDL	00:10:48,416	00:10:49,416	| VfD_E17 |	you come to DARPA
EDL	00:10:49,416	00:10:51,208	| VfD_E17 |	So I retired from IBM at that point
EDL	00:10:51,750	00:10:52,750	| VfD_E17 |	Then came to DARPA
EDL	00:10:52,750	00:10:53,250	| VfD_E17 |	To assume
EDL	00:10:54,041	00:10:56,083	| VfD_E17 |	The swim lane, if you will, the swim lane of
EDL	00:10:56,583	00:10:57,875	| VfD_E17 |	hardware security
EDL	00:10:57,875	00:10:59,166	| VfD_E17 |	Right and released
EDL	00:10:59,166	00:11:01,958	| VfD_E17 |	Three of your programs and the names of them really kind of
EDL	00:11:01,958	00:11:07,083	| VfD_E17 |	Reflect just some of the goal that you have had in mind that I've been working toward
EDL	00:11:07,083	00:11:11,208	| VfD_E17 |	some referring to Trusted Integrated Circuits which is known as
EDL	00:11:11,208	00:11:13,000	| VfD_E17 |	In the short form is Trust
EDL	00:11:13,500	00:11:17,333	| VfD_E17 |	Integrity and Reliability of Integrated Circuits known as IRIC
EDL	00:11:17,333	00:11:21,250	| VfD_E17 |	And the Supply-chain Hardware Integrity for Electronics Defense
EDL	00:11:21,666	00:11:22,458	| VfD_E17 |	Which
EDL	00:11:22,458	00:11:25,000	| VfD_E17 |	Is .. known in short as SHIELD
EDL	00:11:25,000	00:11:29,625	| VfD_E17 |	Each one has its own individual aspects but together there's a certain kind of theme
EDL	00:11:29,625	00:11:31,916	| VfD_E17 |	And I'm wondering if you can actually sort of talked about them
EDL	00:11:31,916	00:11:33,208	| VfD_E17 |	Collectively
EDL	00:11:33,208	00:11:36,291	| VfD_E17 |	And of course diving into each one as you might
EDL	00:11:36,291	00:11:38,083	| VfD_E17 |	Feel so inclined - indeed
EDL	00:11:38,583	00:11:39,875	| VfD_E17 |	God bless our warfighters
EDL	00:11:40,375	00:11:41,666	| VfD_E17 |	It is critical now
EDL	00:11:42,166	00:11:43,208	| VfD_E17 |	For us
EDL	00:11:43,208	00:11:44,208	| VfD_E17 |	To make sure that
EDL	00:11:44,708	00:11:48,291	| VfD_E17 |	Not just the mission is successful that that were protecting the warfighters
EDL	00:11:48,833	00:11:50,083	| VfD_E17 |	executing at mission
EDL	00:11:50,083	00:11:51,625	| VfD_E17 |	The electronic components
EDL	00:11:51,625	00:11:53,416	| VfD_E17 |	We used to support that mission
EDL	00:11:54,208	00:11:55,750	| VfD_E17 |	Need to be
EDL	00:11:55,750	00:11:57,000	| VfD_E17 |	Authentic
EDL	00:11:57,000	00:12:01,125	| VfD_E17 |	We need to make sure that those parts do no more and no less than they're supposed to
EDL	00:12:01,125	00:12:04,416	| VfD_E17 |	But they were built where they claim to be when they were claimed to be
EDL	00:12:04,416	00:12:07,500	| VfD_E17 |	We have to make sure that they last for the full stated lifetime
EDL	00:12:08,041	00:12:09,541	| VfD_E17 |	We have to make sure that
EDL	00:12:09,541	00:12:10,833	| VfD_E17 |	There is no
EDL	00:12:10,833	00:12:14,666	| VfD_E17 |	Nothing done to that component during the supply chain during distribution
EDL	00:12:15,208	00:12:17,000	| VfD_E17 |	But there are no Trojan horses
EDL	00:12:17,000	00:12:18,125	| VfD_E17 |	Or Easter eggs
EDL	00:12:18,125	00:12:19,791	| VfD_E17 |	If you will better built in
EDL	00:12:19,791	00:12:22,375	| VfD_E17 |	And this is challenging right to rebuke because in the
EDL	00:12:22,875	00:12:25,166	| VfD_E17 |	Creation of a chip in the fabrication of a chip
EDL	00:12:25,666	00:12:27,208	| VfD_E17 |	There's so many players
EDL	00:12:27,208	00:12:28,750	| VfD_E17 |	It's so many different places that
EDL	00:12:29,250	00:12:30,541	| VfD_E17 |	And somebody can have your fingers on it
EDL	00:12:31,041	00:12:32,833	| VfD_E17 |	That that you really need some way of tracking ...
EDL	00:12:32,833	00:12:33,875	| VfD_E17 |	That's exactly right
EDL	00:12:34,375	00:12:35,666	| VfD_E17 |	Once Upon a Time
EDL	00:12:35,666	00:12:38,500	| VfD_E17 |	Chain of custody was a sufficient means
EDL	00:12:38,500	00:12:39,750	| VfD_E17 |	Up tracking
EDL	00:12:39,750	00:12:42,083	| VfD_E17 |	The authenticity and integrity of our component
EDL	00:12:42,833	00:12:44,375	| VfD_E17 |	But micro-electronics
EDL	00:12:44,375	00:12:45,666	| VfD_E17 |	Has indeed become global
EDL	00:12:46,166	00:12:49,000	| VfD_E17 |	And right about the time that I warned DARPA
EDL	00:12:50,000	00:12:51,041	| VfD_E17 |	That there could be
EDL	00:12:51,541	00:12:53,083	| VfD_E17 |	An issue in the space
EDL	00:12:53,833	00:12:55,125	| VfD_E17 |	The electronics
EDL	00:12:55,125	00:12:56,166	| VfD_E17 |	Space indeed
EDL	00:12:56,166	00:12:56,916	| VfD_E17 |	Went global
EDL	00:12:56,916	00:12:58,458	| VfD_E17 |	This the design is
EDL	00:12:58,458	00:13:00,000	| VfD_E17 |	We're not the only smart
EDL	00:13:00,000	00:13:00,500	| VfD_E17 |	people in the world
EDL	00:13:01,541	00:13:02,291	| VfD_E17 |	And so
EDL	00:13:02,291	00:13:03,041	| VfD_E17 |	Because of this
EDL	00:13:03,041	00:13:04,583	| VfD_E17 |	It was critical
EDL	00:13:04,583	00:13:06,916	| VfD_E17 |	That we develop those tools necessary
EDL	00:13:07,416	00:13:08,166	| VfD_E17 |	to
EDL	00:13:08,708	00:13:09,958	| VfD_E17 |	To be able to
EDL	00:13:09,958	00:13:11,250	| VfD_E17 |	Confirm the Integrity of the
EDL	00:13:12,791	00:13:18,916	| VfD_E17 |	One of the most audacious trajectory that you've been taking and I get it just amazes me the progress that you and your performers have been making
EDL	00:13:19,958	00:13:20,708	| VfD_E17 |	Is
EDL	00:13:20,708	00:13:21,250	| VfD_E17 |	With
EDL	00:13:21,750	00:13:24,041	| VfD_E17 |	Tiny little triplets about the size of
EDL	00:13:24,041	00:13:25,333	| VfD_E17 |	Glitter particles
EDL	00:13:25,333	00:13:27,625	| VfD_E17 |	I don't want to say anything more cuz I want you to
EDL	00:13:27,625	00:13:29,958	| VfD_E17 |	Tell listeners that just what you been up to with your
EDL	00:13:29,958	00:13:31,208	| VfD_E17 |	performers on this task
EDL	00:13:31,208	00:13:33,000	| VfD_E17 |	Before you even go there
EDL	00:13:33,000	00:13:34,291	| VfD_E17 |	I'm reminded that
EDL	00:13:34,291	00:13:36,583	| VfD_E17 |	It's one thing to come up with a challenge
EDL	00:13:36,583	00:13:37,875	| VfD_E17 |	But it's quite another
EDL	00:13:38,375	00:13:39,416	| VfD_E17 |	To go
EDL	00:13:39,416	00:13:39,916	| VfD_E17 |	Execute
EDL	00:13:40,416	00:13:41,458	| VfD_E17 |	to go accomplish
EDL	00:13:41,458	00:13:42,250	| VfD_E17 |	Such a challenge
EDL	00:13:42,750	00:13:44,791	| VfD_E17 |	And to be clear the heroes in the space
EDL	00:13:45,291	00:13:47,333	| VfD_E17 |	Are the performers that DARPA has
EDL	00:13:47,875	00:13:48,625	| VfD_E17 |	hired
EDL	00:13:48,625	00:13:49,666	| VfD_E17 |	Be a contract
EDL	00:13:49,666	00:13:51,041	| VfD_E17 |	To go solve this issue
EDL	00:13:51,458	00:13:54,000	| VfD_E17 |	I'm astounded daily just
EDL	00:13:54,000	00:13:54,500	| VfD_E17 |	the
EDL	00:13:55,291	00:13:58,875	| VfD_E17 |	creativity the amount of themselves that they pour into the [...]
EDL	00:13:58,875	00:14:01,958	| VfD_E17 |	they skip holidays, they stay home over
EDL	00:14:02,458	00:14:02,958	| VfD_E17 |	they, they work
EDL	00:14:03,458	00:14:06,041	| VfD_E17 |	through Christmas sometimes in order to deliver
EDL	00:14:06,041	00:14:07,041	| VfD_E17 |	Products
EDL	00:14:07,041	00:14:07,583	| VfD_E17 |	such as those
EDL	00:14:08,333	00:14:10,375	| VfD_E17 |	The one that you're referring to , SHIELD
EDL	00:14:10,375	00:14:11,916	| VfD_E17 |	The threat space is large
EDL	00:14:11,916	00:14:12,708	| VfD_E17 |	The threat space
EDL	00:14:13,208	00:14:16,041	| VfD_E17 |	Of micro electronic component begins in design
EDL	00:14:16,041	00:14:17,541	| VfD_E17 |	It goes right through fabrication
EDL	00:14:18,083	00:14:22,166	| VfD_E17 |	And then after fabrication and packaging it goes through distribution
EDL	00:14:22,666	00:14:24,208	| VfD_E17 |	SHIELD is a taggant (标签剂, 原意"为了预防不法使用 而在炸药添加的物质,使它在爆炸后能被辨认出来")
EDL	00:14:25,000	00:14:25,750	| VfD_E17 |	Shield
EDL	00:14:25,750	00:14:28,291	| VfD_E17 |	Is is a means of authenticating
EDL	00:14:28,291	00:14:29,333	| VfD_E17 |	The parts that
EDL	00:14:29,333	00:14:29,833	| VfD_E17 |	We
EDL	00:14:30,375	00:14:33,166	| VfD_E17 |	Use it are most sensitive applications they have
EDL	00:14:33,166	00:14:34,708	| VfD_E17 |	To be the correct part
EDL	00:14:34,708	00:14:38,791	| VfD_E17 |	For a number of reasons the existing authentication technologies were
EDL	00:14:38,791	00:14:40,333	| VfD_E17 |	necessary but not
EDL	00:14:40,333	00:14:40,833	| VfD_E17 |	sufficient
EDL	00:14:41,375	00:14:43,666	| VfD_E17 |	So SHIELD is a microscopic taggant(标签剂)
EDL	00:14:43,666	00:14:47,500	| VfD_E17 |	We hope to get it into the world records here before we are all done
EDL	00:14:48,041	00:14:51,333	| VfD_E17 |	But it is used to make sure that this is the part
EDL	00:14:52,125	00:14:53,666	| VfD_E17 |	that we intended
EDL	00:14:53,666	00:14:54,916	| VfD_E17 |	to go into
EDL	00:14:54,916	00:14:55,708	| VfD_E17 |	our defenses
EDL	00:14:56,708	00:14:58,250	| VfD_E17 |	It has five special sauces
EDL	00:14:58,791	00:14:59,791	| VfD_E17 |	The first
EDL	00:14:59,791	00:15:02,083	| VfD_E17 |	Is a hardware root of trust
EDL	00:15:02,625	00:15:04,916	| VfD_E17 |	Every single microscopic
EDL	00:15:04,916	00:15:05,666	| VfD_E17 |	Shield
EDL	00:15:05,666	00:15:06,458	| VfD_E17 |	Chip
EDL	00:15:06,458	00:15:08,250	| VfD_E17 |	Has a unique identifier
EDL	00:15:09,000	00:15:09,791	| VfD_E17 |	II
EDL	00:15:10,541	00:15:11,833	| VfD_E17 |	Special Sauce
EDL	00:15:11,833	00:15:14,125	| VfD_E17 |	that each SHIELD die(压模) contains
EDL	00:15:14,125	00:15:16,708	| VfD_E17 |	Is an AES 256-bit
EDL	00:15:16,708	00:15:17,708	| VfD_E17 |	Encryption engine
EDL	00:15:17,708	00:15:19,000	| VfD_E17 |	100000 transistors
EDL	00:15:19,500	00:15:21,833	| VfD_E17 |	On a chip that is 100 microns by odd
EDL	00:15:21,833	00:15:22,333	| VfD_E17 |	Backgrounds
EDL	00:15:23,083	00:15:24,125	| VfD_E17 |	The 3rd
EDL	00:15:24,125	00:15:25,666	| VfD_E17 |	Is sensors that sense
EDL	00:15:26,166	00:15:26,916	| VfD_E17 |	If
EDL	00:15:26,916	00:15:29,250	| VfD_E17 |	The SHIELD ship has been corrupted
EDL	00:15:29,250	00:15:30,000	| VfD_E17 |	Compromised
EDL	00:15:30,791	00:15:33,583	| VfD_E17 |	Could [doucled] any given way
EDL	00:15:34,625	00:15:35,375	| VfD_E17 |	The 4th
EDL	00:15:35,375	00:15:36,166	| VfD_E17 |	Is an antenna
EDL	00:15:36,666	00:15:38,458	| VfD_E17 |	Because it's way too small
EDL	00:15:38,458	00:15:38,958	| VfD_E17 |	Contact
EDL	00:15:39,458	00:15:43,333	| VfD_E17 |	And so because that we have to talk to with RF - You mean physical contact is just too small
EDL	00:15:43,333	00:15:43,833	| VfD_E17 |	That's correct
EDL	00:15:44,833	00:15:46,375	| VfD_E17 |	V is
EDL	00:15:46,375	00:15:47,416	| VfD_E17 |	Self destruct capability
EDL	00:15:47,916	00:15:49,458	| VfD_E17 |	But if you attempt to remove it
EDL	00:15:49,458	00:15:50,250	| VfD_E17 |	From The Host
EDL	00:15:50,250	00:15:51,000	| VfD_E17 |	Component
EDL	00:15:51,000	00:15:52,541	| VfD_E17 |	It will cease to be functional
EDL	00:15:53,541	00:15:54,833	| VfD_E17 |	The part is powered
EDL	00:15:55,333	00:15:56,625	| VfD_E17 |	By the
EDL	00:15:56,625	00:15:58,583	| VfD_E17 |	By the interrogator
EDL	00:15:58,583	00:16:00,250	| VfD_E17 |	It is completely seperated from 
EDL	00:16:00,250	00:16:01,000	| VfD_E17 |	from the host component
EDL	00:16:01,500	00:16:03,541	| VfD_E17 |	The goal is that at any time
EDL	00:16:04,041	00:16:04,833	| VfD_E17 |	At any place
EDL	00:16:05,333	00:16:06,875	| VfD_E17 |	An untrained operator
EDL	00:16:06,875	00:16:10,958	| VfD_E17 |	with no special equipment in this case being just an iPhone or smartphone
EDL	00:16:11,458	00:16:13,541	| VfD_E17 |	Can test the integrity of their components
EDL	00:16:14,041	00:16:15,041	| VfD_E17 |	At any time and place
EDL	00:16:15,583	00:16:16,583	| VfD_E17 |	And get immediate
EDL	00:16:16,583	00:16:17,625	| VfD_E17 |	Trustworthy
EDL	00:16:17,625	00:16:18,375	| VfD_E17 |	Results
EDL	00:16:18,375	00:16:18,916	| VfD_E17 |	For free
EDL	00:16:19,666	00:16:21,208	| VfD_E17 |	SHIELD cost one tenth of a cent
EDL	00:16:22,250	00:16:25,541	| VfD_E17 |	And the entire operation would cost less than $0.01
EDL	00:16:26,083	00:16:26,833	| VfD_E17 |	Every time
EDL	00:16:26,833	00:16:28,375	| VfD_E17 |	You wished authenticate the part
EDL	00:16:29,125	00:16:32,708	| VfD_E17 |	When you authenticate the part it also reports the GPS location
EDL	00:16:32,708	00:16:35,041	| VfD_E17 |	And the TCP IP network address
EDL	00:16:35,541	00:16:36,958	| VfD_E17 |	Of where it was tested
EDL	00:16:37,333	00:16:38,375	| VfD_E17 |	In this way
EDL	00:16:38,375	00:16:40,416	| VfD_E17 |	At least for the most
EDL	00:16:40,416	00:16:40,916	| VfD_E17 |	Serious
EDL	00:16:41,416	00:16:43,208	| VfD_E17 |	Over counterfeit(伪造者) in clone threats
EDL	00:16:43,750	00:16:46,291	| VfD_E17 |	We believe we have a very cost effective solution
EDL	00:16:46,791	00:16:48,333	| VfD_E17 |	The goal is to make sure that
EDL	00:16:48,833	00:16:50,625	| VfD_E17 |	Counterfeiting and cloning
EDL	00:16:50,625	00:16:51,166	| VfD_E17 |	Becomes
EDL	00:16:51,666	00:16:52,708	| VfD_E17 |	Too expensive
EDL	00:16:52,708	00:16:53,958	| VfD_E17 |	and takes too long
EDL	00:16:53,958	00:16:55,000	| VfD_E17 |	For the bad guy
EDL	00:16:55,750	00:16:59,333	| VfD_E17 |	Right absolutely amazing description I mean this sounds to me like a bat
EDL	00:16:59,875	00:17:01,916	| VfD_E17 |	The highest of high technology
EDL	00:17:01,916	00:17:04,708	| VfD_E17 |	A certain length in the synthesis the way you're mixing and matching
EDL	00:17:04,708	00:17:09,083	| VfD_E17 |	Different kinds of Technologies also is just to me one of the things that characterizes
EDL	00:17:09,083	00:17:15,208	| VfD_E17 |	A lot of what's going on here at DARPA - one thing I'm somewhat of a pain in the rear to my performers about
EDL	00:17:15,208	00:17:18,291	| VfD_E17 |	Because I'm just a knuckle-dragger hardware engineer
EDL	00:17:18,291	00:17:19,583	| VfD_E17 |	Everything we do
EDL	00:17:19,583	00:17:21,625	| VfD_E17 |	You have to be able to hold it in your hand
EDL	00:17:22,125	00:17:23,666	| VfD_E17 |	And this is a program
EDL	00:17:23,666	00:17:29,208	| VfD_E17 |	Especially this program where it's not rainbows coming out of keyboards are unicorns sleeping over Terminals 
EDL	00:17:29,208	00:17:30,833	| VfD_E17 |	and magic will happen
EDL	00:17:30,833	00:17:32,125	| VfD_E17 |	This has to be
EDL	00:17:32,125	00:17:32,875	| VfD_E17 |	Deterministic
EDL	00:17:33,416	00:17:34,166	| VfD_E17 |	Quantitative
EDL	00:17:34,666	00:17:37,250	| VfD_E17 |	Very analytic real engineering
EDL	00:17:37,750	00:17:40,833	| VfD_E17 |	And after the initial technologies were developed
EDL	00:17:40,833	00:17:41,583	| VfD_E17 |	SHIELD
EDL	00:17:41,583	00:17:42,375	| VfD_E17 |	Is about
EDL	00:17:42,375	00:17:43,625	| VfD_E17 |	Good engineering
EDL	00:17:43,625	00:17:44,666	| VfD_E17 |	We've engineered
EDL	00:17:44,666	00:17:45,666	| VfD_E17 |	A beautiful product
EDL	00:17:45,666	00:17:48,000	| VfD_E17 |	All right well since you're all about that kind of ground truthing
EDL	00:17:48,500	00:17:50,791	| VfD_E17 |	Where are we at with the with this
EDL	00:17:51,333	00:17:53,375	| VfD_E17 |	Program with these tiny little
EDL	00:17:53,375	00:17:55,416	| VfD_E17 |	Triplets how would you characterize the status
EDL	00:17:56,166	00:17:57,958	| VfD_E17 |	SHIELD is a 3-phase program
EDL	00:17:58,500	00:18:00,791	| VfD_E17 |	Phase one was to go develop
EDL	00:18:00,791	00:18:02,833	| VfD_E17 |	Those five core Technologies
EDL	00:18:02,833	00:18:04,625	| VfD_E17 |	Because they really did not exist
EDL	00:18:04,625	00:18:06,416	| VfD_E17 |	At that scale all five
EDL	00:18:06,416	00:18:07,958	| VfD_E17 |	Have been demonstrated to be
EDL	00:18:07,958	00:18:08,458	| VfD_E17 |	Functional
EDL	00:18:09,000	00:18:12,583	| VfD_E17 |	Phase two is the integration of those technologies
EDL	00:18:12,583	00:18:13,833	| VfD_E17 |	Into the shield
EDL	00:18:13,833	00:18:14,375	| VfD_E17 |	Prototype
EDL	00:18:15,125	00:18:16,916	| VfD_E17 |	Phase 3 of the program
EDL	00:18:16,916	00:18:18,208	| VfD_E17 |	Which is the field test
EDL	00:18:19,458	00:18:20,750	| VfD_E17 |	Of Shield
EDL	00:18:20,750	00:18:21,791	| VfD_E17 |	Will begin
EDL	00:18:21,791	00:18:23,333	| VfD_E17 |	Early in 2018
EDL	00:18:23,833	00:18:25,125	| VfD_E17 |	The field testing
EDL	00:18:25,125	00:18:27,416	| VfD_E17 |	Is supported by
EDL	00:18:28,166	00:18:32,541	| VfD_E17 |	Some wonderful companies that we won't identify right now that have volunteered their supply chain
EDL	00:18:33,041	00:18:34,333	| VfD_E17 |	And we will do things
EDL	00:18:34,333	00:18:35,333	| VfD_E17 |	What's the components
EDL	00:18:35,333	00:18:36,625	| VfD_E17 |	Windshield attached
EDL	00:18:36,625	00:18:38,416	| VfD_E17 |	And use their supply chains
EDL	00:18:38,916	00:18:41,250	| VfD_E17 |	And we will see how effective Shield is
EDL	00:18:41,250	00:18:43,291	| VfD_E17 |	In catching compromises
EDL	00:18:43,291	00:18:44,833	| VfD_E17 |	So Kerry, we've talked about
EDL	00:18:44,833	00:18:45,583	| VfD_E17 |	Shield
EDL	00:18:45,583	00:18:51,750	| VfD_E17 |	I do want to go back to to the other programs that you work on one of them is completed now and one of them is still in progress it was
EDL	00:18:52,250	00:18:55,041	| VfD_E17 |	Start with trusted integrated circuits (TRUST) https://www.DARPA.mil/program/trusted-integrated-circuits
EDL	00:18:55,041	00:18:56,041	| VfD_E17 |	which I believed is
EDL	00:18:56,041	00:18:58,375	| VfD_E17 |	kind of one of the earliest programs you took on.
EDL	00:18:58,375	00:19:03,000	| VfD_E17 |	TRUST was the program that I actually began supporting before I entered DARPA
EDL	00:19:03,000	00:19:04,541	| VfD_E17 |	Trust was a program
EDL	00:19:04,541	00:19:07,083	| VfD_E17 |	To make sure that we could verify
EDL	00:19:07,083	00:19:10,916	| VfD_E17 |	that a part is doing no more and no less than it is supposed to do
EDL	00:19:11,458	00:19:13,750	| VfD_E17 |	Trust was a large program
EDL	00:19:13,750	00:19:15,791	| VfD_E17 |	Lots and lots of achievements
EDL	00:19:15,791	00:19:17,333	| VfD_E17 |	We developed microscopes
EDL	00:19:17,333	00:19:19,375	| VfD_E17 |	We develop solutions
EDL	00:19:19,375	00:19:22,791	| VfD_E17 |	For pulling netlist(网表) if you will
EDL	00:19:22,791	00:19:24,250	| VfD_E17 |	the schematic from chips
EDL	00:19:24,250	00:19:26,541	| VfD_E17 |	To make sure that the schematic is what it's supposed to
EDL	00:19:27,041	00:19:30,916	| VfD_E17 |	We look at both COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) product
EDL	00:19:30,916	00:19:32,958	| VfD_E17 |	As well as Gods parts
EDL	00:19:32,958	00:19:34,250	| VfD_E17 |	Government-owned components
EDL	00:19:34,750	00:19:37,541	| VfD_E17 |	We looked at field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)
EDL	00:19:38,083	00:19:39,625	| VfD_E17 |	As well as ASIC(专用芯片)
EDL	00:19:40,125	00:19:41,916	| VfD_E17 |	The output of that program
EDL	00:19:42,416	00:19:44,458	| VfD_E17 |	Is installed in a number of agencies
EDL	00:19:44,458	00:19:45,750	| VfD_E17 |	All over the country
EDL	00:19:46,250	00:19:47,541	| VfD_E17 |	And still being [...]
EDL	00:19:48,041	00:19:52,666	| VfD_E17 |	Ready when you mentioned ASIC, field programmable gate array (FPGA), those are just names for
EDL	00:19:52,666	00:19:55,208	| VfD_E17 |	other kinds of categories of integrated circuits
EDL	00:19:55,208	00:19:57,000	| VfD_E17 |	That have different capabilities
EDL	00:19:57,000	00:20:01,625	| VfD_E17 |	But all of which are used today and all of which we really need to feel very confident about - that is correct
EDL	00:20:01,625	00:20:03,416	| VfD_E17 |	So that's TRUST and that completed
EDL	00:20:03,916	00:20:07,250	| VfD_E17 |	A year or two ago when did that ... - yes, it included
EDL	00:20:07,250	00:20:08,041	| VfD_E17 |	About
EDL	00:20:08,041	00:20:09,041	| VfD_E17 |	18 month ago
EDL	00:20:09,041	00:20:13,666	| VfD_E17 |	So obviously there's parts of the spirit of that program that are part of SHIELD
EDL	00:20:13,666	00:20:18,500	| VfD_E17 |	And the other program I just wanted to say a little bit about this one continues
EDL	00:20:18,500	00:20:23,875	| VfD_E17 |	Today and that's the integrity and reliability of integrated circuits program or IRIS
EDL	00:20:24,416	00:20:26,708	| VfD_E17 |	The question that Iris answered was
EDL	00:20:27,208	00:20:29,250	| VfD_E17 |	If indeed we know that this component
EDL	00:20:30,041	00:20:31,583	| VfD_E17 |	Has not been compromised
EDL	00:20:31,583	00:20:32,333	| VfD_E17 |	In its function
EDL	00:20:32,833	00:20:35,666	| VfD_E17 |	Can we still be assured that it has not been compromised
EDL	00:20:35,666	00:20:36,416	| VfD_E17 |	And its integrity
EDL	00:20:37,208	00:20:38,750	| VfD_E17 |	How do we make sure with
EDL	00:20:38,750	00:20:40,291	| VfD_E17 |	With a low sample size
EDL	00:20:40,791	00:20:43,625	| VfD_E17 |	That this component indeed fulfills
EDL	00:20:43,625	00:20:44,875	| VfD_E17 |	Its lifetime spec
EDL	00:20:44,875	00:20:45,916	| VfD_E17 |	Its reliability
EDL	00:20:46,666	00:20:48,708	| VfD_E17 |	That it is up to the task
EDL	00:20:48,708	00:20:49,750	| VfD_E17 |	A performing
EDL	00:20:50,250	00:20:52,041	| VfD_E17 |	For $20,000 an hour
EDL	00:20:52,583	00:20:54,375	| VfD_E17 |	Or 100000 power in hours
EDL	00:20:54,375	00:20:55,875	| VfD_E17 |	Or whatever the spec is
EDL	00:20:55,875	00:20:57,666	| VfD_E17 |	That mission that is critical
EDL	00:20:57,666	00:20:58,208	| VfD_E17 |	2
EDL	00:21:00,000	00:21:01,250	| VfD_E17 |	To the defense
EDL	00:21:01,791	00:21:03,041	| VfD_E17 |	That it's installed in
EDL	00:21:03,041	00:21:08,625	| VfD_E17 |	Okay and this is to defend against such things as counterfeiting practice
EDL	00:21:08,625	00:21:14,083	| VfD_E17 |	where an old chip might be taken out of some unit it might then be blacktop right where new kind of
EDL	00:21:14,083	00:21:20,208	| VfD_E17 |	packaging is put on with new printing looks new but in fact it's old and so might not be able to actually live
EDL	00:21:20,208	00:21:21,000	| VfD_E17 |	Up to its
EDL	00:21:21,000	00:21:22,500	| VfD_E17 |	the spec that a user expects
EDL	00:21:22,500	00:21:23,541	| VfD_E17 |	That's correct Ivan
EDL	00:21:23,541	00:21:25,083	| VfD_E17 |	Just like human beings age
EDL	00:21:25,583	00:21:26,625	| VfD_E17 |	In automobiles rust
EDL	00:21:27,375	00:21:29,416	| VfD_E17 |	There's a lifetime to electronic components
EDL	00:21:29,958	00:21:30,708	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:21:30,708	00:21:34,791	| VfD_E17 |	The lifetime must be ... we depend on that lifetime when the system
EDL	00:21:35,333	00:21:35,833	| VfD_E17 |	Is built
EDL	00:21:36,333	00:21:38,125	| VfD_E17 |	For that part to execute its function
EDL	00:21:39,416	00:21:41,458	| VfD_E17 |	Even without the malicious intent
EDL	00:21:41,958	00:21:44,291	| VfD_E17 |	We need to know we need to be able to
EDL	00:21:44,291	00:21:45,833	| VfD_E17 |	Very quickly assess
EDL	00:21:46,583	00:21:48,375	| VfD_E17 |	The reliability
EDL	00:21:48,375	00:21:48,875	| VfD_E17 |	Of a part
EDL	00:21:49,416	00:21:50,166	| VfD_E17 |	and currently
EDL	00:21:50,666	00:21:52,208	| VfD_E17 |	The reliability science
EDL	00:21:52,208	00:21:53,000	| VfD_E17 |	Is is a
EDL	00:21:53,000	00:21:54,250	| VfD_E17 |	Is very involved
EDL	00:21:54,791	00:21:55,291	| VfD_E17 |	Painful
EDL	00:21:55,791	00:21:58,458	| VfD_E17 |	Long-term goal
EDL	00:21:58,875	00:21:59,625	| VfD_E17 |	And so
EDL	00:21:59,625	00:22:00,416	| VfD_E17 |	IRIS
EDL	00:22:00,416	00:22:01,166	| VfD_E17 |	Looked
EDL	00:22:01,166	00:22:02,708	| VfD_E17 |	To try to
EDL	00:22:02,708	00:22:04,000	| VfD_E17 |	Improve the turnaround
EDL	00:22:04,500	00:22:05,250	| VfD_E17 |	and the testing
EDL	00:22:05,250	00:22:05,791	| VfD_E17 |	Reliability
EDL	00:22:06,541	00:22:10,125	| VfD_E17 |	I want to move to a couple of other questions before we we close out
EDL	00:22:10,125	00:22:15,000	| VfD_E17 |	One of them is really I want you to reflect a little bit about micro electronics
EDL	00:22:15,000	00:22:16,791	| VfD_E17 |	As a technology in your
EDL	00:22:16,791	00:22:19,875	| VfD_E17 |	roll, your several decades roll in
EDL	00:22:20,375	00:22:26,000	| VfD_E17 |	Pushing that technology forward and doing whatever you can to ensure the integrity and safety of it
EDL	00:22:26,000	00:22:29,833	| VfD_E17 |	And you know with some programs even moving forward thinking about
EDL	00:22:29,833	00:22:34,708	| VfD_E17 |	Next generations of micro-electronic devices even in the nanoscale area
EDL	00:22:34,708	00:22:38,291	| VfD_E17 |	So so that we continue to have a
EDL	00:22:38,291	00:22:40,333	| VfD_E17 |	Progressive technology in micro-electronics
EDL	00:22:40,875	00:22:48,541	| VfD_E17 |	As you think about all of that me what excites you about this category of technology and, Kerry ,what concerns you about it
EDL	00:22:48,541	00:22:51,083	| VfD_E17 |	I've been few months ago I had the
EDL	00:22:51,083	00:22:52,375	| VfD_E17 |	Privilege of
EDL	00:22:52,875	00:22:56,208	| VfD_E17 |	Spending a week with a 311th Fighter Squadron
EDL	00:22:56,208	00:22:57,750	| VfD_E17 |	At Holloman Air Force Base
EDL	00:22:57,750	00:22:58,500	| VfD_E17 |	In New Mexico
EDL	00:22:59,041	00:23:01,333	| VfD_E17 |	And after spending a week of them sharing
EDL	00:23:01,333	00:23:02,375	| VfD_E17 |	With me
EDL	00:23:02,375	00:23:03,125	| VfD_E17 |	What they do
EDL	00:23:03,625	00:23:05,958	| VfD_E17 |	I have the opportunity at the end of that week
EDL	00:23:05,958	00:23:06,708	| VfD_E17 |	To describe
EDL	00:23:06,708	00:23:08,000	| VfD_E17 |	To them what I do
EDL	00:23:08,500	00:23:09,250	| VfD_E17 |	And that's when it hit me
EDL	00:23:10,291	00:23:13,375	| VfD_E17 |	My son is training to be an A-10
EDL	00:23:14,125	00:23:14,666	| VfD_E17 |	Fighter pilot
EDL	00:23:15,666	00:23:16,708	| VfD_E17 |	The warthog
EDL	00:23:17,458	00:23:19,250	| VfD_E17 |	And when I
EDL	00:23:19,250	00:23:20,791	| VfD_E17 |	Got in front of the audience
EDL	00:23:20,791	00:23:21,833	| VfD_E17 |	They all look like Mikey
EDL	00:23:22,333	00:23:23,375	| VfD_E17 |	They all look like
EDL	00:23:23,875	00:23:24,375	| VfD_E17 |	My son
EDL	00:23:25,125	00:23:26,166	| VfD_E17 |	And, I mean, it's hard
EDL	00:23:26,916	00:23:29,333	| VfD_E17 |	It's even hard now to talk about it
EDL	00:23:30,500	00:23:31,791	| VfD_E17 |	It's not just
EDL	00:23:33,083	00:23:35,125	| VfD_E17 |	As a DARPA program manager
EDL	00:23:35,125	00:23:36,666	| VfD_E17 |	or as an engineer
EDL	00:23:37,666	00:23:38,958	| VfD_E17 |	As a parent
EDL	00:23:38,958	00:23:40,250	| VfD_E17 |	How many people
EDL	00:23:40,250	00:23:42,375	| VfD_E17 |	Everyone, of course, wishes the best
EDL	00:23:43,583	00:23:44,333	| VfD_E17 |	Our warfighters
EDL	00:23:44,875	00:23:46,125	| VfD_E17 |	How many people actually
EDL	00:23:47,166	00:23:49,291	| VfD_E17 |	are in the position to do something about it
EDL	00:23:49,958	00:23:51,500	| VfD_E17 |	It was one of the greatest
EDL	00:23:51,500	00:23:52,291	| VfD_E17 |	epiphanies (顿悟)
EDL	00:23:52,291	00:23:53,541	| VfD_E17 |	Of my time at DARPA
EDL	00:23:54,083	00:23:55,625	| VfD_E17 |	was to realize that
EDL	00:23:56,125	00:23:57,416	| VfD_E17 |	I've been trusted
EDL	00:23:57,916	00:23:58,666	| VfD_E17 |	With
EDL	00:23:58,666	00:23:59,458	| VfD_E17 |	All this
EDL	00:24:00,208	00:24:00,708	| VfD_E17 |	Resource
EDL	00:24:01,500	00:24:02,500	| VfD_E17 |	And funding
EDL	00:24:03,291	00:24:04,041	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:24:04,041	00:24:04,833	| VfD_E17 |	Security
EDL	00:24:05,583	00:24:06,083	| VfD_E17 |	And
EDL	00:24:06,625	00:24:07,875	| VfD_E17 |	Given everything I need
EDL	00:24:08,416	00:24:10,208	| VfD_E17 |	To go do what I know needs
EDL	00:24:10,208	00:24:10,958	| VfD_E17 |	to be done
EDL	00:24:10,958	00:24:12,333	| VfD_E17 |	If I fail it's my fault
EDL	00:24:12,333	00:24:13,250	| VfD_E17 |	Because this
EDL	00:24:13,250	00:24:15,833	| VfD_E17 |	God bless this agency is giving me it's giving me
EDL	00:24:15,833	00:24:16,583	| VfD_E17 |	Everything
EDL	00:24:16,583	00:24:18,666	| VfD_E17 |	I need to succeed and it's all on me
EDL	00:24:19,166	00:24:20,708	| VfD_E17 |	And that's what's driven me and
EDL	00:24:21,208	00:24:22,500	| VfD_E17 |	In front of an audience like that
EDL	00:24:23,500	00:24:24,291	| VfD_E17 |	They deserve no less
EDL	00:24:25,041	00:24:26,083	| VfD_E17 |	Thanks for that.
EDL	00:24:26,583	00:24:33,000	| VfD_E17 |	You've been here since 2012 so you've been here longer than a lot of program managers and you probably are coming toward the tail end
EDL	00:24:33,000	00:24:34,000	| VfD_E17 |	When are you leaving
EDL	00:24:34,000	00:24:35,291	| VfD_E17 |	September of
EDL	00:24:36,041	00:24:37,583	| VfD_E17 |	September 18th
EDL	00:24:37,583	00:24:44,000	| VfD_E17 |	I'm not actually sure you're even going to be able to see SHIELD through all the way to the end I know that that's you're gonna go
EDL	00:24:44,000	00:24:47,333	| VfD_E17 |	most of the way but I'm I imagine you're going to be handing off some of the final
EDL	00:24:47,333	00:24:47,833	| VfD_E17 |	Testing
EDL	00:24:48,333	00:24:54,750	| VfD_E17 |	I'm just wondering with six years of of participation in this agency which is part of the the
EDL	00:24:54,750	00:24:55,750	| VfD_E17 |	Innovation ecosystem
EDL	00:24:56,541	00:25:02,416	| VfD_E17 |	What you have learned about it as an organization and as a culture in technology
EDL	00:25:03,208	00:25:04,916	| VfD_E17 |	DARPA is a incredible place
EDL	00:25:05,250	00:25:06,250	| VfD_E17 |	Just incredible
EDL	00:25:06,250	00:25:07,041	| VfD_E17 |	Place
EDL	00:25:07,041	00:25:10,625	| VfD_E17 |	Of course it's a human organization so it's given to
EDL	00:25:10,625	00:25:12,666	| VfD_E17 |	All the variation that
EDL	00:25:12,666	00:25:13,416	| VfD_E17 |	Human
EDL	00:25:13,416	00:25:13,958	| VfD_E17 |	Endeavor
EDL	00:25:14,458	00:25:16,750	| VfD_E17 |	Introduces but it's such a rare place
EDL	00:25:17,250	00:25:19,041	| VfD_E17 |	To be given the opportunity
EDL	00:25:19,041	00:25:19,833	| VfD_E17 |	To go
EDL	00:25:19,833	00:25:21,625	| VfD_E17 |	Develop those ideas
EDL	00:25:21,625	00:25:22,916	| VfD_E17 |	Which you know
EDL	00:25:23,416	00:25:24,166	| VfD_E17 |	Can be made to work
EDL	00:25:24,708	00:25:26,333	| VfD_E17 |	Is a once in a life-time
EDL	00:25:26,750	00:25:28,541	| VfD_E17 |	Do you have any thoughts about
EDL	00:25:28,541	00:25:31,083	| VfD_E17 |	a post-DARPA phase of of your professional adventure
EDL	00:25:31,625	00:25:33,916	| VfD_E17 |	There are certain capabilities
EDL	00:25:33,916	00:25:35,458	| VfD_E17 |	This nation urgently needs
EDL	00:25:35,958	00:25:38,791	| VfD_E17 |	And I'm pouring the concrete(混凝土) in those holes
EDL	00:25:38,791	00:25:40,833	| VfD_E17 |	As quickly as I possibly can
EDL	00:25:40,833	00:25:43,625	| VfD_E17 |	My intent when I complete my DARPA post
EDL	00:25:44,166	00:25:48,000	| VfD_E17 |	Is to be able to move into a position where I will be allowed to continue
EDL	00:25:48,750	00:25:49,250	| VfD_E17 |	to pour that concrete
EDL	00:25:50,541	00:25:56,958	| VfD_E17 |	Well I for one will be excited to watch you as you take your programs through to the point that you will be able
EDL	00:25:56,958	00:25:59,500	| VfD_E17 |	Able to end to see what you do
EDL	00:25:59,500	00:26:05,916	| VfD_E17 |	When you leave here now bringing your DARPA experience, maybe perhaps back into the private sector and industry whatever you might do
EDL	00:26:05,916	00:26:08,708	| VfD_E17 |	Where was I wish you the best of luck
