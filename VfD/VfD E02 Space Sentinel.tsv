EDL	00:00:11,650	00:00:17,730	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Stealth technology , the internet , GPS in the palm of your hand on tonight's operation. 
EDL	00:00:19,280	00:00:30,230	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Technology is a driver of our times since its founding a nineteen fifty eight , in the midst of the cold war , DARPA , that offends advance research projects has been a driver of technology . 
EDL	00:00:30,670	00:00:40,090	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Welcome to Voices from DARPA , a window onto dark as core of program managers , their job to redefine what is possible . 
EDL	00:00:40,610	00:00:43,370	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	My name is iphone , the motto , and I am your dark host . 
EDL	00:00:43,370	00:00:45,790	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And today I am pleased to have with me in the studio . 
EDL	00:00:45,790	00:00:56,336	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Wen zim , alert , a program manager in tactical technology , where , since twenty fourteen , she has been running the intriguingly named space surveillance telescope . 
EDL	00:00:56,336	00:00:59,920	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Where SSTprogram welcomes the two Voices from japan. 
EDL	00:01:00,320	00:01:02,020	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Thank you so much for having me . 
EDL	00:01:02,020	00:01:03,220	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I am really excited to be here. 
EDL	00:01:03,620	00:01:04,770	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Well , i'm excited to have you . 
EDL	00:01:05,360	00:01:13,900	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And before we dive in and talk about the space surveillance telescope , which packs some really amazing technology that i'm eager to hear about . 
EDL	00:01:14,250	00:01:16,000	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Let's talk a little bit about you . 
EDL	00:01:16,000	00:01:22,840	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Um , what I like knows something about your background , how you became a program manager at the. 
EDL	00:01:23,580	00:01:30,760	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Sure , so a while ago actually started as a photography major at the university , michigan , which you might think is a little bit odd . 
EDL	00:01:30,760	00:01:32,350	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Start for a scientist . 
EDL	00:01:32,680	00:01:35,000	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I was always inspired by the images . 
EDL	00:01:35,000	00:01:36,860	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I would see you in a strongly magazine . 
EDL	00:01:37,210	00:01:40,690	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And at that time , I thought all that means that should be a photographic major . 
EDL	00:01:41,210	00:01:46,030	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	But after learning a little bit more my time there , I dropped it over to our space engineering . 
EDL	00:01:46,030	00:01:50,873	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I got my undergraduate degree in our space engineering there and a masters as well . 
EDL	00:01:50,873	00:02:00,030	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And I went on to produce where it is some graduate work that enabled an assumption called the treasury planet finder , which was a new design for a space , total scope . 
EDL	00:02:00,030	00:02:09,850	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	After that , I had some marketed in policy and actually met a fellow program manager here double , who introduced me to the how double works and the double programs . 
EDL	00:02:09,850	00:02:13,360	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And I was really exciting to me , and that's how I ended up a double. 
EDL	00:02:14,000	00:02:21,770	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And before we do really talk about the advanced technologies that come together into this tour , the space surveillance . 
EDL	00:02:22,670	00:02:29,040	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Maybe you can talk with a little bit about the problem that really backed in the screen for something like an SST. 
EDL	00:02:29,040	00:02:37,320	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And when i'm referring to hears is the kind of landless abbott like a human made in cosmos made debris . 
EDL	00:02:37,320	00:02:40,340	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So magazines really the beginning , the species. 
EDL	00:02:40,340	00:02:41,888	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah , absolutely , a minor . 
EDL	00:02:41,888	00:02:45,650	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	A user space is becoming increasingly critical to daily . 
EDL	00:02:45,650	00:02:50,719	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I think a lot of people don't know when the space is even involved really anymore . 
EDL	00:02:50,719	00:02:56,190	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And in order to do that , we are launching increasing numbers of minimum attacks in the space . 
EDL	00:02:56,190	00:02:59,420	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	There are tens of thousands of these objects in space right now . 
EDL	00:03:00,000	00:03:06,039	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so we have to be very careful that they don't come near each other and sometimes even collide with each other . 
EDL	00:03:06,039	00:03:19,908	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And on top of that , we also have debris in space , some from man made objects , but also just natural objects , but also SSTis really focused on tracking and identifying debris and objects in orbit called geo geo synchronized orbit . 
EDL	00:03:19,908	00:03:23,812	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	That's about twenty two thousand miles about the earth . 
EDL	00:03:23,812	00:03:24,961	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So really far away . 
EDL	00:03:24,961	00:03:25,880	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Where did I? 
EDL	00:03:25,880	00:03:30,392	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	From leo rights , which is low authority , that was a lot of satellites . 
EDL	00:03:30,392	00:03:30,690	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	well. 
EDL	00:03:30,690	00:03:32,640	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	That's absolutely right . 
EDL	00:03:32,640	00:03:33,800	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Leos much closer . 
EDL	00:03:33,800	00:03:37,060	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So it's a little easier to see objects there . 
EDL	00:03:37,660	00:03:40,930	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Jill has a volume of tens of thousands of oceans . 
EDL	00:03:40,930	00:03:44,840	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So not only is it far away , it's gigantic . 
EDL	00:03:44,840	00:03:51,340	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so building a telescope that can handle both of those challenges since it's very far away over a very wide area . 
EDL	00:03:51,340	00:03:54,360	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah , I is really what our sister is best. 
EDL	00:03:54,880	00:04:00,030	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Okay , I love that kind of image just gave us with with all of these oceans above the same . 
EDL	00:04:00,030	00:04:02,850	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	You need to be worked out and monitored . 
EDL	00:04:03,260	00:04:08,440	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So that sounds to me like , like , you need some oil technology . 
EDL	00:04:08,440	00:04:18,440	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And maybe this is a good time for you to talk those , those really advanced , unique technologies that you helped naturally come together into this remarkable. 
EDL	00:04:18,790	00:04:31,330	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah , absolutely , so you think about a digital camera that you have home when you use your zoom lens , you see the field of view on your camera , narrow in on the thing that you're looking at it as you get closer . 
EDL	00:04:31,330	00:04:44,310	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And that is how a traditional telescope works as you change the design that the field of with SST, we actually had a unique optical design where we use a curved focal plane . 
EDL	00:04:44,970	00:04:49,950	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So gone , thinking about your digital camera , there is a small focal plane , focal plant in your camera . 
EDL	00:04:49,950	00:04:50,930	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Call the CCD. 
EDL	00:04:51,410	00:04:52,710	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	That stands for charge . 
EDL	00:04:52,710	00:04:54,180	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Couple devices are very cool . 
EDL	00:04:54,180	00:04:56,890	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The most of us know is just the academic. 
EDL	00:04:57,280	00:04:57,830	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Thank you . 
EDL	00:04:58,170	00:05:14,290	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Well , the weather system teams are very , very widespread of view , but still relatively very high resolution is actually , instead of having a flat CCD, Aflat focal plane , it is curved , and SSThad the first working curve to focus design. 
EDL	00:05:14,660	00:05:19,700	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	That we know over the world , and what was so special about the curved form embrace is a flat one. 
EDL	00:05:20,250	00:05:29,524	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So the curve format allows you to actually focus the light a little bit better towards the edges of the CCDitself is also very , very challenging to build . 
EDL	00:05:29,524	00:05:35,580	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	In fact , I am a telling concludes who built the focal plane has to come up with the , the new process . 
EDL	00:05:35,580	00:05:38,030	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I am able to to enable that character. 
EDL	00:05:38,500	00:05:58,525	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Over the over the plane , right and philosophy might not know the legal legs are really fascinating place with AAhistory that goes back really to world war two with a task at that time to work on what really was some of the original weight or technology , and it's been really involved in updates , among other things ever ever since . 
EDL	00:05:58,525	00:06:07,190	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Those are really interesting in partner , and in this case , what are some of the other technologies that have been really tough , dark , dark awards , the tiger , tiger. 
EDL	00:06:07,190	00:06:15,980	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The the processing power of this total scope is quite impressive , and the speedy , which it can scand over the sky . 
EDL	00:06:16,460	00:06:34,260	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so we can actually view objects over one quarter of the entire jail belt over , you can imagine that is one quarter of each night from new mexico , and that is just an incredibly fast drive train on the telescope and requires incredibly fast processing . 
EDL	00:06:34,260	00:06:37,790	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And those are two things that that we also developed under the assets to program. 
EDL	00:06:38,220	00:07:00,000	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	When I was called the standing volume to be thinking about this in the field of view of this instrument and anything , a kind of an amazing portrait writers is that the white sense mister ranges in mexico , which triggered smooth people there know is wismar , but it is on top of a fantastic way . 
EDL	00:07:00,000	00:07:01,993	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The name played a pig called adam peak . 
EDL	00:07:01,993	00:07:07,175	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Maybe you've been there , so maybe you can just sort of paint as a little bit of a picture . 
EDL	00:07:07,175	00:07:08,969	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	What is like to buy the telescope ? 
EDL	00:07:08,969	00:07:11,860	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And why are you doing that describe the telescope? 
EDL	00:07:11,860	00:07:18,580	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Sure , so the autumn peak itself is very high and very dry in a very dark location . 
EDL	00:07:18,580	00:07:27,622	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So you can stand up on the peak and actually see the sunset out over the range , which is beautiful , and you are also looking right over a site called trinity sites . 
EDL	00:07:27,622	00:07:40,680	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Trinity sites is actually where the united states exploded its first atomic weapon , which is kind of interesting to be standing on the egypt of two areas where technology was after sunset against incredibly dark . 
EDL	00:07:40,680	00:07:49,480	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	You can actually see the edge of the galaxy when you're standing up there , and after night fall , we can walk inside the telescope down . 
EDL	00:07:49,480	00:07:59,542	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The facility itself looks like a very flat square building with a giant dome on one side , and you get inside that dome , which is elevated even higher above autumn peak . 
EDL	00:07:59,542	00:08:03,502	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And then we'll open up the door for of the telescope dome . 
EDL	00:08:03,502	00:08:23,385	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And almost every time I bend there , the wind is just blowing , and it's freezing cold , but everyone to stand up down because it just so need to see the stars in the toll scope , moving the toll scott movement itself is completely silent as they're just sitting there looking at the stars next to the instrument . 
EDL	00:08:23,385	00:08:24,040	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And it was. 
EDL	00:08:24,040	00:08:32,950	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Give people a sense of the scale of it , and how fast is moving , because when you say this instrument is silent , and I think about how biggest is and how fast is moving . 
EDL	00:08:32,950	00:08:35,850	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	It's almost impossible for me to think about it , right? 
EDL	00:08:35,850	00:08:41,520	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So the telescope is offered several towns , and it's sitting on the top of many different gambles . 
EDL	00:08:42,000	00:08:47,330	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And what is doing is the shape of the opening in the domestic return . 
EDL	00:08:47,330	00:08:48,962	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so it starts at the top . 
EDL	00:08:48,962	00:08:55,695	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And the telescope movement is going open down and both open down in the vertical and also crossing the horizontal motion . 
EDL	00:08:55,695	00:09:02,230	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And again , it can serve the entire sky , so one hundred and eighty degrees of down the dome in one single nights . 
EDL	00:09:02,230	00:09:05,610	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Again , that , you know , volumes and volumes of ocean A. 
EDL	00:09:05,610	00:09:07,720	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Quarter , about in one night , right ? 
EDL	00:09:07,720	00:09:14,290	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so , so it literally is moving from one spot , taking a snap shot , moving to another , taking a snap shot . 
EDL	00:09:14,290	00:09:28,490	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I, Iheard that there are some thousands of horse power worth of hydraulic piston and other moving elements that that actually can bring it from one spot to the , to the next . 
EDL	00:09:28,490	00:09:35,660	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And yet the sound is something like when I heard this , maybe you can correct it , or you another matter about as loud as a microwave of. 
EDL	00:09:35,660	00:09:36,570	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I think that's right . 
EDL	00:09:36,570	00:09:41,010	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The only thing you can hear is the clicking of the shutter on the camera itself. 
EDL	00:09:41,350	00:09:43,220	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Over the half of a microwave open right . 
EDL	00:09:43,220	00:09:52,605	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And then so when the shoulder is open , and it's gathering the slide on on that through curved optical element that you talk to battle can look at such a huge volume of space all at once . 
EDL	00:09:52,605	00:09:58,546	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The late itself that is going on to , as I think you might have seen essential like that in our cell phones . 
EDL	00:09:58,546	00:09:59,980	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Can you talk a little bit? 
EDL	00:10:01,090	00:10:07,740	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah , so i'll start with them as the appetizers open the light actually comes in and and hit several different measures . 
EDL	00:10:07,740	00:10:08,770	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Similar sense . 
EDL	00:10:08,770	00:10:19,500	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Mates article train , and it's about three point six meter mirror , so that gives you an idea of a sort of helping the hotel school visit itself at several meters larger than that . 
EDL	00:10:19,500	00:10:42,447	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so the labour comment in bonds through that that mirror and actually be focused , that occurred focal plane , where , you know , the late hits the materials in the focal plane , and that turns them into an electrical signal , which is an transferred into what we would think of his pixels based on the strength of the electrical signal year at the scene of brighter or a finger pixel . 
EDL	00:10:42,447	00:10:52,360	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The longer the telescope is open and looking at a specific place in the sky , the center of the object you might be able to see , just like if you were doing it at home with your digital camera. 
EDL	00:10:52,360	00:10:58,510	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Okay , so now i'm imagining the camera is sharing out to jail synchronism altitudes rapidly . 
EDL	00:10:58,510	00:11:02,530	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	What twenty two thousand ahead there . 
EDL	00:11:02,530	00:11:10,370	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And it's picking out perhaps thousands at one time , thousands of even software sized objects that right? 
EDL	00:11:10,370	00:11:11,300	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yeah , that's about right . 
EDL	00:11:11,300	00:11:12,970	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Maybe the size of what he bought. 
EDL	00:11:12,970	00:11:18,655	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And if we focused on one of those objects , you wait with the whisky bottles , you just in the mountain . 
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:21,720	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	If you really are whisky bottle whirling around in orbit. 
EDL	00:11:22,280	00:11:23,510	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	One can only guess , right ? 
EDL	00:11:23,510	00:11:25,060	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We have add astronauts of. 
EDL	00:11:25,060	00:11:30,195	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So let's assume it's not a whisky bottle , but some other kind of debris . 
EDL	00:11:30,195	00:11:34,720	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	How many pixels with that single object occupy , and the sensor of. 
EDL	00:11:34,720	00:11:43,080	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The SSTshirts will be very few , so assets can not actually take what we would think of as an image of something in gear . 
EDL	00:11:43,080	00:11:46,520	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	What , as I see , does this really see dozen streets ? 
EDL	00:11:46,860	00:11:53,160	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So it is not resolved the military of an object in jail , but really an indication of where that object is. 
EDL	00:11:53,160	00:11:54,301	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And how it's moving . 
EDL	00:11:54,301	00:12:15,370	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Okay , that's really all important when you really want another trajectory , because then you can map that trajectory until the trajectories of all the theme satellites that are out there , whether it's for deal , deal or other analysts , so calculate where there might be an unwanted to intersection of the strategic rate. 
EDL	00:12:15,370	00:12:17,235	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yes , that's absolutely right . 
EDL	00:12:17,235	00:12:36,540	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And I also add battle primary user , the toast group , bring out , actually NASA , we partner with NASA to try to identify in catalogue new near earth objects , and as it sees , actually prolific at this , at finding what we call these news , primarily , astronauts are what we're looking at. 
EDL	00:12:36,950	00:12:37,410	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Right , right ? 
EDL	00:12:37,410	00:12:42,380	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So , so that has been sold in the test out phase in his earlier ten years . 
EDL	00:12:42,380	00:12:45,800	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	In a way , it has first light in twenty eleven . 
EDL	00:12:45,800	00:12:51,290	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	If I call my reading is that when it first went on top of item peak , or was that somewhere else ? 
EDL	00:12:51,290	00:12:52,690	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	No , that was an atomic . 
EDL	00:12:52,690	00:12:58,140	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Okay , so since then , can you give the sense of the catalog observations that the associates made? 
EDL	00:12:58,780	00:13:05,843	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Since then , I will , we worked , like I mentioned with NASA to look at objects near the objects , astronauts and comets . 
EDL	00:13:05,843	00:13:11,220	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We've also takes some images of nebula and supernova , also for a partner's analysis . 
EDL	00:13:11,220	00:13:15,824	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I worked very closely with the united states air force for the air force . 
EDL	00:13:15,824	00:13:26,630	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We are observing very thing , objects in geosynchronous orbit and providing them information on , and that could be anything from a piece of debris to to a small satellite . 
EDL	00:13:26,980	00:13:30,810	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We also work quite a bit on developing what we call the brain models . 
EDL	00:13:31,320	00:13:37,290	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So new telescope is strong enough to see every piece of debris in space . 
EDL	00:13:37,290	00:13:42,060	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so what we do is we make estimates about where that debris might be based on what we know . 
EDL	00:13:42,550	00:13:46,280	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So SSTcan see many more objects and other telescopes . 
EDL	00:13:46,280	00:13:53,470	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so we've been using our measurements to help develop models for what we think the reality of of the debris of. 
EDL	00:13:53,470	00:14:02,370	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Okay , that you mentioned many more telescopes that make me think of the larger context here , which is the , the largest of the space of violence . 
EDL	00:14:02,370	00:14:03,060	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And that were. 
EDL	00:14:03,060	00:14:05,764	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Sure , so the united states air force operates . 
EDL	00:14:05,764	00:14:07,429	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We recognize the assessment . 
EDL	00:14:07,429	00:14:31,920	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Everything has to have an agreement , the space network , and there are several different types of optical and radar sensors in that network , as it sees currently , not one of those sensors , even though we do provide data on an attacked basis to the air force , but very shortly , it is going to become one of the sensors in that network , as it is going to be transitioning over to air force use actually very soon . 
EDL	00:14:31,920	00:14:34,310	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	On october eighteenth of this year. 
EDL	00:14:35,220	00:14:39,300	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	That is an important kind of a successful drop . 
EDL	00:14:39,300	00:14:50,323	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	But when we think about , we're trying to do here is in developed technologies to further the cost of we really do what the sort of transition ultimately to happen . 
EDL	00:14:50,323	00:14:53,606	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We do a lot of high risk kinds of technology development . 
EDL	00:14:53,606	00:14:57,276	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So the transition doesn't always have the material case where it is . 
EDL	00:14:57,276	00:14:59,014	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So can you talk to me about this ? 
EDL	00:14:59,014	00:15:11,880	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	But on hand of right , and where we are now so that we can make the hands off to the your force , and then perhaps also take us for to the sequence of events that will be able to , oh , oh , with the next few years. 
EDL	00:15:12,310	00:15:16,310	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Sure , so I mentioned ASSThad first late in twenty eleven . 
EDL	00:15:16,720	00:15:19,800	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I was a demonstration system that we developed. 
EDL	00:15:19,800	00:15:33,370	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	But I am just going to rub the case for those who don't know first letters , just as a wonderfully term in the telescope community , which really refers to that moment when all of the conception is over in the development in the building . 
EDL	00:15:33,370	00:15:44,910	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And you finally know , open up with this wonderful instrument to to observation , and you desperately want to see what that first observation is that often referred to his first lights . 
EDL	00:15:44,910	00:15:49,690	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So sorry to interpret that was that in february of twenty eleven , first life , respect. 
EDL	00:15:49,690	00:15:50,720	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yes , thank you . 
EDL	00:15:51,110	00:15:53,850	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So at that time , it was a demonstration system . 
EDL	00:15:53,850	00:15:54,750	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And here are double . 
EDL	00:15:54,750	00:15:59,790	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We try to really push beyond the state of the art in a revolutionary technology . 
EDL	00:15:59,790	00:16:03,535	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And sometimes you always don't , you don't always get a perfect the first time . 
EDL	00:16:03,535	00:16:10,102	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so it is the camera that we had in there in two thousand and eleven , we realized that there were some improvements that could be made . 
EDL	00:16:10,102	00:16:15,340	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so over the past year , so we've been developing a replacement camera for the wounded exist there today . 
EDL	00:16:15,800	00:16:24,540	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So we're installing , we finished the installation of that new camera and had a game first lights on august this year . 
EDL	00:16:24,540	00:16:29,637	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We are currently demonstrated the improve , improve capability of assets . 
EDL	00:16:29,637	00:16:40,339	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	He once that demonstration is done , and we really , really certain that the technology is complete , and we are just really excited to give this to the user force . 
EDL	00:16:40,339	00:16:49,250	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	It represents an order of magnitude , increasing capability from what they are able to see now with their existing optical sensors . 
EDL	00:16:49,250	00:16:55,990	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so we are very excited to to be able to give them that capability and have that actually run into operational. 
EDL	00:16:55,990	00:17:05,720	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Right , so the air force will officially take stewardship of assets , tea and the official ceremony that would be happening up on item in a new mexico . 
EDL	00:17:06,160	00:17:07,330	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	What can happen? 
EDL	00:17:07,330	00:17:16,690	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	After that , I , after that , we are actually going to be , we've been united states going to be moving the telescope to australia . 
EDL	00:17:17,510	00:17:20,110	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We have software around the planet . 
EDL	00:17:20,110	00:17:23,760	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Yes , not an easy task for a very large telescope . 
EDL	00:17:24,240	00:17:38,474	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And twenty thirteen , the secretary of defense and also the minister defensive australia , signed an agreement to actually move the top scope from white sands , massachusetts , to hear the whole naval area in western australia . 
EDL	00:17:38,474	00:17:53,930	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And so once we complete , the technology demonstrated and transition into the air force , the air force is going to continue to work with our australian partners to physically move over the western australia that will be happening over the next , maybe two years. 
EDL	00:17:54,300	00:17:59,980	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And that that sounds like an enormous project , probably worth its own engineering story . 
EDL	00:18:00,760	00:18:05,560	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So why take the great pains to move this telescope and. 
EDL	00:18:05,560	00:18:07,173	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I have a healthy adult way . 
EDL	00:18:07,173	00:18:08,383	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I completely agree . 
EDL	00:18:08,383	00:18:11,610	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The movement is potentially a dark problem in itself . 
EDL	00:18:11,930	00:18:15,300	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	The reason to do it is because that is a part of the world . 
EDL	00:18:15,300	00:18:20,660	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	They were very interested in observing what's going on up in geosynchronous orbits . 
EDL	00:18:20,660	00:18:29,679	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We have a lot of very important settlements in that area to communication , and also , it represents a great partnership with the australian allies . 
EDL	00:18:29,679	00:18:32,780	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	It's really those two reasons why we want to move it. 
EDL	00:18:32,780	00:18:39,050	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	We've covered a fair amount for the time we have about the space . 
EDL	00:18:39,440	00:18:44,800	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	A surveillance health group is a question that you really wish I would have asked here that I did not . 
EDL	00:18:44,800	00:18:47,710	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	And if so , you get to ask them as well. 
EDL	00:18:48,490	00:18:52,157	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Well , maybe not a question , but I have a statements . 
EDL	00:18:52,157	00:18:55,090	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Um , my whole life I have been interested in . 
EDL	00:18:55,090	00:19:04,090	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So looking beyond , we know what we can really see , and I think it's inspired , trying to work on an instrument that lets us see other galaxies . 
EDL	00:19:04,090	00:19:05,380	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	It makes it so real . 
EDL	00:19:05,700	00:19:16,141	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	In a way , it's one thing to look so about a picture in a magazine , and and it's another to be working with an instrument that can actually imagine napoleon and a supernova suffering me . 
EDL	00:19:16,141	00:19:24,880	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Working on the program has , has been inspiring , not only from a science perspective , but also because we could contribute to you to our important mission for their fourth. 
EDL	00:19:25,920	00:19:40,810	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	When is your editor plays darker , which is kind of all about reimagining what is possible and actually taking steps to change what to take , what my previously been considered impossible , making it possible . 
EDL	00:19:40,810	00:19:45,210	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So in a way is the place it's trying to make science fiction on fiction . 
EDL	00:19:45,210	00:19:53,190	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I am just wondering if you have some water now , fictional technologies in mind that you think what to be real. 
EDL	00:19:53,830	00:19:54,980	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	So I have a couple . 
EDL	00:19:55,450	00:19:57,950	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	One is the universal translator . 
EDL	00:19:57,950	00:20:01,450	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I think it might be on the the star track series . 
EDL	00:20:02,150	00:20:09,340	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Uh , that is the technology of perhaps a superpower that I absolutely wish that we had . 
EDL	00:20:09,340	00:20:17,390	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I think the other one is to travel beyond the stars , perhaps that that one you could guess it's not not for me to just look . 
EDL	00:20:17,390	00:20:18,350	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I wish we could go there . 
EDL	00:20:18,350	00:20:18,440	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	and. 
EDL	00:20:18,830	00:20:19,910	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	That's a good place to end . 
EDL	00:20:19,910	00:20:21,080	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I think so lonely . 
EDL	00:20:21,080	00:20:23,770	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I just want to thank you for this a great conversation . 
EDL	00:20:24,420	00:20:25,310	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Thank you very much . 
EDL	00:20:25,310	00:20:28,720	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	Gradually here , and thanks listeners for sharing this time with us . 
EDL	00:20:29,160	00:20:32,520	| VfD E02 Space Sentinel |	I hope you join us again for the next Voices from dirt .
