EDL	00:05:32,543	00:05:33,055	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Traditional Inn
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,127	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Other retail sites
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:38,943	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We're focusing on digital tires
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,455	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Products
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,783	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So we think that offline retail today is
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:44,063	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Unfairly
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Challenged
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:48,415	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Because it's really hard to connect to people with a product
EDL	00:05:48,415	00:05:49,439	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	In the retail store

EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:58,911	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So recognizing the product is very hard problem
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:03,519	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Is there any given one time there is hundreds of millions of different products are they in the mall
EDL	00:06:04,031	00:06:05,311	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So how can a person go
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:09,407	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	The product so that we can have the interaction that
EDL	00:06:09,407	00:06:12,223	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	You have a soul naturally online we don't have it all flights
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,759	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We believe that's a problem that we want to go
EDL	00:06:14,527	00:06:17,599	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Digitizing the physical world starting with Rita
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:18,111	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Stihl products
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:20,927	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And once you do that at once you can build
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,279	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Customer interaction or you can building to business interaction with
EDL	00:06:25,279	00:06:26,047	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	The product
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:29,631	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	That you have a very different model for her offline retail wood
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:30,655	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Generate the revenue
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:34,239	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So what what does your product look like
EDL	00:06:35,519	00:06:36,287	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And who uses
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:41,151	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So if you would going to a Walmart store even going to a
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:43,711	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	The mama Pop Shop store in Xi'an
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:49,599	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Coca-Cola fridge you will see a iot device
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:51,391	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We'll be sticking on the door
EDL	00:06:51,391	00:06:56,767	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	I'm basically two cameras looking in so they understand what are the products have been taken out of the Shelf
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:59,839	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And we do local processing on the edge
EDL	00:06:59,839	00:07:05,983	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So there's a small On The Edge chip that does deep learning algorithm to recognize what a product
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:09,311	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	I take it so it's only the bits that's changed gets
EDL	00:07:09,311	00:07:10,079	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Sandbox
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:14,431	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	The cloud what the heck what are you able to see all the product movements
EDL	00:07:14,431	00:07:17,247	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Over a million a million have
EDL	00:07:17,247	00:07:19,551	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Coolers out in the market
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:23,391	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So basically giving the headquarter that transparency and
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:25,951	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Into Howdy's
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,487	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Point of Sales devices are working
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:27,999	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	At them
EDL	00:07:28,767	00:07:31,327	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So if it isn't retail in wind energy or two
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:31,839	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Two very different
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,631	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	What's a commonality
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:35,423	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Two of The Outlaws
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:36,191	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	To the field product
EDL	00:07:36,959	00:07:37,471	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Service Pro
EDL	00:07:40,031	00:07:40,543	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Which one the focus on
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:45,151	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Depends very good question that's a question that keeps me open hats that wake at night
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:50,015	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Essentially when we got into this business we see the fundamental technology blocks are the same
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:55,903	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	It's going to be hard where it's going to involve some type of software computer vision screening of automation
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:56,671	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	End
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:57,951	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We are
EDL	00:07:57,951	00:07:59,999	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We believe that these
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:02,559	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Technology should be applicable in 3rd different.
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:05,119	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We went into wind energy first
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,911	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Because we had background
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:09,215	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Draw a hardware
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:09,983	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Computer vision
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:11,007	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So that's
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,055	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Entry into that
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,871	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Space give us that natural barrier
EDL	00:08:15,871	00:08:18,687	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And has a celebration that we need to be number one in the market
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:23,807	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Stop the 2 years in this industry worship our first product and we are already the China leader
EDL	00:08:23,807	00:08:26,623	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	In doing autonomous inspection for the winter writing desk
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,415	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	When we look at
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:31,743	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	The Second Industrial we see the retail industry is
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:34,303	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	It's a trillion dollar industry with
EDL	00:08:34,303	00:08:36,607	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Still very little technology
EDL	00:08:36,607	00:08:41,215	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And we believe the technology that if we can provide for the offline retailers in the cpg companies
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:43,519	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	They wouldn't use that as tools and weapons
EDL	00:08:43,519	00:08:46,847	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	To actually have a fair fight against the guys like amazonics
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:50,431	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We want to see how this industry would get shaped
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:51,199	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	In the future
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:57,343	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	But that takes a longer time for us to be there when that battle happens
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:09:02,463	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We got to make sure that we can survive this Revenue stream we can be leader insurance place that we sure of
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:08,863	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	To look at wintermyers mobile device to play we look at more of the retail space is offensive acceleration
EDL	00:09:08,863	00:09:09,887	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Template for the lawn
EDL	00:09:11,167	00:09:11,935	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So what
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,959	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Conner Industries Borger
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,471	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Are you going tonight
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,263	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	We have
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:17,567	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Plenty of things on our play for us to chew
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,895	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Our goal is to be number one being those to feel that I think it's
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:21,919	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	It's going to be a while
EDL	00:09:21,919	00:09:23,711	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Before we can ourselves
EDL	00:09:23,711	00:09:24,991	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	I say we are
EDL	00:09:24,991	00:09:27,295	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So we're not looking at the third industry we think.
EDL	00:09:27,295	00:09:28,831	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Our strategy is to have a
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:30,367	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	What's the fastest plane office play
EDL	00:09:30,367	00:09:31,135	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And that's already
EDL	00:09:31,135	00:09:34,207	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Complete I will just have to go super deep in these areas
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,767	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	To see how we can go help these Enterprises
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:38,303	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	To extrapolate
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:40,095	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Better value and better potty
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,679	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Do the wind energy companies have more money
EDL	00:09:43,679	00:09:44,191	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	To pay you
EDL	00:09:45,215	00:09:47,007	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	They do have
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:48,543	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	The pretty significant budget
EDL	00:09:48,543	00:09:50,847	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	For the operations and maintenance area
EDL	00:09:50,847	00:09:53,919	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	This is actually a 25 billion dollar market
EDL	00:09:53,919	00:09:56,479	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Andaz 450000 turbine
EDL	00:09:56,479	00:09:57,247	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	It's worldwide
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:02,367	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So if you do the math the average house to $65,000 they spend
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:05,183	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Operations and maintenance alone
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:05,695	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	For a
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:07,743	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Provide per year
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:13,119	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And today we're only scratching the surface where is only getting $300 out of that 65
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:19,519	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Thousand dollars that they're spending so there's a lot of Technology innovations that we can doing there to make sure that we can
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:22,335	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	That's a larger pie and also the pie South will get bigger
EDL	00:10:22,335	00:10:23,615	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	As the technology Innovations
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So what's preventing you from
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:27,711	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Just focus on.
EDL	00:10:28,223	00:10:31,551	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	It takes time for a commercial business
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,087	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	To really accelerate
EDL	00:10:33,087	00:10:37,951	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And for us to do that part well we already taken the right set of a group
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:39,487	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	12 + 4
EDL	00:10:39,487	00:10:41,279	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	This is not a game of
EDL	00:10:41,279	00:10:42,815	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	You know if you have
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,119	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	10 people you can go to
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:51,519	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Attend turbines if you drive a hundred people is 200 it's actually just a set of people that's turning I the customers
EDL	00:10:51,519	00:10:54,079	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Besides I'm fixing boxing proven products Etc
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:58,687	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So we're not increasing the team where is celery and make sure the product is better
EDL	00:10:58,687	00:11:02,527	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And that time is not going to go away by adding people so
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:08,671	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	For us we know the trajectory is there and we will have to go deeper if I going deeper we'll just have to take that
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:13,023	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	So could you talk a little bit about your technology and how it

EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,984	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And turn around
EDL	00:35:53,984	00:35:58,592	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	And use whatever the resource that took a long game into creating what is
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:35:59,360	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Kind of look like today
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:03,712	| George_Yan_From_Microsoft_China_to_Clobotics |	Right so I think the entrepreneur spear if you read his writing
