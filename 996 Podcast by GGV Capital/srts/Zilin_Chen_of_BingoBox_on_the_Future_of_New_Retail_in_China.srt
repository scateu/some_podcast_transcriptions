246
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
How that works

247
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
Did I find the solution

248
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,671

The direction

258
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943

259
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
I have to say the team is ready in baby

260
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575

Application that level is not I don't think we are

268
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247

269
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295

270
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087

00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
You my point of view

309
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
We are very different

310
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975

00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
From the

313
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
From the beginning very beginning

314
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,143

324
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
Amazon go is

325
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
2

326
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
Beehive day fixing to

327
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Tufted chair

00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,535
Shopping environment

329
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Old traditional

330
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Shopping mall and they are not

Total merchandising

335
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
So

336
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,919
For my understanding Amazon go is true

337
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
Is try to solve that problem in that you in the United States

338
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
The kashia is very high pay

339
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,487
And the other way to Wild pinpoint that

340
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Easter pic time and lows

341
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Got no time

342
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
And then when

343
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
They take a lot of rental for 4:44.

344
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,007
Store

345
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
At the peak time

346
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,335
The wait for

347
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,175
Play Kidz Bop because I have a lot of

348
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Many choices that I can

349
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,783
I can drive to another store

350
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
Appliance stores very very very developed in

351
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
Because you lost a lot of choices to

352
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
To go to another store

353
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
They tried would solve his problem

354
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
So that if you can

355
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
No line for check how is baby

356
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,775
They take a safe to save a lot of rental

357
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
That's so

358
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
I think in that way

359
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,711
When is the Kesha free model Pembroke

360
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503

362
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,831
Reasonable

363
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183

I-77 past team can maintain

387
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
50 60 70 80 boxes

388
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
That's our plan

389
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,903
So could you walk us through it a technology that you used to

390
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Track items in your store

391
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
I think it started out with

392
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,303
Radio frequency identification or RFID

393
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,911
Which uses a tad that contains electronically stored information

394
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,727
But later on you also integrated computer vision

395
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
How did you make these particular choices and in this particular order how much are you spending on RN

396
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
How much resources are expanding rnt

397
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
Disorder is not

398
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
It's not a choice

399
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Is the accessory

400
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
That yes yes because

401
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
At beginning we have no

402
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Research

403
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Power

404
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
Restart computer vision

405
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,679
Need a lot of money to fall for you

406
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
But the research

407
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
So

408
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,103
We just stood up we use RFID

409
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Chipper and

410
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,527
And mature technology to build up our a man

411
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Convenience store station

412
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Alliant SSL

413
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Total solution

414
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,279
Product recognition is only the first

415
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
Step off the amend kunming install operating

416
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,727
. we need to recognize the product and then we need to

417
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Do the payment and after that

418
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
In the back end we have

419
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
Maintenance operational system

420
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
Twitter POTUS

421
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
You can see the results

422
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
I7 opposing team

423
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015

Bingo Bash

425
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
I mean that.

426
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
The product recognition is

427
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Web the very first app

428
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
And then we used to have baby

429
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,559
On highest we can find a life ID

430
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Aztec

431
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Levi ecss

432
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
Technology to do that and I know

433
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
4

434
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Ma

435
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
The large scale usage iPad is not very

436
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,895
No chip enough because you do need to pay

437
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Harry

438
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Ivy Tech

439
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Attack on

440
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
The labor cost

441
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Patek cost so

442
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,815
Is definitely the computer computer vision is the future

443
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,399
So at the same time we use ibid to build hours

444
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
Our entire system and

445
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
True

Business model

450
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
And lay her in the same time we have

451
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,807
Invest a lot of money I am in need of US dollars

452
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
True to the research

453
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
You have

454
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Naugahyde

455
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,279
We have our team of 100 100 research engineer

456
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
To do that, Theresa.

457
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
I know a product is called

458
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,239
Self on fire

459
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,871
Use computer vision to to the recognition of the product that will get rid of a body

460
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
So our operational calls is

461
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
30% lower

462
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,319
That means we are now

463
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Already

464
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
For the last K-Love

465
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Replication

466
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,231
What is the accuracy rate

467
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Of your computer vision solution

468
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Technically

469
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
Activate Straight

470
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
Should be over 99%

471
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Night night night night

472
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
Now

473
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Franklin

474
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:02,175
Now we have no Death Note such off technology that can achieve a 100%

475
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
By now

476
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
So I mean baby is already very reliable I have to save it

477
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Who is very important

478
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
In the payment

479
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535

Customer connect

505
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
Going to go fix it through moving the item

Competing against

00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,888
My Philosophy to co-op

I don't want to sell bingo balls to anybody

877
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
That's why I do what

878
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
And I will welcome for order

879
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040

883
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,352
Houston metal market price but

884
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
Just like the one from a 10-7 OtterBox

885
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
Some group will listen cuz podcast

You know it's settings open for business

887
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,896
So right now for a bingo box

888
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,224
Shoppers still need to plays everything on a counter

889
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
To check out even though it doesn't involve

890
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,344
Human cashiers is still takes a bit of time

891
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,928
Whereas for Amazon go user just take everything and leave

892
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,744
So are you aiming for that day when you can

893
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Realize

894
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,072
That vision and how far are we from there

895
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,912
Okay just about chicken goal

896
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
So

897
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Bachelder

898
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
Point of view II just been zombie

899
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,616
People don't like icing Icing

900
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,920
Related when we talked about

901
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Making a payment

902
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
What is more important

903
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Double liability

904
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Is more important than the

905
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
In a tie

906
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
In fact loud

907
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,744
Do you speak about casciato to do the payment

908
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
It's already very iffy

909
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
Do Tesla 10

910
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
Seconds

911
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
10 seconds

912
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,936
I don't think that's what this

913
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,984
Just disappear

914
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
Acceptable to I need to to a consumers

915
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
Kmart

916
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
10 seconds more than you can get laid

917
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
Feeling of security

918
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
I think this

919
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
What it

920
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,856
Was it for the extra 10 seconds

921
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
So

922
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
I think that

923
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
Bingo balls

924
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
Consuming Spirits POS in Singapore

925
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Is

926
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
Somehow better than

927
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,752
What technical experience icing is

928
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Mall

929
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
More acceptable for the

930
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
For the low price

931
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Photo

932
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
Like you do

Can you guys do know

936
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
You know it's baby pee

937
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:24,256
But when you making a big amount payments a live

938
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
You need to check the people before you

939
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
You do make a payment

940
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
Actually I know

941
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
Pick N Go

942
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,704
Angle

943
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,776
Maybe in the future sometime

944
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Lupita mainstream

945
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
My my my policy is

946
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,992
Where can human eat it

947
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Offer it

948
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,368
Have you seen a consumer demand for that yet

949
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
Rocky Mountain

950
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Most of consumer taste

951
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
The Hulk

952
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
To experience that kind of

953
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,024
Nice beautiful

954
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
Wenzhou

955
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Verizon store San Jose

956
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
You know

957
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Where are you

958
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Launch this kind of

959
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,264
Ron's Chicken Go

960
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,336
I have to say when the the cause

961
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
Is low enough

962
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Is reasonable

963
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
Singapore Singapore

964
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,344
By this time by now even Amazon Amazon go

965
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
They need to

966
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
Did system

967
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
The cost million dollars

968
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,744
So intent

969
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
Not even can do a bunch of passing accuracy

970
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,656
So icing is not a chip

971
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216
This technology is not mature enough

972
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
Inow

973
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
So there's only one store

974
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,128
You have 300

975
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
I think I can go

976
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
The Chicken Go technology is not released

977
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
Now

978
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
So I think

979
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:57,952
Also a huge difference between the China and between China and the US is in China Mobile payment is

980
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
As such high penetration rate

981
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,840
So everyone it has WeChat pay were all they pay on their phones

982
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,680
And bingobox leverages on those forms of payment

983
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
So you don't need to do a lot of user education

984
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,568
For them to know how to use the bus whereas in the US

985
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
There's no like

986
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
Mass adopted

987
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,176
Mobile payment methods

988
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,248
So I might take a lot of the more time for users

989
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
You actually

990
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,088
Become used to pain with her mobile phones

991
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,136
Actually

992
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
Now I have no plans

993
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Tool

994
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,256
Locate pickleball scene

995
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,304
North America

996
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
So I

997
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:39,680
I really don't care about yes but I was just commenting on the fact that

998
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:45,056
Probably this this idea is probably more Bible in China because of how

999
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
Widely-adopted Mobile payment

1000
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
The sewer

1001
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Obviously

1002
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
That is Mobile in China

1003
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Genovia

1004
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,440
We are launching a new box in Korea and also in Malaysia

1005
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Popular

1006
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
China

1007
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,704
So we we we also provide another another ways of payment

1008
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
Traditional credit card

1009
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,384
What is the party's kind of payment

1010
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
I have to

1011
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,272
I have to say that's not the efficient that are not essential

1012
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
Barrier

1013
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,880
It's not barrier the payment is not the barrier

1014
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Because you know

1015
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
Tested

1016
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,280
Denise top consumers

1017
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Dismounted

1018
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Is the weather

1019
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Picture

1020
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,192
Chikka for them to use bingo balls because you know

1021
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
Venti iced Epix

1022
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
Snow storm outside

1023
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
Take a lift out there you can buy all the things you need

1024
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
That's the chicken

1025
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Also in the US

1026
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:02,623
I noticed that all the newspaper articles about Amazon go mentioned the loss of cashier jobs

1027
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
Where at in China

1028
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Rarely mentioned in the news

1029
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
I think people in China generally have a more

1030
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Buoyant

1031
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,631
Attitude towards AI in new technology

1032
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,471
Library on the positive impacts rather than negative ones

1033
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,519
So what why do you think that's the case

1034
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,823
I Sing Because

1035
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,127
Chinese people nowadays

1036
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
Educated by the

1037
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Internet

1038
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
How many years

1039
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,807
We are now in a

1040
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Interchanging

1041
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Area

1042
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,183
Hng Aurora in China

1043
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
Everyday is different

1044
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
You know you're nasty

1045
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
Stay sizing

1046
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
Cheetah chasing not so fast as yet

1047
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
Is China that pencil

1048
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,447
And also people that

1049
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
Because they are

1050
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
How to say

1051
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
WB develop

1052
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
Two societies

1053
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Set it up

1054
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
People that

1055
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
Do you care about that

1056
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
Escapability

1057
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,039
Status quo

1058
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
They don't

1059
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
They don't

1060
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
They don't like change

1061
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,927
I think it's reasonable

1062
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
Also there a lot of existence

1063
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,279
Existing constituents

1064
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
Any two

1065
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327

1066
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
For any new

1067
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
Changes to happen and that takes time

1068
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
So

1069
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,543
You recently launched a new product called Bingo box Mini

1070
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Can you tell us more about what that is and how it works

1071
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
15 products

1072
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
And I like it very much

1073
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,039
It's a very low-cost viso

1074
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,575
Riso recognition

1075
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Solution for

1076
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,903
Traditional convenience store

1077
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,719
Now we should be

1078
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Regis

1079
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,583
Neat 707000 rmb

1080
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
4

1081
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
For each product

1082
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
4-H Bingo bus Mini

1083
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
Is pack n play

1084
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,823
I put it in the store

1085
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
And

1086
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895

1089
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
You can

You can start to sell these products toe-tapping boss miniview recognize all your products

1091

So

1092

You can say focaccia

1093
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:18,815
So that's like it looks like an oven right the size is about the size of an oven

1094
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
And you can basically

1095
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,191
Re outfit a traditional mom-and-pop store into a

1096
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:28,799

1099
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,831
Yes so by doing that you extend your impact beyond your own Bingo boxes and into these

1100
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
More traditional

1101

I am expecting so how many of those have you sold how many stores are using

1104
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143

I jump to the final part of the interview which is around of quick fire questions

1152
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,103
The first one is who is an entrepreneur that you admire the most and why

1153
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
How to say

1154
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
It's pretty chilly say that I like

1155
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Steve Jobs

1156
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
I hate the most

1157
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
That because

1158
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
I think he

1159
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
Where is Del Rio

1160
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,143

Megabox Bonneville

1303
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,639
What's the irrational food

1304
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
Spend time new retail

1305
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
And what's particularly interest you

1306
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,015
About megabox

1307
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,807
Yes so

1308
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,671
Before I talk about that people pass away so wants to know that paint

1309
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
So far the traditional

1310
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
E-commerce market and also the

1311
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Pinpoint

1312
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
Photos of Lionel Richie

1313
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,143
So the pain point for the traditional e-commerce

1314
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
Started

1315
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,727
First you have to require a lot of person

1316
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,263
Uses for y'all

1317
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
E-commerce things

1318
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:36,127
And actually cause to search

1319
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
These days

1320
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,991
So normally so maybe

1321
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,831
So if I'm 5 years ago so you'll have

1322
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:51,231
To purchase a used to purchase in your cell where is like 10 rmb

1323
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
Today is such attitude

1324
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,815
200-300 events

1325
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
Mm

1326
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:02,239
Smartphone penetration is gonna band size is not growing as much

1327
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:08,895
Yes so actually I think short there's no try to search a certain traffic.

1328
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
For today

1329
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,575
It was my fault and he just bought we used to to install every application

1330
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
I wished I was stalked

1331
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,207
So you may want to install one or two

1332
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,767
Monthly you don't have to install

1333
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:31,423
Another words the consumer has already got used to several application

1334
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,239
Already.

1335
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:38,335
The second up employee is that possible Castaways eCommerce

1336
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:45,247
So even though you need to purchase one bottle of water you still get delivered to the company

1337
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:49,855
Get to the home so it will cost you almost the same as the price of the good

1338
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:54,463
So this is two major pain Point weigh station

1339
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,999
Toys R Us Mall

1340
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
Robinson cost

1341
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,607
Under a very competitive

1342
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
Situation in China

1343
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,959
So are you have to do this

1344
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
Price of cost

1345
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:11,359
Okay so true major pain Point ways to traditional retail

1346
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:17,503
At yes. The first one is to

1347
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:21,599
Ship the goods to the retail Point s consolidation

1348
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
So you have more economy of the skillport ordered

1349
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:31,327
Right you just shipped out the total

1350
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,143
Chester take away Tan on himself

1351
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:40,543
So fill for the traditional why is also the same so I like the first one that number one point is that

1352
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
The rental

1353
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:47,711
Pentecost was usually High very high so as we all knows that if we want to open when

1354
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:52,575
Retail store in China like Shanghai Beijing and a console

1355
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,183
So the average daily Break Even Point Es as high as

1356
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
8000

1357
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:05,119
And the car be the lowest to normally

1358
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,447
We will see like a 10000 13,000.

1359
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
For the break-even point

1360
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,799
So where's the new retail

1361
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
You can

1362
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,615
Virtually pay valid

1363
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,431
Cost sometimes you up you put some

1364
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:23,551
What are the boxes to into the middle of nowhere and you are charged for free

1365
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,367
So the second one for the retail

1366
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,927
Traditional retail is dead

1367
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,207
At the stocking cost

1368
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:35,327
So structure

1369
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,655
Avocado total cost but you still have to pay attention

1370
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,447
And you have to

1371
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:46,591
Imply like a suite of five persons and Alyssa true person at the same time

1372
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:50,175
Install service training course training time and also leakage

1373
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,199
You don't worry about things

1374
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,855
Saudia some catch-up time for the for the new staff and do you have to pay more attention to the Staffing and

1375
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:02,975
If they have potential and stick to the general principle yourself photo

1376
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,911
So these are those major Fame points at 240v Commerce and 240 and a tradition

1377
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
Retail level

1378
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,263
The new Ritz hotel at the South Pole

1379
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:21,407
So full for the first one that you don't have to pay

1380
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,479
Check why use a speaker the buckets just nearby

1381
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:30,623
When did consumers just walk around they found that doesn't need it they just walking and

1382
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
Purchase it

1383
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,439
Second death note

1384
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,487
Because

1385
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,559
Just like I said so.

1386
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
Pay attention and take it away and you may be consumed immediately like a Coca-Cola

1387
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:49,311
Is Dad

1388
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:54,943
Construction communities

1389
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,991
There's just no rental costume

1390
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
Robbie's not right now

1391
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
Enforces Staffing card

1392
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
Do you have to

1393
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,159
Check data entry

1394
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,975
Play like a what's a what's a day or twice a day

1395
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
The most but you don't have

1396
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,583
Hopstop Stop Standing There and

1397
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Provider

1398
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
Immediate service

1399
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,591
So there are a lot of companies in the new retail space is being a buzzword in China in the past 2 years

1400
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:26,687
A lot of companies in the unmanned space especially so what

1401
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,247
About bingobox stood out to you

1402
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,319
Yes of course I'll fall yesterday

1403
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
So

1404
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:39,999
When we invested early so we considered the founder of the team has the most valuable

1405
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,303
We are looking for

1406
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,887
So at least I spend a lot of time we still have found it before we met

1407
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:51,775
Make a final decision

1408
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,591
Provided he can proof of everything he

1409
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,407
Statues to take to your answer final

1410
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,687
Finalize

1411
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
This is very important

1412
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,759
The second one is that

1413
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
They have amateur

1414
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,063
Solution

1415
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:10,719
Like I carted mature solution to where we come to the business world will have to provide a service

1416
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,767
To be stable

1417
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:18,399
So a lot of guys come to me Erica I can provide a image processing

1418
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,215
Image recognition solution to to you at this is

1419
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
Final

1420
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,031
Avulsion of the new retail

1421
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,871
We found the accuracy

1422
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:33,759
I mean transform maybe 50 50% to 97 +

1423
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,367
You going to waste a ninety-five 97% accurate right

1424
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,647
Askew

1425
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
Estufa

1426
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Top-ranked

1427
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,559
Being stable wasted no operation in the real world

1428
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
So

1429
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,167
Fit solution actually it's not so advanced

1430
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,239
Compared with the image recognition why

1431
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,823
But as the first generation

1432
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,687
Do you want to go out the business so quickly and wanted the business to be stable

1433
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:09,343
So when we talk about it future astronaut

1434
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,463
Doing is he is doing with the second generation which is also waster

1435
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
Most advanced to image processing

1436
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
Solutions

1437
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,375
So this is a different major difference between

1438
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,423
I think a box and the other players

1439
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:29,823
What is your definition of new retail we've talked a lot about this term but I think

1440
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,967
Different people have different meanings to it I think it was first proposed by Jack ma few years back

1441
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,319
Yes I seen the first first and important

1442
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,623
The definition for new Naruto is hot

1443
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
Be smart

1444
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
Sew a lot

1445
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:51,071
Parasol investor day inviting some new deals, new retail but they are they

1446
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,631
Do not use Smart Camino

1447
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
So you don't know who I am

1448
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,311
What they are buying

1449
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
Who are the founder of

1450
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
So

1451
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,407
They are not a trend.

1452
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,455
The future of the the new retail

1453
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,015
Second one yes.

1454
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:14,367
What's the new ritual you have to stop for pain points

1455
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,439
Wow wow semi photo traditional semi 40

1456
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,791
When you can solve all the pain points

1457
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:27,935
All the problem and the using the small machines model solution and noodle noodle uses

1458
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,727
And have a database

1459
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,055
444 foot to be used in the future

1460
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,847
With the batter

1461
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,687
Possible I mean solution business model

1462
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,247
So that will be ideal

1463
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Make sense

1464
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:49,183
How has the bingobox and sleigh and the team grown since you first met them

1465
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,023
Oh yes oh a function level so the team level

1466
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
But they have changed

1467
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Kitchen Magic

1468
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
So I mean

1469
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,375
They have to do a lot of good ass

1470
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:04,031
Not only operation lava but also I like hella Halal HR

1471
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
And also strategic and

1472
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,151
A most important today is ID

1473
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:14,527
The most recent today are recruited the head of the IRA in Intel

1474
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,551
Hi in China

1475
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Turn down

1476
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,391
290 always encouraged

1477
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,927
Image processing

1478
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Solution

1479
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,975
Icicle

1480
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,023
So

1481
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,863
Chinese New Rochelle

1482
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
Investments

1483
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
10

1484
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Take the

1485
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
Best Heller from IT world

1486
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,519
Could not doing enough SmartThings or Internet

1487
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,591
But the technology you know how is Ashley there

1488
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,151
Does a great marriage of up resources

1489
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
And opportunity

1490
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
Right right

1491
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,735
So

1492
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,527
It this is very important to

1493
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:52,671
And the second one is dodgy business operation so as you guys know they are the first runner in this space

1494
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,999
And they have certain dividends not only

1495
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,791
For the business but also found

1496
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,863
The government so they have developed exclusive

1497
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,215
Collaboration with more intensity is government

1498
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,287
Hopefully to to run the business

1499
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
Graduate

1500
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
And

1501
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,199
When we inviting the carpet

1502
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,759
The company only up for the five boxes

1503
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,879
