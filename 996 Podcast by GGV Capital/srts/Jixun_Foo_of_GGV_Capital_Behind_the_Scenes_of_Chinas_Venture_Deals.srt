Thank you

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,048
So I wanted to start with you earlier career how did you end up in venture capital

71
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
Well it's

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Bit of a Twist and Turn

73
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,264
You know I started to have the idea of being a bunch of capital when I was in Hewlett-Packard

74
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
Sr R&D engineer

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,456
My spend some time in the US spend some time to Valley spend some time in Corvallis Oregon

76
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
Looking at or the

77
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
Innovations and I was still

78
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
90

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
590

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Sakes

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
And Corvallis Oregon

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,815
Corvallis Oregon

83
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
It's

84
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:26,239
It's where a HP has a star Pinhead division

85
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
So it's interesting how a lot of the Technology Innovation actually happens in

86
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
In the US

87
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,247
And even though I was an R&D engineer at Hewlett-Packard

88
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
It was more of a localization effort

89
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,207
Reformatting the printer if you will in different sizes and shapes to fit the different market segments

90
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
That was where I I said well

91
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
You know Asia at some point

92
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
Innovation has to take all we have to

93
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
Have our old product

94
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
Technology Innovation capability

95
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Until

96
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
You know I figured out whether I wanted to be an entrepreneur you know be an ambassador so that's where I really had the ID

97
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
But really that wasn't a lot of

98
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Startups that wasn't a lot of

99
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
Venture capital and I thought the only good stepping stone will be to join some Veggie Capital then

100
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
There were a few like water and advertise and so on

101
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,911
But when I rode my CVS and nobody really bought his call back

102
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,311
So that was then so the stepping stone for me was really an STD where I went in and

103
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
Stop debating cubatur

104
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
And I did that for about 4-5 years

105
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,479
You know that's part of the government initiative I what year was this

106
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
96 to mm

107
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
So there was a time where

108
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
I wrote papers and

109
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
Y'all and I I went around it will actually

110
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
I went to Israel Iran to

111
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Ireland I look at

112
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Also so

113
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
Innovation initiative London cambridge's Acura

114
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
So I think it opened up my eyes a bit and then the dog really came when in mm

115
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Idfg

116
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639

Off Silicon Valley show

120

And started

121
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,767
You have to eat planet and you know that's why I joined give je plan and that was my

122
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Extend into the industry

123
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,471
What if the deals you did at DFW Planet wisp I do could you talk about how your first met Robin Lee the founder

124
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
And why did you think it was a

125
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Idea to invest in

126
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
About to be

127
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
To be honest I think when

128
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
At a time that word is waves of returnees from us back to China

129
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
And

130
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,367
Through The BFG not what which is a pretty powerful now weather

131
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
Strong Affiliated not world end

132
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
You know I was referred to Robin

133
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,839
I remember my first contact with Robin was over a video call

134
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
True the Singapore office with a Skype call

135
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
We had a video call

136
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
Where's with Robin

137
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,199
And so that was when I first met Robin an hour rate was found it interesting

138
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,319
And I went to Beijing visited the office at 2 invited at that time

139
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
Is a NICU remember was this very

140
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,815
Pretty run-down place is called me. So you got bingo

141
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,167
There were very few people they had like 13-14 people than I'm so

142
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,007
Why invest in looking at the environment looking at

143
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:44,639
These guy coming back the I mean leaving your family behind and coming back to

144

145
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831

146
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
And that really kind of like

147
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Give me the

148
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
Have you got hey you know this guy could do it so that's on the people side

149
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
S2000

150
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
That's mm

151
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,935
Meet 2008 about your research

152
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,567
Honestly was more a lot more desktop I got time and say okay you know

153
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
And there was no Google it was really comparing within to me and asked my into me was doing the

154
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,087
Is search engine for Yahoo and was powering the number of the portals

155
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
And then you also buy to have the same model

156
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
And service provider and I still remember that was the

157
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Yeah

158
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,703
Definition of the thesis I wrote in a mammal

159
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Partners

160
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,823
And so that was a thesis but I think I'm the line yet

161
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
That was this

162
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
View

163
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,199
That as information grow and that's more

164
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
Svss more websites and small content

165
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:00,671
It'll pull to put away portals is organizing the information to a directory is not enough

166
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
I'm so search has to be eventually a gateway

167
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,095
Now I wouldn't have predicted business model at that time

168
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,679
I just predicted the knee and predicted the guy.

169
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,751
And then obviously Baidu

170
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
2002

171
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Pivoted to a beauty model

172
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,687
Was it yeah it was it really 2001

173
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
How difficult was it get to that

174
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,343
Decision it was it was not a it was not a straightforward decision

175
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
At that time

176
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
That was a robin

177
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,023
So we had Cena so who natys we had all the major portals by the way

178
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
As our customers right

179
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
So

180
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
Pink customer site okay

181
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
But really we're not really making a lot of money is like

182
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
200000 us what a year and so it's it's a fundamental questions of where the value

183
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
When we go to capture the value

184
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:58,271
Obviously going to see setting up your own portal you're competing with

185
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Your customers

186
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
And so that's

187
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,183
That's a I know that really puts a Barbie doll to True a lot of conversations like

188
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,047
Are we sure we going to do this I think one Robin was very determined and

189
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Because he feels like

190
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Is heated SRU guide like

191
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,959
No is that desno

192
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,591
There's no outcome there's no Market there's no value yes you can get

193
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Some business right

194
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
But there's not a big business

195
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
So I didn't.

196
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,551
Determination he had at that time was really really important

197
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,647
And so the reference that we have what we do not Google I mean Google was in

198
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Thalia

199
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
In 2001

200
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
So it was really goto.com

201
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,095
Goto.com with a company that actually bfj in basket

202
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
As well

203
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
That had to model for people performing

204
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
The acquired

205
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
First five placements on

206
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
All the search results in all the major portals and and they basically but they do Albatross business they they don't really own

207
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Massage

208
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
So

209
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Both Robin and nose in some ways of Google as well figure that hate that's the model that they could money

210
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Overtime

211
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Goto.com

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Approving a business model

213
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
So you grab in Singapore when is school there in

214
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,167
Works there in the beginning of your career when did you come across the idea

215
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
Singapore my specific

216
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
So

217
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,847
I grew up in Singapore Joe Iowa

218
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Mike my dad my

219
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:33,247
My mom that book to the both of Chinese Peking they were both teachers and I grew up in a very

220
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
Chinese speaking family my

221
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,135
My dad had monster in Chinese history so

222
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
So I had the

223
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,255
Affiliation or Affinity to China even when I was

224
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Young

225
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
I think a lot of it is

226
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,679
The fact that I grew up in a family that you know gives me the confidence and

227
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Some level of understanding

228
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Aon

229
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Affinity to China

230
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,079
Until when opportunity comes along

231
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
I was like okay you know I should go spend some time

232
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
My first trip to China was

233
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Back in

234
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
In the second year

235
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
University

236
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
So

237
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,647
At that time you know I I I did a

238
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Exchange program in Hong Kong University

239
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
And then I

240
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
I added a trip to China

241
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,911
It was quite an experience One China was to

242
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Very good I was 19

243
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
You wasn't about 1990

244
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
So

245
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,895
The country is due a very close country is still limited by resources and

246
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
Open up in 1992

247
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
With the storm

248
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Hey Ya

249
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,575
It was very only

250
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
And I took a train through Hong Kong

251
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:48,511
I from Sunshine all the way up to about how large is north of Beijing

252
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
And

253
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,375
I still remember when I tried tried to cross that border deal with people who say

254
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Hey you know can you

255
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,751
Does this job so it's still a plan economy

256
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
So that's this coupon that you can

257
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
If you can bring across and got a stamp

258
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
They would actually be able to

259
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,831
You know cat the produce across the rug which is the television without those taxation

260
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Without the

261
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
The import tax

262
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
And so I tried to do that

263
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
I was a student I can make a mule some money

264
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,239
And I was caught at the immigration I was brought into the immigration room

265
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
And I was questioned and

266
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
You know initially I'll show you this.

267
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
It was quite an experience

268
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:47,135
So it it's in the process of traveling through China

269
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,463
You see the different faces of China

270
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
And that the important thing is that over the years you see how I think what's important for people to know

271
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
All about China

272
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Is not a ball

273
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
What you see at an instant

274
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,055
He's about the change that you see in the process

275
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
Because that changes

276
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
The one that is

277
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Power

278
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
The change. Jessie ended

279
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,503
Does the simple change in infrastructure

280
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
But it's also the change in the people the my side

281
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
I think that was something that actually caught me in

282
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
And say this is a country that

283
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
Come up

284
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
I really agree

285
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,375
When I'm in school here I go back around once a year and every time I go back I don't recognize the country

286
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,215
Yeah and I think right now like I don't go back for more than 3 months

287
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Completely

288
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
Well you know just the kids that we talked to

289
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
Yesterday I mean do you know what

290
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
That's what I was like conversation is like

291
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
I mean these kids are

292
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Amazing I mean

293
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
The power they know what they want

294
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
I mean if you compare two

295
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
This I guess the same group of kids their parents in the end and the generation before then it got very different but the change

296
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
Going through and the inter like that

297
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
It's Alicia

298
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
In this country

299
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Is the one that

300
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
That's really amazing for

301
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,847
This generation Z is going up with a lot more confidence about half lot more information

302
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
That anyone else beforehand

303
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
Ryan isn't probably see them

304
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Carrabba's lentil rice

305
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,807
So how did you first come across to TV

306
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Elementary

307
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:27,487
Gbwhats actually founded by four Founders how many seeing Joe Kalman

308
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
We have hanging out and Scott Bond him as well

309
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,143
I am the one Thomas and Joel Thomas Wilson

310
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
My college

311
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
At at

312
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
So he

313
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
He ran a

314
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
I find it that timing on Dennis TV called TV

315
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
DanTDM related

316
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
Became Pediatrician on TV of China became hippies

317
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
So anyway that's a little bit

318
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
History dare

319
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,111
So Thomas and I goes kind of way by and I knew him since that he say

320
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,719
After I joined the fji idea to leave the FJ

321
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
We started to have conversation

322
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
You know about last name saying

323
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
You know he really want that

324
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
Me to comment

325
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
Nail spend time with gdb

326
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,519
And actually help set up 2GB in China

327
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,663
Set a time that was so so Jenny 2005 is 2005 and

328
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
So you know she

329
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,527
I do remember so Thomas

330
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,623
That time you know got his team we spend time together

331
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:33,279
And then we also went to this Alibaba big event in the Westlake in 2005

332
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,679
That's why I spent quite a bit of time with Haney with Jenny and so the idea was kind of coming together

333
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
I had the

334
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Option of say hey ghost.

335
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
Fun Zone files

336
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,383
Or Johnny apothem and I figured that

337
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Partnership is actually not that easy

338
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
You want to join a group that

339
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
That you have some affinity

340
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
And so you

341
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:00,159
You may not be a like but at least you have some

342
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
Cultural connection you have some

343
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
A common understanding you have some common

344
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Friends in common

345
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
Browns and so you can you can go a long way

346
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Sold out

347
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,543
Big part of my consideration when I drawn ggb was the fact that I know Thomas for a long time

348
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,175
What was different about you versus the other us Farm cuz I remember

349
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Baidu Harrah

350
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Back in 2000

351
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,111
234 had a tough time raising money from Sandhill Road everybody in the whole world could have seen

352
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,439
Baidu Baidu and could have invested everyone pass

353
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
So what was about you TV that make you feel comfortable that is

354
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Does not like another

355
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
ABC women's China

356
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
Ford GT vs

357
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
Gdb actually I think

358
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Thomas beard

359
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
Haney and

360
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
God and Joel

361
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,455
I didn't get the group and we we we started off with this

362
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
Very fundamental view of

363
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
The cross-border

364
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
We believe that

365
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,183
That's a lot of intellectual average that we can get

366
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
Across us and China by being on both sides

367
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
We

368
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,167
I I saw how the team spend time together in fact

369
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
I meant that more than once I met him in

370
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,591
The whole team in Singapore I met whole team in Beijing and made the whole team in

371
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
The valley

372
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
So you can see how

373
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
They are spending time together

374
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
To interconnect

375
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
A lot of the

376
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
Views of the views and ideas

377
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
And two today I think that's the

378
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
Approach that we continue to take

379
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Gdb

380
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,791
Across is punishable we spend time across

381
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
Both both region

382
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
Having all sides but it is in

383
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
DUIs are in China

384
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
And being on the ground

385
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
Asking what's happening it's important

386
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,103
So I think for many of the

387
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Silicon Valley.

388
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
You know where I was the FJ

389
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
To be fair I think

390
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
Tim Draper someone really.

391
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Spend time

392
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Traveling around

393
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Most people would not

394
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
Maybe they'll do it once in

395
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
A long time ago

396
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,767
One year two year three years but not frequently

397
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
You know how many times a year

398
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
So

399
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,679
So that's that's the engagement I think only when you

400
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
Hot and feel and not just reading

401
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
Materials

402
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,943
An articles that you can make a better connection and F4 you can bake a better

403
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Inform judge

404
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
On what you're investing

405
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
You have that many of the

406
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Largest m&a

407
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
Yeah in history of Chinese internet sector starting with Joe Caputo which was the first ever multibillion-dollar dealer that got done

408
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
Internet in China

409
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,655
Read about it I was extremely impressed inspired

410
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
The way you did and what else is possible

411
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
I thought I was coming who can be a different era

412
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
Starting with that deal with more to come

413
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,223
How did you think about the idea of structuring the deal

414
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,551
And how did not get you to do more things like that

415
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
/ lost

416
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
Yasso

417
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
It alright

418
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,487
I as I spend time on tudor

419
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
And I spend time with Gabrielle

420
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Look at how this company has

421
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
It is a

422
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
Interesting I mean it with a first-mover

423
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
In the market

424
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,543
Caught on video online video the

425
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
Obviously

426
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,407
It started with more little bit of a beetle parked cars and then it evolves right

427
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
Andy become more mainstream content

428
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
And

429
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
So as it becomes more mainstream content

430
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Y'all

431
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Oh that's

432
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
A lot more content

433
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Acquisition and cost

434
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
Escalate so it's not just use acquisition

435
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Costas contact

436
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
So as you look at this

437
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Particle

438
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
The competition start to get intense and

439
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
2011

440
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,799
Where's the cost of content escalating as much as

441
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
5 to 10

442
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,359
Display

443
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,943
It's it was like hundred to two hundred thousand

444
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Rmb / episode 2

445
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
A million to 2 million

446
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Rmb

447
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Any shot of Everclear

448
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
So that was this

449
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
The first

450
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Dang it I mean

451
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Looking at a market

452
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
And

453
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Looking at and then

454
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,192
Look ggv are we had quite a bit of money in there we actually brought our

455
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
We also brought audit investors

456
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
I feel really real

457
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,576
O'Reilly's 405 it was 10% off of fun

458
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,136
Also that the question is really

459
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
You know what

460
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
Was nice and

461
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
You know that

462
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Doodle

463
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
At with all the

464
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
We bought a $10 house

465
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
It did go IPO and

466
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Murad ipoe

467
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
Waipio Valley weather

468
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
About to the market also reacted to a point where I get home devaluation came down Hymn for her

469
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
100 million in

470
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
You don't we have

471
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,296
200 million cash but that's why I took 200 million cash

472
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Will last about

473
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
Tough monster

474
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
That's Gary

475
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
That's really scary like wet wild can you raise capital

476
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Drink

477
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
So

478
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
He my mind

479
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Consolidation

480
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Has to happen

481
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
This Market

482
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
Has we got consolidated

483
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240
So and I went around talking to

484
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
The people

485
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
Gary I spoke with Victor I spoke with Roku

486
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
Victor youku

487
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,760
I spoke with Kanye from I touch your body if I do

488
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
So I thought that talking to Dom

489
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
They hate this kind of

490
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Obviously I'm coming from a position

491
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Where

492
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Yunnan

493
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,792
You're not looking at $2 and I told to Gary this

494
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
I said

495
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
If consolidation is going to happen

496
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
You want

497
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:06,752
Because you captured the most valued by being the kingmaker

498
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Right

499
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
That was a thing that really try to get him to think about his number 3

500
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
Number one

501
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,808
He was I mean in terms of traffic it was kind of

502
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,184
Two so it one two three but in that ballpark are not that far apart

503
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,976
But you can really be the key make

504
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
In that instant bright

505
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,424
NBA players that PDP players

506
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
And so I do

507
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Which a lot more traffic

508
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
So we knew something has to have

509
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
So that that for

510
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,248
Biplane got hand I was able to you know

511
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Get the attention

512
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
No problem

513
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,880
Well I didn't when I talk to the CEOs

514
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,440
Everybody knew that

515
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,000
The biggest issue is Trust

516
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Life

517
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
How can we do this

518
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,888
Like because to have a MMA

519
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
You have to

520
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
Open up the kimono

521
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,264
Like everybody has to say okay this is

522
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,896
This is what I have open up some gas so you have to open

523
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
And

524
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
And that's one

525
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
2 is

526
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
You have to feed all the manager

527
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
So

528
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Let me know

529
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
Deck that can be

530
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
D2L

531
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
Alright so somebody

532
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Has to step aside

533
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,048
And what do we do with the match many Star just one person

534
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Is that one team

535
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
So that's always the the

536
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
Ski park

537
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
In MMA

538
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
So I think

539
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
I was able to figure that out

540
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
That was in

541
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,896
One12 12 2012 when

542
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
I remember it was

543
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Chinese New Year and

544
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,344
I had a call with Eric leave from Shumway Venture and then

545
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,672
So now after we had multiple calls out the dad hand

546
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
We brought everybody to a neutral ground

547
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,560
We had to re everybody to neutral ground which is

548
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,656
Hong Kong 4 and we had a closed-door session

549
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:16,032
Kioku into town between you and to the whole one day one it's almost one full day

550
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,848
All through the night and we had a handshake

551
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
How we took a bow

552
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Just about three weeks

553
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
From that point on

554
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
To iron out

555
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Mejor Crema

556
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
But I can be announced

557
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
Obviously

558
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
Taobao listed company

559
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
The whole completion of the transaction

560
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Take time

561
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,864
I'm going to be a little naughty and ask obviously you're very Closer by do and you know both Robin and also

Hook up by the woods on the water LIC was in the white numbers

564
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,616
Well you have to ask that

565
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
When he saw the news was

566
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
It was a little bit

567
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,480
Wow shop with them as well

568
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,880
About to be fair

569
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
It all

570
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
What we're friends but

571
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
I will lay the opportunity

572
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536
Down for you but if we

573
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
If I want to get the dude on reading speed

574
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
And certainty certainty is important

575
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,496
So that that that driving conviction and

576
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Determination to want

577
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Galveston Veterinary

578
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Victor

579
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
So

580
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Do in terms of

581
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
At exits to thing

582
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm pretty sure start thinking about that from day one and have a clear idea of how their come

583
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
Exidor

584
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
I think

585
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,840
No I think you have to stop it I Dear Dad

586
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,192
Well if you if you want to go and build something

587
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
You don't build something to say

588
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,848
I built a Sal around I think you want to build and say I want to build something

589
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
Now the outcome is really hot

590
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,712
I would say that

591
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
You know I've been in this business for a loss

592
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
18 years

593
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
In-N-Out China

594
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
And

595
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,696
I didn't first ten years most people would say.

596
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
IPO is the

597
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
The way to go

598
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
Because

599
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
First of all that wasn't Manny

600
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
Super unicorns

601
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
Unicorns that actually can make

602
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Logic

603
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Right

604
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
So

605
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
You know

606
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,640
From 2010 to now heading over the last 8 years

607
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Now we have

608
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
We are

609
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
These ginormous companies like

610
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,064
Aliante concern and baidu

611
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
JDJ

612
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
So they have

613
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
They now have the

614
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Market

615
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
Market cap

616
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Uwell 2

617
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
How to make Lodge acquisition

618
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
Interesting outcomes

619
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
So I think the market has

620
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,680
Change so Eminem

621
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Just ice

622
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
In the US will be

623
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
Become a

624
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,848
Could be a very interesting Isaac in some ways it can be a better exit

625
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,432
How if you have to complete looking at liquidity part of you yet

626
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
Bubble of entrepreneurs and Anubis

627
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,832
But I think a lot of people don't realize that up until that you'll go to the murderer

628
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
IPO with

629
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
Primarily the only way

630
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,416
That's right people to get AIDS

631
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
In the US where is 80% lemonade

632
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,048
Was all IPO up Adele.

633
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,376
Engineer fu

634
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
Few more prominent big-name M&S

635
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,776
I didn't next one was Vikings investments into chunara

636
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
With controlling stake

637
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
That was another unusual

638
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Move

639
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
What had a controlling stake but also

640
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
The company was able to go

641
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,040
Public only two deals I was done at all time when it was so who

642
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,320
And their game company

643
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,904
And then I was with what you did with by doing too.

644
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,744
So how did that work and once again how do you generate rust on both side

645
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
To have

646
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
Both sides agreed that yes one will have control mistake but no to the amazement has control operationally

647
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,288
Yeah well I think the

648
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,872
The story was that you know chunar

649
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
That was back in 2011

650
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
So in 2011 shootout

651
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,296
Started off as a meta-search play

652
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
And

653
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
Yeah you were competing with

654
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
Cucina

655
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
Initially and but

656
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
Overtime

657
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,512
You know if we want to take

658
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,096
True not with you level so you was more like a kayak and sites that in the US

659
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
And

660
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
It if you want to take schunard to a bigger

661
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Company

662
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
That business model is not enough

663
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
So it has to

664
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,920
It has to evolve into more Beyond a Media Company be and become a OT

665
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
Call order I mean

666
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
How do you become a o t a i mean really dead

667
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:47,648
That whole supply chain is being controlled by both sitra Bandito

668
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
So

669
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
Two so that two outcomes one is

670
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,864
We sell the company at that time we had the option of selling the company say

671
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,424
600 700 million to

672
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
OCC Tribble

673
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
The lights

674
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Or

675
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,104
We want we continue to grow that company

676
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
But we need some

677
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Ammunition

678
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
So

679
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,040
And so the idea that time I had was

680
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
If we can have Baidu to invest

681
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
And if I do can

682
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
You know

683
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,000
We can make sure not become the de facto

684
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Gateway

685
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
Fall travel search

686
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
You'll be a very pompous

687
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
So at least I control

688
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
The supply I mean

689
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
50 Monaghan

690
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
And then I can work on the supply chain

691
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
So that was the idea

692
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
And so I brought the Baidu team

693
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
Abroad

694
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
CCI prison

695
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,504
So together and and have a conversation

696
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,832
And I was able to work out a deal

697
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
With them

698
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
Obviously d

699
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
It was complex because Baidu

700
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,512
Definitely wanted control

701
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
So we negotiated the

702
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
The control State you know

703
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
How to 60%

704
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
And

705
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,960
We wanted to maintain Independence oh

706
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
We we have

707
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
7 boat seats

708
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
I'll preach Baidu

709
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
At 4

710
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,152
But that's a 4-seat that the appointment

711
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Remember so

712
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
A sort of the Divide

713
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,296
So that was how we

714
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Restructured the

715
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
Deal

716
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,672
And we went pretty well

717
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:29,280
Soda company continue to grow that business in 2013 we IPO to come

718
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
But competition

719
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Continue to

720
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
It becomes

721
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
In Tad's right way

722
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Wave sea travel

723
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:40,544
ISO Alibaba and so

724
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,152
By 2015 we forget the funeral James Leon came back to see Trey band

725
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,224
Airsoft at the conversation alkmaar consolidation then

726
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
So we did we did that m&a with

727
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Shinar

728
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Back in 25th

729
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
Team

730
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
And it was a great outcome for us

731
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,976
It really priced

732
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,816
Tonight at 7 to 8 billion so you was at a Next Step Up

733
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
From producing Bessemer

734
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
It wasn't

735
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
Step up from Baidu investment because

736
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
Baidu investment web

737
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,336
Radiator that's how about you we have sold the company

738
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Would have been

739
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
2015 combo

740
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,992
How do you negotiate a deal

741
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Deal that's acceptable

742
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
To everyone

743
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
Especially a lot of the time

744
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
People may have different

745
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
Intros and

746
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,768
One player might be more dominant than the other so how do you make sure everyone

747
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
A set of terms and

748
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Except

749
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
First of all you have we have to understand what

750
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Each body wash

751
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
So Baidu has

752
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
This strategy

753
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
That time

754
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
If you look at it

755
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
It was run relative

756
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,112
They had a strategy that. Somebody goals Dede wood

757
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
I won a majority

758
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,048
As much of a stake as possible but they are very willing

759
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Spell to have that

760
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
Management and

761
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Xiamen

762
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,680
Given to

763
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
To the team

764
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
Depron step business

765
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
So that that was you know

766
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Baidu

767
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Onesite

768
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Okay I want to own that body

769
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
5 minute IQ

770
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
Run it

771
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
Vincent has a similar Style

772
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
10010 has

773
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Today at

774
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,368
Samosa by tencent doesn't require that lot ownership

775
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,904
I do at that Minority

776
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
That's what I might do is more majority type

777
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Arrange

778
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
You have to figure out what the

779
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
One that's why

780
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,144
And whether in the management what do they want

781
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,752
So I think for the management team as well for cc but the club

782
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
Who would want to step up as a CEO

783
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
You know because

784
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
You know he will lavish on that

785
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
To build

786
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
You will be able to take this company

787
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
2

788
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,552
You know just from Media company to a OTA camp

789
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
That's what really he wanted

790
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,440
So he's willing to give out that ownership

791
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Set time to 2

792
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
To do that

793
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
So I think it's a question of just

794
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Making those needs

795
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Matt

796
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
And you know

797
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,472
I'm building a Arrangement equating arrangement.

798
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
Allow precise to

799
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
To get what you want

800
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,872
With the recent merger of

801
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Humana and culture about

802
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Which are the largest

803
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
Top trucking companies

804
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,784
The angel investor one guy actually became

805
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Ciccio

806
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:39,488
Adding that on that deal, say that there's a lot of that's a lot of investors and wet Wild

807
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,560
Route the few minority shareholder off you my mind

808
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
I will give a lot of

809
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,168
A lot of the credit to one column

810
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:53,056
I remember one thing is last year in August I was

811
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
Traveling in Europe

812
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,152
Wangjing caught me and say hey

813
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
Deal you know

814
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
I'm going to do this and I'm going to

815
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
He and he was still alive

816
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:08,672
He was mine he was an angel investors it was positioning himself and invested but he was the one who really negotiating

817
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
Shockwave WhatsApp

818
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
What's a bonnet

819
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Alliance

820
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
So he told me he's going to get it done in

821
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
2 weeks

822
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,680
Hi babe

823
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:26,080
Do I got a few things.

824
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
I told him was like that's not going to work

825
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,224
Because they are very comfortable in size

826
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
And I think that

827
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
That's no one

828
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Management that can

829
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
Say

830
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,672
I don't know how to say this in English like

831
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Bhutan rights

832
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
What size is saying that

833
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
Okay you know I

834
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,328
I I gave up you you are you're better than me

835
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
I don't think so at that time

836
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
The

837
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:57,568
The the management team leadership the leadership of the management team

838
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
It's not that clear

839
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,432
So I said you know

840
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,504
I think ini I post this to Wonka I said

841
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
If you want to do this the fasting

842
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
The right thing for you to do

843
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
Become the CEO

844
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
If you become the CEO of the company

845
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,304
Everybody will follow everybody will

846
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Will follow you

847
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
The leadership

848
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
Annies

849
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,728
He's X Alibaba your has a operator experience

850
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
He has

851
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,104
The credential office investor indeed investor DDC

852
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
He has that cloud

853
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:41,600
So anyway it the whole deal took months actually

854
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
In

855
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
I didn't want to be the tremendous job off

856
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
You know

857
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,304
Talking to the various investors on both sides

858
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
And including the government

859
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
That the supported

860
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
No both sides in order to prospective government

861
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
Still to come pick us as Lotto

862
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Disadvantage

863
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
So I think he managed to

864
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
Will all these things

865
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Together and

866
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
And cut a deal work so so

867
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,808
By mistake my hat off to him and he's done a fantastic

868
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Even

869
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
STD bronchitis

870
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Or didi and Uber

871
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Just

872
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
After that you'll who to delete everyone

873
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
I'm a lot more used to

874
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
Doing MMA

875
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
Joseph put inmate Huntingdon

876
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Excetera excetera

877
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
What do you think are there

878
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
External factors

879
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,360
And I made a lot more possible to have MMA after 2011

880
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:40,736
What were the two factors involving with Audubon Pennsylvania made a possible easier to have

881
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Honda deals

882
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
Well I think that

883
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Does a lot more MMA I think that's

884
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,696
An accidental Factory is ready

885
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
These Market

886
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,560
China the pace of change

887
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
An innovation is

888
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Accelerator

889
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
The market adoption

890
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
Consumers education everything is

891
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
Add a salary.

892
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,616
You look at how I weezing evolve you look at how payment evolve in China

893
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
A lot of that has

894
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
Capital

895
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
That's a lot

896
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Capital being

897
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,040
Pumping to subsidiary

898
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,344
The program that is subsidies and so hot

899
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
2 2

900
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
To drive adoption

901
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
I'm on hand you have

902
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
Rapid adoption

903
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Janina Market

904
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
Which is driven a lot by capital

905
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
But yeah.

906
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
On the other hand

907
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
A dry scalp

908
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Titian

909
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,728
At different levels which also requires a lot of Kappa

910
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Thrift store

911
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:38,080
It all it does a limit to how much Capital you can race

912
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
Despite whether you are TD or York yd

913
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,760
That's a limit to how much valuation people are willing to pay and so

914
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,808
Hiding capital

915
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
A factor that

916
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
Actually drives those MMA

917
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,696
Because you can no longer race

918
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
Mall Cop

919
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
Enough for you to Bard

920
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,632
So you have to pick out while snacks and sold that forces a lot of consolidation

921
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:05,472
I think it stopped it really with online video

922
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,056
Inanity boss into the out of oracle's like

923
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:15,456
You know EDM quality by sharing and Uber China and the ride sharing space and then we have

924
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
Measuring by Sherri Webb

925
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
May Tuan and Kim King

926
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
Which is more deep

927
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
Takeout business

928
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,232
So you just consult will you continue to see this happen

929
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Because

930
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
The market

931
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
SMB capital

932
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Market can no longer

933
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Take those

934
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,448
Financial subsidies in finance

935
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Consolidation

936
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
So I think that's a big

937
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Factor

938
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,200
The other thing is just I think with the yucutu doe case it's also a mindset shift

939
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
People understand what that means

940
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,600
And entrepreneurs who have

941
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
You know

942
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,256
Y'all bet the guys was sold that business are you know to mm850 Exeter

943
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
They

944
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,888
DXE the Army good with with with

945
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
I mean big they got up with pot of gold

946
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
I think

947
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,544
When you when you see that it's also important

948
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,688
All the entrepreneurship the alpha down hard work is it paid for

949
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
If not

950
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
It's not the little just walk away without anything

951
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,112
So I think that outcome also helps

952
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
So

953
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
So I think it's a

954
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
2 factors

955
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
You've let a lot of Jujubes invest

956
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
Shenzhen mobility in

957
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Including

958
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,632
Ride-sharing companies like Didi and grab

959
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Bike sharing

960
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Hello bike

961
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,008
Trucking company in my mind and also connected car company

962
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Expo Motors or shop on seashore

963
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:49,408
I wonder what makes you excited about mobility and you are mine

964
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,200
In 10 years how will people be

965
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,320
Yeah so I think that's a pieces that

966
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
Affirm

967
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
I woke

968
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
Wave hands at work with Jenny so we

969
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,512
We we we talked quite a bit about

970
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
You know I do remember

971
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
So when we first started

972
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
This whole thing is just a concept

973
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
Porsche economy right

974
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
But ride-sharing in

975
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
I'm so

976
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
Professing faster in grab it and a dog

977
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
We caught up with Ed

978
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
I didn't hold

979
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
The whole tracking service

980
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Chris Paul

981
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
I didn't want is

982
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,528
If you look at it all business model

983
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
They all wear

984
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
What is on the consumer and business and

985
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
It's it's not easy to connect

986
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
Demand and supply

987
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,536
So that's a fundamental issue which Mobility I

988
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
She creates because it's

989
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Location

990
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,144
So that technology

991
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
Mobility solution actually

992
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Makes a connection work

993
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
And then along with that I think that's the first time

994
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,848
And

995
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,663
We we we done went on from

996
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
Connecting people

997
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
Because

998
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,783
The guy providing the sub is a drivers do a person

999
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,087
How to connecting with an object

1000
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,415
Which is a car or bike to stop

1001
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
So I think that

1002
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,767
The mobility solution will evolve

1003
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
The

1004
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
D Supply on

1005
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
Which is the vehicle

1006
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,471
Ghost from the bike

1007
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Christmas elf drawing

1008
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,055
South right to

1009
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
A car which can be bought on Amazon

1010
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
What time

1011
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Is

1012
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,175
The connection will be caught will change

1013
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,455
Towaco from

1014
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
People to object

1015
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:34,623
And so that will be a lot more technology that needs to go in there

1016
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:37,183
How to make the car more intelligent

1017
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
Autonomous over

1018
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
What time

1019
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
So I think

1020
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
If you see the evolution of this actor

1021
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
And

1022
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Wake me think that

1023
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
These things going to

1024
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Convert

1025
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
The car company

1026
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
And the right sharing

1027
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
Platforms

1028
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
It's going to come by

1029
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,639
He my mind out of the food truck Alliance now is called

1030
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
It's going to

1031
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
He has to think about how to

1032
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,223
How to build trucks that is

1033
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Eponymous

1034
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
Overtime

1035
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
Espada 1

1036
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,927
So that connection will ship all the time and so

1037
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
I didn't put ugb is

1038
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
We have to

1039
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
We ambassador

1040
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
We invest ahead so we

1041
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,399
These are pieces of Jigsaw somehow

1042
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
Now that maybe

1043
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,775
Working independently as different companies and still

1044
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,823
Collaborate with each other or they may

1045
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
Much with each other

1046
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
At some point

1047
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
We don't know

1048
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
But

1049
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
I think it is a

1050
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
Directions

1051
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
That market is high

1052
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
That

1053
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Car

1054
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,087
The supply and will become more and more

1055
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Collagen will be

1056
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
Become more a man if you will

1057
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
All on this side it just

1058
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Become more intelligent

1059
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
Telling you the kind of service

1060
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
You can ride a bike

1061
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
If you're just going for a

1062
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,959
Want to 3 kilometer or 1 2 3 miles

1063
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
How are you can

1064
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
Got a car

1065
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,079
So in that same app

1066
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
You you should have all the transportation service that you know

1067
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
Versus having like multiple apps

1068
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
So I think that will be more

1069
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
Consolidation that could happen in disc

1070
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,903
So what investment that was not as obvious

1071
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
Is from day one was

1072
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
The bike sharing

1073
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Hello by Adele

1074
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
So

1075
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
When

1076
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
When you met them

1077
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,351
The second was already very heated with

1078
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,935
A lot of investors money going into ammo bicondova

1079
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,263
And that the vendor markets in China was pretty saturated Allred

1080
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Yeah

1081
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,663
And they failed

1082
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,479
And the founder was very young so what makes you believe

1083
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,807
That it was a good idea to invest in demand

1084
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,159
Obviously it's a very prescient decision because they're the number one

1085
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
Independent by sharing

1086
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
Player in China

1087
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
I love you but don't know.

1088
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
Production by Alibaba

1089
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Yeah

1090
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,191
Well when I first look at this

1091
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Bike sharing space

1092
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
I was trying to

1093
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Figo light how do you make

1094
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
How big is

1095
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:08,735
It was

1096
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Funeral

1097
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,367
You can predict that you don't even need to pay to write to to try to get a ride bro

1098
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,183
How do you make money from a ride-sharing

1099
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,231
Service that that was mine

1100
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
First question

1101
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
And

1102
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
So

1103
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
So we we met

1104
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,423
We might mobike or we not owe for that time

1105
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
And

1106
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,519
Find out what different questions that we

1107
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,567
We had it on my about both companies

1108
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
This

1109
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,383
Otho had a very

1110
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Simple

1111
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
Bike

1112
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,967
Religious a bike with a lock

1113
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
Like a mechanical lock

1114
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
And I will work

1115
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
So

1116
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,487
And and when I look at the model is 200 RMB a by the cost of operating the 200 by

1117
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
Towanda R&B by a lot

1118
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
Is quite High

1119
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
I mean

1120
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,887
At that time David

1121
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
Debbie Wade

1122
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,519
The co

1123
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
So hat is

1124
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,919
Had his model and I was looking at a model I said

1125
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
You can never really

1126
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,527
Take tomorrow cuz I think the cost of operation

1127
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
Co-op

1128
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
The rights

1129
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
Robot robot

1130
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,415
The number of rice per day could shift

1131
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,975
As you go from Summer to Winter

1132
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,327
Things like that so so when I look at tomorrow it wasn't quite making

1133
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
And mobile

1134
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Similar and

1135
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,703
So when

1136
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,543
@brenda Halo by came to me and so it was already out

1137
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
Portfolio is they had a service

1138
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
For parking. Time in

1139
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
What's not going very far and this is his

1140
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,503
Second Venture and

1141
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:50,879
And then you know and then he tried to any'tizers tried to tell me to ask him to do this which is

1142
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,695
Stuck in the shade so

1143
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,279
Why should I believe you and so I think when he tried to do that

1144
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,375
But he threw his first to graduate he has a

1145
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
Accumulated

1146
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
A lot of operating know how

1147
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
He understand a lot of the issues

1148
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Around

1149
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,615
Bike operation

1150
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
A product

1151
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
Prada issues and how to make

1152
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,479
Operationally efficient

1153
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
The service operation

1154
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Play fishing

1155
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,623
So I thought that victim of Engineers

1156
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,183
It was a good team of Engineers and

1157
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,767
So it'd be the one interesting thing is

1158
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,583
Initially I

1159
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
Completely convinced I say

1160
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,679
Well what are you going to do

1161
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:42,079
What are some trials threatened in some selected cities that he did he went to two cities and he did some trials he came

1162
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
The numbers

1163
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
And and then

1164
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,687
He sought to open my mind

1165
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,479
About what disc

1166
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
Grandma one I think

1167
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
The the number of

1168
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Rice actually

1169
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
This this is a big mark

1170
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,975
So just from a frequency of Engagement

1171
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,535
Is far higher than the TDM

1172
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,655
So at that time I kind of we did a bag

1173
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
So tobacco

1174
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
The envelope

1175
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,239
So as to Major list for China

1176
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,543
That these rights but they could get to

1177
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
100

1178
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
That's a big number

1179
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
In terms of using

1180
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
Well that's one thing that caught me

1181
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
The second thing is

1182
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
Yeah he was telling me that

1183
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
Hey you know I'm not just doing bikes

1184
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
I'm going to do

1185
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
Electric Power

1186
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,255
But has a lot more product and Technology

1187
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
Emo music

1188
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
That you need to deal with light charging

1189
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
Bison

1190
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,959
Prices wireless charging on charging stations and blah blah blah

1191
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,007
Those are issues that he hasn't

1192
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,567
I figured out yet but he said hate directionally this

1193
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
Xiamen to do

1194
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
I'm going to increase my

1195
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,943
Not only the frequency of Engagement but

1196
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
The distance for

1197
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,247
Travel

1198
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
But

1199
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
That statue God got me

1200
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
Interested

1201
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,695
So I brought you haunted

1202
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,511
Wake up at 3:54 how did you get over by that

1203
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
The concern that

1204
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
Via subsidy will still be there

1205
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,887
In art what the capital of

1206
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
Christopher Wilde

1207
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471
Do you feel that give me a passage with all the

1208
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
Consolidation

1209
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
That won't last forever

1210
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,591
Then we already a year 2 years into it

1211
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,639
So the

1212
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
So

1213
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,503
So I honestly do I bet on this guy become

1214
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Number one right from the inside not really

1215
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:34,719
I was like okay what's my wand

1216
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,023
The other thing about Vice sharing is that

1217
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
China has closed

1218
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,351
400 series

1219
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Wave

1220
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,959
More than a million million people

1221
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
And so

1222
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
This

1223
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:53,407
And in a mobile and even at that time or buy a no-fault alarm me in Tijuana

1224
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,735
Fairfield City to get dad's room for them to grow

1225
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
Said that's one thought

1226
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
The second thought is that

1227
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,111
No because even after this

1228
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,927
Given to all this because I haven't been amazed

1229
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,207
The worst case scenario

1230
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975
How to get console

1231
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
Odyssey that's value

1232
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,143
So that's how I thought about initially

1233
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
I hate you

1234
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
If they do there's any

1235
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
To do this right

1236
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
In the West cast

1237
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,847
So that's why I know

1238
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,151
Will you be I got you and Jenny we spent

1239
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
Sometime in between

1240
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,223
We put in the first 5 million and

1241
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
II

1242
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:34,111
Free melon so we continue to finance him until Chang we came along and and Financial

1243
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Taking the long way.

1244
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,927
And today they are

1245
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
By far the largest player

1246
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
Friday

1247
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,559
They are more than 25 minutes a day

1248
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
Yeah

1249
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
You know the aggregate

1250
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,447
Aggregate also go for a mobile

1251
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
Understand because

1252
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:55,359
That way his team had to buy clothes not as quick intelligent

1253
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,967
But what do you think is the reason that I hope I can overtake even mobike

1254
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
Number one for lunch

1255
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
Mike Meyer Weiner mobiles

1256
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Not so much on.

1257
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Product

1258
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,695
My Rio mobile was just

1259
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
My understanding of

1260
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
What's happening with the mange

1261
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Richmond

1262
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
So

1263
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
The

1264
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
Not Unified

1265
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Not as

1266
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Yeah not as Unified

1267
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,263
So I think that

1268
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
But you should die

1269
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
Roi

1270
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,895
I hear from afar

1271
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
Which

1272
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
I think

1273
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,479
So that was the thing that I

1274
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
I think eventually

1275
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
Octagon itself

1276
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
Presently being he's gay

1277
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
He's the

1278
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
He's a real founder

1279
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,671
Hi mobile

1280
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,975
He's the chairman but

1281
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
He is really doing

1282
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,279
Yellow wheels

1283
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,351
At Broadway and where he has hundreds of Millions.

1284
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
Bonnie Wright

1285
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,191
Orion TV company

1286
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,215
So what

1287
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,007
That's a TV company and so

1288
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,591
Wet weather cset right where does he stand

1289
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,151
So it's a different so I think that

1290
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,943
Evil entrepreneur has haiku

1291
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
Conviction in

1292
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,527
You know go all in on one one thing

1293
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
The chance of snow

1294
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Size of just hire

1295
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,999
GDP was not a major investment Automotive sector in the

1296
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,535
Between 2000-2010

1297
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:22,143
There were other investors who rushed into a space Cocina automotives a huge sector

1298
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
That's why she called me

1299
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
In China

1300
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
Poverty line

1301
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,751
60 years

1302
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,287
Most realistic

1303
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
E46 years

1304
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:34,175
MTV has become a major investor in the space lab IU with invest

1305
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,991
17dd and Edna Halo bike and

1306
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
And

1307
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
Norfolk Airlines

1308
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
So within a very few years

1309
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,255

Deep dive

1478
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,943
And spend time do I have to understand the fundamental

1479
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
A lot of

1480
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,503
The stop.

1481
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
About

1482
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,319
My view I mean

1483
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Talk about things

1484
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:38,719
That should be at a very high level

1485
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
What

1486
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,511
He can be but

1487
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,303
But there are a lot of

1488
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Things That Go

1489
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
Can go wrong

1490
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,399
And when things goes wrong

1491
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,215
Is it really going wrong or is it just a moment

1492
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,543
But I'll see if you can understand that

1493
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,079
You could dance

1494
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,663

You don't from my early investments in Baidu like

00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
