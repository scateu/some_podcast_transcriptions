00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
As well you need that 3-g

109
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
But that was believing it will come

110
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
Northwest Mall

111
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511

117
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,831
I sent a nice to food today is that China is one of the most

118
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
Entrepreneurial country and was one of the country with the most energy

That's what I like

123
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,127
When you went to China did you know anyone there or speak the language at all

124
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,223
So when I went to China I didn't speak a word like activity

125
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
I didn't

126
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Maybe

127
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,855

Yeah

139
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
I would say my first 18 months was I was mostly walking for Gomez so in the way I learned about what to do

140
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
What not to do in China

141
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791

To understand that and I'm happy to $12 each way before starting my own business he gave me time

143
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239

I would say I stopped other business in France and I like to joke once in awhile.

166
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
If you can do it in France probably can do it anywhere

167
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:13,983
Used to be better but I'm using it less so that's

168
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
That's bad

169
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335

Laundry hours

179
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
I think everyone looks wrong at all so wet when seems that people can also work for Marty I think we are

180
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Elmo focus on what

181
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
People than you hoes at the exact time of the office

182
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
So that small how we have Edwards at 10

183
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Between search team to ingenuity

184
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
I would say

185
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Organization

186
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
But different to your team saw a walking holiday

187
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
And if we do see 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. 6

188
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
No that's something you don't see in you up

189
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,615
And I'm surprised you don't see much activity in the US

190
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Not as much anymore

191
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Exact

192
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
I guess I could use to be more

193
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
But not much

194
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,575
So no that's part of United Rihanna

195
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
That probably Carreras puppys a place for us

196
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Walking

197
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
So how does

198
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
I should get for my world business

199
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
But size you from the quality of work

200
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Also very good

201
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
Some people think that you working hours

202
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Efficient

203
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
What do you think

204
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
I think it might be true in some companies

205
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
But I don't think it's true at that Pennywell really focus on the what people did you go again

206
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Simon's office

207
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
So so that's pretty awesome

208
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Acqua di Gio so jobs

209
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
So I guess it depends on the

210
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
You convenience fish

211
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,095
Different it seems like you can have both fast and

212
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
A lot of hours

213
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
I still have to work

214
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Outside

215
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
Scary combination

216
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Yeah I think so

217
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
What is the best Chinese company

218
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
How different is it

219
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
Anything at the end of the day like 96 and it's more about on my side and then motivation

220
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
Just like mere long hours but people charges

221
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,927
Hungrier and they want to work more and if they don't work not as safe to feel

222
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Left Behind if there

223
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Companies moving south

224
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,375
Yeah I seen China and that some of them are cats and I'll do 50 more hungry than usual

225
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
She take care of you don't say us sometimes

00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
PlayStation Kia Galpin I'm surprised I've always been hungry

227
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,431
So why some people don't take this but that's what you do

228
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,319
So as a result do you see more Innovations coming out of China due to these competitions

229
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
High-end

230
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135

00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
Innovations that came out of China receiver when it came to T-Mobile

234
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,335
It was not so hold on by the existing web and internet are presents

235
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151

236
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479

360
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
So yeah at some point we might sit

361
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,311
Something for for me personally

362
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
Having being title for

363
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
8 years on the ground

364
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Decide to move on

365
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
2A California

366
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
In 2013

367
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,759
Also because I want to build a morgue

368
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
We have office and both here

369
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
As well in San Francisco Boswell's

370
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
China

371
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
You can do so much more together having

372
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
Presence in Baltimore

373
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,399
Curious about your experience raising money from Chinese VCS at that time and both times in Birch Run,

374
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
Mendez V feel like at that time

375
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
Not a lot of Chinese BC's were investing in

376
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Enterprise

377
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Companies are not

378
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Let alone.

379
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,223
Founded by non-chinese on prayers so what was your experience like and was there anything that surprised you

380
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
Yeah it was different ear by reaching into space I mean somewhat surprised if he has a phone

381
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
How to tighten

382
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Get financing

383
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
I think the bigger issue was small

384
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
The fact that

385
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
Most of our focus and for good reason and b2c China Box

386
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,119
Its fashion

387
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
Beaches in China

388
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
White balls always arrest

389
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
Search for smoke trying to find

390
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
Type of investor will understand what

391
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
We try to do it

392
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,711
Easy I mean we want people to understand and believe what we do

393
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
If it's a stressful damage

394
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,575
It would be a strained relationship at some point Graham

395
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,439
So so far as that was already trying to find out until I'm not so many

396
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
We're ready International in mindset and west

397

Ready to talk in English

398
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,143
But Josephus were Smartphones at the time very

399
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,239
Shoe are in China Beijing thinking about app

2012 stop

403
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
But when we started like a cat

404
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
CiCi's Pizza phone number

405
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319

406
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Early fall

407
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
People to

408
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647

409
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,927

00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
And

415
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,447
Funny time when you started another When shall we started it wasn't obvious

416
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
The smartphone one

417
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Take over

418
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
And for both of us to succeed

419
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Almost

420
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
A Motorola Arris anoakia all have to fail

421

3 year.

Nokia Rush

429
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:07,967
I was like no way these guys are walking dead cuz I don't know it but well not going to sleep all day

430
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
I'm not going to invest or precious

431
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551

432
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
My my Julie hunt variant

Cranston West

434
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,184
Messages not on par

435
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
If you don't get it.

436
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
But I'm not going to

437
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Walking Walking Dead

438
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,864
And I think the Enterprise Market

439
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
What stuff

440
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Very tough.

441
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
Party tent

442
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Very few

443
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Successful

444
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
At all

445
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
But I think

446
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Since your success

447
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
Construction

448
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
Maurices in China are looking at Enterprise security

449
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
I think that over time

450
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,040
Giving all that big Chinese internet companies

451
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Grown up

452
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,136
You will you will make some time or Enterprise company that sells services

453
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Solution

454
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Do they speak Chinese in a jar

455
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
It's just like

456
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Mus

457
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
I totally agree

458
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
Bandits it's fun people to

459
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,144
Embossing operate multiple markets

460
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,448
Cuz you see some of the trends happening in one

461
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,752
And you just know it's about time we could happen

462
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
Studio the country and vice-versa

463
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
And when people just poke someone country

464
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Is very easy to have

465
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
Blind spots and nausea

466
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Yes that's 232

467
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,368
That's one thing I love running a penny that 3-wheel bright in certain countries

468
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,952
Around 40% of our business Nisha 14 Americas

469
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
What's something you up for

470
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
So we have

471
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
I mean we sent Market that. So we

472
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,400
I'm all that. We see everything happening in the world at the synapse

473
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
But don't say we have the direct contact and touch with all his crayons

474
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Everywhere and that's very exciting

475
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
For me to see those

476
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
The small differences in

477
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Defense Market

478
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
To see one

479
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,712
That can serve as a crystal ball at this for some categories

480
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
But what's going to happen in summer in

481
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
In some Industries

482
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
Addition to some of our clients

483
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
Use us Foamposites

484
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
What's coming

485
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,256
Price of smelt us when they want to see no grounds what's happening in China and

486
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Japan song

487
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,376
Definitely looking over the last two to three years

488
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Politics is very local

489
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
And this a strong push back

490
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
Against globalization

491
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,336
In parts of a side part of Europe and Asia

492
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
Here in the us as well

493
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,944
But the innovation in Port Orchard

494
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Acknowledge diffusion

495
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
It's definitely

496
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,576
Global to Global phenomenon

497
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
Ice in politics

498
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
I usually

499
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
Agrippina story

500
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
Hopefully if he doesn't go too fast

501
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
But it's

502
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
Let's not forget.

503
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Every single

504
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Is going company

505
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
Keep doing business

506
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
They sold his International

507
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Books-A-Million

508
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,456
I wanted to dig deeper into the reason why China just sleep brought into Mobile so

509
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Quickly

510
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,808
So if you like write a Beijing Subway today at everyone

511
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
Glued to their phones

512
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,440
Mobile payment Market in China was 11 times that of the US last

513
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Sphere

514
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,608
And a lot of Chinese companies these days don't even bother to make websites anymore they just have a nap and just a bear

515
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,448
Their website with a QR code and then maybe a WeChat official account but

516
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
People just

517
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
Or not on desktop.

518
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
So what do you think is a reason that

519
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
China Star

520
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Jumped into Mobile so quickly

521
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Even more than the US did

522
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
He not funny that's actually it was a question that I'm always asking why is he being so slow in the US to get

523
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
T-Mobile in Europe

524
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
I've been so

525
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:31,744
Push up because I just go back to he's so convenient to use this device but in your pocket

526
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
If we where you are

527
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:39,680
I seen that thing away from me China is what you chew Avenue

528
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
Videos of recent questioning and

529
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,568
I mean obviously the illogical reasons I mean

530
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Home Depot website

531
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
And laptop desktop presents

532
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
In the USA

533
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
Purple shampoo

534
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
China beetles

535
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
China of course your laptop's internet but

536
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
Opal Shimmer shoes

537
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
What puts you Smallville

538
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Malden

539
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Each other. We still had balls

540
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
600

541
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
700 million

542
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Dust up meaning that users

543
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
Yeah but it's not always your on your laptop on your desktop

544
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,936
It might be you or your office while maybe at home but mostly Ralph

545
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,496
The Sidewalk Cafe I sing for me

546
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,848

We're actually Chinese developer some TV shows that build apps that actually scare

776
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,320

00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
China is

00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648

792
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
What people miss

793
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Is the nuances

794
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,304
Not because China has a lot of competition

795
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
So you have to innovate faster

796
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
Because China has

797
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
4 different ears

798
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Cities

799
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
You deal with differin

800
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Quality of

00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
Networks and users

802
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,032
And tastes so ends up over time

803
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
The models

804
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Anapodoton built

805
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
Could be more relevant for a wedding

806
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Emerging Markets

807
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,760
Yeah and you're very trusting hansa competition sights

808
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:11,136
Competition is so intense that the surviving ones over again

809
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
Dell'otto popular apps in China started

810
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,768
On the ground with really low tier cities like

811
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:21,120
Glacier hotel and even QQ start in the internet cafes

812
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,752
I think that's one of our investment thesis here in the US as well so entrepreneurs need to

813
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Learn to make a mass-market product

814
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,848
And not just appeal to people in

815
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,688
So I also monitored the App Store

816
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,296
I'll have any of like Emerging Markets especially Middle East and Southeast Asia

817
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,136
We're starting to see more and more Chinese apps made by Chinese

818
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
Making those top ranks

819
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
Are you satisfied, you're singing why do you think

820
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,608
Optimistic are you about the ability of Chinese teens to make

821
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
Podesta appeal to other emerging

822
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,544
Yeah and maybe he'll I want to or so highlights when initiatives are Chinese government has

823
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
What's up

824
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
I seen that

825
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,248
I mean we tried actually to measure what was

826
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
How Chinese companies were following Sergeant was interesting.

827
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
To see that photo capture of Donald

828
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,304
Nike 45% in belt and Road countries to like 55 57% off.

829
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
Donald's outside China

830
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,376
Happening in despair Town Road

831
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Country

832
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,496
So I seem to see me some alignment between some level of government policy

833
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
What successful Chinese internet companies are doing

834
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,176
So that's probably why I no longer want you to catch that internationalization of

835
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Chinese companies

836
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
Following some of these trends

837
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
I'm doubling down in some ways and smoke

838
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
What is a false

839
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,256
I'm pretty positive because again of what we just discussed at Chinese companies have developed software that

840
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Richie Hawtin

841
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584

Tiana

844
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,680
And that's what you need in some of these small

845
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
If you see another one

846
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Have.

855
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512

And that's very exciting

1153
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,751
Because sometimes you see these huge crazy plans

1154
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
From government to invest

1155
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,127

Medical programs

1162
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,447
Where you can do an app with them when the WeChat ecosystem in

1163
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471

1164
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:18,079
10 years from now we'll still have screen after screen of apps on our phones

1165
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,639
Or do you think it will go towards more consolidation

1166
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
Amor supera

1167
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455

Talking about straps for like 5 years

1170
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,415
WeChat has been claiming that

1171
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,951
Facebook has been trying

1172
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,999
I think there is a limit to

1173
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
People Trust

1174
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,559

00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,359
Asobi on the US so

1179
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,407
It's not as if we charge King also apps

1180
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,735
As you know from your Investments and something very wet

1181

1184
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:11,583
But not I don't think pretty beyond that I need so so goes with only so much

1185
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
She can do research

1186
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119

00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
Facebook

1190
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
You don't have the full access to the

The phone you don't have to

1192
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
Some capacity

1193
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,151
You don't want to just depend on that you got up as and that Patricia

1194
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:29,503
Maybe text you get cheat on his own but once you get them you want to keep them

1195
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,903
Flirtations of ego defense would be more for smaller brand smaller apps that don't really want to invest I'm not ready

1196
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Tea companies

1197
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,559
And believe it's cheaper to just be purely in the WeChat enjoyment and I might make sense

1198
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
SMS

1199
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863

1202
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,799
It's more of a careful approach I guess on Morley Virginia CPAP suzhou

1203
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
You like what you see

1204
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
What advice do you have for non Chinese entrepreneurs who might want to start adventure in China I think a lot of

1205
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:06,623
Not Chinese people these days are interested in getting involved and ecosystem there but are pretty intimidated by

1206
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,463
Just the culture there the language and how different everything is

1207
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
Amy pisani that's what

1208
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,095
Cutting Justin Howard Ashanti twice I was excited

1209
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,495

Ubuntu

1211
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,823
I passionately love you stories

1212
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,871
So maybe that's why I was I was talking to

1213
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
Tmall China

1214
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,991
I think I don't think people should be so so scared at the same time

1215
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
It's not easy also so

1216
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,623
So I think the best for my Best Buy TVs for

1217
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:45,023
People cool at coffee house painting leaving one or two years in China

1218

Abortions in China

1221
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,703
Cuz once you leave there you learn to be there first

1222
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
I mean that's also something else

1223
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,895
Some people cannot take Heat

1224
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,199
You know

1225
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,015
But if she already liked it and lock it

1226
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:09,599
She connected and sings and you will stay for more and

1227
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:15,743
It's easier to probably take baby steps are leaving say I'm running a bit of the basics of flavor scene

1228
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,535
So that when you are ready to

1229
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,351
221 business or Commercial Business

1230
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,887
How to do something else

To stop stuff in China I have my network

1235
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967

00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Mystics

1237
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,295
It's so easy to make me sick

1238
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,951
So it's I think about you to do that

1239
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
And it in China Beijing Shanghai

1240
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791

Facing specially for expats is my BCT
