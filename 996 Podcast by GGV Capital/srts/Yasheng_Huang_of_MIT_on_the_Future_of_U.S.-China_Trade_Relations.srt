Of Chinese internet companies many which are moving faster that even their American counterparts

13
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Welcome everyone into this strange gdb 96th and Seneca podcast Library

14
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
According

15
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:23,968
I'm sorry. I'm joined by my 96 ho-hos Hans Tung managing partner igb capital

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,832
I'm by Kaiser cool host of a Seneca podcast and producer up in 96 podcast

17
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
Please join me in welcoming our special guest Professor irrational Quan

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096

And he's the founder and head of the China left and the angel at MIT

22
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,528
Such a pleasure talking to you for Seneca last year in San Francisco

23
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
Your straight talk in your practice is always quite the breath

24
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
A fresh air

25
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,952
So look like what's the deal with the elephant

26
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,280
In the room

27
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680
Trade War are we we've seen volleys in both directions now first the steel and aluminum tariff and in the face of dude

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Chinese response

29
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,032
Then he had the 60 billion dollars punitively over the 301

30
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Twgok

31
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Then China's announcements

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
And and now just on Thursday this week 8

33
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,992
Thread of an even larger Tariff of 100 billion

34
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Bite by Trump

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
Administration relief

36
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Is fixed as opposed

37
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,720
To one particular Target of all this time I mean it it's

38
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:44,864
China's new tech focused industrial policy that's called made in China 2025

39
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
America has

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Basically always opposed Industrial Park

41
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,824
Call Meechie and in Japan in the 1980s which is a target of American Iron

42
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
What is it that they object so much too in

43
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
Made in China 2025 end end is there

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
Is there actually something to objective is there as or something it's deliberately quite unfair

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
Okay thank you Kaiser and very good to share the podium with

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
Hanson Zara as well

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
Yeah this is a big elephant in the room

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
And I think

49
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
The

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
The possibility is a real one that things can get all of the country

51
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
Might you have an escalation of the conflict

52
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
And the more you ask if I ate

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
It's more difficult to

54
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Walk down

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Farm.

56
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
High position that you have made very clear and so is your specific

57
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,256
A question about what the US is its objective

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,328
Through this

59
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
The power of action

60
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
I guess there

61
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Three things and

62
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
Falling into categories why is

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Macroeconomics

64
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,152
Which has to do with the trade imbalances and their different calculations about

65
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,736
Exactly what is the what is the right number

66
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
Byron Lars there is a

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Decent consensus that us has a persistent

68
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Pray

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
The deficit with China maybe the

70
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Size is not as big as

71
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
They say

72
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
Complication

73
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
AR

74
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
Norman

75
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
How do you Account Processing trade

76
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,311
So that's one that's on them or macroeconomics side

77
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
On the more so the microeconomics

78
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
This has to do with the issue of IP

79
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,087
So Trump actually use that term which is IP theft

80
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,975
And you know what type of debate whether or not straight out of

81
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,559
Is the right remedy to deal with that

82
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,399
I don't think it's alright instrumental deal with even the macroeconomic issue but

83
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Formica

84
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Long instrument

85
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
And then there's the political officer of security

86
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Issue

87
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
Which has to do with

88
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
How a

89
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Incompetent established

90
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Power

91
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
Do you swear

92
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
A rising power

93
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
That has such a fundamentally different

94
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,023
Play deep all you can all make right social, institutions and violet was right

95
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,423
And that's unprecedented multi-dimensional

96
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,519
Western Union with kind of always knew their weakness

97
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
That's right the great ballet but what consumer products

98
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:47,391
There's nothing to be a trivia about

99
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Right there

100
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
Basketball

101
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
Imitation Russian accent

102
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
Severe severe

103
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
Biology and chemistry

104
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
The fundamental difference is WeChat

105
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
They didn't have that

106
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
That's true

107
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,159
Bye-bye neither of China at that time

108
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Appointment

109
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
But the fundamental difference is that

110
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Sylvia's never use their signs

111
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
But you can call me

112
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,399
And so there was a god

113
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Regina Hall

114
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
Advance the science was

115
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
Which was mostly geared toward

116
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,103
Defense

117
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,967
It was never really apply to Economic Development

118
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Tsume Yuki

119
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
Horrible

120
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
Where's the country I actually had you know

121
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,671
Established scientist

122
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,535
That's a great book by the way written by a historian

123
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
The title of it is a lonely ideas

124
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
The book is about

125
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
How old is Sylvia

126
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
Invested heavily in signs

127
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
Antec maybe technology heavily in science

128
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
But never came

129
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,967
Benefit from this is a huge difference between

130
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
So I think the

131
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
Fear on the part of the United State let this sort of separate two issues why is whether we should fear

132
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Interview

133
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
The other is

134
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
Whether or not

135
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,047
Superficially there is a subjective reason

136
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
For a average

137
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Person in the United States

138
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
To say wow look at that country that has a

139
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Is sort of a normal a communist

140
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Assistant

141
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
One-party system in all of that

142
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
Plus signs Plus technology plus hands

143
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,575
Right song

144
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
You know

145
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Boston Silicon Valley

146
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
You need three things

147
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Scientist

148
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,471
Scientists technologists

149
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Entrepreneurs

150
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
And

151
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Reitzel

152
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,431
No we can debate about the quality and the quantity is impressive

153
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
China now

154
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
In terms of

155
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:26,879
You probably have more data than than I do quantity has a quality all its own

156
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,927
So so

157
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Size Matters

158
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,047
Right so so

159
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
Well I mean sometimes you do have but the thing is

160
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
Let me put it this way if

161
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
You don't have a big

162
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,799
Signs of establishment vegvisir established

163
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
The probability of having Stellar signs

164
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
InStyler investment exactly the law

165
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,575
You kind of need a size because precisely the probability is low you need a size

166
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
To make the actual number

167
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
And this is really in terms of

168
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
Country to Country comparison

169
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
It is the absolute number that matter

170
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
It's not so much the ratio to Chinese

171
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
You know

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Success raised in

173
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
If you can use the

174
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
The success of x's and maybe

175
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
That can be low in China

176
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
But as long as the numbers large

177
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Who the other country

178
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
That's significant

179
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,503
So sometimes we would need to establish our benchmarks more clearly

180
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,831
So you think that this is what's bruising anxiety around industrial policy

181
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
In terms of industrial policy

182
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
It is true that

183
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
If you look at

184
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
Silicon Valley Boston

185
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
There was

186
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,327
Lesson 4 / industrial policy

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
Explaining the development of

188
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Silicon Valley and

189
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Band Boston

190
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
128

191
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
But let's face it right so

192
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Amenity

193
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Benefited tremendously

194
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
It's not

195
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
Bissell a design to

196
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:06,463
Increase the price of plus this is where the mercantilism comes in

197
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
And the mercantilism is an idea that

198
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
First you use the government

199
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
Directly explicitly to Advance economic goals

200
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
A second that you focus on train

201
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
China has the flavor of

202
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Both

203
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
And that worries

204
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
People here

205
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
This is for me it's surprisingly

206
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Bishop people

207
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
In the US, talking about

208
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Chinese government's role

209
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Something Auto Suisse

210
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Funding of those

211
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
Put all his money

212
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
To work as of that made a huge difference

213
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
If I look at that the actual facts

214
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
Of how to send out of a leprechaun

215
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
Amazon most valuable company in the world

216
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
We have very little egg

217
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,191
This much government

218
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Is it

219
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Can do well

220
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
If a government doesn't bother that

221
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,527
Internet companies were founded by people who are either Americanized or actually had been in the United

222
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,391
Long time like Barbara leave for absolutely and you know with American men

223
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
Capital listing on American

224
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,535
Emotional for making money from tencent and Baidu and

225
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
How to apply skins for Americans in people

226
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
Preaching to the choir

227
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,567
Yeah I do want to ask you about Trump says 500 billion

228
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,687
I think that the real number you know the nominal numbers 350 maybe but then

229
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
I think

230
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Focus on me

231
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
That number is

232
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
Is it

233
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
What is 500 / 300

234
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
The reason is that

235
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
Fundamentally the trade imbalances

236
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,839
With China are driven by the difference in savings

237
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
Exactly

238
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,007
If you would throw incurve 500 billion or 300 million dollars of

239
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Trade imbalances

240
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
The China

241
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Then you'll have to do that with somebody else if you want to borrow that money if you want to see if you want people to show up in your Treasury

242
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
You you consume a lot right relative to your savings rate

243
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,879
That means by definition that you have to

244
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
Sort of borrow and then

245
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Deficit

246
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
Difference between the capital account which is

247
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Importing them on a phone the rest of the world

248
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
And the trade account which

249
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Is the deficit

250
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
China has exactly the

251
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
If China does not have a huge

252
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:33,151
Everything else being equal I'd is current level if China doesn't have this huge tray

253
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
United States

254
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Then

255
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
The savings investment and consumption ratios are stars

256
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
That it has to have

257
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
A train stops

258
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Which is

259
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
The description is really about

260
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
Why you need to have such a

261
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,031
Big surprise a surplus in the first month

262
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
Vadadent whether or not this is the right way to

263
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
To do with it

264
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
So that is from the house of the weather

265
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,807
The consumption Valor contemporary issues and maybe you're investing too much

266
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,207
Maybe you're not consuming enough

267
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
The Texans running back

268
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
We're actually actually fun companies

269
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
The r

270
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Riding the consumption upgrading China

271
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
I want to see

272
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
Customer comes to Mark not just locally

273
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,591
So it's so it's so that's a that's a

274
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Both analytical

275
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Write discussion to have

276
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
As well as a economically meaningful

277
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Relatives in China

278
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
I I wish that they could consume more

279
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,255
So that is what is constraining their consumption

280
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
And why their savings rate

281
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Is so high

282
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
And that's a

283
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,215
Atacama social safety net

284
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
But that's a discussion.

285
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
That's a

286
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
About domestic

287
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
Policy issues rather than about cross-border politician

288
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,247
Country the country that typically don't have those

289
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
Even though I mean it I think it's interesting to note that

290
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
If you are going to slap a bunch of times

291
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
Is it really going to hurt China so much words

292
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,535
Just an accelerator the rebalance Hyatt my own view is that it is hurting China more than it is

293
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Resorts in the US

294
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Write this is strictly

295
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
And you can all midterm

296
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
So if you think about

297
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
What the US is

298
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
What kind of

299
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Products that are important

300
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
These are from Chinese

301
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Industries

302
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
That are competing with us

303
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
That so essentially

304
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
China sort of

305
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,855
Economics distinguish between absolute advantage and comparative

306
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,695
China has a comparative advantage

307
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,023
Light Industry labor intensive industry

308
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
But it is producing these

309
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
You know

310
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,703
AI companies drone company that DJI and

311
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
Leather caning in terms of absolute advantages vis-a-vis the US

312
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Cell companies

313
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
So the US is targeting those guy

314
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
And those are competing with the US companies

315
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
Where's the Chinese

316
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Imports one that you are

317
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
Are basically complimentary

318
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
Weather

319
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Chinese

320
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Society in Chinese

321
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Now we're talkin about

322
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,351
Soil

323
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Into

324
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
That's hopeful I guess that's

325
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
Is that one of the application that maybe other applicants

326
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
Essentially sorbian is the Upstream product

327
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
Inside of air handler

328
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
So that's one so it is it is it is it is complementary and the other

329
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
Effect on China is

330
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Agriculture is a part of the

331
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
The core inflation

332
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
So

333
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
China

334
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Henna

335
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Afford to have

336
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
You know inflation right right

337
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
So it really does hurt us have more of an impact on the Chinese macroeconomic situation

338
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,903
Then it does on the United States

339
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
China

340
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Depends on the US

341
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
In terms of the

342
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Much more than the other way around

343
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
So if you're just

344
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
No us is losing 150 billion dollars

345
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,823
China is losing you know whatever y500 write something like that

346
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,919
So it does have a bigger effect on China than it does

347
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Yeah I'm such a

348
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,807
Play I think

349
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
Lot of times trade war is about Paula

350
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
So basically who is going to bring

351
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,303
So there I don't really have a very good way of reading the situation

352
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
So they sent that I have to

353
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,447
Say something about it I will say the following which is

354
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
With everything

355
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
Democratic societies are more vulnerable

356
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
2

357
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Politico

358
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Because

359
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
Businesses people

360
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Speak up

361
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
People who are losing fur trade Wars

362
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,599
You know authoritarian Society you don't you don't have that

363
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
So typically we say that a democratic

364
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
Country a has a lower tolerance

365
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Spore

366
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,607
So there's actually research that shows that democracies don't go to war with

367
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
In part because they have a low tolerance

368
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
We just got the witch witches

369
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
One of the reasons is

370
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
It support

371
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,199
Where's your sense of your sense of that even if you have pain you don't express it

372
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
In this particular situation.

373
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,319
I'm not so sure this manifest

374
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,463
It's there when you go to the grocery store when you go to the end consumer products

375
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
At least for now

376
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559

If you walk down from 50 billion

440
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,895
No even as I'm at the professor I know something about math

441
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,991
You go down to 25

442
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,831
Now it's 100

443
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,672
UE Central a frame that sits by the higher level

444
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
Once you friend that is Carson dellosa

445
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,816
This is something that I have no taste in China

446
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Xian Chinese

447
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
The young Chinese in China

448
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,728
More nausea

449
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
Then when I was

450
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
Young Chinese

451
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
We're all naturalistic back during the founding of that

452
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
Shortcoming of a system back then

453
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,864
Assistant with her bad thing

454
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
The current generation you know they play games that they don't really know what the heck

455
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,848
I think they have this

456
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Certified

457
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
Longview about what city

458

00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Seoul

460
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,040
It's not the size of the GDP is

461
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
May 2nd

462
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
In the world

463
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
What per capita GDP

464
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
AP

465
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Is right in the middle

466
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,304
Of 198 countries in the world

467
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Middle East

468
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
Canova country

469
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
India is per capita GDP

470
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
It's not the aggregate you did not know right so

471
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
And just speaking from personal experience I think

472
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Chinese rest of my generation

473
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
Come to you as to study

474
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Ashley want to go back

475
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
He stays piercings actually work in China they want to

476
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Contribute

477
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
All they wanna

478
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Make a lot of money there

479
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:55,232
More up to it he's there it's hard to get a US Visa now so they're not so

480
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,560
Words that are pulling them back home and I think part of the reason

481
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
4

482
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,448
That the reason why Chinese tech companies can't grow so fast is because they can attract all these

483
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
What's redis

484
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,872
I think that's a very good thing and and I

485
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
Celebrate

486
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
Shenyang people

487
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
Aspirations in

488
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
I just I just

489
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Want to say that

490
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
Sometimes we need to be

491
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
More cool headed about being cautious

492
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah I bought these macro issues right so I think don't translate the macroeconomic

493
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Amazon

494
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:37,984
So blindly into macroeconomics

495
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,848
China still has lot of children in the countryside

496
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Nothing is

497
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
Behind children

498
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
The country

499
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:52,832
What time is it

500
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
So I just think that

501
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
And I would

502
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Argue with that

503
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
If the young technologist

504
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
From China

505
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
Think about making money that's great

506
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
But what's to think about how to use technology

507
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
To solve these social problems

508
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
That would be awesome

509
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,544
I want to ask you a couple questions I I mean first I want to ask you about Americans likely react

510
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Add about Chinese people react

511
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,664
Directions to the burgeoning trade War

512
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,016
United States in the United States or China is obviously targeted

513
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,320
Not just red States not just

514
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,416
Bullying is not in a red state

515
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Craigslist

516
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
Alcorn gensley beans and end

517
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
And pork

518
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
These dotart

519
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
She should have been treated

520
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Ashley Pro Trump

521
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
Is it smart

522
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
Strategy let me know where is this going to fart

523
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Is it possible I

524
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,568
Is it going to look like God playing near meddling in American polity

525
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
How are Americans likely to respond to

526
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Meme

527
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
China

528
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
You picked a

529
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
I'll give you two blocks

530
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
I think so.

531
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
The one issue is what is the alternative

532
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Right so

533
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
I think this is us a smart

534
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Strategy

535
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
As you can play

536
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Idris Elba

537
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
Under the Sycamore

538
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
Does and

539
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
But I

540
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
I have a feeling that I may be wrong

541
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Open do you know

542
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
I have a feeling that it may not

543
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
Trump is not a conventional politic

544
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
His supporters

545
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,528
They may be some here but I don't know about his supporters are already up.

546
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
Sometimes are not

547
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,368
Super clear about their true economic interest

548
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
And you know

549
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Many of their supporters what

550
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
Have a lotto game from Obamacare

551
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
He's the one

552
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Promise to demolish

553
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Obamacare

554
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,936
Are you, calculations may not work this time

555
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
I was going to finish my

556
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Earlier

557
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Example about

558
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
The political capacity to a beer

559
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
I actually think Tom

560
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Has a quite a bit of

561
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
Evidently he look at his

562
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,720
Will the Mueller investigation

563
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:12,096
What's wrong with offending 1.4 billion people right away

564
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,424
And and also if you look at his approval

565
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Rating

566
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
Is a Pool of Radiance

567
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
Right in the middle of the tree

568
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
Console

569
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,944
And the business Community is more split than before

570
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,248
And there is more of a

571
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,320
Bipartisan bipartisan consensus

572
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
About

573
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,928
This particular

574
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Issue

575
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Then there was before

576
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Even the Democrats

577
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
Support some of the

578
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,192
Paris for a cocktail tonight and we have to decide between a Moscow Mule

579
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
Or a Dark and Stormy Daniels maybe a white Rush

580
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,992
Russian interference

581
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,904
Edinburg solid objects my little brother from Facebook

582
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
The ordinary people in China

583
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
Are they

584
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
Rally around the flagon

585
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Vicodin

586
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
What's a hashtag that I keep saying no

587
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
What was just out of

588
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
What is it

589
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
We didn't we didn't grow Chinese

590
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
So

591
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
It's a you know

592
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
More

593
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,104
When do you know to give us more

594
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
Yeah bring it on Reno

595
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
Bring it

596
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,272
Like that

597
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Again that's Kaiser

598
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
I think

599
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,072
My only again

600
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
I'm a professor

601
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
I can say these things

602
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Which is that

603
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
I think the

604
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
Biggest fear is the lack of

605
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
And

606
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
I think China

607
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
So if you look at Chinese you can all make

608
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Growlithe

609
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,296
Right if you look at a Chinese macroeconomic picture

610
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,392
We're talkin about a Yukon the maid that is through heavily

611
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,696
Dependent on investment driven

612
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,632
Consumption household consumption GDP ratio is about 40 39%

613
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,728
Which is actually very loyal compared with major UConn amazing the world

614
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
USMC

615
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
So so

616
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,384
So to have more sustainable growth

617
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,712
You need to decrease investment

618
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
You need to increase the consumption

619
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,344
And you need to have a healthy

620
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Export

00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648

If you

Cartel

625
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Export now

626
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
To keep

627
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
The growth rate as it is in a 6.5 diesel

628
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
7

629
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
The only

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,336
Nothing available to the policymakers is to increasing vitamin

631
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
More Fai

632
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,688
And then that means more Bank

633
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,552
How long will it take that I have driven growth

634
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Moore printing over the money

And the X

638
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
We need both of them

639
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Right at home

640
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
I would you know

641
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
Again

642
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
Professor I will just swallow the

643
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
Bitterness whatever I was just

644
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
You say Okay so let's just have a

645
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,432
Have a compromise and rather than sort of playing on this a psychological nationalist

646
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Sentiment

647
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,016
I think that's very very dangerous

648
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
Nationalism

649
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Has never

650
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,416
Been a friend for you Konami

651
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
From where we said

652
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Kind of kind of

653
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
I see that

654
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Changing

655
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Opposition

656
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Cuz he always do stuff

657
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Don't expect

658
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
There's a possibility that he was ejected

659
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
You look at China

660
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
Pékin change somewhat

661
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
But not too much

662
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Okay

663
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
What's most likely happen

664
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
AR View

665
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Mike personal

666
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,784
Is that things are getting nastier

667
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
For a while

668
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
And see which talking

669
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Pick up more

670
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
And make a test

671
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,208
Accordingly and nuts the mixer hosting a lot

672
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
Whiskey

673
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
Than ever before

674
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,816
But we could see this

675
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Pronoun for I

676
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:34,240
What do you think this whole episode will go down in history as a hiccup in the

677
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
More

678
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:40,128
Then a bigger trend of globalization or do you think globalization is actually stoppable by

679
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Individual leader

680
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
Globalization has been stopped

681
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Buy individual leader

682
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,088
Firefighter Brown policy choices

683
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,744
If you look at lines about the smoot-hawley Tariff smooth and if you look at the suit of the cross

684
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Border investment

685
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,072
As a share worldwide GDP

686
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
The world reach

687
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
APK

688
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
Just before.

689
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
The first World War

690
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,568
Write a note for the next 50 years and 6 years I went down the hill

691
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,200
So so you know maybe with hands around the things will be different.

692
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,856
But I'm not a lion if you make

693
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
Policy decisions

694
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
You can really go down when I pass

695
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
That you regret

696
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Later so

697
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,888
Interview question whether or not this is a short-term hiccup or not

698
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
I actually don't think this is

699
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
And I think

700
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
Sometimes we distinguish

701
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,104
15 structural

702
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
Component and cyclical component

703
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
In the past

704
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,064
The US China relationship has been governed by

705
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Cyclical up and down

706
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,000
For the structure it was moving in the positive

707
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:06,400
Did you know that

708
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,680
It's moving in the right direction

709
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
I'm not so sure

710
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:14,592
Precisely because I see more evidence of

711
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,408
Bipartisan consensus

712
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Getting

713
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
Harsher on China

714
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,088
Trump obviously but also business community.

715
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Right

716
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,976
And from the Chinese side more nationalism

717
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Strong leadership

718
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
But you know

719
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,072
Country also

720
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
In my own vehicle

721
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424

Larry Market open market liberalization

725
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
If you look at FBI as a as a measure of some sort of a civilization that has been 3

726
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
So

727
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,488
The more worrisome is the component of the total FDI inflow

728
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,120
In the early 1990s to the mid-1990s march of the Chinese

729
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
IPI

730
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
Was Amanda coming from Hong Kong

731
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,360
Like that and then it went down because

732
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,248
Euro

733
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
Now we're coming back

734
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
Put the situation in the early 1990s

735
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:33,696
The Hong Kong Investments are outpacing Japanese Investments

736
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Us investment

737
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
And your opinion

738
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,096
I have nothing against the Hong Kong investment

739
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,912
But I would argue with that the US investment

740
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,496
European vitamins Japanese Investments brains vagina

741
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Technology

742
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
Management

743
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
Anyway I don't think Hong Kong about

744
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
Right there more indicative of

745
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,528
Brought a global integration for China is

746
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
We all hoped China would

747
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
Do more than ever before

748
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
It helps to have a c

749
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
Superworld when it's more balanced

750
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,256
But what the science we do see

751
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,864
Is that instead of being milked to to be to be more militaristic and be more antagonistic

752
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,448
Versus economic Forum disaster route which is

753
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
I want Beltline Road Coppell

754
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,288
Depending on us for export

755
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,360
When we sell more of our services model and goods

756
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,992
To Southeast Asia to India to Central Asia to Eastern Europe to Africa

757
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Latin america

758
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,856
I think over the next 10-20 Years you'll see a lot more push

759
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,184
Buy Chinese government aligning with a Chinese internet company

760
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
To export and

761

Introduce other developing

That's why the chance of more tennis company coming to

Us

764
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
It's less

765
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
Good morning Chinese in a company going out

767
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,128
How's this is felt very cynical let's let's move this more than I-96 territory and talk more about

768
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Tech investor

769
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
The time to shift it into that

770
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
Supposed to do that

771
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
Can you spend a lot of time studying

772
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Chinese

773
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
And you start with looking at soe early

774
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,720
And then Starship into

775
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
The private Enterprise

776
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
And then even with the channel app look at the

777
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
As UC ship

778
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,632
From soest

779
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Department of ice

780
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Internet companies

781
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Do you see the

782
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Quality management team

783
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Piazza

784
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
Does the kishin of a

785
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Apus systems

786
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
Anthea

787
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Growth

788
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Change party

789
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,664
Is it commensurate with the

790
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
The change in

791
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
So so so this is an excellent

792
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Equestrian

793
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,088
So I found it in China la banda Lobby

794
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
2008

795
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
And since then.

796
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
It has been

797
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
I 10 years we have worked

798
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
About 300

799
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Chinese companies now

800
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
About 70 Indian companies

801
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
So

802
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
As an academic

803
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,008
It's actually extremely hard to study management because we don't have faith

804
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
The work I did in China

805
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
I did

806
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Texas Lotto

807
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
Chinese entrepreneur company

808
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
The shift

809
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Toms River

810
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
10 years ago

811
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
If you look at the type of projects we are doing invisible he's the type of projects we were doing 10 years ago

812
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,840
10 years ago most of the projects we were doing

813
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
War about

814
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Marketing

815
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
Marketing overseas

816
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,008
I have a product I want to sell to Japan I want to sell it

817
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Do you ask

818
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
You will have a team please help us

819
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,920
No come up with a marketing plan and

820
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
How to tell over

821
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Increasingly

822
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
The projects

823
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
Are about

824
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
Management in Covina

825
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
Human resource

826
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Management

827
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Financial reporting controls

828
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Devising kpi

829
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Things like that

830
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,656
There is a dramatic shift

831
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,240
From the external orientation of these company

832
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,336
Two internal capacity-building

833
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
On the part of the companies we work with

834
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
I think

835
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,528
You know this is not a systemic peace update

836
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,368
To tell me that the Chinese entrepreneurial companies now

837
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,928
Put more volume or premium

838
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
Management

839
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Right so

840
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,304
Also before if you look at Chinese private sector companies

841
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
That is simple structure

842
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:28,704
1 boss everybody was a management

843
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
I would say 20 years ago

844
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,664
It was irrational

845
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
AT-AT walker

846
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:45,344
They don't want to be a worker

847
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,232
And I can't be the boss

848
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,560
So what the boss is doing everything by himself or herself

849
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Now you have

850
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
A

851
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
More sophisticated

852
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Managerial

853
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
System

854
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
You have top management middle management

855
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
Applying management

856
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
And I think this is

857
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
Really reflecting

858
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
The dynamism

859
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
And and

860
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
Ryzen quality

861
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Chinese privacy

862
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
The part of it is

863
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
I think part of it is

864
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
When the economy is

865
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
More competitive

866
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,072
Right you can't just rely on

867
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Connections

868
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,912
Government connection

869
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
You cannot just rely on that

870
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,008
You have to rely on management know-how

871
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
What was the technology

872
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
Right technology is playing more and more important role

873
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,968
In art an alarm projects in the last 3 three years I would say

874
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
The ratio of the planets share of the technology project

875
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
70%

876
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Not surprised

877
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Interrelated

878
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,464
Internet-related

879
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Art

880
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
I have a piece of

881
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Technology

882
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
So I think definitely

883
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
At that level

884
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:11,616
Chinese economy is I-10

885
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
GDP

886
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
And all of that

887
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
I actually think that

888
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
These microeconomic indicate

889
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
Are a more reliable indicator

890
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Healthier

891
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
A hole

892
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
Chinese economy is getting high

893
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,096
That's what you smell outside looking in India and of course you run the NBA live as well I'm really curious about you

894
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
Either disorder

895
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Qualitative or

896
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
From head work without the China lab media lab

897
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:43,616
Absolut Vodka shipping some compared

898
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Now.

899
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,968
Engineering Style

900
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Dial TV

901
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Yucca root

902
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:54,112
Yaso India

903
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
IPad

904
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,768
5 years ago 10 years ago

905
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,584
I went China live in India. Began

906
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,656
Mostly with high Indian students doing Indian

907
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
Chinese students are in China

908
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Now it's just the office

909
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
The tiniest in Islam

910
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
The Indians

911
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,992
They they they are more curious about each other

912
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
And

913
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
And by the way I got interested in India

914
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
A long time ago

915
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
That was criticized

916
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Well being

917
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,024
Optimistic about India

918
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
But I think that you know

919
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
India has

920
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,496
Breathing the huge constraints it is facing has

921
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
Dunwell

922
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
Well right song

923
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,128
It is now able to grow 7%.

924
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:56,320
There's a term called that Hindu right of the growth

925
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,648
Conferences if you say all this country is growing at the rate of growth

926
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
It doesn't have to be about India I can be about

927
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Country

928
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,024
If your on everything else that had all k

929
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,608
1%

00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,704
7% we're talkin about eustachian growth

931
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Meso

932
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,800
Weather savings right about half of the Chinese savings rate

933
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,080
Whether you guys smell right

934
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
How about Chinese in Bessemer

935
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,968
80% of the Chinese

936
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:30,112
I take responsibility for this I did ask him to be Politically Incorrect and then he

937
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,768
You obliged versus the Hindu

938
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,888
Call Kaiser

939
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,936
Small investor

Into Indian

941
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984

Leading Tech

946
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
There's just been a lot

947
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
I'm coming to town

948
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
I am meeting with Chinese

949
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
He's meeting with Chinese

950
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,927
Actively want to learn

951
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
In knowledge

952
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
What has happened in China

953
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
Italy filled a lot of

954
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,839
Big umbrella from problems are there trying to solve in India

955
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Somebody in China

956
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
I saw the symbol of

957
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,983
And now the local adaptation will be very different for sure

958
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
Badolato principles

959
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
Jackson storm

960
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,311
I should be quite body

961
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
Remind me how the

962
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Chinese New

963
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:30,015
Come to Silicon Valley and ride right right of your your portfolio companies

964
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Alibaba

965
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,695
Alibaba

966
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
But are they looking at it

967
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Learn manager

968
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Just got to be some reason why

969
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
So many more Indians

970
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,983
Okay I think the end of the Chinese company are looking India as a

971
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
The market Express

972
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,823
I think that's mean that they are more Indian exactly

973
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
Silicon Valley

974
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,407
Not make me never change

975
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
At least not for now for a while

976
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,039
But what they sing what is partially because

977
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
Mosto

978
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,623
A successful a lot of success

979
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
A lot of successful

980
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Promising Chinese

981
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Engineers or apartments

982
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
End up going back to China

983
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,047
It's something you're stuck

984
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,607
And they're done for the Indian executives

985
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
Being here has been a payoff

986
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Upington

987
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
But as India Pro

988
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
You could change and what's interesting about India's

989
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,591
More more Americans actors who have done well in

990
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Us in psychology

991
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Are more willing

992
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
To invest heavily

993
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Into India

994
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
Amazon

995
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,807
Is investing in India in a way that it never went there too

996
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:42,207
To try and waste, waste money and be irrational for China they look at the market cap of jd.com

997
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
80 90 billion

998
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
That's what

999
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
Amazon PO box

1000
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Are not being

1001
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,631
So we see a lot more competition Indiana

1002
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,655
Between American companies

1003
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,703
Indian local sawdust in Chinese

1004
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:59,359
Beyond India do you think the other emerging markets around the world will look more like China or more like

1005
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
The USS

1006
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
They develop and how optimistic are you about

1007
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
Did we have Chinese companies

1008
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,271
Ways to expand into those markets

1009
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:10,367
Southeast Asia Eastern Europe and Asia Middle East

1010
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
North Africa

1011
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Not as a

1012
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Shut the fertile hands

1013
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
I think I think

1014
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,751
They the Chinese companies

1015
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
10 to

1016
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,639
I know a little bit more about Chinese companies in the US than I do about

1017
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,431
Chinese companies in Indonesia

1018
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,295
So the Chinese companies unlike Japanese companies

1019
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,855
Which came to the US in the 1980s

1020
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
The Chinese companies

1021
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,951
Kanto has a

1022
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,999
Separate operation

1023
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Indian Idol

1024
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,119
As compared with their home operations in

1025
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,935
The management team is separate

1026
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
The typically have a American

1027
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
The head of the US operation like

1028
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Son, Daisy

1029
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
I'm not like that but

1030
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
Pineapple

1031
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
And they don't quite impose

1032
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,271
Chinese managerial method

1033
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,575
On their us operation

1034
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,391
Where is if you compare that with Japan

1035
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
North Korea

1036
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Taqueria right

1037
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:22,303
Is Japan lean manufacturing zero inventory and

1038
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,351
They imposed even the

1039
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
Hugo Minnesota

1040
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,519
Ramona Flowers

1041
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,871
Emagine Ohio

1042
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:45,087
The Honda open expanding Ohio

1043
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
In 1987

1044
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
Imagine in Ohio 1987

1045
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,511
Where the Americans there

1046
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,143
Bowling in 02 the boss

1047
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
Factory

1048
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,983
Chinese companies don't do that so

1049
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,383
Enter that 996 nonsense

1050
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:15,807
Angela's 99 6 days a week

1051
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
So I think

1052
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
They're the Chinese

1053
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
Managerial

1054
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
Poage

1055
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,743
Is quite different right so

1056
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
It is

1057
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
You know I

1058
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,143
What time they serve on the board of attorneys Investment Company

1059
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Much less

1060
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
The company alone

1061
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,751
Rather than exercising active

1062
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
Managerial voice

1063
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,895
We can debate whether that's the right thing to do about but that's what I say

1064
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,967
Right so maybe when I go to Indonesia

1065
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
Be more handsome

1066
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,879
But I do know that Alibaba is investing in India paytm

1067
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,719
Patreon and

1068
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,535
Wikipedia

1069
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,863
I don't really know how

1070
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
Interventionist

1071
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:07,263
Alibaba is

1072
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
Willis auto

1073
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
Inquire

1074
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
The both are happening

1075
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,431
How how do you think the relationship

1076
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Swaintech and governor

1077
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Different

1078
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
Between us in

1079
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
I kind of feel like in the US

1080
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,111
Washington DC is often at loggerheads with Silicon Valley

1081
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,415
Whereas in China the interests of

1082
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,719
Tak and the Garmin seems to be more aligned

1083
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
To agree with

1084
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,095
Well I think in the US

1085
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,423
Weather Logan Heights is the right word to use II

1086
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,983
I don't know but there is a

1087
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
A distance

1088
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
Between

1089
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
Pride

1090
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
In the fact that it is not

1091
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
Located on East

1092
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,503
But now they

1093
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,087
Are no more realistic now they have

1094
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,183
Washington the Air Buddies office in New York

1095
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:03,583
Because because because the government is going to regulate what happens at Facebook and

1096
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,423
And so if you don't work with the government the government will come to you

1097
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
And so I think

1098
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,287
Even the tech sector in the US has to be realistic about

1099
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
The role of the government the government

1100
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Is not going to go

1101
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:20,735
I think you know whether that's good or bad that's a separate discussion the government is not going to go

1102
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,855
It could be even more active right it's always talk about

1103
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
The current

1104
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Wave of

1105
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
A technology

1106
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
Producing

1107
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Potentially producing

1108
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
Shoes winners

1109
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
Adopt would be widened

1110
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,495
The governor has two player

1111
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,287
In China

1112
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
I think

1113
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:51,967
Know if you look at Alibaba maybe this is the old story now about Alibaba tencent Baidu

1114
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,063
It is absolutely true as hands pointed out when they first developed

1115
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
They didn't really have any meaningful

1116
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,671
Relationship would I have

1117
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:04,255
So there is a lava was backed by SoftBank

1118
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,375
Tencent was backed by a.

1119
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
I'm about to South Africa

1120
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,703
Yeah

1121
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,871
Sotalol

1122
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,199
The question is now they're getting so big

1123
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Now they're getting so big

1124
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:30,111
You know Alibaba nanjing finance and all these areas

1125
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,183
Whether or not the government is going to get more

1126
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:39,583
Right there is evidence that the government is getting more interesting

1127
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
Then how do you structure that relationship

1128
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,679
Is going to be

1129
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,519
Definitely don't want to get involved

1130
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
So far to kill them

1131
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Hainan

1132
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
They are doing so many things

1133
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
The government has to

1134
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Certification

1135
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,039
So that's one kind of involvement the other kind of involvement that I see

1136
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Moral

1137
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
China then I do

1138
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
In the United States

1139
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Is is

1140
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,207
Government loan venture capital

1141
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:06,975

1143

1146
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
You don't see that

1147
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Indian

1148
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
You have in a one CIA

1149
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
CIA

1150
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,823
Oh okay

1151
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,895
Seoul

1152
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431

1153
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Happening

1154
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:33,087
The US Department of energy has Loan program

1155
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,415
Different from equity

1156
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
Investment

1157
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Weixin China

1158
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:44,351
Shenzhen Capital right

1159
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
And and

1160
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,959
I actually think

1161
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
If you look at that Moto

1162
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,335
That model is closer to the Eastfield Mall

1163
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
Then to the US mother

1164
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,687
Israel

1165
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
In the 1970s

1166
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
This Is How They

1167
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
Invested in the early start

1168
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
JumpStart

1169
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
Jump starter pack industry in Israel

1170
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,535
Government as an investor for the key differences

1171
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,839
Maybe the difference is not as big

1172
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
But the commute

1173
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,703
The difference is that in the case of Israel

1174
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,007
The government was a more of a

1175
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Passive

1176
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Investor

1177
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,615
Has relied on the judgment

1178
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
All of the

1179
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,407
Of the

1180
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:33,759
Took a backseat

1181
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
Where's in China maybe the government is more active I'm not sure

1182
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,719
But also to be if I look at

1183
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
The playing field

1184
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,047
Apostle top 50 beaches in China

1185
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
I would say probably 30 of

1186
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,375
Are us back

1187
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,983
Back by USA limited partnership with the LPS us USMLE

1188
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,799
Probably 20 the ratio probably 20 of

1189
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,847
RMB funds are doing well

1190
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,151
I'm almost twenty I was a lesson

1191
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
Less than

1192
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,223
Some kind of government

1193
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,783
I said okay but I also think

1194
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,879
It is not the wrong thing

1195
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
To do for the government

1196
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
Go back meme

Adidas iPhone

1199
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
That the reason is that

1200
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,143
So it so

1201
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
We talked about

1202
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
Eternal 20

1203
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703

No

1208
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:38,271
Energy these are huge

1209
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,855
I actually wish to see more of that in the US

1210
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,183
Exactly in the US right so what you see is

1211
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,231
Law of investments in

1212
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,047
Internet related things maybe an AI now

1213
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
Unlike signs

1214
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,143
Anything in between actually doesn't attract

1215
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:59,263
Auto V it takes to get money from

1216
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Government official

1217
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
Using

1218
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,359
Is a different skill set

1219
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
From designing

1220
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
Best product

1221
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
Designing

1222
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711

1224
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Designing

1225
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,343
So

1226
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
I want I want to see

1227
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
Government

1228
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Invest in

1229
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
In my heart heart

1230
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
I still like to see

1231
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Or insurance

1232
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,839
Pincher bug

1233
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
What university

1234
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
Play more

1235
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,423
I could broken the way.

1236
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
Yu-Gi-Oh

1237
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,263
So I actually think

1238
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
I agree with

1239
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Everything.

1240
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
DJI drones

1241
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
The US from

1242
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,527
I didn't go to us don't lose out

1243
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Is not that there was no Capital funding

1244
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,855
Putting them to fight against

1245
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Did you like the TV

1246
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,951
In China I think what

1247
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,743
Difference

1248
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Us

1249
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
Is locking that manufacture

1250
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,959
The sectors are manufactured spending

1251
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
To to do better

1252
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
So I actually think this is

1253
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,079
One of the huge advantages

1254
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
China House

1255
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,943
Exactly Nicole location between technology and manufacture

1256
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,551
So if you look at alarm Boston where do you see Manufacturing

1257
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,343
Actually if you look around Silicon Valley

1258
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,879
You don't seem a lot of that

1259
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
It is

1260
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:26,303
La Covenant Factory is okay for particular kind of Technology

1261
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,095
Maybe lifesigns I'm not sure what right but

1262
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
But yeah

1263
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:35,007
Energy Capital Equipment and

1264
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
You really need

1265
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,127
Both large-scale Manufacturing

1266
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,015
Biggest biotech I mean it's true that mean

1267
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:52,927
Social search engine there's no reason why

1268
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
MLB

1269
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,255
A manufacturing version of

1270
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
Call Silicon Valley

1271
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
So

1272
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,631
There's a book by actually MIT graduate

1273
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,655
Bunny Farm

1274
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423

Innovations in Shenzhen

1277
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,127
Has a famous Hardware hacker really real

1278
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,663
Sendai

1279
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,527
We tend to think about and I was just copying

1280
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,343
What he says is that it's much more than

1281
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,439
Is incremental innovation incremental Innovations

1282
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,511
On top of it basic model and they make it

1283
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,791
Thousand times better

1284
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,863
That margin of improvement

1285
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
Is all that because of

1286
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,191
Miss incredible

1287
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,495
I'm having a lot of Technology

1288
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
Involved

1289
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
La Nova menu

1290
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,359

Barring other

1294
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,415
We'll talk a little bit about the impact of the so-called

1295
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Fourth

1296
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,719
Industrial Revolution

1297
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,767
In the United States and in China

1298
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:06,143
I mean if you look at all the major technologies that are obviously going to be disrupted by move already mention

1299
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,191
Beauties yashow Advanced robotics

1300

1301
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,287
I'd genomics it and especially Gene editing

1302
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
RCA 9

1303
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,383
The two countries that are really at the Forefront

1304
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,687
Are China and the United States and its

1305
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
It's the private sectors of both

1306
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,783
They don't seem to really be talking to one of

1307
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:27,391
And these are really important things were interoperability

1308
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
Standards

1309
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,743
Ethics issues really needed to be

1310
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
I am in

1311
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,839
Autonomous driving things like that all these things are going to be really important

1312
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
How

1313
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,679
Musician area where you were going to see

1314
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:47,615
Divergence and it in a lack of of interoperability or art do you think that this is a

1315
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
Potential area

1316
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
4 bottle cooperation

1317
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,015
Or does it even even matter

1318
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,343
I hope so

1319
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,415
If you look at a i

1320
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,463
There's some

1321

Profound

1322
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,071
Socio-economic implications

1323
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,351
The arrival of

00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
IAAI

1325
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
You mentioned privacy

1326
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Transmission parts

1327
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,799
Looking back on labor right

1328
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
That kind of thing

1329
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Can be countries

1330
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,967
Chinese value privacy as much as

1331
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735

00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:38,303
No China is still a AAA in the 1.4 billion people and lot of laborious

1334
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,119
And there are still farmers and

1335
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,935
So if you're just sort of think about

1336
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,263
How you make this transition from low-income

1337
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,055
A middle-income to high-income

1338
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
You still need

1339
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,407
Conventional industrialization why you have

1340
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,431
Employment

1341
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
So

1342
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,015
Failure to talk to each other

1343
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,831
I think and to think long-term about

1344
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
The rise of

1345
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,647
One of the things that I

1346
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
That I read

1347
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
About

1348
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,743
Uno China 2025

1349
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:12,607
No the division as you read about the Visions read about the industries reader

1350
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
About the money

1351
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
All these things

1352
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
IP

1353
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,983
Strategy

1354
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,519
Financing strategy

1355
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
What are you doing

1356
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
Is

1357
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
The implication

1358
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
On society

1359
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
Locations of Labor

1360
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:32,575
This is remarkable to me right so if you read Marvin Minsky

1361
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Work on

1362
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
From AI

1363
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
He was MIT professor.

1364
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,463
Going back to the 96 days

1365
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,535
Father of AI

1366
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,863
She began to talk about these things back in.

1367
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,911
And

1368
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:51,775
I do believe that lack of that conversation but by the way I might eat now has a

1369
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,127
To study the effect of AI

1370
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
Labor market

1371
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
On that committee

1372
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
And

1373
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,271
It's a good

1374
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,111
Except me

1375
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:10,207
The disciplines that committee represents

1376
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,535
Systematic effort try to understand and anticipate

1377
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,095
I just don't see any of that in China

1378
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,959
I was just as I remember when Amazon go

1379
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,519
The amend convenience store by Amazon opened

1380
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
Every article mentions how many cashier jobs will be lost

1381
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:33,247
Where else went Bingo box or purple a company in China open there and then coming into and they have

1382
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
300 of those now

1383
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,319
No none of those articles

1384
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,367
In China talks about Nation evenly

1385
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Like the word of

1386
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,159
Cashier jobs

1387
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
It's just less

1388
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,535
I think we would use planes that Cavalier attitude

1389
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,351
How much does a Cavalier is that s a

1390
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
As a as a country

1391
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
There's a lot more

1392
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Keepall for optimist

1393
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
Stick on

1394
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,543
Talk technology growth in China will narrow the gap

1395
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
Bachata

1396
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Us

1397
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:03,967
Give me a funny reason to believe that I mean they've they've only seen life in

1398
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
Improve

1399
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:08,319
As Technologies in a perfect correlation between

1400
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343
These two things

1401
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
So far that's the case

1402
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,695
Mexico continues to happen

1403
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,767
What will the government do a decent job.

1404
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
I'll probably solve that

1405
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
Anaconda

1406
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,607
Keep whatever's not working hush hush

1407
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
And

1408
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,215
It's is easier to have that position under authoritarian

1409
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
You could argue

1410
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,055
Dot-dot can happen

1411
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Faster

1412
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,639
People get used to it

1413
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,527
Authoritarianism

1414
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,159
But I also think that I agree with pants on this couch Road

1415
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,719
When I first came to the US

1416
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
I was the

1417
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,535
Pies to see movies

1418
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,583
What's a Blade Runner

1419
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,863
Which portrays this

1420
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:00,031
Jesse Black Mirror

1421
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,639
So there's a 3% in Western societies I don't really know

1422
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,919
Why I should

1423
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,479
Invest time in learning about that

1424
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:15,135
Was Frankenstein more spiteful

1425
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,439
Trying to destroy the world and others lot of

1426
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,231
That in the western culture

1427
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,583
What was the Renaissance

1428
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
Both kind of

1429
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,167
Both respect and

1430
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:32,287
I'm recent and distrust philosopher who used

1431
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:38,687
Sofia at NYU in Shanghai names and a green smash you with a book called Shanghai future

1432
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:45,343
At the 1937 World's Fair and at the 2010 Expo

1433
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,159
GM

1434
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
Pavilions one was GM another

1435
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,791
A book for General Motors twins both of them were about future cities

1436
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
And

1437
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,095
You know that

1438
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,143
1937

1439
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
It was called

1440
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
Futurama

1441
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
In the time since Futurama his busy is a byword just for cheesie's or where's my Jetpack

1442
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,639
Spiral Towers

1443
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,199
In in in China is there still an earnest

1444
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,759
Erase of this idea

1445
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,807
Futurity

1446
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,367
Technologically driven it is a betterment of

1447
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:24,255
It's really interesting Scar from the Opium War from mother

1448
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,815
Things that happened in the 19th century

1449
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
Number people

1450
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:32,447
I feel like $10 is good without technology we will be defeated again

1451
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,239
And that kind of inference

1452
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
It's true

1453
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,567
We're still embarrassed about the boxers

1454
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,151
But I think that is more gentle than

1455
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,479
It's actually more gentle baby young technology

1456
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,551
In the western culture there is always

1457
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,599
Session

1458
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
Look at what lawyers do

1459
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,303
Star City right solder

1460
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,351
Trade off

1461
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,143
You always want to think about that

1462
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
The downside

1463
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
And then devise

1464
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:10,847
Institution democracy is actually to guard against

1465
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
Volume

1466
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,895
Yeah where is he

1467
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,455
The Chinese culture there's not

1468
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Similar

1469
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,783
Forward Thinking about the dance

1470
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,183
This will cover for kitchen about unification

1471
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,975
I thought about hate this government is back

1472
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:31,071
Or did the king is back just make sure he doesn't

1473
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,863
Adversely impact us too much

1474
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,983
That is very different

1475
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,519
The sentiment goes like this

1476
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:45,919
Okay this king is bad the next king will be great

1477
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:52,319
Olympics in Beijing

1478
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,975
Summer Olympics 2008 opening ceremony

1479
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:05,887
I might do. I wouldn't want to show that for the rest of world

1480
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:15,103
Brainwashing

1481
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:21,503
Chinese reporters life back I know they look.

1482
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:26,367
It is very different ethos very different

1483
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,903
Absolute

1484
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,463
So I think we should have a

1485
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,487
Broderick

1486
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,815
No the privacy issues

1487
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
How we think about technology

1488
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
How we think about all these

1489
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,471
Collectivism

1490
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
Yeah we don't have enough of

1491
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:44,799
Conversation

1492
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,127
Brother Paul you did a lot of research on the relationship

1493
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,455
Talent and economic development I wonder

1494
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,759
There a lot of light nutrition like me who

1495
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,295
Come back and became Highway

1496
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Sea turtles

1497
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,879
I'm enjoying Thai companies are started

1498
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,439
What what do you think are factors that make them

1499
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,743
Because not all of them are

1500
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,303
They have a lot of adjustments to go through

1501
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
After they go back

1502
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,423
What's up I don't know the individual cases

1503
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
Right so I think that's a cohort

1504
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,495
The

1505
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,287
The highway cohort

1506
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
Is going to

1507
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
Very important

1508
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
4

1509
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
China

1510
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,991
So I think but the key thing is

1511
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
I think

1512
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,087
People like you Zara have to make a decision

1513
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Right

1514
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,975
How

1515
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
Local do you go

1516
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,839
Do you go all the way to

1517
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
The local

1518
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
