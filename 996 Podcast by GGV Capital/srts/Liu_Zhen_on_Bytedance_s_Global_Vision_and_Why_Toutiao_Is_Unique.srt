Before taking a leading position at Woodbridge China and most recently joining bytedance

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Houston

56
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
High School

57
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
You went to

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Interest-only

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
A predominantly white town in New Hampshire

60
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,064
What was your biggest takeaway from that experience and white. Particular state

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
I think it's

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
For me I was 17 you know what I want to

63
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,720
Compare New Hampshire I went to a local high school

64
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Who stayed with English-speaking host families at situation family for the entire year they have switches I think they're louder

65
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
I think the entire this when you experience is really eye-opening

66
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Change poem

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,616
Decided to take a gap year

68
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
I guess

69
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
You don't want to look back I guess the biggest takeaway is

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,808
I was able to learn the other side of the

71
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Sorry

72
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Antiviral aih

73
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
I give examples

74
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
You know I still remember that when I went to

75
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Learn history

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
I was a senior yeah that was a senior year I went to

77
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
At school and at 2 pastry class

78
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,960
And what I learned about Chinese history

79
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
What I learned when I was in China right now

80
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,384
Remember that I even got into a huge debate with my classmates and teachers

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
WhatsApp

82
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
It is wrong

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
And I said why and that actually

84
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
Couldn't you know English wasn't very good I couldn't really articulate the reasons but what I found out that they said one sentence

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
I remembered

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
Today that they said

87
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
You said that because you were taught that

88
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,351
I think that's very important

89
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Is just

90
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,519
You don't you know I am fortunate enough to involved in a very small community and tripping or community

91
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,847
That you don't come see us a lot of established

92
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,455
Entrepreneurs of tech companies in one of the topics at today

93
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,831
We spend alot of time all actually is about AI artificial intelligence in education

94
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
Education conference

95
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
This afternoon and then eating our CEO and founder would have a conversation fireside chat

96
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Connor rental

97
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
And in that group we discussed

98
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
What a I going to change to education

99
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
What topics going to be replaced

100
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
What skills are subjects

101
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Better actually

102
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Not really

103
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
A2000 forward-looking as technology develops

104
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
So I think education is very important

105
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
And Anna and I think there were few people

106
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
Who actually had the opportunity

107
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,231
To learn Chinese history in China and then also had

108
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,631
Same exposure in the US what they say about Shang Dynasty

109
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:32,031
The Chinese history

110
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,847
Ymml strong supportive

111
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Having kids

112
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
To expose what emerged

113
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,039
In-N-Out only multi-language but also you don't want that Rose

114
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Emoji

115
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,879
Culture educational system

116
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
So that not only it's not about the language is about the information Avenue and the channels of

117
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
How you receive information

118
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
I think that's very important so

119
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
I always wanted to hear other side of the story

120
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,263
To be able to form my own argument to have them work

121
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Objective

122
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Veal

123
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
I think that's

124
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
Very important and I think about

125
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,551
I think a lot of us who study abroad at an early age also resume with that

126
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,183
The feeling that our opinions are shaped by how we grew up and how we were taught

127
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
Yeah so you studied law and wondering

128
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,863
Cuz you said before that you like risks and Ventures below is a pretty risk-averse

129
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,007
Career so how how why did you choose study law and become a lawyer

130
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,079

134
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231

149
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
He's not

150
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511

Impression of being a lawyer

171
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,183
So when you first

172
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463

173
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255

Very much involved I was a corporate lawyer so I represent clients

186
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Synoptic company

187
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959

188
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Can help them sideways

189
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
And help them enter into China

190
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Took them public in the US

191
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,991
Tsmma and also took them private

192
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:31,135
Add a couple years I started my career at Wilson sonsini as a corporate

193
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,719

6

196
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,095
And I still remember that most of our clients back then were

197
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
VC funding

198
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
In the US are trying to adjust

199
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,263
I think she started just started and we hope to quit us

200
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
Making sure it's a good China and representer

201
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,687
It is a look over kind of the portfolio company they decided to invest in

202
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
And then later we

203
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,575
Represent antreprenor School study MBA students phones Denver

204
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Eater Charleston

205

Second-handed cars come to the office to help

206
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
And later on we started representing

207
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,047
Those Chinese intrapreneurs

208
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Cool

209
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887

Chinese music Chinese

213
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Or maybe

214
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
I would say

215
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,103
A China arm of USBC but have a

216
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Stronger China present

219
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Quiet

220
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,063
You know a tendon in his one of them as well

221
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
DCM China and although

222
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,023
And then later on we started representing intrapreneurs

223
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
That's also kind of a conscience

224
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Option

225
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
But for a law firm said we wanted to go

226
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Grow with the company

227
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
And then we started companies

228
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,591
That was even some some Chinese Chinese Reese's intrapreneurs started

229
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Have an interesting more diverse

230
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Background some of them

231
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Never study

232
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
Just grabbing some of them can barely speak

233
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
So that you see the changes

234
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Very very entry

235
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Kissing that you go to the sport meetings first

236
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
Do you know the board meetings of very rigid

237
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Incorporate governor

238
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,351
I just like typical us companies you have a very sound headboard

239
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
He go through the routine

240
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
And then you have to

241
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
A little bit relax

242
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Board environment

243
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
I don't they sometimes the board would hold a meeting on WeChat

244
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,919
All the changes you think is

245
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Very very true

246
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Dizzy all the time

247
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
Felices

248
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
We sing it Versace more companies

249
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
From China

250
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
That has a mixed management

251
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
To be a

252
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
As well as hog weight

253
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
Baltimore comes to going out

254
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
And it sucks when you have people who

255
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Bicultural

256
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Multi culture

257
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
Do you see that as a sustaining Triton

258
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Would we see more of those companies

259
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
Or do you think of Music musically invite dad's arm or Ally

260
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
I would definitely think that

261
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
All the management team today at

262
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Especially in Texas

263
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Stackers whatever

264
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
More diverse

265
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
What members in Altamonte

266
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
That people have different background

267
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
And also have to say that just being in kind of the intrapreneur side

268
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
That have seeing you know

269
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,143
Intrapreneurs leaders actually unconsciously

270
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
A wanting to diversify their management

271
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Someone to talk to me

272
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,591
Yeah yeah it took a little gap between my TD and vitodens and they can talk to

273
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,943
And did you notice that while we just wanted to really that works of our management team

274
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
You know what they do have this implanted

275
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
In the mind.

276
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
Because people given back today even today that we hire a lot of people

277
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Very interesting facts

278
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
You never know what they got a boy

279
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
I probably some of that

280
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
I'm one of them and we do have a couple weiner management team

281
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,215
Bad we recently hired that I think a very you know they're not dating

282
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
Not have technology background

283
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,359
And some of them not even family like China but they come in and they boys

284
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,687
Very interesting different perspectives when we discussed

285
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Things and I think that's very important

286
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
And that's very healthy Trend that you see

287
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
As a company to become immortal

288
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
You moved from the legal career to Tech

289
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
I'm wondering what was that learning curve like for you cuz it's

290
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
A very different profession

291
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
I guess is

292
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Depends on what type of lawyer

293
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,983
Thought you were if you are corporate lawyer you know most of the time

294
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
To some extent you were more like

295
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Acting

296
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
General counsel

297
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
And I was

298
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Is actually bald

299
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
All the two

300
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Yucas tacos

301
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
I don't 6 months

302
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
I remember that I was pregnant with my first child

303
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
I stayed in haidian tonight

304
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Commute every day

305
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,375
Fragment you know until they find a replacement I was there at

306
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
Tubing ball with you

307
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Operation

308
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Yes

309
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
So and I think as

310
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Service provider

311
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
That you want me to

312
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
Just south of

313
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
If you hadn't chosen the UC Berkeley

314
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Would you end up being worth

315
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Have you gone to a different Law School

316
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
What does any of the album

317
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
East Coast

318
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
Was you end up being with

319
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
I think probably not

320
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
I think the location matters

321
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,375
You know sometimes I ask my husband actually went to Carnegie Mellon

322
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
And then he worked

323
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
Chad Bloomberg New York

324
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,871
Sometimes you know that's the same question himself

325
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,063
What TV you don't end up at on what street or somewhere it's going to be

326
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Variegated

327
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
Sweating location matters and I do think that

328
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
That you don't because I want you

329
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,215
Explain the four that you want to be the one making the decision and not just advising

330
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,543
People how to make decisions at what point did you realize

331
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
That's what you wanted

332
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,687
I was actually preparing last night I Was preparing my speech that I going to give

333
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
Do graduate students at chinois tomorrow afternoon

334
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
It's all about entropy

335
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Panache a vital part of

336
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
Teenager Pandora as the owner not a renter

337
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,511
And I think everyone not everyone can become

338
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
A founder of account

339
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Bedeviled why should

340
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Have

341
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
The central partnership

342
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
When they work at a fast growing type

343
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
Apartments that you need to

344
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,823
Take as much ownership as you could

345
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
And if you are you know you have

346
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
Auctions you a part of the company

347
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
So you are making decisions and you are responsible

348
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
For moving things forward

349
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
I think this mentality

350
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
Not only to me I think to everyone who works at by dad

351
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
That they should feel that they're making the dish

352
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Decisions

353
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
And they're moving things forward

354
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,351
And they are taking responsibility or liability

355
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
You know to bear the consequences

356
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
It is been a couple years at

357
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Uber what made you

358
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
To decide to

359
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Make.

360
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
2 or 4

361
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,359
Reform camp

362
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Pennywise

363
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Discuss as you know

364
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
In the history of Silicon Valley companies no internet company

365
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Succeeded in China

366
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
So what

367
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
Make this one

368
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
To be the one

369
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
For you too

370
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Welcome back

371
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
I think

372
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Uber

373
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
You know those

374
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Type companies fast-growing

375
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Startups

376
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Uber

377
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Is

378
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
The most

379
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
A Chinese Chinese

380
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,823

And you know I pay scale

383
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
And down

384
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,735
And in size I think it's definitely the most Silicon Valley

385
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
In China

386
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Intersection of the two wolves

387
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
Yeah yeah in both cases

388
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,767
So I think it's very you know I know so we don't I know a lot of people

389
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,887
Yoart before my work sad it was also advising providing legal advice to Uber

Uber

393
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
And down

394
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
And I think I met Travis

395
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Him and I think Wilbur is

396
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Just very intrigued

397
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455

Interesting

407
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
But I think they all have sure that they

408
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Compassion

409
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239

410
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
And they wanted to originated

411
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Earthquake

412
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
As opposed to just

413
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
It'll borrow things where what where

414
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943

Stop

418
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
The idea was in

419
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671

Cuz I'm in a Uber in us has

433
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Share of controversies

00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,607
Pocket podcast of some of that are questionable and incredible

436
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,679

00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
But it was very interesting to see a collection of talent

447
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
In a Silicon Valley

448
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279

Concession about that right

509
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,864

Not really searchable can we talk before after

517
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
I think it's kind of out of nowhere I I didn't

518
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,752
Try that again Seattle what year was this

519

You know I do to remember the details

527
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Best thing about me is very

528
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
Give me an introvert

529
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Indian by tweeting

530
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
You're not very social and he doesn't like

531
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,056
So we out and socialize with other people

532
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
When it comes to a cootie

533
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,432
Leesburg Christian

534
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,272
Aggressive persistent I don't know how many times he comes to you

00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Play side of where the company is where he lives

537
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
He's very persistent

538
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:02,144
Remember after the merger I think the second aliens with music can we meet

539
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,192
MSN log people will say hey

00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592

541
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
You know I think that's interesting you can always come to recruiting has a even today has persisted

542
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
Become very social

543
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,952
And he is actually very open-minded

544
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,280
To embrace people with different culture Edition back

545
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,376
You know I would be impressed with that

546
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,800
So what what what was the reason that he used to convince you or what were you persuaded by

547
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
Have to admit that I didn't know much about

548
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
The product I'm acting

549
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,992
I'm a user actually I'm going to another one

550
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
No I was using over

551
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Yeah

552
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,160
And I was using my mom used to joke that you know that you love

553
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
He likes to see me joined Hotel because

554
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,816
That provides all hit her daughter's information

555
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,168
Oh that is actually personalized

556
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
Anyway so

557
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,568
I think I was just very impressed by

558
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Paintings

559
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Ambition

560
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Attitude

561
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,224
And also I think he has very high tolerance

562
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,784
Of people with diverse background

563
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
But I think that's very important

564
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,416
And I am enough quotes and I know kind of roughly you know.

565
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,768
Company and also I also said that I didn't want that that was a very quick decision for me

566
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
I didn't want to join another company that is burning money

567
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:41,984

That are counted platform

571
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,224
A powered by Machine learning

572
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
So Daddy

573
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,344
People can it's really Discovery platform that provide personalized compass

574
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Two olives

575
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,952
And its Flagship product is called sociology Naruto with y'all

576
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
Which you know what has

577
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
It over a hundred million users

578
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
In China daily active users in China

579
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
And II Buckhead after products

580
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
Are we caught UBC products

581
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032

Chinese people

583
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,640
A familiar way those short video products historian

584
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Horsham

585
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
And then they had one

586
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,552
Data more focused on interactions

587
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,600
Overcomes personalized,

588
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,696
The three packets of products overseas products

589
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232
Including this

590
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:39,328
It'll musically we just recently announced the merger

591
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,168
Musically is really a great platform that is covers

592
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,240
Us and Europe most of their users

593
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,848
And this is rhodium agents that we didn't have too much coverage before

594
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,432
So I think there are definitely Synergy about musically and

595
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
Going forward

596
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
In terms of

597
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Tiger lady

00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Global Mart

599
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
How would you summarize the mission of ideas

600
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
It wasn't

601
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,976
In one sentence or two

602
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,584
Bank is I wanted to tell you know why

603
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
You know this content platform was

604
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,216
Found it in the first place you know the company's 5 years ago

605
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
And 5 years ago

606
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,568
Ambulate 2011/2012

607
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
That is

608
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,176
Beaming realize that the information

609
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Information agent

610
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,040
Atwoods transforming from PC and newspaper

611
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,088
To mobile

612
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
So at an accompanied by the development of machine learning and AI technology

613
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,072
Yeah but those are all based on PC

614
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Netease

615
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
We're eating a yeah but yeah but then you take into consideration of that weed the first app way /

616
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
It's called a lance is actually

617
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,640
A very simple content platform that Focus sound

618
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Apple biting joke

619
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,504
Similar to Reddit with less political content

620
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,904
But at the very beginning that you mean was Ashley using machine learning the key features

621
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Lentils jokes

622
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,584
So I think we're really the first one who use my s*** applied machine learning technology to contact YouTube

623
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,144
Discovery breakthrough

624
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Innovation

625
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
And then we applied us

626
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
Technology to all the products we have today

627
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,848
That make us you know different from other

628
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
Add approach

629
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
When it comes to contemplate musically

630
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
I decided to

631
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Merchandise

00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Mumbai dance

633
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
One reason why I was in favor of it

634
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
Did this is a very unique capability

635
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
Can boost almost any company you work

636
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,304
Most people haven't had the opportunity

637
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
What do you

638
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
The chance

639
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
To develop the algorithm

640
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Also machine learning

641
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
You guys have something that can be applied

642
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Across multiple

643
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
How many Engineers does spiders have

644
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
We now have about 3000

645
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,480
Ngos and data scientist

646
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
Wishes I can go bare access

647
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,880
We applaud that we have today in China

648
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Which is also

649
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
You now easy access to find today

I'll let you know very

651
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,704
And I know that recruiting many top talents in machine learning and AI algorithms

652
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,616
I think it is everywhere you know from the valley

653
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,736
What what are the top reasons that you use to convince people to join by tens

654
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
What would you tell them

00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Edo

656
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
I think part of

657
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:47,232
Because I was with Uber which is very operational driven company

658
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,536
And is very

659
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
Very technology

Product

661
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Type of company

662
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
So guess different types

663
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
Funniest would have filled a different way

664
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Quitting

665
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288

666
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,336
I think for any operational

667
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,408
Operation driven companies what iPhone is that there

668
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,552

And they really just tell her that

686
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
I think the most

687
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,384
Inspiration slogan I heard it will be

688
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432

690
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
Ghetto engineering recruiting

691
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,576
Send it can be very very

692
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
Data-driven

693
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
To be in the

694
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232

MGK bath Market

696
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,960
And if you ask the evening was kind of the big track of recording Collins Brody with the conversation recipe

697
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,568
So Uber want to change the world it was inspirational

698
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:43,200
Bytedance is very solid reliable and looking at interesting products

699
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:47,040
How did the evening who is very solid and reliable

700
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
You find out he not

701
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
You know I would want to go global

702
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
We want expand Beyond China

703
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
What

704
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
Prompt him in a company

705
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
And you guys

706
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
To make that decision

707
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,120
We started our International expansion in mm

708
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Another company was

709
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,496
Steel for your a little bit more than two years old

710
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,848
So is Barry Williams that he started and decided to go

711
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Globo

712
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,968
I know you don't and I do see this in many

713
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
Entrepreneurs in his generation

714
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
That they stink globally

715
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
And they never intended to be

716
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
A chine account

717
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464

718
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Yes

719
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,328
And they say and also I think I'll come check in space

720
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,424
You know I'm sure online content media social media space

721
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Do I think this is

722
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
Just so you know this is just the right thinking

723
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
That you couldn't think of you can't really

724
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
Continuous selfie White Ranger

725
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,920

Perspective

728
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
This is the platform business

729
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,320
So I think they never really intended to

730
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,672
You know where global company to headquarter happened to be in Beijing

731
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
I sent you personally also worked on a lot of

732
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,584
Totalis recent deals with

733
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:10,240
Companies outside of China how was this process of negotiating with non chine

734
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Chinese companies

735
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,568
And because

736
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,664
I guess brand name is very strong in China but overseas

737
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,784
Not many people have used its products or they use it but don't know is part of by chance

738
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,184
I think the most with or without answer is trust me is much easier than Hugo shading waves label companies

739
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
Music deals

740
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
Switch positions we are doing more votes Wicked Ways has been side we do seed

741
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,800
The products Energy Engineering or talents energy that we feel that we can help the company

742
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,384
So when whenever we approach and then Chinese

743
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Ice Company

744
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,480
And which are most founded by product people

745
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760

746
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,600
Dizzy very easier for us because we could have really have a camera

747

00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:11,680
Dad you know the Airways stop when we got in we can improve on their products

752
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,984
And the founders smile

753
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,056
They showed me the reason for the Temptation twist board

754
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
6 identical

755
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
We just we really think alike

756
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,224
I think it's as kind of it is much easier than

757
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
I was a negotiating with

758
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
Business

759
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
Finance

760
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:33,184
Yunnan people

761
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:42,400
Musically is also you know we we had to come is treated as a builder as a

762
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
Products people

763
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
So I think it's

764
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Sweet forward

765
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
And then you have to come in

766
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
Play when you speak the same language

767
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:56,480
So Hans would you like to come in more unlike the significance of the musically tote real deal

768
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,064
But I think when we messing musically the it was the first

769
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Company

770
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
How many Beijing Shanghai

771
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
With a very

772
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
China dominated team

773
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
Pencil Building Products that become mainstream in the US

774
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
And I was

775
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,864
Extremely hard to do and never did no one ever did that before

776
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
That was interesting

777
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
And then over the last few years

778
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
You can tell that

779
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
Musically has something amazing

780
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,312
But it could use extra help

781
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,384
To to get fulfilled a true vision

782
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,456
Well as possible for them to pick American partner

783
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
I think collectively as a board and shareholders

784
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,368
We all felt that going with someone like Tokyo if you'll be something quite special

785
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
And offer a lot more upset

786
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
And I think the

787
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
The culture

788
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
Are so similar in both Farms

789
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,328
Both do 9 and 6 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

790
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
62 week

791
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Cardinals schedule

792
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,936
You can improve car. Product screaming tuna

793
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,032
And and I'm not even for a for a few years even before I don't you

794
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
6 years ago

795
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,896
It's amazing to see how much he has matured

796
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
Like there's sunset

797
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Amazing

798
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
And then

799
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
I know that for us

800
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Get a deal done

801
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,624
That you may have to figure out a way to work with futon at Cheetah Mobile

802
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
And then

803
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
The evening plus I was able to

804
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
Who sell that and make that happen

805
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,328
So you was not an easy deal I don't think I don't think anyone else

806
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Could have really done it that is not many people can

807
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
Are you guys getting gotten extremely efficient

808
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
So far all of a sudden music

809
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
We boycotting

810
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,616
How to be seized is IG and teaming then

811
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
Acrylic wall

812
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944

814
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368

00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
It's a milestone

816
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
Yeah thank you

The holiday season is a very important tee

827
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
Accounting products

828
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,976

829
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,280
Four by Genesis products

830
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
Both in and outside of China

831
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:23,680
I think in China you know because of the large user base

832
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
So I think the demography

833
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
Kind of evil

834
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
Is a disability

835
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568

I think China pek

839
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
Is a huge disparity between

840
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
The first-tier cities

841
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344

In Japan

861
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440

862
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
Japan Korean

863
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,304

But the bike and recommendation engine

868
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360

869
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640

880
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:56,096
Yeah I think the back end cuz all the engineers and product people are based

881
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,936
Airbase in China so we share the same

882
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,728
Backend and also we do Qualls

883
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
Product marketing as you said that we will be able to promote

884
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Other products

885
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Inflection

886
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,944

887
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
The top priorities

888
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296

00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336

00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Too short.

910
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:56,000
Statistics that we are about in terms of waiting time media content consumption time worry about 6

911
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768

00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
So we definitely see video saree

944
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Becoming

945
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
You're definitely

946
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
EBay timeshare

947
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,840
And you also we also lost the Twitter type of way what type of

948
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
We told you

949
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
Feature

950
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
It also we don't encourage users

951
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216

952
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Quaid content directly

953
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,152
I'm so if you look at the rage format an advertisement it's just another form of counting

954
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,248
Will you do personalized as product my way well

955
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,600
And you can invite it in the park where it is itself actually account

956
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
So

957
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
I think the reach content

958
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
And also better this way you'll have

959
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
Udo variety of which continent

960
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328

962
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
Distribution

963
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
I think you definitely

964
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Engaged

965
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
Earwigs out in

966
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
It's a bit more

967
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,312
That's why the time

968
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,736
What issue that many media platforms are both in and outside of China struggle with its meditation

969
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
Could you talk a little bit about how

970
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
Iden's makes money do you know where ER advertisement Revenue

971
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Model business

972
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
I think it's different

973
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Social

974
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
Media platform hosts

975
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Publix

976
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,752
An advertisement you think about it

977
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
This man is really just one of the puppet

978
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,152
That's why you know what about you

979
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
Monetize

980
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
Is actually better to monetize

981
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
Public content

982
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
Dan is the man

983
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064

984
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344

985
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,136
Social content

986
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
So I think

987
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,720
This is so you know what the news feed by say

988
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
Advertisement I think it was

989
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
And in this area wasn't really

990
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:47,776
Wasn't built in a lot of Vig and big companies didn't pay a lot of attention to this area

991
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
Montecito

992
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080

Moving Giver discuss.

994
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,407
On this one to two

995
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,807
But you tried monetization on the UTC

996
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
The short-form mobile video app

997
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,439
Will you be looking at different ways to monetize Beyond

998
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Flooring.

999
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
But I think you know when

1000
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:17,727
You know I think being I think we're exploring that but I think is important to realize

1001
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
The power

1002
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
And potential office

1003
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Is one stop come from

1004
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:27,967
That not only because I'm going to technology-wise you would be able to

1005
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Morito you use

1006
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,319

1015
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,263
Reading behaviors on different formats

1016
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,359

1023
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,631
Career I want a dead woman and she's very sick

1024
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,959
And she always encouraged me to

1025
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
How to find a step forward

1026
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,055
Andy Mohr model

1027
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
Sometimes when I was

1028
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,663
Kind of struggling or deciding between

1029
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:33,503
Attending my kids school emails or are you going to go on this business web

1030
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,831
She is always the one encouraging me to go on a business trip

1031
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,159
She said well enough kids going to forget about that which is the truth

1032
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,815
So I think this is very important that I I was actually said to a

1033
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
Boarding kindergarten

1034
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119

1041
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,623
Boarding and even had a little Hospital inside

1042
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903

1051
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:45,951
Small takeaway ask my husband is out also you know interesting you know why I've you are

1052
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,303
As more partnership as opposed to traditional husband and wife

1053
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,607
Can we share equally and in some of

1054
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375

Intensiva

1059
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,247
I think that's also very helpful that you have a very

1060
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
Strong family support

1061
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,855
And you are also able to

1062
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,671
Leverage all the resources you have

1063
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975

1064
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
Now I have work both in the valley

1086
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,015

A lot of we started at 5 yards

1088
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087

A lot of meetings

1112
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
They also feel that if the company is

1113
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,063
Growing very fast paced

1114
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,879
I feel a little bit left behind

1115
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:28,767
Yeah and she said that she didn't want to come outside but is ended up that

1116
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,863
Elmo see you know every other Sunday because of the work.

And meetings that we require

1118
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,727
So as a woman in the family

1119
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,079
You probably get a lot of people asking you like how do you do it all

1120
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
That's probably one of the most

1121
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,455
What does it take to be able to do a lot of

1122
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
Chugalug

1123
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,575
Extremely fast moving

1124
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Always involved

1125
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,207
I think to be able to kind of jungle

1126
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
You know that's workload

1127
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,071
And having two very young

1128
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
I think the most important

1129
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
How much weight

1130
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
Play time you high

1131
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,519
And are you feel excited

1132
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
About your own

1133
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
What's your mom's name

1134
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,871
I think it's very very important

1135
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
To be able to

1136
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,015
To do something for your own to make yourself happy and energetic

1137
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,831
Then nothing you can take on more challenges

1138
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,647
And two to be able to accommodate more

1139
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,439
I think that's a boy

1140
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
I think

1141
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,535
Anyone who can take care of themselves

1142
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,375
Especially women you know man I guess you don't

1143
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:43,775
Always take care of themselves are selfish

1144
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,799
I should definitely

1145
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,615
Blossomtime parade

1146
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Yeah

1147
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
Are you feeling happy

1148
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
You are

1149
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
And you have feelings

1150
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
Madhur

1151
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
The most

1152
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
I think

1153
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,671
I think you have to understand that you manage them you know what they care the most

1154
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,487
At what you care the least

1155
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
That's very true

1156
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
You want to do it well

1157
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,655
You have to go to give up. Go

1158
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:15,263
So you don't ya and and work that way we always say that we were

1159
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
I wanted to make magic

1160
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Achieve

1161
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Perfection

1162
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
But I home you know

1163
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
I I care less

1164
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,759
There's really a lot of things sad

1165
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
I feel.

1166
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,087
III character list

1167
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,623
You know what kind of

1168
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Close my kids

1169
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,719
I swear we could have milk

1170
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
You know

1171
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,839
Are there dressing properly for school you know

1172
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,679
Attending every school

1173
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,471
You know there was just at 8

1174
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,031
Started actually education about this

1175
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,847
You know I can go half

1176
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:54,175
I can not go the other half.

1177
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
You know if Daddy can go if

1178
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,807
You know what Daddy can go but if not that's fine

1179
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,111
Let's all fights

1180
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
How do you prioritize

1181
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,487
Reply lessons you learned in worked for to your family

1182
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:14,399
Yes or no the other profession side yet

1183
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:20,031
If both parents was in the valley I think it's

1184
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
It's

1185
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,895
Is more likely to be able to do that

1186
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Sear

1187
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
Them over there

1188
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,343
Yes or no I think in the valley I don't know you but but I definitely see some family so I vote

1189
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Go to

1190
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Also

1191
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
So beautiful

1192
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
Some similar

1193
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,511
Domestic system

1194
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,583
Somebody saying the body cuz you just go to Whole Food and buy a lot of

1195
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:51,007
I'm outside it is easier that you don't really look for

1196
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,799
I think in

1197
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,615
In about a year

1198
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
In New York

1199
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Somebody's place

1200
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
You have

1201
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
The mother is somehow expected

1202
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
Spend more time

1203
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Attending the

1204
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
MySchoolBucks

1205
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,367
Buckets

1206
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:12,255
Yeah I think that you have to educate their children that what are the conventional truth is

1207
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,327
And you shouldn't always follow the conventional truth

1208
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
How do you hatch a billionaire mindset

1209
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,311
To be honest as also thing you know Silicon Valley moms

1210
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
Returning to work

1211
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,943
Because they wanted to demonstrate to their children specialist

1212
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
Dad daughter

1213
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
Yes

1214
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,319
That you don't women swallow is not only defined

1215
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
To do the math

1216
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
But also can take a role just as their daddy is

1217
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,255
EIC definitely this

1218
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,535
Need

1219
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,327
You know from children side

1220
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,887
No pressure even from education side

1221
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,959
455 stay at home mom to return to the

1222
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Coincidence

1223
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,751
When

1224
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,287
The debate is on

1225
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,335
In the US after you get married

1226
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
Almost all

1227
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,895
Women are more expected

1228
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
To change last name

1229
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
Qufu map

1230
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,735
Previous lost

1231
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
To the husband

1232
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
I don't ever see that in

1233
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,367
China or

1234
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,647
Parts of Asia

1235
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,439
But in USA

1236
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Almost expected

1237
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
And

1238
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Psychologically

1239
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
It's its edges

1240
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,839
It's it was

1241
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
It was eye-opening for me

1242
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
Cuz

1243
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
It's not what I'm used to

1244
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,727
You know what

1245
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
In Asia women

1246
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
Keep a lost thing

1247
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
If you married and still you know

1248
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Your own person

1249
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,895
But in the US

1250
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Is Ura

1251
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Socially

1252
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Expect to change

1253
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,271
So is this a small thing but

1254
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
Different

1255
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Don't expect

1256
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,463
An interesting cuz I'm in charge of booking you know

And my family or my husband is responsible

1259
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,607
Before executing yet that I mean try to

1260
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,423

1306
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
Why do a sentence

00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247

In what situation is different problem would have different bound

1310

And when the boundary changes
