00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
Definition is what I felt when we thought about this program then

123
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,823
We didn't expect to be seeing this many applicants

124
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
On top of that

125
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639

134
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
I'm so sitting up

135
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,791

Countries at young age

185
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
In

186
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
The face in Michigan

187
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
Really helps to shape

188
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
A global mindset

189
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
And the building of this open-mindedness

190
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
I believe critical

191
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
And navigating through an Ever more increasingly

192
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,927
Call Blythewood sure and is nationally I feel that way helps me to understand

193

197
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
Why did you pick Germany

198
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
Phone number places and then

199
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,495
Most of my friends in the states for grad school off of work

200
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
If I couldn't

201
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Be the best

202
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
I like to be a little bit different

203
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
And I was a petrol head and everything two cars

204
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943

And after

207
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Germany

208
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Lobotomy

209
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903

00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
That you didn't know

212
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Before a discover we were there

213
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
And what were the things that impress you the most

214
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
I think there's one thing that impressed me most about Germany is

215
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Time management

216
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
And dedication

217
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
They're almost

218
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Same thing

219
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
Urban legends on China social media about how Germans are

220
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,687
Carefully curating managing and documenting everything

221
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991

Believable

231
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
In September

00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
The winter is coming should we grab tea together

233

Incredibles so

238
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
Quaker time when I was a pain everybody's like

00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,127
Managing of documentation I went skiing

241
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407

242
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
Holiday season

243
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Give me a prescription runtime

244
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,551

Where I had my glasses

247
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
It's about 3 years ago

248
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,767
I gave them just my first and last name of course that's a record

249
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,839
And they have my record and emailed me over again

250
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
I like 10 minutes and I think this kind of dedication

251
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Odoo documentation

252
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239

You just have to be so meticulous and precise

258
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
So that's the takeaway

259
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
I wasn't very

260
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951

00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
The station

278
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
We actually had somebody

279
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Renting house for house in Wilson West

280
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,983
I'm not sure it's basically Chicago

281
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Slightly better

282
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Or you could call 911 people come out

283
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
An hour because police demand

284
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
I don't want to be in danger

285
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
So

286
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,479
It was a huge shock for me because it's quite alright

287
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,855

Consulting

321
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687

Sing for me

324
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,343
Icing I enjoy problem solving and critical thinking

325
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
And quantitative things

326
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Golden

327
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
My make mimosa

328
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
Especially in the public opinion talking about

329
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
And that was the end of

330
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
2017 I got a call from the cooter

331
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
At a point inside

PhD degree in electrical engineering

336
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383

00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
And my concentration

340
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Is on human behavior modeling

341
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
So when we do is apply quantitative modeling

342
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
And the computer simulations

343
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
But to understand

344
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
And predict human behavior

345
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767

Tripe

350
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
This week

351
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
Based on public speeches extracted

352
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335

Nazi models

354
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
And I personally wish my pissy work we actually published

355
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
How to predict a model

356
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:51,391
Coalition Dynamics in regions of conflict like Syria military factions Audiology claims

There also

373
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
The Annenberg national election survey of largest

374
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Panel composed of

375
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
That was hosted by managed by the time

376
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
So

377
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
What they do is they ask

378
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
About

379
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
What are your positions on

380
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
The top

381
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Six or eight issues

382
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Slipknot art

383
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471

384
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Including

385
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Taxation welfare immigration

386
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Uninterested

387

388
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Pro-life and pro-choice

00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Corinth Topix

390
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
And I'm based on those

391
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Questionnaire responses

392
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
You can basically place an individual

393
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
High-dimensional

394
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Space

395
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
And then there also the

396
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
Ancient Enlightenment was

397
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
The published statements

398
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
Of the illegal Canada

399
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
And I know you can see you

400
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
Which candidate would give them a higher perceived utility

401
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,959
Invigilator noises and people are irrational or misinformed

402
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Collectible noises

403
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007

405
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Behavior

406
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
In terms of making

407
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
The better choice

408
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Play for themselves

409
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Fascinating

410
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
So from there with his go next

411
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
So from there I was one day given this report on Syria

412
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
About to friend Ida logical group

413
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
UPS in Syria

414
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
SF State Department for office use on it

415
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
And I traced back to the author of that document

416
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
Turn on Pandora.

417
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Practice was an alumni

418
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
And so with a minor present

419
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Once I reach home

420
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
It's pretty cool

421
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Happened to work on this

422
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
The Intern

423
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Antitoxin

424
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
What did The Internship

425
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
Meet you to tell them to go full-time offer Nashville

426
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
And I joined the firm

427
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
Being one of the first

428
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
The scientist

429
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
I love you technology

430
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Help them to

431
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Extract people is

432
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
The medical narratives

433
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Anan

434
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Tracing public opinion

435
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Encore social issues

436
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
For a number of pi

437
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Signs from your stomach

438
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
2

439
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Unnecessary

440
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Agency

441
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
And

442
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
The general customer

443
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
Horoscope from there too

444
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
I think it would help me to build a lot of more solid engineering

445
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Technical skills

446
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
And I felt

447
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
It was this insufficiency for me personally

448
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
In terms of

449
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
And actually have a couple of offers

450
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
At the same time

451
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
I wanted them I still remember when

452
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Br

453
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Content strategy

454
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
She manager for Coursera

455
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
Deciding what Rotondo

456
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
How many products

457
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Understudies

458
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
But my argument myself is that

459
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
I think it's easier to

460
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
Go with the technical track and Adrian track

461
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
When you're younger because

462
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
Everything faster in the morning verses

463
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
If I go for managerial Consulting tracking

464
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Do an MBA I think it's

465
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Much more difficult to

466
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Come back to

467
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Mechanical field because the pace of

468
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Innovation

469
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Ana peso

470
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
Change in the type what is just so fast

471
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
And I want to stay tuned

472
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Until I'm ready

473
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,207
So you were in school at UPenn a retile operating about his research

474
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
And ends up working for monitor

475
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
And so does the internet become full-time

476
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
Then how did you go from monitor to

477
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,983
Swear words what city were you in for monitors lanzhou

478
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
There's three are former

479
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Kumon

480
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Pinterest

481
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Okay

482
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
And then nothing for the barrier then how'd it go for monitor 2

483
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
I realized that

484
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
I would

485
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Not sufficiently trained

486
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
And and Technical and Engineering background

487
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
For me I basically Middleton

488
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
Concord has to be better

489
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
A young age

490
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
To concentrate

491
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
On a technical track until I'm ready to mate

492
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
The jump entirely

493
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Tube strategy

494
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Look for Tech firms in

495
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
I wasn't looking

496
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
At a time

497
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
Until the end of Seventeen

498
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
And I got a call from recruiter

499
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
And I'll point

500
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Ugly Heart

501
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
This really cool thing going on here

502
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
And where

503
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Ending

504
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
A secret

505
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
AI project

506
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
Until you

507
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
October 1st

508
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Phone conversation

509
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
Would you like to do the interview with us

510
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
And I didn't exactly

511
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Is Fallout 4

512
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
What are you doing an apple now

513
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Now you can share

514
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,215
I think for the OSHA tagline I am developing

515
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Shiny hunting

516
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Natural language

517
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Understanding capability

518
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Of Siri

519
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
And

520
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
That's all I'm allowed to say

521
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Truck.

522
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
If you feel that by doing this theme

523
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
Prove your technical background and experience

524
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
I think it does

525
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
And I think one of the things I did not realize

526
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
I joined his dad

527
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
There's an inherent

528
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Advantage

529
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Two large Tech firm

530
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
It's a scale that

531
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
So when I was a monitor

532
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
Our clients are we looking at

533
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Police auctions record the million half a million

534
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
Sizes of data and asking out

535
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Wyan

536
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
This kind of probing questions

537
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,871
But an apple whenever we doubled neighbors and relatives

538
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Future

539
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
We're serving in hundreds of millions a day

540
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
So I think that's really valuable

541
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
Burns and then also really helps you in and almost

542
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Fortitude

543
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
To sing

544
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
And sing at a difference

545
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,743
And then when you are at Applebee's you ever

546
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
See anyone around you do a startup

547
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
How did you come to know about innovation in a

548
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
Explorer

549
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,935
Sure I think

550
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
SO2 colic departing

551
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
1-4

552
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
Self-driving the other one

553
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
Why don't you do ico's

554
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Late for him to

555
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
But anyways

556
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,575
As an entrepreneurship I have always

557
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
In a firm believer

558
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Startup life

559
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
In order to

560
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
To do great things

561
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
And I would say for anyone

562
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
With a mission

563
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
To realize their dreams they should

564
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
Try to work for themselves

565
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Commander life

566
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
Or at least appear to Fairlife

567
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
To at least

568
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
1

569
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
To build something they believe in

570
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
And that's my

571
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Personal credle so to speak

572
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
And I've always been seeking opportunities to do so

573
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
I have done

574
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
One side of back

575
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
When I was in grad school

576
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,343
And my last social apps that after you start funding

577
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
But in the same time I realized

578
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Dongguan

579
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Fashion

580
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
And we had a very competitive

581
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Competitor

582
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
By the time we launched and didn't go quite well

583
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Persisted to me

584
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Truckin personally for me at this stage

585
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
I think I'm trying to be

586
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Much

587
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,800
Technical background as I can but and also

588
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
Nepeta important actions

589
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
That will become you

590
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
When I do decide

591
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
And find out what I meant

592
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
I say you can race

593
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
$5000000

594
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
What will be your

595
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Startup idea

596
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
That you will

597
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Tailspin

598
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,720
I think there are two considerations hours

599
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
When I want to do start

600
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
1 East Howe

601
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
Confident I am

602
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
To realize

603
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
And secondly how

604
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Image of a possum

605
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
I

606
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
I've always been

607
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Actually don't be thinking about

608
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
In the area of

609
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Strong

610
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
In general

611
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Halogens

612
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
And language understanding

613
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
I think this will be

614
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Critical trend

615
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
The next

616
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
4 reasons

617
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
That almost obvious

618
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
Number one there will be a new form and much more efficient

619
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
A natural form

620
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
Of human computer interfacing

621
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,328
So wouldn't using clicking and typing as major form of making with computer systems

622
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
Ever since the invention of

623
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
Mustafa Centre now

624
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
But

625
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
Don't cut program to

626
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
Just use our fingers going

627
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,104
Natural form of communication for anyone as we're doing right now

628
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Aswetalk

629
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,432
And this really requires

630
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
This computer system

631
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
How to say

632
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Capability

633
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,320
To fully understand and take in

634
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
What's our intent are

635
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
A language system would help bridge the gap

636
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,488
And I think it has two very important applications for 1

637
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
If you think in terms of human

638
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Computer interface

639
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
This will help

640
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
To bring

641
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
Technology so much more personal

642
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
And Incredibly easy to use

643
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,776
Even people who have no computer skills at all

644
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
And now I believe there are plenty

645
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,408
And secondly their massive shows of data

646
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
Existing

647
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
In the anticipation

648
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
In a broader public domain

649
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Star in text

650
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
And and not

651
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
In any other form

652
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,160
Anhui country of still doing

653
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
Streamwood matching

654
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,560
Define information and we have hummus reading analyst reading through

655
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Pages of Shopkins from Prospectors

656
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,680
To due diligence documents to files and in Shreveport

657
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
To get maybe one or two

658
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
Useful pieces animation right

659
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
But what if the computer had

660
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Speakability

661
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
To read

662
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Thomas 10

663
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
To summarize

664
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
And also to

665
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Do the Cure

666
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
In

667
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
An ear or superhuman

668
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Level

669
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,320
I think there have been some sort of stew in the area

670
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,952
And some vertical Industries during this already but I think it's still a relatively underdeveloped field

671
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
That is inherently challenging

672
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Ana procedure

673
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Like challenging

674
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,120
Is natural language processing a very specific domain

675
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Vertical use

676
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,192
People pay a premium for it

677
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
The benefits

678
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Garden rakes

679
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,824
That's a good idea

680
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,920
So now you're at Apple Cupertino in the new campus amazing

681
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
Is very easy to

682
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Just working for the rest of your life

683
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Never leave

684
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,832
It's so beautiful and so self-sufficient

685
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
What prompt you to decide to apply for today

686
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Movie Palace

687
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
The first of all about apples

688
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Campuses in

689
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Amazing

690
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
But

691
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
In terms of why I wanted

692
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Apply for Lowe's

693
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
Obviously I do have

694
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
The dreaming long-term

695
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
To do something

696
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
And to be good at it

697
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
And make an impact

698
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
That's very tangible and personal

699
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
I don't believe

700
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
You can quite do that

701
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
And I normally

702
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Organization

703
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
In any

704
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Elevation Church

705
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Secondly

706
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552
I think we study current economic

707
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Google trend

708
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,904
China is taking an Advil increasingly important bro

709
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
On what stage

710
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
Economically

711
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
It'll be a natural thing to do

712
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
To be in those environment

713
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
Just like an old-time she would have wanted

714
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Venice

715
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Florence

716
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,704
Milano to be a merchant I think they want to do a start of anyone

717
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Adventure

718
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
You want to go to

719
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,800
Friendly and also the overall Society

720
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Providing

721
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Good foundation

722
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
And I'm cold

723
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
One thing I

724
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Wired about

725
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Repulsive

726
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
Steve Jobs

727
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
And he's finally it's going to

728
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Intercede

729
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
The construction site

730
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
She appeared very

731
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Upset

732
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
What is fellow man

733
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Why

734
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
Aren't you happy about

735
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
He said he just realized

736
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Everything

737
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Not to bring this

738
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
Antidepressant comparison

739
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Overall

740
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
For every single

741
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
And they will always be

742
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
The next big thing

743
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896
It's important for those individuals

744
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
This weekend

745
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
To take the leap of faith

746
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
And commit

747
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Twitter believe in

748
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Opium

749
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
Eventually.

750
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
And I hope I

751
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Along the way

752
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
It seems like you are also impressed by

753
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Peter Thiel

754
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
I think you said

755
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Marvelous

756
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Brave

757
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Intelligent

758
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Person

759
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,400
He's almost

760
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
Contrarian

761
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
In a way

762
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Awkward

763
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
And I've already spoken almost

764
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
Every single

765
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800

770
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
And talk about process of being something

771
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
Sing out of nothing.

772
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Very helpful

773
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Informative

774
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808

One week trip

778
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
In China

779
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976

782
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
Besides people quoting Peter Thiel

783
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
I think it's

784
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,472
It's lingering the chief of staff Denver garage

785
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520

786
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544

4 video clip sharing

788
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,640
It's a very controversial service

789
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
And why did Chris

790
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Search for

791
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
But some people

792
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
I think there are

793
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Sharing

794
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Distasteful

795
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552

00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Icing

799
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,560
That's the perception almost everybody in the class had before him come in and I think everybody else

800
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
I took a lot of you in there like

801
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,008
I'm through with gossiping and if you want to ask him very sweaty question

802
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,128
I know you all have this

803
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
Perception of these

804
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,480
Infamous company I work for but

805
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Here's our mission

806
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
So he should have a love question

807
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
Which I really I could withstand without doing the wrong day that's why I stopped

808
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
Recording

809
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
Everyone

810
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Faithfully

811
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
He said they're sweet sayings

812
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Good in life

813
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,256

815
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
And the Beautiful

816
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
If you think about Instagram and then there's two

817
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,264
The word for donations are the kind

818
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
And the question is the

819
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
Spectrum Business

820
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
To the artist

821
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,784
Composing a chimichanga with with a famous painting

822
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,856
I think a lot of stuff Working Class People

823
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
And for those who don't know it

824
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
It's like realism

825
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
Some paintings in French

826
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
19th century French

827
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Los Arcos

828
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Depicting the life of

00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
Orchids

830
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
So basically is arguing that it's

831
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Is a modem version

832
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Of

833
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Art

834
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,896
That is strictly recording the Daylights of people

835
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,200
Cool in a precautionary area

836
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
Worst employee

837
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,040
Emitted in history

838
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
My ass is kind of venal

839
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Almond

840
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
An Eureka moment

841
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Wow

842
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,792
This is what you're doing this is kind of eye-opening and really this astonishing

843
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
For everybody

844
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
We didn't know you were doing charity work

845
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
And I think to a certain time

846
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
It is

847
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,520
They were talking about Universal values were talking about

848
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
How was your

849
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,896
Everybody's looking at you to share I could have access to a

850
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,736
Very meaningful and deep conversation that was something

851
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
The most unexpected

852
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Turn up volume

853
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
For attending

854
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,624
And I personally was very tough

855
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
Bye

856
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Is kindness

857
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
And also their vision

858
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
At least there are other types of vision

859
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
As well as just

860
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
How open he was going to share a business

861
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Regulatory hurdles

862
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
Question was facing when going so fast

863
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
So now what

864
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Good

865
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056

866
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Big takeaway

867
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,360
After 1 week

868
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
The things you learned

869
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
Or things that you feel

870
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
You can take away and help you

871
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
To do something

872
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Dallas news

873
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
I think without a doubt it would be

874
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Realism

875
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Not quite shows

876
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
Style but I really think the sense that I think

877
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
A lot of us

878
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
I'm going to

879
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Elite institutions

880
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Looking at Big tech company

Living in a bubble Sprite I wouldn't quite had

883

Outside

886
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Silicon Valley outside

887
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Getting a real check

888
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432

00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Slightly painful

890
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
Elizabeth discomforting

891
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,832
Fundamentally reassuring me personally I think

892
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,136
A lot of my friends and me personally had

893
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
Over romanticized

894
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
The idea of doing a startup

895
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
And really almost

896
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
Ignore menticide bones to extensive fantasizing

897
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
Catching exorbitant evaluations

898
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,704
After 6 months after 6 months after C Class

899
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,496

XNXX

904
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Is odd

905
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
I think the idealism is there

906
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Passion and

907
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
Urban legends some of them are truly real

908
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
But the

909
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
Amount of effort

910
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Dedication

911
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
And the firmness

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
Of your face and bleed

And being persistent leader

915
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
Takes a lot of

916
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
A lot of

917
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Perseverance

918
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
And he's like

919
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,800
I think night when there was a lot of curiosity and I came back with

920
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
I love respect

921
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,384
Hours of thunder

922
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Twice

923
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
Well companies didn't do that well

924
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,992
But it is the hardest job on

925
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
TPS Honduras

926
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552

So

00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Smecu things that

00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
In the future

940
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
And how would this what you learned

941
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
From this program

I think

945
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
Sociable in the long run

946
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
As I said earlier

947
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
The economy trends

948
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,040
Are really going towards

949
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
In favor of China

950
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880

It is natural thing to

956
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
To be there

957
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
To be on the ground

958
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328

Fighting the battle

961
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
What to do today

962
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,288
This way helped me the program itself

963
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Really helped me

964
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Enjoy one

965
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
As I'm getting a reality check

966
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
To fully understand

967
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
And have that kind of breadth and depth

968
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
In such a short period of time

969
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Is simply incredible in a parallel

970
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
And secondly also help

971
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
Salata social program

972
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
Boys are fellows

973
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
Turning Point

974
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
OK Google

975
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Might come up

976
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
I feel this

977
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,632
Quit program that way healthy

978
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
Define duress

979
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
And and to make more informed choice

980
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
If you have any suggestions

981
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
For next year

982
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
How can we do it better

983
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
Make the next class will Conor

984
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
2007

985
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
In terms of size of the class

986
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
I still think 36

987
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
What's good what do you think should be more

988
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Wallace

989
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
I think it's about right

990
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
If any launcher

991
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Italy

992
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Difficult to build a cohort

993
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Sense of camaraderie

994
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
In such a short period

995
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
I was 6:30

996
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
240 PP

997
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Is brown rice a

998
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
Do you feel got to know almost everyone

999
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
I try to be a socialist I could

1000
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
Not only I would say hi

1001
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Relativity

1002
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
Three quarters

1003
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
Then the last question

1004
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
A fun question

1005
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
It you got 10 days for vacation

1006
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
This year

1007
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Where would you want to go

1008
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
I'll go to Israel

1009
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
Is Rose the other Silicon Valley other than Johnson

1010
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,840
Candy and actual Silicon Valley

1011
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
And I was almost going to go on the climb trip

1012
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Now at the beginning of 7:10

1013
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Then there was a terrorist attack

1014
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Buy the farm

1015
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
So

1016
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
Everlog racing

1017
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Whenever I go

1018
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
I read

1019
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Israel

1020
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
My Promised Land

1021
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
About the

1022
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Hold on is it

1023
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,088
And the moment the returning batteries

1024
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
What's right now

1025
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
And I would want

1026
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Thank you very much

1027
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
Go beyond our podcast

1028
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
Professional thank you hands and thanks everyone

1029
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Fraternizing

Digikala

1031
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Thank you

1032
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,240
Now you will hear an interview with another of rggb fellow

1033
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
Oh hun or hon baoding in Chinese

1034
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,152
Went to Harvard for his undergraduate studies and graduated in 2014

1035
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:30,784
And has worked as an engineer at Google as well as at a startup in La before returning to China last year

1036
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Sobo

1037
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,136
Could you tell us more about your background where you're from and why you're here

1038
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,208
Sure yeah I was born in Beijing

1039
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,024
In 1992 and then when I was three

1040
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
We move to Hawaii

1041
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
And I lived in Hawaii for about 7 years

1042
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,728
9 move to Connecticut my first stop in the mainland live there for a year

1043
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
And I went to middle school and high school in Indiana

1044
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
I went to college at Harvard

1045
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,664
And then lived in San Francisco and Los Angeles

1046
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
And then last year in

1047
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,504
July I came back to Beijing

1048
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:07,392
Why so I'm a co-founder and CTO at a tech startup with my cousin

1049
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:12,000
And we're focusing on English education for the 0 to 6 age range

1050
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,400
And currently most of our development happens on WeChat specifically WeChat mini programs or Sceptile

1051
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Why did you apply to Jadoo fellows

1052
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,848
So before most of my life and work experience has been in the US

1053
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,200
So I thought it was a really good opportunity to learn more about Chinese Tech

1054
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,528
And also previously listened to the GV

1055
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Podcast a lot

1056
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Got a lot of that

1057
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,416
I think you're quite special because I have a lot of friends

1058
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
Who spend the vast majority of

1059
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,584
Their life in the US even though they were born in China and they identify with the term ABC

1060
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,656
American Born Chinese even though they were born in China

1061
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
And they may not even

1062
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Speak Chinese

1063
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:58,592
Even though you left China at H3 you're still extremely connected with

1064
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:03,712
Chinese language and culture and still identify as like a Chinese person so

1065
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
Could you talk about why that's

1066
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
The case yes I think

1067
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,136
Most of us are very influenced by our parents

1068
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,720
Then my parents I think are pretty different from most

1069
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:19,840
You know ABCs parents they study the humanities so my dad is a history professor

1070
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,656
My mom study Chinese in college

1071
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
So

1072
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:29,312
From a very young age they really cared about me learning about Chinese history in Chinese language

1073
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,640
I remember as a kid my mom pretty much everyday wood

1074
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Read

1075
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,968
Like the Yuan like textbooks

1076
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
With me

1077
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,296
Even though it was at a slower Pace than

1078
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Black eye normal

1079
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
What Chinese

1080
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Kid

1081
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
But I think even

1082
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
With all of that

1083
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
After coming to China

1084
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,280
I've had to downgrade my

1085
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,912
Sense of my own Chinese ability so before in the US out consider myself like a

1086
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,008
Supposed native speaker coming to China I feel like

1087
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
I'm more of

1088
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
At most like a middle school

1089
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
A level Chinese

1090
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:07,456
I think you're extremely fluent but I think a lot of it is

1091
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
Not language but the

1092
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
The nuances of the culture

1093
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Society

1094
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
You can't get

1095
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
In textbooks

1096
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,488
Also the tongue use their married if so how has the adjustment

1097
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
How long have you been

1098
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,352
Been here so I've been here for about half a year

1099
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,912
Yeah I think the adjustment has been

1100
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
Free easy

1101
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
I think mostly it comes down to the attitude where I'm very interested in Chinese culture and Chinese Tech

1102
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
Changes that have been happening

1103
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
In society

1104
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,224
I think living in the US for so long I

1105
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
I'm just so familiar with

1106
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,064
Us society and US culture

1107
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,136
That it's just really interesting to learn more about

1108
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,696
A different culture but also

1109
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,024
I feel like it's my own culture so out of connecting with my own

1110
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Roots

1111
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
So can you talk about your experience with

1112
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
Did you get fellows like

1113
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,216
After you came and lower your expectations and how did the program

1114
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,008
Yasso

1115
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
I think

1116
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:08,384
Even before ggv fellows I felt slightly overwhelmed because

1117
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
In the group chat you sent like five or six different books in Chinese enough heck

1118
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,832
I read like this

1119
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,648
Book list

1120
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
I started

1121
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,488
I started reading a one of them

1122
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
It's like

1123
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:29,120
An overview of like 2008 to 2000

1124
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:35,520
And then I started kind of timing myself so you know I've read one chapter like how long would it take for

1125
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Finish this book

1126
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,896
That I realize that I couldn't actually finish the five or six flags

1127
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,480
I meant I didn't actually finish that book by the time the event started

1128
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
But I think after

1129
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
Going into like going into the event

1130
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,648
I realize that you know I could follow along and then

1131
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,696
Everyday was really action-packed

1132
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:00,352
But it was kind of like a fire hose of just fire hose style learning really just got to

1133
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,984
Overview of a lot of different Industries and then also companies at various stages even though

1134
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
I think the

1135
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:12,128
Early stage company was still pretty large like series series

1136
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Possibly

1137
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,528
The companies we interact with Warrior course but there were a few that were morally

1138
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Yeah

1139
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
So what was something I left

1140
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
The most impressionable

1141
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,488
Yes I think there's two aspects one is the

1142
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
The actual companies

1143
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,816
That we learned about so I think

1144
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
One of the really interesting companies for me was mocha

1145
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
The co-founder

1146
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,472
He left China I think I was

1147
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Dahlia

1148
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
So he went to Berkeley for college and then most of his work experience was also in the US but he came back to China

1149
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,224
I know I think when he was like 23 or 24 something like that

1150
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,064
And he decided to go into the 2v industries

1151
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
I thought was really

1152
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Interesting

1153
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:00,256
Given that he didn't have a prior experience but it seems like he has a really good attitude toward

1154
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
Like learning

1155
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Just talking

1156
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
A lot of different

1157
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,608
People I think that's a really good

1158
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Skill set to

1159
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
So why did you identify with

1160
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
I think his Outlook is very

1161
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
Like Silicon Valley

1162
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,384
Inspired I think it's just inspiring how he managed to build a company

1163
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
Even though he didn't have like

1164
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
Prior experience

1165
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Area or

1166
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
In China

1167
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,136
So you have worked in Google in Mountain View and also a startup in

1168
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
La

1169
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,464
How would you compare what you saw in the

1170
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
Us like the text-based there verses

1171
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,816
We're seeing here what are the

1172
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
Major

1173
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Difference

1174
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,680
Both just people's attitude and work

1175
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
So I do think in general

1176
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
People

1177
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,408
Well there's there's two aspects to it so one aspect was listening to the ggv podcast I got the impression that

1178
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Every company was very

1179
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,528
996 all the time all the employees were nine and six

1180
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,112
Had a little bit like Sweatshop like

1181
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:04,512
But I think after visiting the company's I've gotten a little more nuanced understanding or like to gvr

1182
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,584
Not judging you but not in sex is more of like a

1183
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Mindset where

1184
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
People are

1185
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
Thinking about

1186
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,216
Work more often then

1187
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
People evaluate I think that stuff

1188
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Play true especially

1189
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Within like

1190
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Co-founders Earl

1191
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Like higher level

1192
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Companies

1193
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,688
They're kind of constantly thinking about

1194
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
You know how to run their company and I think

1195
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,088
Part of that possibly stems from the amount of competition that exist in China

1196
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
We're like

1197
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,160
Once you have someone success for

1198
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,488
Seemingly successful business model you'll have a lot of

1199
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Competition

1200
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,072
That comes in and it seems less the case in soccer

1201
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Valley

1202
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
So what will be our biggest

1203
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
3

1204
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
Rough couple takeaways

1205
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
From Judith

1206
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
What are the interesting takeaways was

1207
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
The other fellows who would have very good job opportunities in the US there very seriously considering quitting

1208
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
China

1209
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
I think that really contrasts with

1210
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
A lot of the

1211
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
People who immigrated to the US in the

1212
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
In the early 90s

1213
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Mason Lake

1214
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Basically my parents generation

1215
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,767
I think the mindset back down was if you

1216
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,351
You could stay in the US

1217
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Say I think

1218
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
I think that's a really good sign

1219
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
Yuan for China that

1220
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727
It's able to attract

1221
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
These people back

1222
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,543
Even better sinus

1223
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
If you're able to attract

1224
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Completely

1225
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:27,199
Like completely different immigrants right think that's a sign of

1226
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
The health of a cup

1227
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
For you

1228
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,807
Do you feel

1229
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,111
You're welcome in China do you feel like it belongs

1230
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Yeah I think so

1231
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
Although the funny thing is in Beijing a lot of people

1232
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:46,143
Ask me like are you Japanese all right. Cuz they listen to my Chinese and they think it's like a little bit off

1233
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,727
But I haven't actually experienced that in southern China maybe it's because

1234
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,079
It's like you just have a different accent

1235
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Yeah

1236
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:59,967
And I think the more someone has spent time in the US interacting with ABC's

1237
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,783
The more they're impressed with my level of

1238
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
Chinese

1239
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:09,439
And then the more someone is actually like completely native Chinese the less they're impressed

1240
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
Your Special K is for our fellow so almost everyone is what we call a highway or overseas return

1241
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,959
Cool probably left China from like 16 to 20 something

1242
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
To attend

1243
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,311
Palo Duro High School or grad school in the US or other countries

1244
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,199
And then they may have worked in the US for a couple years and now considering coming back but you laughed at it really

1245
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,551
So when you were speaking with the other fellows did you feel like

1246
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
You had a different perspective on certain things

1247
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
Then the rest of them

1248
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:46,303
I think so I mean I think for me even though I don't purposefully try to do it and I think so

1249
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,167
Consciously a lot of my thinking is still impacted by kind of American or like Western

1250
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
Ways of thinking

1251
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,471
But I think

1252
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:59,871
Having grown up in a Chinese household as well a lot of the I can understand

1253
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,431
And sympathize with a lot of like Chinese ways of thinking

1254
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
As well

1255
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:08,831
Things that came up that was interesting to me was when we visited face plus plus

1256
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
Yeah so I think

1257
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
There was

1258
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Or there were two

1259
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,047
Other Americans in the group so Fisher and bench and I think they brought up a 7

1260
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Like privacy issues

1261
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
And

1262
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:26,751
I think listening to them talk about like privacy issues I could release some thighs with that as an America

1263
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
At the same time

1264
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,687
As a Chinese I could predict the Chinese response because I I think I live through that

1265
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Yeah yeah yeah

1266
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
I really think that's a gift

1267
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
I think most people

1268
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
Can only lift their life and

1269
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,415
B1 now the other but where

1270
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,207
Living in an age where you can actually

1271
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Peoples

1272
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
Sympathize or empathize with

1273
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
Both sides of the story end

1274
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
Identify with

1275
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
A larger

1276
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:59,263
Set of people that was really one of the biggest

1277
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,079
Takeaways from living in Indiana

1278
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,687
So previously when I was living in the US in Hawaii like

1279
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,807
Hawaii is a very Asian state so like if you're Chinese you're just kind of part of the majority

1280
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Culture

1281
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
And then after moving to Indiana I think

1282
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Even though I

1283
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,327
Grew up as an American people saw me as a Chinese so then I ended up you know having to explain

1284
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
A lot of like Chinese culture and like

1285
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,215
People would have preconceived notions of like what Chinese people are

1286
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,615
And then also like when the 2008 Olympics happened they would ask me oh yeah did you know like the Chinese gymnasts

1287
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,455
Taking their interview stuff like what do you think about that

1288
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
So yeah I think living in

1289
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
The Midwest actually really shaped my identity as well as a Chinese person I think it really reinforced

1290
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
My sense of

1291
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:54,303
Okay maybe I'm not completely American-made maybe if someone grew up in

1292
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,143
San Jose or the bay area where everyone else is an immigrant

1293
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:02,495
That maybe their understanding of what an American is would be very kind of emigrated

1294
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
So was it a difficult

1295
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
Decision for you to

1296
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
To move

1297
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,639
To Beijing because you have not left

1298
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Care for life

1299
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Over a decade

1300
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,759
No it wasn't it wasn't difficult at all

1301
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
I think

1302
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,599
What really helps was the fact that

1303
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,903
My parents had moved back to

1304
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,463
Or they move to Hong Kong in 2012

1305
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,303
So I no longer had any family are in the US

1306
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
And then also coming to Beijing

1307
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:33,471
I'm working on my startup with my cousin so I think just having that family support

1308
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Crossword help

1309
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,567
That also when I was working in the Barrios

1310
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:43,967
And La I was pretty Frugal so I like saved up some money so I think that helped with the risk

1311
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Terrace Park

1312
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
And you see yourself here in

1313
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
At least a few more

1314
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
Yeah yeah as long as I think you know

1315
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,767
Funding doesn't tryouts that's why

1316
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
Could you talk a little bit about the startup

1317
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,935
Yes so we're targeting a026 age range

1318
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
What's the name

1319
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
Oh yeah it's called your mama

1320
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Archery

1321
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
And

1322
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
So we're focused on the 0 to 6

1323
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Age range

1324
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,223
And mostly developing mini programs that foe

1325
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
Focus on content

1326
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
And then also

1327
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,855
Games that center around that contest

1328
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
So trying to

1329
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
Expose

1330
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,439
Chinese kids still like

1331
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
English content and then trying

1332
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
Air Force

1333
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
The concepts

1334
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,351
And you say you're mostly baoding

1335
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
The product around which how many

1336
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Any program

1337
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,519
So that's quite different from what you're used to work on the states did you have to learn everything

1338
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Again

1339
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
I think

1340
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,895
The fundamental programming aspects are

1341
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,479
Pretty much the same no matter what new framework

1342
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
Comes up

1343
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,063
But definitely the details of implementation are

1344
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,367
Are different I had to go through a lot of

1345
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159
Documentation in Chinese

1346
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Which

1347
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
Involved like looking up a lot of

1348
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,279
Words and then also going through like differ

1349
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:05,119
Tutorials and then also learning how developers in China kind of

1350
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,191
Works where do they go when they have questions

1351
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
News about bugs

1352
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
How to how to

1353
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
It's not something

1354
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:16,127
So as long as you're good smart engineer and you can read Chinese it's not a

1355
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
That difficult adjustment

1356
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
Because I think

1357
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,783
Fundamentally most programmers are

1358
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,343
Lazy which is a good thing so

1359
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,743
Whenever you hear this new completely new framework it's usually built around something that kind of exists

1360
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,559
Already because it it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel

1361
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
So like

1362
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
WeChat mini program it

1363
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,679
Kind of sounds like completely new but it's actually built on

1364
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
You know JavaScript

1365
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,031
Wxml which is similar to HTML

1366
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,823
And then also W

1367
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Access

1368
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
As switches like CSS

1369
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,991
So like if you know if you're familiar with web programming it actually

1370
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
Is pretty familiar

1371
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Cool so

1372
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,879
Is there any last words you want to say maybe

1373
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,695
To either or audience or perspective

1374
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
Gdb fellows applicants

1375
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,327
Yes I think given my background I really want to

1376
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
Encourage other

1377
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
You know Chinese Americans are

1378
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471
Members of the Chinese diaspora to really

1379
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
Keep in touch with China you don't understand

1380
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,943
History especially recent history maybe like why your ancestors decided to go abroad

1381
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
I think that's really interesting

1382
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:29,855
I also think from a practical perspective it's really important to learn Chinese

1383
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
Yeah there's a lot of

1384
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
Unexpected

1385
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,999
Opportunities that you can get just from that

1386
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
Language ability

1387
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
I think like

1388
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
When I was in high school

1389
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,679
Never would have expected the Chinese tech industry to have grown

1390
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:50,847
This level and back then I would never have been able to predict that right now I would be in China like working

1391
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,407
In China it's possible because you

1392
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Okay cool thank you

1393
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:05,439
