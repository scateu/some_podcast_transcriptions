When Legend first told you about

00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
The idea of

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Xiaomi

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
I remember it was so cold winter night in Beijing 2010

70
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
That's right it was in late January 2010

Westlake

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304

79
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
I spend I was

80
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
Second person to call in the same week

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
And I met with him in person because I was

82
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Flipping beijing at a time

83
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,712
To talk to him

84
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
And remember in the first

85
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Half an hour I was just

86
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Shock

87
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Of what he wants

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
To do the Hulk there's no

89
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
In history

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Textile apps

91
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
No

92
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
From

93
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
2tb 2.5 g and 3G

94
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
No startup has ever

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Seated

96
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
From scratch

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Stepping up

98
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
So he was trying to do with something that was

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Has never been done before

100
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
The first 30 minutes

101
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Autism shock

102
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,408
Next one hour I have decided that this

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Makes sense

104
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
And they probably have the best thing to do it

105
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Because

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Just a few things that you said

107
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
The first thing you said was that

108
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
In 10 years

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
By 2020

110
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
Smartphone will replace laptop as the

111
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
Most valuable and most commonly used

112
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Computing device

113
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
That people carry along with them every single day

114
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
And the second thing he said was

115
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
2

116
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
Went in this market

117
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,543
The winner has to figure out how to build a brand online

118
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
And sell online

119
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
And listen

120
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Consumers feedback

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Online

122
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
And be able to get away fast

123
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Beijing

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Consumers. Feedback

125
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
He expect on this point by saying that

126
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,695
All the great phones for Motorola Nokia even Android or iPhone

127
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
HTC

128
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
Phone companies don't listen to consumer

129
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Steve Jobs famous for saying that

130
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Consumers dont know what they want

131
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
Let me know what they need

132
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,775
So it's takes a genius to come up with the amazing product in this category

133
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
And they took the opposite of entire approach

134
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
We just that you'll come up with something that's

135
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
Solid

136
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Decent is good

137
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
He welcomes user feedback

138
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
So they can get a ride

139
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Screw up crossword

140
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
And that's

141
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
I think that's the second revolution idea.

142
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
He came up with

143
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
That was interesting

144
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
The third idea was

145
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
What's the fact that to wedding

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
Apply for Math League

147
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
You know you have to be working side Hardware

148
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Have the best

149
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
What's my fashion manufacturer

150
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,823
How to be able to build up some kind of android-based OS

151
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
So you have a chance to do a UI.

152
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
Taylor Swift needs

153
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
Of the local consumers starting with China

154
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
And the first thing you need to do is

155
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
Be able to monetize through internet service

156
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
And now through horror

157
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
The harbor has to be as

158
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
That cheap as possible

159
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,255
That's low-margin possible to get to the heads of the office many users

160
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
As possible

161
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
To make a to make it work

162
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
Those are the three things he said

163
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,447
That I thought were extremely a revolutionary

164
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
That no one else in China had a similar thought

165
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
I.

166
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Point point in time

167
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
Yeah it was designed to be

168
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
More customer-friendly

169
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
Then the existing Hardware player at the time

170
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
And also

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
More

172
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
Internet Service Company in China was willing to

173
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
To what to do

174
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
The people who want to do software only solution

175
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,463
But not many want to do

176
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Combination of all three

177
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
2

178
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,119
I think I'm the second point about show me listening to his users

179
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
My thing is

180
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Pretty revolutionary in that late really really want

181
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
How to befriend

182
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
So

183
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
Xiaomi always says like

184
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
They trade their users as friends as equal

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
And they're not

186
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Saying all you do

187
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
I'm going to make a product

188
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
You're going to like it

189
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
There's a bug I really recommend called Tyga

190
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Was just sent of party

191
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719

Yuan Chang

193
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
Bush talks about how xiaomi

194
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Customer marketing

195
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
It's really impressive how they were able to

196
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
Is it their philosophy is

197
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
Is to build loyalty first before

198
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
Same if they want to have a really deep relationship with their core users before going big

199
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
Crucial to it

200
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Definitely

201
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
And I think the

202
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,903
People overlook this xiaomi had co-founders from Google Microsoft and kingsoft

203
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
And Africans are other Chinese internet companies

204
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
And a lot of the tactics that work

205
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
King from

206
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Co-founders with experience

207
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,239
Operating in China what is from big company or Chinese camp

208
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
Nothing in this area Richelieu by Moines Iowa

209
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Face Mart in putting out

210
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
That hot how you matched

211
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687

212
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Company culture

1

214
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Unique xiaomi culture

215
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Will be the key determinant

216
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
To decide whether xiaomi can be back on

217
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
And I think they can see that that's the most serious thing

218
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
That he did

219
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Once you started

220
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
You make sure that people function well

221
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
As a team and spend a lot of time listen to

222
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Customer feedback

223
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
And astrology Stephanie panel

224
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
After first year of Howard

225
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,543
I think what convinced me to invest in tell me what's that

226
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
Leaving his team was the only team in China

227
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
That had to be

228
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Sulphur Springs from King Saul

229
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
The internet service

230
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Give me experience

231
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Wingstop

232
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
At the unemployed building Springs from Bangkok

233
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
India

00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Almighty Commerce

235
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Prince from

236
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Jojo

237
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Even though it was nobody with strong Harbor experience

238
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,119
Lincoln was able to recruit them build a team overtime to overcome diet

239
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
No one else in China had all five

240
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
So I thought I'd let you have the best shot

241
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
With four out of five attributes

242
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
To a wedding

243
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Is definitely not an easy decision

244
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Or obvious

245
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,271
I think all the people who pass on xiaomi or Leon

246
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Possible autological Right Weezer

247
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Either the prices

248
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Too expensive

249
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Or they wasn't enough

250
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Datapoints show this condition

251
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Can definitely make it

252
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
And Hardware is a difficult

253
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Business

254
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
214 C

255
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Sustainable.

256
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
So for all the people who pass on xiaomi it is

257
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Absolutely

258
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
I can complete weasel mow the lawn

259
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
It is not the puppet show me what does he look at all the

260
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,151
Make a unicorn stuff coming out of China

261
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
The next few months for IPL whether it is a

262
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Make wine or a

263
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Single door

264
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Or what

265
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
Patricia coming out later in the form of a bike dance

266
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
And

267
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,719
TD every single one of them for

268
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Most of the Rams

269
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,143
To pass on them are extremely logical indivisible annual argue

270
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
So

271
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
To make you suffer from calls

272
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
And make those spots

273
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
Why you have to believe that founder has a right Vision the right direction next

274
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
Into that the market is changing

275
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
The favorite a new way of doing

276
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
And then three remaining cases

277
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
Iskcon players must not get it

278
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
And not be able to adjust

279
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
To give newcomers to the opportunity

280
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
To make this rock

281
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
Destruction happened possible

282
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,791
The lava comes out to judgment because you know the founder

283
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
And Wellness

284
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
Carmen. He was she has a right attributes

285
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
To take advantage

286
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Market opportunities

287
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
And I didn't date you cannot doesn't take off

288
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,591
If you don't like doesn't make enough impact in China

289
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
In the awesome world

290
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
It is not possible these Apple

291
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
Bridget loves can make a war

292
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Till now we have a saying this.

293
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Because we're betting on China is going to be

294
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Different

295
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,903
Because we're not betting on internet is going to change China improve China

296
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
Therefore you should bet on Founders

297
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Who has the most

298
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Audacity

299
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Biggest change pasa

300
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Guess that the few of them that can make it work

301
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
We'll have to check and see how come

302
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
I think they can get a calculation on

303
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Personiv xiaomi the window

304
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
But you're a little late at night and I participated

305
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
The first one investment xiaomi at IPO

306
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Not sweet

307
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
Yielded 866 tax return

308
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,039
So don't take that risk

309
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,367
With the dishes are found early on

310
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
It's not possible

311
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
To make stock return if you're very rational and reasonable

312
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,535
The room for return on Fortune Wheel

313
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,679
So you have appeared in the present number of times talking about xiaomi and I've noticed

314
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,751
One question that a lot of us reporters asses

315
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,543
How does xiaomi compare to Apple

316
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
I guess they always try to find a xiaomi equivalent

317
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Us in a closes

318
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
Stay single visible because of the smartphone does

319
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
So what

320
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Why do you think people should

321
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Stop comparing xiaomi

322
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
If not Appleton

323
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Which company do thing is

324
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
The closest

325
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
When will the

326
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Question I've heard from you

327
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
American Audio

328
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Obviously

329
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
You're very smart investors in general

330
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Investing in Taco Bell

331
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Decades

332
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
When the first question I heard was that

333
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
So

334
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
Xiaomi a has a party system so how is it compatible to Android

335
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
4

336
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Show me all the last

337
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
The years

338
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
It is amazing how

339
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Even smart investors

340
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Like to use

341
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,439
Eno

342
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
And put on top of

343
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Companies from Emerging Markets

344
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
And think.

345
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
What is

346
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Similar to the other

347
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,447
It's very difficult for any investor to fully understand

348
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Xiaomi model witch

349
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Uniquely Chinese

350
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,359
Besides that listen to Consumers and therefore not presume they know what consumers want

351
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Quick weekend getaways

352
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
2

353
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
Meet and exceed

354
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Exploitation of consumers

355
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
I like people look at xiaomi Revenue source

356
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Some things I hate 7% come from the hallway

357
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
Another 10% come from Smart Home Appliances

358
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
An opportunist seems to be growing in 2018

359
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
Baby stuff for 3 months

360
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
2017

361
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
So it's a hardware company

362
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,655
Two people for people who haven't tracked xiaomi that's a very easy

363
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
Unfortunately most of the smart investor

364
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
What is in Hong Kong or us or elsewhere

365
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Have not come through

366
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Rise of middle-class

367
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
Or upgrade

368
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Consumption

369
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
Assumption in in in China or two

370
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Japan

371
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Or even in Taiwan

372
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
Whenever people and large middle class

373
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
Rice

374
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
And going through ovulation in one

375
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
Resume the end up buying Brands they Trust

376
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
And I grow up

377
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,167
What is with Uniqlo and in Japan in the 90s

378
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Or some some throughout the 90s and 200s

379
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Mm

380
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
In

381
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
In the US

382
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,639
Whether it is HEC in Taiwan

383
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
You got people end up

384
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,527
Growing up at what are you mainly in the u.s. in the 80s with with gap

385
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,367
And then most recent last 10-15 years with Zara and H&M

386
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Consumers Cooperative

387
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
The end up buying more from now brand

388
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Muji is not a good example, out of Japan

389
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
So what's wrong he has done is

390
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Is becoming a brand.

391
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Customer first light

392
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Pics of a phone

393
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,983
That ends up liking experience spent a lot of time on the internet

394
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Through the xiaomi phone

395
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,847
Stand up and show me TV and other smart home appliances from xiaomi

396
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
WinCo's Wasabi story we're going to a

397
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Outlet mall

398
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
You stop buying can help with overtime to submit a new pot to come out each month

399
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
I probably xiaomi ecosystem company

400
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,671
I'm going there often and as such

401
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,975
And don't spend more time out xiaomi app

402
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,303
The most popular example public show me a video

403
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
So when that happens

404
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
UFC of liking effect

405
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Faster growth

406
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
Hardware first

407
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
What comes later in each cohort

408
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
You some more users will end up spending time my shopping app

409
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Thereafter

410
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
They sound very good at building an application app

411
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Not take the best of

412
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Content Pro

413
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,599
Related areas and put under the platform and build a business around it

414
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,927
Is so. Internet service impact will come later

415
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,255
Any needs have user use multiple camionera products

416
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
To to to get them to want to use those

417
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
So what what the

418
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
Public buses haven't had a chance to see

419
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,263
Is the lagging effect that will happen with more crap from internet services

420
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
The only time will tell

421
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
The proof that this is right

422
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
Is what we see from looking at a core data

423
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
But I think over time

424
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
Smart pop investors will learn

425
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
That is a different kind of company that what they're used to

426
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
I was right

427
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
One of the xiaomi co-founders

428
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
Let's compare xiaomi's business model to that of a small restaurant

429
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
So they sell food that's kind of

430
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
The smartphone but they really make the money for

431
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Vim tips

432
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
Fish comes from

433
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,423
Crack and a lot of people forget that

434
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
For any pure internet service companies

435
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
People have the growth hack

436
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
Meaning that you got to figure out ways to grow user base

437
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
Through mechanism

438
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
That you have to spend money on

439
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
Calculate LTV versus cock

440
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
To figure out what is a good way to scale your user base

441
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
It's a painful user show me Ashley

442
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,903
Gets paid at least 5% gross margin if not more

443
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Off to hot where to get users

444
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
So there in that Services actually has a

445
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
Has a negative cock

446
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Is it a positive pack

447
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
To grow users by getting paid for it

448
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
Is it a hundred people use

449
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,055
It's a very different model than almost any other internet service companies out there

450
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
So if if this is sustainable

451
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,967
And there to make sure it is symbol is through having a lot more Harbor products out there

452
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
Study middle class

453
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Consumer family can buy

454
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
In in in in the US.

455
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Froyo of horror device

456
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
To get paid for crying users

457
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
Solana unit services

458
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Siskin Steel

459
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Are there after

460
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,351
So it's a very different model 1 people you eard their people used to

461
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,911
Investing overtime people see if

462
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
If it doesn't work out

463
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Was some of us

464
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Would you compare xiaomi

465
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Emoji

466
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Given

467
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
View of a shelf

468
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
And how it's more

469
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
Adopting the concept of

470
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
New retail

471
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,247
Stephanie elements armuchee in Uniqlo

472
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,831
In a different field in the 4 for xiaomi

473
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
There's definitely elements of

474
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
Costco model of basically

475
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Description

476
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
Plus very low cost

477
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
To make sure no more

478
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Products are affordable

479
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
By the rising

480
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,447
The defin elements of Amazon in there as a papa

481
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Myself

482
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
Many many Pollocks

483
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Bielenberg Focus

484
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
At delivering Superior experience

485
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Tuatara music

486
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
So what they doing

487
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
, in a team have come up with

488
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
Is a mixture of different models

489
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
The itis

490
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Core

491
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
Is figuring out how to

492
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
Beat a customer's best friend in

493
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Olympics first

494
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
Exceed a consumer

495
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Expectation

496
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
And I think in his

497
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
7 words

498
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
Internet

499
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Prodigy

500
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,167
A being focus of being

501
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Focus on delivering Superior experiences

502
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
By focusing on

503
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Delivering water mouth

504
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
Possum Word of Mouth impact and being extremely fast

505
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
These four terms

506
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
Michelada

507
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
I think the lesson here is that

508
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
It's not possible to take a shortcut and

509
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Find a US equivalent

510
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Live forever

511
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
In China or every emerging market

512
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
A lot of times

513
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
There is no cumpli equivalent and

514
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
We just need to take the time to understand the

515
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
How they really were

516
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,167
And I only have a Chinese company also

517
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
About any company with new business

518
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Facebook IPO was

519
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,543
At $30 a share and

520
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
Within the first 6 months after IPL you went down to $19

521
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
And I'll today is over $300 this year

522
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,551
Sew-in for years people learn that it is very different model than what they used

523
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
I remember back in 2008 2009

524
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Who put on Facebook

525
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
I think that is a company is given us why put out out

526
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
Is not as profitable as Google and never will be as popular

527
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
That's Google

528
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,935
Therefore it's a very easy even for a smart investor in the world to miss

529
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Of something that's

530
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
And the fact that xiaomi

531
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
The primary Market is in Asia

532
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
Makes it harder for a US investor

533
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
William Hung Ambassador

534
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
To truly understand

535
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
The only time can show

536
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
That it is say yes Superior a model

537
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,391
But when you look at how China has expanded over the last few years

538
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,791
Now there I'm on the top phones not only in China but also number one India in n673 other come

539
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Self

540
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
The penetration is a lot faster

541
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
And deeper than we all thought it was possible

542
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
If we look at number of interviews

543
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
Xiaomi online

544
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
The next 1.5 billion users

545
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
Becoming online between now and 20

546
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
20:30

547
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
Most of that growth

548
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
What come from the

549
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,015
74 countries that xiaomi is

550
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Skin already

551
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
So I'm

552
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,879
I love you ask me about what a Chinese come to the US or not

553
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
I think

554
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Completely missed the point

555
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
Not the crow is coming from

556
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Existing countries

557
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
The song He's already

558
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Show me causes Salva internet

559
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
Allow people are scam

560
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
Article of that term

561
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
Why what how would you convince

562
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
People that show me isn't internet

563
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Could you elaborate on some of

564
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Internet services

565
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,967
Show me has a prospectus Dimension that has over

With each of them with the monthly active users

00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575

Over 10 million in monthly ad

573

Beneath these are amazing numbers

574
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Any aggregate

575
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655

A company in the world

580
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
I think the most popular when people know

581
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
It's probably xiaomi

582
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Tommy video

583
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783

He doesn't license content from anyone

586
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,719
What it does is

587
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Abacus counting from

588
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559

The content

592
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Yeah and

593
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Whenever I use a click

594
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
On a video

595
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,871
In xiaomi video it takes you to the content from

596
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Its partners

597
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
But within the app itself

598
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
So that you can have more

599
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
Immigrant experience

600
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
EMP charges advertising Revenue

601
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
And also

602
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
From the user

603
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,000
So it makes money in multiple ways from different stakeholders

604
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,608
And it should I Revenue with some with his Partners to provide the original a video content

605
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
So you can focus on providing the most

606
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Comprehensive

607
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
Collection of content

608
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
To that user

609
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
At the same time

610
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
So far they don't have to spend much money on the card in the content themselves

611
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
If we go way to coexist

612
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Without a content

613
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Producers

614
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
So is a good way to build build a ecosystem

615
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
To provide better service in

616
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,928
People can make

617
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
They're sure of the

618
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Of the money as well

619
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Does a very good way to

620
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
Duke to outgrow business

621
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
And they're playing a philosophy

622
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,680
In other categories as well not just the outside of China

623
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,752
In the process of doing so we also become switching ambassador

624
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
NBC service provider so they work with

625
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
In situ xiaomi invested early

626
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,944
And so it was able to grow with Chachi

627
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,040
As well and they're doing that not just in China but also in Benny of the

628
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,344
Other 73 countries are there in

629
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
So

630
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Again

631
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
Parting bastard haven't seen this ghost

632
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
System approach

633
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,048
And from our experience of investing in China since the 2000

634
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
We know that

635
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
If a country take off an internet makes an impact

636
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,264
Many of the top in the compass in the country will have tremendous growth

637
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
So show me what when multiple ways

638
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
As we stopped up the investing and building an ecosystem

639
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
Egypt country

640
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
So I wanted to talk about the IPO is

641
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,760
Myself and devaluation

642
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
The pricing

643
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
So if there were a lot of fluctuations on

644
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
On the first day and

645
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Do you think

646
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Xiaomi was

647
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
Had a reasonable pricing and

648
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
What would you expect

649
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:01,120
I think over the last two weeks has shown that xiaomi stock price has steadily risen

650
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
Now surround party 21

651
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
I think

652
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,312
Whatever the short-term fluctuations was the first day or so

653
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Heading all black

654
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
2 weeks

655
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
That's totally fine end up being the high enough

656
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
Heading about pricing at the Lord of the Rings

657
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:21,088
Makes it easier for investors to believe in the in the in the end of the story

658
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
Inn at Reading volume a lot

659
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
To show that

660
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
Nonis the volume

661
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
Reasonable

662
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
Stock price also

663
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,352
But I think we should be looking at a longer-term

664
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,680
How strongly will continue to grow based on the

665
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,472
The twins that I mentioned earlier

666
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
So

667
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
We always think that IPO

668
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
It's just a blip or a mouse

669
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
I need a day

670
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
You got to be

671
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
Can you look up the business at UW

672
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Oprah larger

673
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Continue to grow in

674
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,856
And looking out of Facebook on Google and Apple

675
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
In

676
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Alibaba and tencent

677
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
All the great companies out there

678
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
Show. So that's the way to

679
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Crave audio

680
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Overlocker.

681
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,216
What's one question about xiaomi that you wish you were asked

682
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
But you're never

683
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
I think a lot of people don't understand

684
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
What some ecosystem means

685
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
Boating terms of

686
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Highway code

687
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
And then

688
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Internet service

689
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
People don't know they have it

690
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,368
Correct and think I think going back in China

691
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
Over last decade

692
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Wer

693
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,280
The fortune of beat having a front-row seat

694
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Does ecosystem form in China

695
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,656
What is in the form of tencent invest in gaming companies around the world

696
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
And

697
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
E-commerce players in

698
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
China

699
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
Or Alibaba

700
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Ambassador

701
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,872
Incompetence in the ultra-space

702
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
And I pardoned some of them

703
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Or

704
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,504
Companies like make why not become a super app

705
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Implementing

706
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
And WeChat

707
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
Do we not doing this and see how we became the same

708
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
Let a lot of content providers

709
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Nice to be on top of their popcorn

710
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
This kind of ecosystem were

711
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
Seems that * company learned and tried

712
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,728
Through four generations of 14 regions of Entrepreneurship in in China

713
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
I just realized

714
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
10 13 years

715
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
And we are very fortunate to see that happen

716
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
And getting up

717
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Perspective

718
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
So when we start investing

719
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
In Southeast Asia in

720
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,832
Yeah us or even like a marathon in Europe maybe down the road

721
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
The perspective of a building

722
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Assistant company I think 10

723
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
Replicated expended

724
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
Where is it happening with

725
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Uber learning from

726
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
B20 do you want to be a super app

727
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,424

728
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Income is like a line

729
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
And others

730
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
And that does services

731
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Ecosystem

732
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
I think more companies should learn from that

733
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
And have a better chance of

734
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,968
Becoming a bigger company not on their own but also help other countries grow with them

735
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
In over last 10-15 years

736
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
Web snap extremely profitable

737
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
Inbody creating for

738
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Chinese

739
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
So those are great lessons I hope.

740
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,072
Are are willing to consider and we'll be happy to help

741
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
Sing the best way to appreciate your music

00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
By visiting

743
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Xiaomi store

744
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
UCI notches phones

745
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,848
Laptops in TVs for also

746
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Rice cookers

747
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Air purifiers

748
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
Segway headphones

749
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Bags umbrellas

750
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Etcetera

751
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:34,112
These are all products made by companies I shall be invested and it helps that late when used to be an angel

753
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,744
I just want to see the hundred plus different kind of products inside each shopping store

754
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,816
It's amazing that xiaomi itself only makes three products

755
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
The phone to the TV

756
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Laptop

757
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
Everything else is made by another company

758
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
