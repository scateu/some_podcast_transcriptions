00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
First of all it's the growth of the company

55
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,912
When I joined a company we only had about 500 million market cap

56
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
And today we're exceeding 20 billion

57
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776

When I joined a company C trip is only

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,368
Are there a small Chinese online travel company

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392

77
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160

Plays to freezer X

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752

00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
They want to

84
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Preserve the option of working

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360

All for their career path

93
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
I'm going to take the interview to earlier age

94
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Earlier point in time

95
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
When you went to us

96
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
You've already in college

97
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
In China

98
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Why did Stella go to us for business

99
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
You start with the law school first

100
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
And then you went to us

101
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Business School

102
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Why did you decide to do that

103
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
And also said go to us for

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,647
Yeah when I first came to the United States I was a sophomore in Peking University Law School

105
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Indict

106
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,303
Chinese system law school integrated system

107
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
States

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Law school is accredited school

109
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:58,239
So my original plan was to go to the business school first

110
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,615
And then go to law school next and get my Ph.D to set up the third step

111
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
But right after I graduate

112
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
I can't be good Chinese

113
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
Graduate student wants to make her parents proud

114
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063

Yeah we are very blessed for the opportunity because when we went to school

136
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
The cultural revolution ended

137
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
And when we went to

When there was only 46 employees in a company

144
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
And then

145
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591

146
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175

You always talk to the engineers to Alibaba I try to help out

168
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
As much as possible

169
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919

00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,247
Always see Jack as a very good friends of ours

171
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
I tried to be helpful

172
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
And I remember one day

173
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
John Carter phone call from Jack

174
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671

187
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:42,495
Self banking St 220 million in a company

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
So when y'all joined he told me

189
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Alcohol only had $5 left in the bank

190
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
So

191
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
Yes it has been a long way and we're extremely proud of

192
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Achievement

193
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
Alibaba team has achieved

194
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,767
And how big was sitra when you joined and what made you believe in

195
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
The ski trip vision

196
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
Yeah I also asked myself

197
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
Well first of all I ask

198
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
History questions

199
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
A force of 4

200
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
Should I

201
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Invest my youth

202
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
United States in China

203
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,223
And at that time USA the GDP growth rate was about

204
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
2%

205
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
And China was growing anywhere between 8 to 10%

206
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,903
So when the economy is growing so fast

207
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,207
It presents a lot of opportunities

208
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
For the unemployed

209
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:41,119
So when I joint secret pie become one of the youngest CFO in the market

210
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
So that's the first question

211
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Should you

212
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,775
Remain to be in the USA or do you want to go back to

213
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
China

214
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
The second question is

215
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
If you want to invest in China

216
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Which industry

217
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
I will give you a very good opportunity

218
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Squirrel

219
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
And

220
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
I always tell myself if I join

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Company

222
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Alcohol

223
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Company

224
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
You can make a lot of money

225
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
But in a way it's not very healthy

226
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Reitzel

227
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,703
I tried to tell myself that I need to join a company

228
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
That is

229
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Fairway healthy

230
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
A Dairy Queen

231
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
Happiness to the peephole so I believe

232
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Kabul

233
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,687
I'm not only a great happiness

234
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
Stream videos to family

235
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
Let young kids learn

236
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
It also brings Global p

237
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
When we travel around the world

238
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
So I choose

239
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Invest my

240
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
Time and energy in my used

241
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Bolinas

242
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,679
And DeSoto question is if you want to invest yourself

243
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Travel industry

244
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Which company has

245
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
The best opportunity to win

246
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
It'll when I talk to I like him

247
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
I feel very

248
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,735
Strong that this company is very humble down to earth

249
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Hard-working

250
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
And they have the best opportunity to weigh

251
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647
And so these are the three things I considered

252
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
When I

253
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Decide

254
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Two Joints each other as the CFO of the

255
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
So it has been

256
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
A very good day

257
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Pack

258
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Phony

259
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
What was it like to transition from

260
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
CFO to CEO and then

261
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
CEO

262
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,567
What kind of lessons did you learn about how these leadership function

263
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Can work together

264
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Yeah

265
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
When I was a CFO of the company was very small

266
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
But grow very fast

267
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
So whatever

268
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
That is not taken care of by

269
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
Elevation of teams I would have just too jumpy and a fix

270
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
A couple of years

271
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Our board

272
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
Feels that I already was doing this year olds position

273
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
So they promoted me to be a clo

274
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
And then three years ago when James talk to me

275
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,615
And he wanted me to take on more responsibility as the CEO of the company

276
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,455
And I told him that we just finished two major deals

277
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
When was Elio when was Chennai

278
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
And I thought our team this

279
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
Stabilized

280
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
The finished

281
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
The mergers and acquisitions

282
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,767
Before I took responsibility so I waited for year

283
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,607
And then two years ago we made a very smooth transition

284
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
To see your position

285
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
Shuffle me micros track

286
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Istat

287
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
I already see what else needs to be done

288
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,431
And without the title I was already doing a lot of

289
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Oddities

290
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
So far away yeah

291
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,135
Adidas Team my advice to them is always

292
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
Costco

293
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
And invest

294
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,535
You have time and energy in the next level

295
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
And then

296
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Us-10 out

297
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,447
So my title my scope is never a limit

298
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
On what I do

299
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:02,079
Whatever is good for the company I would just jumping and look at it.

300
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
People outside of China have

301
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Stereotype

302
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Of how Chinese

303
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Women

304
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
And yet you were among the very first

305
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
The runs

306
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Major Chinese

307
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Internet come

308
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
In the major internet company worldwide.

309
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
What

310
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Kind of challenge

311
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Did you have to overcome

312
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
In order to be

313
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Come

314
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
In such apus

315
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Opportunities

316
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
To prove yourself

317
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
To show that you can

318
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
I think it's a female leader

319
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
I tried

320
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
To be authentic

321
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
I think a female as themselves has lots of

322
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Stress

323
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
You don't have to act

324
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
SML

325
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271

A couple of our strengths so we have is that Forza 4

329
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
We always put the team first

330
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
I never

331
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Very welding to make

332
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Personal sacrifice

333
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
In order for the team to

334
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
And I think that's so great strength

335
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Will you become

336
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
High level

337
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Executive

338
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Cocina company

339
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
The second thing is

340
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,639
Females are also very good ways

341
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Putting yourself in others shoes

342
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
So when I mean that you go Shay Shay

343
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
I always try to see

344
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
For this deal

345
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
What

346
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
We can brain to the other side

347
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
If I were the other side

348
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
What they would like to have

349
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Right

350
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
So if you

351
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
To your selfie

352
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
People shoes

353
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
It's very good for you to make a deal

354
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,751
That is when we rather than I kill you or you kill me

355
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Coincide

356
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,895
And the food thing I feel female reader that's very strong

357
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Is the communication

358
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
And Computing skills

359
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
So a lot of times

360
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Weather sensitive

361
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
We understand what

362
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
The teams need

363
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Instead of

364
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,999
I just focusing on Wednesday we try to

365
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
Bring to the table

00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
A comprehensive solution

367
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
So that

368
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,703
The team's career path

369
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Company's interest

370
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
Shareholders interests

371
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055

I will take

373
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
So I think a female leaders

374
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Have inherited

375
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Strength

376
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
And we have to

377
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,087
Are use our strengths to be successful in the business world

378
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,671

Yeah the schedule is very demanding so I tried

381
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
To get to the office

382
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
At around 7

383
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
To 7:30

384
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
So I finished all my

385
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Homework

386
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,407
In my direct report if I eat to have while on with my director poet

387
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,247
Normally I invited for breakfast meeting at 8

388
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063
Ephraim 9 my

389
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Schedule is back to back

390
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Half an hour for meeting

391
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
He's back to back

392
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
All the way until

393
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
Maybe 6 to 7

394
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047
And in the evening I tried to

395
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Show the work papers I need to read

396
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
And bring it home if I'm not traveling

397
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
I tried to have dinner with

398
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
My family

399
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,103
I want a kiss like young I tried to help them with the homework

400
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
I know they're old enough

401
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
So when I'm working there doing their homework

402
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
And from 9

403
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
2

404
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
12 a.m. or 1 a.m.

405
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
I schedule my overseas

406
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Europe was United

407
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Space with NASA

408
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Etc

409
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
So

410
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
That's how I try to

411
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
To balance my work

412
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
And life

413
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Do you work 5 days a week

414
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Or more than

415
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
More than that

416
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,823
China in 96

417
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
Meeting from 9 to 9

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Time 6

419
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Bass

420
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,039
A lot of them is a lot of

421
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
7-Eleven 7

422
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
The 7:00 to 11 p.m. 7 days

423
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
So some of the listeners

424
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Like to ask a question

425
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
How can you be efficient when you work long hours

426
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
So implied in that question

427
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
You can either be

428
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Efficient

429
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Or

430
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
You're being efficient

431
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
In your mind

432
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
How to tell

433
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Menards

434
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Become efficient

435
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Insta

436
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
Yeah I think efficiency is very poor

437
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,015
So I tried to

438
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Run

439
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,087
Half marathon on the weekend

440
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,463
Every year my husband and I tried to join two marathons a year

441
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
So

442
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Healthy is staring

443
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
The second thing is also

444
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,983
To train your team so that they can be

445
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
A sufficient Sur

446
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,359
Understood lay is a range of time

447
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Otherwise

448
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
So when I'm in the car

449
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
I tried to

450
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Listen to a book

451
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
I when I'm in the office I try to

452
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
You know arranged in BTS

453
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
So there is no more than to waste

454
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
Could you tell us about the baby tiger program as C trip to encourage internal initiatives and how do you make sure

455
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:16,191
Your overarching goals of the company are effectively communicated to all your employees

456
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,031
Yes it's a company is growing bigger and bigger

457
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,359
We consistently think about what is the best

458
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
That's the way

459
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
To energize the company

460
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
So when

461
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
Initiative so we took is the baby tiger

462
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
So basically our employees are encouraged

463
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,671
To bring new ideas new business plan

464
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
To us

465
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
And we'll give them fundings

466
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Personnel Resources

467
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,839
And then let them to innovate

468
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,679
So for example when not their employees

469
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
She is very young

470
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
Right now he is only 26 years old

471
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,615
And he is the CEO of gesine which is

472
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
It's a cream

473
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Business unit

474
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,295
I'm so we give him you know he wants to do

475
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,367
Eustis business unit anchor

476
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
And then at your tickets

477
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
To attend

478
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
At hotel business

479
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
He's only 26 years old

480
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
So

481
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
When we ask

482
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
How much money

483
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
How long

484
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,191
He needs and he says you know I need

485
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
2 million RMB 6-6

486
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
People to improve

487
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567

490
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
And it only took

491
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
What nice

492
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,807
To prove that the volume exceeded 10000 per day

493
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,647

494
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927

495
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Successful Young

496
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255

Analeigh tip

499
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
And we want to encourage our young employees

500
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
To step up

501
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Take on more responsibility

502
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
But in the last 40 years

503
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Message of Jonah company

Personally

511
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
6 7 days a week

512
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
Yeah a couple of things I think

513
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Forza 4

514
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
I have

515
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
Two young kids

516
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
And I think

517
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Mothers

518
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,863
Are the best role models for their children

519
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
I cannot

520
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Tell them

521
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
To study hard

522
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
To be independent

523
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
And meanwhile

524
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,799
I'm relying

525
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
My husband

00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,383
Not to where I can watch MTV

527
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
So I think

528
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Few

529
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711

How to be independent

00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
Fathers and mothers

533
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
The best role models

534
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
For them

535
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
Secondly I think I'm

536
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
So so blessed

537
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,023

00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Ida Price

576
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
That becomes

577
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
10x

578
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
As big as

579
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Today's hits

580
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
So you feel that is

581
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
This is your calling

582
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Strong sense of

583
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Sabine.

584
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
So

585
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Tigres made money

586
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Switching basketball

587
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Into

588
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Very startup

589
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
In China and outside

590
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
Including busting

591
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
Did you prefer go to ja

592
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Merging

593
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Did we go to Nar

594
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
And many other

595
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
How do you say no problem

596
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
He also invested

597
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,496
Companies that just make my trip India

598
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
As well as boom supersonic

599
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
In the US

600
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Can you talk about

601
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Examples of

602
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Obscenities that he hoped

603
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
The cheap

604
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
Holy smokes Batman

605
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
And how did you

606
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Decide that you want to make

607
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Investments

608
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Beyond

609
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
China

610
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
That what you look for in these startups

611
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
When you

612
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Vancomycin

613
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,208
Yeah we heard very high standard

614
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Chippewa

615
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Acquisition Target

616
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,840
Are there was three principles we adhere to

617
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,936
The first one is if needs to closely related

618
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
To trouble in this

619
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
There are a lot of opportunities

620
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
Outside

621
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
Humble but we are very

622
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
A much focused on the Travel industry

623
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,552
The second thing is we only I interested to a making investment in the Winger's

624
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
Number one or number two in each row

625
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
So how do we make

626
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Tin Anniversary Inn

627
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
Zoe Massey winners

628
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
And the sad thing is

629
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
No matter how good a company is

630
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
Evaluation needs to make sense

631
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
So it's very difficult for us to make a move because we are looking for another

632
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
YouTube

633
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Are ridiculous

634
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
So if you look at our investment wing on which is the number one Travel Agency in Hong Kong

635
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
6 years

636
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
To finally close the deal

637
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,440
It was during the financial crisis

638
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,256
When we took the opportunity and made it

639
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,608
If you look at our investment Inc

640
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
Again it was during the financial

641
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,008
Crisis in 208 and 209.

642
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
So a lot of company if they're so good

643
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
We need to be

644
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
Sarah patience

645
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,456
We need to be confident

646
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,576
That one plus one equals five Thai Palace

647
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Synergy

648
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
Sissy trip is a travel company the business

649
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
Is inherently global

650
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:37,376
So in the fourth quarter of 2018 revenue generated from international business accounted for a 30 to 35%

651
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
One of the company's total revenue

652
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
What do you hope that number to be in

653
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
Five years in which region would you prioritize as you go global

654
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
Yes in 5 years I hope the

655
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,248
Pie will be 50% to domestic at 50%.

656
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,832
We move to the global places very methodically

657
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
So at the beginning

658
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,208
We only do Chinese people travel with in China

659
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
And the second is that P is

660
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
Chinese people

661
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Trouble with eating

662
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
The Great China area

663
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
And a soda step

664
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
Is Chinese people

665
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
To Asia

666
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
And then the rest

667
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,592
So we pretty much finished

668
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
The Chinese people album

669
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
The layout

670
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
For Chinese people album

671
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
Now we're looking at

672
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
The flooring people

673
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Travel to China

674
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,624
Because I won't even tour in China is very strong

675
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
Product offering is Farrakhan

676
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Comprehensive

677
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
And the last

678
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Step

679
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Probably will be

680
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Ford Ranger forum

681
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
So

682
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Offering person

683
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
Safariland

684
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
I so we will make our move

685
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
Very massage

686
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Every year

687
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
To achieve the

688
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Best

689
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
Successful

690
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
Willow China outbound travel

691
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,456
I'm going to wrap up

692
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
2018

693
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
/ 140 million

694
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Well travel Over

695
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Let's collect

696
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
We spent over hard

697
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
20 billion dollar

698
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Us total

699
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,464
Harvard inventory from China is

700
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Much smaller

701
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
Only 30 million

702
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
It only a fifth of those

703
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Stuff from outside

704
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
China

705
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
How important do you think

706
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Inbound tourism

707
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
440

708
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
And what kind of

709
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Efforts

710
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
That makes sense

711
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
To help China

712
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
Is your desk

713
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,040
I think China offers a great offering

714
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
For the following friends

715
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:37,184
So we work very closely with the government try to increase and attract

716
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
The amount of customers

717
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
There are a couple of things

718
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
We can do with stuff

719
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Element

720
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
Perciful we need to make

721
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
Visa application

722
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
So you know have an app

723
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Mobile

724
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Maybe will be much better

725
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Captain heading to foreign friends

726
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Lining up

727
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
In the embassy

728
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
Encompasses

729
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
How are you

730
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
So that's a first date

731
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
The second thing is The Rock

732
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
From

733
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
San Francisco

734
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Go to China from linden tree

735
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
The sad thing is

736
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,000
Having a China welcome program

737
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
So well

738
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
People enter into China

739
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
We need to make sure there are English signs

740
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
People feel they are very welcome

741
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,752
And I think that if we focus

742
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
Which would interest the four in France

743
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
I will be able to make

744
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
Make a great mood

745
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,064
What is your advice to younger people with cross cultural backgrounds who have lived across both us in

746
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm trying to adjust like yourself

747
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,952
I always tell my children that you

748
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
You would have to be

749
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
Successful they need to look at

750
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Christopher

751
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
What's they are passionate

752
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
You can be a lawyer

753
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,984
You can be here cutter but whatever you do

754
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,264
You need to feel passionate

755
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
And try to be the best

756
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
Your verdict

757
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896
Please send me your city

758
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Passion is very poor

759
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,272
The second is he is what they're good at

760
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
So if you have

761
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Eileen go by

762
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
Cultural background

763
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
That's for real

764
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
I think it is

765
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
Kids will have very good opportunities

766
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
Doing business

767
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
English speaking

768
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
Countries as well as Chinese Peking

769
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448

Touchy subject

833
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
With them

834
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248

To navigate

839
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Yeah I think

840
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,720
China is growing so fast

841
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,280

Used

844
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
Was very good

845
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
Chinese like

846
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,984
Yao Ming when he was 10

847
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,128
He was already much taller than anybody else

848
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
Right so if you expect

849
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
Teenager y'all means behave like an adult

850
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552

852
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
But he is learning

853
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:55,488
My Chinese learning Chinese culture is a little bit more reserved

854
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
Then the American culture

855
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
A little teeny kids

856
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632

00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,968
Should learn to be a global citizen very fast

860
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Because

861
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,040
Much is given much is expected

862
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
As the second largest economy in the world

863
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,696
Are the government the community to schools

864
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,792

I manage that

868
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Expectation

869
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
But on the other hand

870
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Africa

871
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848

Going to study in the USA

879
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,304

888
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
Country

889
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
But the

890
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Country

891
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272

892
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
Missing us a little bit more try to understand

893
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,928
Mm a years of confusion setting

894
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
Then I think

895
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,024
A lot of misunderstanding yba-11

896
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
And I'm very

897
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Blessed by the APA

899
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
To have

900
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,056
The opportunity to study in a reverse Queen China and also to study and work in the USA

901
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,640
And I very much like to be a good Bridge 40

902
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
I think travel also plays a big

903
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Rolin

904
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
Enhancing. Neutron

905
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,392
We just launched a new product

906
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Today

907
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Quote that Romeo

908
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
Mini

909
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Lost

910
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
The summer my husband and I took our children

911
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
To visit Italy

912
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:13,216
So when we were in Rome we taught them about the Roman history

913
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
How to kids

914
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
So with the Wolfpack

915
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
The city

916
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,616
And then we took them to the

917
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,176
Sinsemilla the middle evil times

918
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
And we put them about the reform in a religion

919
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,296
Flores

920
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
And we taught them about the Renaissance

921
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
So when I come back

922
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,696
The kids just to learn so much

923
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Along the way

924
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,768
So the Confucius teachings

925
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
It is better

926
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,120
To travel 10000 Mi Venturi

927
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Pencils in a book

928
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Came back

929
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
I talked to our products

930
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
And I thought

931
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
Did they were so much

932
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Education

933
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,592
All we can do along the way

934
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
So we launched a product

935
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
And we will have

936
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
Professors experts

937
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
Destination

938
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
And before we send it to his children wear

939
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Let them read these books

940
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,720
And then let them touch it when they come back they can share their stories

941
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
What they see the pictures

942
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
And I think they would never

943
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Catabolic

944
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
And these kids will be

945
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,192
Such a good Global citizen rather than

946
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
Having the only

947
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,032
View from China to the world

948
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,360
Now they will know wow outside of China

949
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,664
There were so many people similar

950
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,248
Two Chinese people yet so different

951
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
I'm very positive.

952
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,088
Travel will enhance

953
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,160
The International Exchange and promote Global Peace

954
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,096
Now it's up to a final round of quick fire questions who's that you admire the most and why

955
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
There are many

956
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,936
People I admire I think Bill Gates full most

957
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
I think he

958
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,008
Buda such a successful

959
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
Company yet

960
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Time

961
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
He

962
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,408
Contribute so much to Africa

963
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
I took the rest of the world

964
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
And I have very high admiration for him

You're going to hear a short interview with our managing partner to shameful

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,792
Pelagius investment in chunar and online travel company that merged with C trip in 2015

1021
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,608
In a deal that was bad about close to 10 billion dollars

1022
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,728
Could you please tell us about how you first met soon are and how you came to invest in them

1023
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
It's kind of a long story

1024
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
And

1025
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,128
You know I first met Fritz back in 2005 mm

1026
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Beijing China World hotel

1027
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
And cons

1028
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
You know a lot of us have our meetings in China Wall back then

1029
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
That's right and so I met Fritz

1030
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Demopolis

1031
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
Abeka no 506 bike

1032
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
Beef roast

1033
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
Carrying his briefcase

1034
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
Telling me about this medicine

1035
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,048
Play and travel set

1036
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,120
And I thought it was an interesting story

1037
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
But I wasn't at

1038
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Paying a lot of attention

1039
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
Because at that time

1040
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
B5 Baidu just went public

1041
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,848
I thought that Jesus such as such right that's a

1042
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,432
Big search company already just got out and

1043
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,480
Couple billion dollars at that time

1044
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:46,368
And why would that be a Marketplace for a vertical search so I wasn't paying a lot of attention to it

1045
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
Until they did the series

1046
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
Sirius B

1047
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
I still have questions on

1048
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
The value of

1049
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
Hey buddy go olmeca

1050
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,216
But during the process I got to know Cece drawing the co-founder

1051
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:06,592
I also got to No Frills and the two of them really well so it was a / 3 to 4 year.

1052
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
And by 2000 and

1053
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
7 + 2008

1054
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,528
I saw that they were doing something

1055
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Right

1056
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Quite right

1057
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Because how

1058
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,672
Flight information got democratize because he

1059
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
Is digitized

1060
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,512
And tickets became e-tickets

1061
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
What is physical

1062
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,376
Tickets so that were watching TV at that time for them

1063
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
2

1064
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
To actually help

1065
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,728
Consumers acquire

1066
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
The cheaper possible

1067
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
So that was back in 07 or wait

1068
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,640
My first meeting done with frizz was

1069
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
80506 and

1070
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
When I saw that

1071
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
The search

1072
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Yeah search for flight prices

1073
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,576
She started to take off

1074
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
The whole momentum

1075
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Because of

1076
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
The

1077
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
Change in the market as well back in 07 to 8

1078
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,816
If you recall if the whole financial crisis

1079
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,120
Action consumer becomes more price-sensitive

1080
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Sochi Nike

1081
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Quite a bit off

1082
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,984
Post in terms of geography

1083
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
One because of the market to

1084
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Because of

1085
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
But digitization

1086
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Off the ticket

1087
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
I can operate

1088
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,176
Another perspective

1089
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
Where Trina is

1090
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,736
Anti portfolio

1091
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
I feel that I missed

1092
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
And I could tell you why I missed it

1093
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,904
I'd like to shoot and I also met the company in mm

1094
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
2005

1095
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,232
But only two websites

1096
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Canada travel

1097
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
What is a genome

1098
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
Yellow one is Secret

1099
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,144
So why do you need a price comparison

1100
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,192
Website that didn't even work most of the time

1101
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Can you have two

1102
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,496
Go to two sites look for everything

1103
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
And what most people also

1104
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Fresas

1105
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,360
Even though he's an old China hand

1106
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
You still not local local back

1107
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,552
And you worried that if I see Yo is from localizing bully in bed

1108
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,624
Into all the SMB server companies that sell ticket

1109
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
In China

1110
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
And then thoroughly

1111
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,280
Chinese government in Chinese SOS

1112
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
The move in trouble soccer move very slowly

1113
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,632
When will the airline have e-ticket

1114
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Long time

1115
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
And they don't they don't move.

1116
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
So those are three things that most people

1117
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Applesauce

1118
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
Imposter I think what you think the well was I

1119
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
The sector was changing

1120
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
Chinese government and the

1121
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Major airlines

1122
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,992
In China what you shouldn't you take too much faster than anybody thought

1123
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
What's possible

1124
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
In Atmore travel agents

1125
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,344
Would getting a line and want to be online

1126
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
So and not dependent on them to travel sites

1127
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
With all the

1128
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Price information

1129
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
A competitive tuna was acquired by Foreign company

1130
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,376
Don't shoot out was kind of left alone be able to focus on

1131
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
Dominator China Market

1132
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
And not be distracted

1133
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
So I think you should get a ride called made on Batman bed

1134
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,056
Welcome to BC Pasadena

1135
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
Nursing home

1136
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
Condition to say no about she changed

1137
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
You can go back

1138
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Because this action

1139
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Oportun

1140
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,528
Right actually

1141
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,392
That were despite the investment that I made that was the

1142
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
Question and overhang on the question

1143
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
You know

1144
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,328
Fritz and Cece and you know together can they truly

1145
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Grow a company from

1146
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,008
You know 60 people too few hundred to a few thousand so the organizational complexity

1147
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,848
Grows as organization complexity grows can they

1148
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
That's a combination of

1149
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
A foreigner versus a logo

1150
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,528
Can they really run the organization I think that question continues to be

1151
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Be there

1152
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
And I think the other line

1153
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
Thing for me which

1154
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
Later brought to the involvement of Baidu

1155
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
What's that

1156
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,632
The metasearch service itself it's actually a fairly thin layer in terms

1157
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,216
Soft the value because you are providing a vertical eyes

1158
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,520
You know comparison engine

1159
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,568
Force very specific sector

1160
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
On the front end

1161
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
You still have to Baidu

1162
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
Which is the start of the

1163
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
Global search engine

1164
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,575
And now you have to OTAs that kind of laying veloso y'all really playing the Arbitrage between the

1165
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
Robot search

1166
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
And OTAs

1167
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
And that value is always

1168
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,559
A little bit of that overhang for me so as a company evolve into 2011

1169
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
I realized

1170
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
By that time

1171
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
That hate you know what they

1172
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
Something has to happen

1173
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Is he there

1174
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,127
Because if you look at what happened very close to Dan kayak and sites that post-merger was also silt

1175
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
To Priceline

1176
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,503
Until we knew at some point that the value of this company is

1177
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
Canby cab

1178
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
And so

1179
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,623
The one thing I have to do is to figure out how to make

1180
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
The company grade

1181
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,767
Until we actually had started conversation we baidu ants eat rib and so on

1182
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
And so

1183
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,095
The involvement of Baidu

1184
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,703
Into the company was strategically important because if actively made

1185
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,983
Chino

1186
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,567
Starting in 2011 the de-facto Gateway for all travel

1187
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
That positioning

1188
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:00,223
Houses to transform itself Beyond just a meta-search play to a OTA

1189
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
And

1190
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,111
That 4 in 2011 through 2013 Parts IPO

1191
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
She not win on this

1192
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Crusade

1193
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
To go from flight to

1194
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Hotel

1195
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
To order multiple travel services

1196
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
Transforming itself

1197
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
How to become more of a multi-platform

1198
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Better than just a media platform

1199
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,519
So that's a very important transformational change

1200
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
The allow it

1201
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
To grow

1202
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:29,663
From a five 600 billion dollar valuation company went by the first

1203
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
Got involved invested

1204
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
2

1205
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,039
Post-ipo of Freefall billion dollar company

1206
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,087
Also that was a second mouse

1207
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,623
Obviously

1208
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
As a company

1209
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
A photo evolve into this huge battle with C trip

1210
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,559
And the eventual Mojo with C trip

1211
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,631
What's in the outfit of all given how intense the company

1212
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Station wagon

1213
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,215
And that is facilitated by both

1214
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,519
You know by do and I'll cells

1215
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,799
Dave & Buster's

1216
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,591
In association with the manager

1217
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,687
So before they became a tree lotia it was

1218
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
More differentiated

1219
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
From C trip in terms of Pi

1220
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Right

1221
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,855
But you can think of the relationship kind of lie

1222
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,647
Bible verses

1223
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,743
Alibaba taobao right cuz if you automatic search and you

1224
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,303
I wanted to say at some point

1225
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
They the conflict

1226
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,911
Will be there if you become the dominant player and the other is

1227
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
The Dominos

1228
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Multiplayer

1229
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
Because each has

1230
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,543
While they're playing a different role

1231
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
And a value chain but

1232
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
Competing for value

1233
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,967
So that competition got intense so we have to take certain sites

1234
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
We took sight we baidu earlier

1235
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
And then I'll

1236
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Obviously we

1237
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Did the modulator with c

1238
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
I just put into perspective I think when

1239
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,487
But Jason said when

1240
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
He got Baidu

1241
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
In

1242
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
2 notches

1243
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,351
Thunderman dollars

1244
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
Kayak in the US

1245
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
Didn't have any

1246
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,215
Investment from Google search engine

1247
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,287
It was sold to Priceline the number-one OTA in the US

1248
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,591
China

1249
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,127
42 billion dollars

1250
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Tocayos

1251
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,455
Global companies over 2 billion

1252
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,783
Enchinar was only 500 600 million dollars

1253
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
In China is a

1254
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
Only play

1255
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Doing exactly the same thing

1256
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
That would by Justin Bowman

1257
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
The ends up

1258
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
Increasing the duration of a company

1259
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,791
But keeping up with a number to search engine in China to become

1260
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
4 billion

1261
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
So

1262
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,375
Shoot shoot important deal

1263
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
To make changes about Alicia in

1264
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
Complexion

1265
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Of the Netscape

1266
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
That's right

1267
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
I think as we

1268
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
Go to Hunts Point

1269
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,383
You no answer your investor

1270
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,199
And some sort of a partner to entrepreneurs

1271
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
Open times

1272
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
You know

1273
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
The entrepreneurial Drive

1274
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:49,439
Yeah business on a day-to-day operationally I'll guess you didn't know that

1275
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,743
The understand the landscape quite well.

1276
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
The drive to

1277
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,839
I did develop the strategy execute on it

1278
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,191
But for the most part I think water in grasses have is that we have this

1279
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Globo

1280
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239
Landscape

1281
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:08,639
Particularly our team here at GTV so we understand a lot of the Dynamics this going on Underground

1282
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,943
You looking into that

1283
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
Future

1284
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Where do we create value

1285
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
The creation of valleys not just for ourselves

1286
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,855
The creation values of audience

1287
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:22,719
So and often times we hope that we could offer

1288
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
A value-added advice

1289
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
And hopefully

1290
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
Positioning the company

1291
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
4 greatest

1292
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
Could you talk about

1293
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:36,799
The role that you played in the sea trip to Nara merger and how long did it take and what were the biggest challenges

1294
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Well

1295
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
It took a long time

1296
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,223
I had long conversations with all sides

1297
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Including

1298
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Seatrade Baidu

1299
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,391
And for lack of a better way to describe it it was

1300
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
Pretty intense

1301
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,463
And the intensity

1302
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,255
Oh that's a lot of

1303
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,303
So we have to realize one thing

1304
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
Nothing right now.

1305
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,679
Complexity comes from the fact that you have two companies do management that have fought

1306
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
Over a few years and many years

1307
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
And

1308
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,799
That is a missing element

1309
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
Which is true

1310
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
And so it's up

1311
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
And so how do you

1312
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Established

1313
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
Understanding

1314
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
And Trust

1315
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,551
What the eventual

1316
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
Not so much as in the value of the

1317
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,463
DeSoto acquisition rerouted value for both

1318
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
Call Juan

1319
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:31,839
It's also the fact that was the eventual management going to look like

1320
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
And so

1321
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,471
That transitional management that's the big part of the conversation

1322
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
Can you fight I spend so much more time

1323
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,567
Talking food ad

1324
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,895
Going to every single option

1325
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,687
And that sticks a lot of time

1326
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Atticus

1327
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:52,831
That is obviously emotions involve and entrepreneurs and managers needs time to digest

1328
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
A lot of these options at compass

1329
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
But having said that I think we

1330
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
Finally came to

1331
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
I didn't

1332
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,559
It took time to Camp come to terms and typically

1333
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
If you reflect

1334
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
If I reflect on

1335
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,215
The some of the parties I've done including to wqs Extra

1336
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
Most of these deal

1337
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,799
Easily take 6 months to 1 year

1338
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
That's the kind of timeframe you have to

1339
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
IPad 4

1340
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
Are you still pacing

1341
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
Throw this process

1342
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Easy hive

1343
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Objections

1344
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Easy have

1345
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
When people say no or not right now

1346
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,647
How do you get people to events

1347
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
If you say yes

1348
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
And how do you come up with a method to

1349
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
It's Life of Pi so that every

1350
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,535
They feel they got something that's

1351
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
Either tolerable or

1352
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
Acceptable or something that's

1353
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
WhatsApp moving phone

1354
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,519
Well perhaps that patience is inevitable cussing

1355
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:47,359
You just you have to live with it and it's not something that you

1356
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
You need to pay

1357
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,199
Thanks for that matter you have to appreciate evolve

1358
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Aldi

1359
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
Energy emotion the

1360
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:58,111
The The Sweat The Tears that entrepreneur put in into building

1361
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,415
These companies and so is not easy

1362
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
And so we

1363
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
Naturally have to

1364
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,279
Appreciate and empathize

1365
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Cancel that's very important

1366
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
Number one number two I think

1367
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Having said that

1368
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
Entrepreneurs house arrest

1369
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:17,311
That's a rational part of that understanding the value of those outcomes

1370
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
So numbers that make a difference

1371
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
So

1372
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,431
Rationalizing Trudeau's numbers

1373
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
And

1374
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
Also

1375
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:28,575
Typically that is a premium for the exit party

1376
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,647
And so how do you rationalize Trudeau's premium

1377
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
For both to buy the cell site to a

1378
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,975
To come to terms with

1379
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
And and having some sort of a

1380
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
Santa Madonna

1381
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
I think

1382
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
That process the number of processes

1383
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,703
This is so important because his

1384
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,751
Is a full realization of value

1385
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
A team

1386
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
Obviously

1387
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
If I called the

1388
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
Quora to buy side

1389
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,639
Device ID

1390
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,687
Typically got the upside

1391
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,015
The future value

1392
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
Where is the

1393
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
The cell site

1394
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
Biggest dove

1395
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
The value

1396
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:08,511
That is premium today so so a premium to the car value so that's a bit of a working model if you go and

1397
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,303
And rationalization to

1398
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
. they call the mix of it and that

1399
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,215
Typically for entrepreneurs that quite rational I mean you know at the end of the day

1400
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
They worked out hot air

1401
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,151
Work so hard and sweat and tears behind in that that had be a meaningful reward for them

1402
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:32,319
Curious because you said that because that's competition between Sutro to Nara was becoming so intense it became inevitable

1403
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
For them to merge

1404
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
Is this a China specific

1405
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,951
Phenomenal because in the US there also a lot of

1406
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,999
Intense competitions but there doesn't

1407
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Listen to BS

1408
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Much

1409
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Murders of rival

1410
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Yeah

1411
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
So

1412
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
I think the

1413
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:51,775
The competition in the BB look competition that us is not

1414
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
YES Prep in China

1415
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,383
And you know Zara

1416
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
You've been

1417
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
China over the

1418
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,503
This few years and you see me

1419
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,575
All intense competition is and how ruthless

1420
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,135
So ruthless they are the mall

1421
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Delta fight

1422
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
And more intense

1423
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
If you look at Uber versus

1424
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,535
Love and you compatible

1425
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,815
DD vs quiet

1426
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
It's a different level of intensity

1427
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,239
Sometimes in China there a literal fight like between delivery men

1428
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:26,335
So it's it's fairly intense and given that the

1429
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,871
That it drives

1430
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895

Drai's to NASA City

1432
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,479
Do I cheat, puto

1433
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
On the stadium

1434
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
What is the state

1435
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,855
Not the CD state in some cases

1436
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,951
If you look at some markets in some cases they come to terms

1437
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,047
In what day is the online video landscape that's to compact that's to competition

1438
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
All if you look at the

1439
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,167
A food takeout landscape Loyola my versus made

1440
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,215
Become so steady state

1441
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
What is stop

1442
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,031
Intensity at the start raising

1443
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,663
Daisy stop the subsidy and start raising soda

1444
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
The Tick rate

1445
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,247
So that uses the

1446
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,527
X ready

1447
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295

1449

Reasons

1450
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
But otherwise

1451
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Weather

1452
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,743
Investors continue to fund it

1453
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,583
And a neat Capital the need for Capital At You drives

1454
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
Big pot of

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
The Mojo

1456
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,471
You also see the founders getting diluted every time they breathe

1457
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
My money

1458
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
If they're bored that's in

1459
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,079
Pop-up with more Refresher

1460
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,871
Because the battle just sew in

1461
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
Intense and it's hard to figure out who's going to win

1462
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
Then

1463
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,223
It makes a

1464
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
Harder for the Thunder

1465
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
The keep on raising

1466
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,831
Abusive couple competition so intense

1467
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,135
But you know the other guy is not going away

1468
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:47,487
So you really want to do this for another 2-3 years or do you want to figure out weight results

1469
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,535
The like Optical

The stomach

1482
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,927
I think that's the kind of conversation

1483
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
Often times we have to have with

1484
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791

Like I said I think

1490
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,567
Entrepreneurs desert emotional part of them where I'll be OCD

1491
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:39,967
