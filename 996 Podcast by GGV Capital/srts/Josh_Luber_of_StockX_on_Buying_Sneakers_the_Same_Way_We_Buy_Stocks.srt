That has been able

140
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759
Go to grow very rapidly and build a lot of

141
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Supply and then

142
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
If the demand has been here

143
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
And China has become 15% of our business

144
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Almost without us

145
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Doing anything

146
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,743

00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
Testing a bit more about what you were doing

151
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
Before stock

Three other stars

154
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
Before the snow that meant anything to do with sneakers almost intentionally

155
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
It's almost like intentionally separating business

156
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,223
Some pleasure in my life but the the business that that would have been chubby

157
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
Comstock expose a company with

158
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295

00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
12 2013-2014

162
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
We are analyzing

163
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
EBay data

164
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
To figure out what her shoe tax

165
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
To create some idea of a true market value

166
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351

167
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
Sneakers

168
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:02,495
And we were just fortunate I guess to be the only people doing real analytics around the secondary Market

169
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
Sneakers at the time and end as this

170
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
The core data layer or understanding of market value

171
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Would eventually become

172
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431

177
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439

Yeah at the corner here that me this is supplied.

That's very very most basic and most pure even props

190
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
More pure than the stock market

191
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
Get itself done the stock market itself

192
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
The market price of a

193
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Overstock

194
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
Ultimately actually of Funk

195
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Function of of what

196
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
People think

197
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
That company is going to do what they

198
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
The performance is going to be

199
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Stickers

200
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Just supply and demand

201
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Do you have these products

202
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
At the brand

203
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,407
Complete your Nike and Adidas and Jordan

204
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,735
Really leopard scarcity in order to put out less product

205
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Then there is demand for

206
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Plus products

207
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
And by

208
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
Basic economics

209
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
If something is available

210
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Then people who want it

211
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Then that price

212
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
I will go up

213
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,279
And that's what's happened to your neck used to doing this for

214
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
34 years dating back to 1985 and

215
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
The first Air Jordan

216
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
But it was always a very

217
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,727
Local underground sort of thing and then in the last

218
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Osteophyte

219
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
6 years really on the back

220
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Social media in

221
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
Instagram

222
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
You know the sneaker mark

223
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Begin a lot more means

224
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Extreme as more people one acts

225
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
And that's really really really with

226
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Stockx about

227
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Access

228
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
And creating access

229
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
Search for product

230
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
That have really high demand

231
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
That's hard to get

232
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
It's hard to understand

233
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
Where to get it what's real what's a fair price for it

234
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
And that's really that

235
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
The Corvette you know the question around the stocks for drugs it is

236
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,679
Was one of the most popular articles that we wrote back in the day when we were just

237
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Just a price guide when I camp

238
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,311
And was this idea of actually looking at the data around sneakers to

239
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,895
To see that the the mechanics of essentially the

240
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Supply and demand

241
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
And how people were buying

242
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Selling sneakers

243
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,063
Looks frankville a lot like the way that people buy and sell boats.

244
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
End drugs

245
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
But you know

246
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Places support much more League

247
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
So you are a sneakerhead yourself

248
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Also

249
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Update on Earth

250
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
As well as a serial entrepreneur

251
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,679
All of the sweet things

252
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Which roaches

253
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
I think is actually the fundation of

254
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,127
Stockx it's definitely data

255
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
We have

256
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Super fortunate that we have been able to grow and become

257
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,551
One of the largest sneaker marketplace in the world

258
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
It's almost a red herring

259
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Sneakers are

260
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
It was called stocking

261
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Text not sneaker exit

262
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
It really is about the model in really is about

263
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Did the economics and the data

264
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
Of upgrading Marketplace that's built on

265
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
On those stock

266
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Mechanics

267
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Sneakers release

268
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Just put in the first category

269
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,567
And look if all that that for General kid knows is that we sell sneakers made by the next pair of sneakers from us

270
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,943
The we appreciate that and we appreciate that business but it really is about the big idea which is why I get to

271
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
To come here to Hong Kong that does speak it rise

272
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,831
Speak around the world and explain the people that this is about

273
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
A new form of Commerce that is

274
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
For lack of less cliche way of saying it

275
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Truly

276
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
Like this generally doesn't exist outside the ACT

277
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Actual stock market

278
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
And that

279
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
Thank so back to the question that

280
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Try to answer

281
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Are you here to talk

282
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Is

283
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
Sneakers more like soccer.

284
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
The interactions of the

285
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
Participants in the market is a lot more like drugs

286
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,943
When you see people that are buying three pairs in order

287
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Where to fund their

288
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,575
Collection and pay for one right if I can get ahold of three and sell to I can afford

289
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,439
The data and the the supply and demand an understanding why

290
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Shoe sales for a certain price

291
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Is actually a lot more like stocks

292
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Where you have

293
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:16,191
Is pure supply and demand and you and we then have built marketplace around that but that idea that is really just about how

294
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
How many people won Everest how many

295
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Paris Roxanne

296
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
So it's both

297
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
Write the data is more like stocks are the

298
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
This behavior is more like drug

299
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Pictures of a sneaker

300
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Is part of what you

301
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
You guys do

302
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Wouldn't treat me

303
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Apartment in Ewing

304
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Crack that is very obviously

305
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Minneapolis

306
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Beyond

307
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Sneakers

308
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
Explain a lot

309
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Yet we didn't make anything

310
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Hit like the stock market

311
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
It has been the most efficient form of Commerce for a hundred

312
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
50 years

313
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
An understanding supply and demand

314
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Has been

315
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Everybody would have

316
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Would have loved to

317
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
To understand supply and demand

318
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Any product

319
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
They sell but demand is always been a really

320
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Hard things under

321
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
We don't have any widgets that there the brand create

322
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
But the man has been a forecast

323
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
Projection off of last year sales

324
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,319
You know what I hope or wish her or percentage of markings

325
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
And whatever it is

326
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Put in the stock market

327
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Demand is real

328
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
You know exactly how many people are willing to buy Nike

329
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Stockx

330
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Price

331
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
You know in NY time

332
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
And so by applying that same model

333
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Any consumer good

334
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
By understanding demand for any consumer good

335
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
You can just create a more efficient Marketplace

336
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
And so

337
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
Any any product any consumer good that you would ask a question

338
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
What is this worth what should I pay for

339
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
That is a question

340
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Best answer

341
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Goodbye supply and demand

342
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Until some of the other cat

343
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Is that we sell today

344
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Watches

345
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Handbag

346
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
Streetwear collectibles

347
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,231
You know these are these are products that are inherently worth more

348
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Then they're often

349
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
Released for and they become more valuable

350
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Because they're collectors because

351
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
There there

352
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
Are scarce because of because brands

353
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Panjiayuan market

354
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
Also works

355
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,031
Downside also works on discounting right so

356
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
You know we're hearing in Hong Kong and is

357
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
News quite hot

358
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,295
Show all winter jackets are 40% off on nike.com or whatever they are righteous some discount

359
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Because we're off season

360
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Why is it 40% off

361
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,439
If we understood demand for winter jacket

362
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,999
Here in Hong Kong in July

363
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Well some people might be a temper

364
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
You can have

365
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
True variable pricing if you understood demand

366
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,799
And then all the sudden that that is just a more efficient way to be able to it to price those pretty

367
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
Are products in this particular

368
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
It's about this is variable

369
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
Still the market actually

370
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
Create I am thinking are there like proof

371
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Fashionable sneakers

372
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
Speculators now do people like do this.

373
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Just to make a living

374
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
The questionnaire implies

375
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,535
It's about fresh inspector is implied

376
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
It's about necessary buying a

377
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
And selling

378
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
You don't when we say the stockx

379
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Today stock market

380
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
The things

381
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
Immediately people think about investment

382
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Stock market

383
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,871
That's not necessarily the case right at the core were consumer goods

384
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
We are an evolution

385
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
All we do is connect by

386
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Business hours for the purple

387
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Price of buying and selling

388
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
Consumer good

389
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Absolutely professional

390
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Sellers

391
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,463
The same way that their professional sellers on eBay and some of those are your one guy

392
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
And in the basement or

393
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Isb companies

394
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Now the cons

395
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Buying and selling in order to

396
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
To speculate

397
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
Make money

398
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
The evolution of the business

399
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
Is is not only allowing two people

400
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
Day trade sneakers to buy and sell sneakers

401
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
The same way that we buy and sell oil

402
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,015
I really do sit in a warehouse

403
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Like that is

404
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
The logic

405
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Extension of what we're doing

406
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,207
Besides crack your other co-founder you have a circle phone

407
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Dan Gilbert

408
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Cleveland Cavaliers

409
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
How did the three of you guys be

410
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
Idea to

411
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
What it is today

412
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,239
You know what Greg Schwartz is the CEO and co-founder

413
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
Who runs the business with media today has been doing

414
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Finish last 3 years

415
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
Starting to run three other starts before

416
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,783
We never had a billionaire co-founder of an idea and

417
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Attraction is quickly

418
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,671
But the short version of was a long story with how'd and I got together was that

419
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Essentially dance I had the exact

420
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
See my dear indepen

421
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
And I never met him I never been in

422
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Detroit

423
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Cavs game

424
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
I believe this idea around the stock market

425
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,239
For sneakers and for me it was very ground up I got the sneakers on my life

426
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
And I had this

427
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
The campus that was around

428
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
The value of

429
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Sneakers

430
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
Dan was sort of coming out from the office

431
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Candle which was the stock market

432
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,599
Dance over for years and I literally can't get him to wear sneakers right

433
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,463
But that's okay right Janet seen this sort of this idea from the stock market side and enter

434
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
You know what a Fantasy fishing

435
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Markesan said wolf

436
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
Why can't we buy consumer goods

437
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
The same way that we buy or sell

438
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,679
And then he saw a 15 year old son buying and selling

439
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:10,079
Speakers on eBay in 2015 like every other fifteen-year-old kid took a closer look at that so you know what that's a pretty crappy market leader

440
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Would that be a perfect

441
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Start stockmar

442
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
Greg was running another startup Within danzico

443
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
System in Detroit

444
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
And Dan Gregor

445
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,135
Danipro scratches inhalers and I had this idea let's create a stock market

446
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Sneakers in

447
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
Will those guys to know anything

448
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
What sneakers but if

449
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Dan Gilbert

450
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
Build a business together then you don't take that call

451
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Those guys

452
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,935
Started that business they get a week into it relies will man we need a sticker guy

453
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Who's the sneaker guys

454
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
Sneaker stock market

455
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Do some research they found campus they found

456
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
My work around

457
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Docker data

458
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
We got together and

459
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
And then we realize that you don't

460
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Also trying to build

461
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
Start a three other companies that work Friday and it wasn't random guy so

462
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:57,695
It was a pretty crazy in the serendipitous way that that we got together but it's been a pretty great

463
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Situation for Greg and I

464
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,607
To to just sit there and have somebody that really understood the bigger idea and and I have the resources

465
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
They want to just

466
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Just run the business

467
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
It's not worried about the rest of it

468
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
And then

469
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
How old is Scott

470
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Cutler your new CEO

471
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
It's in the bag

472
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
We lost this

473
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
On February 8th 20

474
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
That's when we start working on December before February

00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
X goes live

477
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
February 10th

478
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
16 I got a email through Linkedin

479
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
From a guy named Scott Cutler

480
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Who at the time was the co-star

481
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
EBay own StubHub

482
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
The time eBay was our largest matter

483
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
The time eBay was the largest market

484
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
I like man

485
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
But you did come after us

486
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,495
This quickly like what is going on

487
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
But the reality was he before Scott was at StubHub

488
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
He was

489
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
One of the leaders of the New York Stock

490
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967

Things is a better model I would love to help I'd love to be involved

495
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
But we bet it's got to no end cuz we're Wireless

496
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,815
Why is he no like

497
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
He was really understand about an honest

498
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,519
He has like the exact his background is exactly what we are and then he end up going and working eBay but like

499
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
Like fuel Marketplace ticketing

00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
You know that whole wide world and then that the stock

501
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Market so

502
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,015
Stop behaving investor in the very first round and became for Greg and I one of our closest advisers over the past

503
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Couple years

504
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
In and just helping

505
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
Think through the business and we never

00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
Bracket we never really thought that we would be this

507
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
Biggest quickly that we could

508
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
We can get someone likes

509
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Scott m winscott

510
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
I was thinking about leaving eBay a couple months ago

511
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
I said hold on hold on don't go do anything else like let's talk about this

512
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Then let's figure it out it was

513
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
Is very not unlike MTG gain a very sort of serendipitous opportunity came out we weren't looking for a new CEO

514
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,735
But it was sort of the perfect marriage and so you'll be announced everything a couple weeks ago and it's been pretty awesome too

515
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
It happened here movie

516
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Borden

517
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
Frankly I mean

518
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
I I take nine other CEOs none of the people like Scotty

519
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415

00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,095
Still Desir everybody's still doing 7 Jobs still like when were you know three guys in the garage and end

522
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
And that's the fun part of it also

523
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,983
It it's all about great people so it's exciting have Scott here to move forward

524
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
Everyone is based in Detroit

525
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
And I just started operation

526
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871

527
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175

With Europe

532
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
What's Oxbridge

Put our first team on the ground in London and Q4 of 2018

548
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087

When to sell the products everybody wants what we need to go to

563
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,183
The crate that you know very easy local experience so that everyone can buy it

564
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
How they want to buy products and get products

565
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Forecaster in

566
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
And more efficiently and more economical

567
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
So in other words you have a very

568
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Google

569
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
Customer base

570
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
I would assume

571
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
Yeah one of those interesting things as we've been traveling the world in and you know we have a team now in Tokyo and then

572
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
And we've been super Fortune

573
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Can we get to do a lot of press

574
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
One of the first

575
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
First questions in almost every reporter ask

576
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
Me and I'm in any local market is

577
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,087
What are the differences in taste

578
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
Is your weather differences in products

579
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Send n the answer is at the top

580
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Nothing

581
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,511
It's it's all the same it's Nike Louis Vuitton Yeezys

582
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
Supreme your Rolex off white

583
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,143
At the top now you have a long tail with different tastes in different markets

584
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
It's but like for what we sell nose product

585
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
It is all the

586
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Club lit

587
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
And so then we get to be the ones

588
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
The figure out how do you take that global

589
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Supply

590
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
And make it available locally official

591
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Why is that

592
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Who are the two

593
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,063
This is yo it's Michael Jordan it's kinda it's

594
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,415
It's Virgil abloh is it you don't even like we're going to get we get to draft on

595
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,719
On the back of the most iconic brands

596
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
In the world

597
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
And you know that's just really a function of the

598
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
The products that we sell

599
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,631
And the brands are created scarce around these products

600
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
And let you know if there's one word for stockx it's about

601
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
It's about creating apps

602
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
For consumers who either

603
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
Didn't know where to buy this product

604
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
Or

605
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,431
Or knew where to buy it but when asleep outside of sneaker store for 3 days

606
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
Or you know

607
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
Didn't know how to Wade through eBay or knew how to use eBay but didn't know it was real or newest real within the what a fair price was all these things

608
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Which made buying these products

609
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
Inherently difficult and a lot of friction

610
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
We provide

611
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
Just pay taxes for those products

612
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
That people want and so

613
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
It's great I love the fact that you know

614
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,936
Louis Vuitton and Nike do our marketing for us

615
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
Stockx started

616
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
With only snake

617
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
And now entering

618
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
Handbag streetwear and watches

619
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
It comes with a layer of

620
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,992
Protection and validity by its verification model that is necessary

621
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Today given the

622
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
Prevalent prevalent

623
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
So how do you balance scaling up the volume

624
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,000
In your platform at the same time provide the verification process

625
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,376
Yeah I love that we didn't start with authentication because

626
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
It is

627
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
We got a lot of value

628
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Out of all time

629
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
There's no question

630
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
Every single product that we sell

631
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Pastor one of our now five

632
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,688
Detroit Tempe Arizona New York London and end now I know that in the Netherlands

633
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm sure we'll have a

634
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,064
At least one or two in Asia very soon probably have another one in the US

635
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
And there's a massive amount of body that because there are a lot of fake products out there and if you're 14 year old kid and you could care less what a bitter and ask

636
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,048
Kaiser what's means you know you're never going to get a fake pair of Yeezys

637
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
There's Mass

638
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Asset value there

639
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,704
But you're not on like sneakers being somewhat of a red herring because we're about a lot more than sneakers

640
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
Authentication really just is

641
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
Facilitate the larger model it's almost just the ante to play

642
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
It at this point

643
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Set about the stock market model

644
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
What about this

645
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,248
This model built on how the stock market works

646
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,112
And if someone isn't 100% certain that what they're going to get his real it changed their perception

647
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
Value

648
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
If your seller

649
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
You think you're going to get a scam chargeback

650
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Did someone said you saw today

651
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
It changes how much you want to sell some

652
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
Nike stock on the New York Stock

653
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Change your voice

654
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
Like if you thought you were going to fix your stock like it would change everything

655
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,312
For us it's just part of of the larger model

656
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,432
And look even when Nike and Adidas have a chip every shoe and every kid with a napkin authenticate every

657
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Product

658
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
We will still stay

659
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Stan Mill that transaction we will

660
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Still run that same process

661
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Because it's about the law

662
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
It would be easier quicker

663
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Refers to do that

664
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Speaking of

665
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
A few big names

666
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
Eminem

667
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Mark Wahlberg

668
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
And others

669
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
No parking private company is

670
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
Chevrolet what's it like to get a move on

671
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
And

672
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
That's not help your business

673
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,056
Yet you not unlike you know how it how you and I first met

674
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
We created

675
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,176
A venue for some of those folks to invest because they were already helping us

676
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
We never

677
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,320
Never started this business thinking we were going to go out and get the most famous people in the world involvement in this

678
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Business

679
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
It happens

680
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,184
Soup organically the first one was was Mark with Mark Wahlberg

681
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,072
We're in a meeting really early on with Dan and it somehow just randomly came out that Mark Wahlberg wears a lot of Air Jordan

682
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,376
And that is why I don't bark

683
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,704
An hour later on email chain with Dan and Mark 2 days later in Calif

684
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
Tony at Mark's house going through a sneaker closet he's like oh we should put these on stockx

685
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,504
And then you know a couple weeks later something very similar happened around with Eminem and Eminem's manager Paul Rosa

686
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
Bergen you know they're both from Detroit and Paul was in the office

687
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,136
Working with with people in in on Detroit things

688
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,488
And it was also a very organic thing that that we came in contact

689
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
And they were helping us so we created that first round

690
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
I know we could get those guys

691
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Uno the Great

692
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Diary

693
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
You know a $10,000 check to Eminem doesn't really you don't move the needle

694
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,872
So that was the beginning of it and then it was a sort of organic growth around as we

695
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:52,736
Came to contact with other people and dumb and we've been super fortunate we get a lot of people that are interested

696
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Because the product

697
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
Because of Dan because the NBA

698
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
But we get

699
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,440
How to choose those people that are generally in it for the right reason and who can have your value

700
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
Eminem

701
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
Coach you are you look like

702
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,096
You know the first person

703
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
That ever told me that

704
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,704
The first person that ever told me I look like I was Eminem

705
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
Which was really funny there's that

706
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
Is a scene in this video that that we shot

707
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,920
Where I say you know I'm here with Eminem to pick up shoes for the charity auction and

708
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
Eminem goes

709
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
I'm here

710
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Person asking when I met

711
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
Josh of the First Tee of

712
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
This is the first time

713
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
I actually would be

714
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Streetwear is

715
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Less

716
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Globo and

717
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
More local because of the ink

718
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
If you think about

719
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Search who are in the US

720
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
You know what people are

721
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Chasing after braces

722
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
In China

723
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
It's quite individualized

724
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
So what do you say

725
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
Get so

726
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
Streetwear just gets the long tail lock

727
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:05,952
Supreme like Supreme is the Nike of streetwear right and so at the top everybody wants Supreme

728
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,096
Underneath that there's a couple other brands that aren't aren't nearly as big but have you know babe

729
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Which is a bathing Ape from Japan

730
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,192
And then there's a few other brand Palace

731
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,008
I meant it just gets the long tail a lot lot lot

732
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
But very top

733
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
Like that's just that it's just

734
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,128
The clear leader it is

735
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:28,992
I I forgot about the time I had the exact number but it is overwhelming majority of our street our business

736
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
Terms of dollars

737
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
And units

738
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Suspended Supreme

739
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
It in China

740
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Pretty obvious

741
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
That do a nice ass

742
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
And several others

743
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
While trying to be in the space

744
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
And you can tell what it is a

745
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
Growing fan base

746
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Sports for speakers

747
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,656
The consumer level and it's much bigger

748
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Annies

749
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
So much because people thought because

750
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
The end result of this

751
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Is

752
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Actually

753
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
A convergence

754
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
The primary and secondary Market

755
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,896
Together to just be one market

756
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
Right and we always people always ask what's the resale Market how big is it us we think it's maybe

757
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Around 2 billion

758
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
Probably maybe it's 7 8 billion and growing

759
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,976
The global retail Market is 100 billion +

760
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,048
It's the whole thing

761
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,608
And for our growth is

762
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Is about like that next customer that retail

763
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
Customers about their last

764
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Footlocker nike.com

765
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
That never would have tried to wait

766
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
EBay 3 years ago

767
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
Because you got walking to Footlocker and there's

768
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
300 400 pairs of shoes on the wall

769
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
A6000 differ

770
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,272
Track shoes on stockx

771
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,088
Just be you know a hundred dollar shoe that's a

772
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Colorway

773
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:42,976
It's on the wall at Footlocker and it's selling on stockx for 110 or or 95 right

774
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
25% of our business

775
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
Actually left

776
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Then retail price

777
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,632
And it's that it's that long tail of just abs

778
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
Product is out there

779
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,984
And that's why it's a convergence of all of this that are real

780
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,544
For sneak and this is just sneakers

781
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
And it's not too bad

782
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Illinois

783
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Four singers that the brands

784
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Most of our base

785
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
Designer started in the US

786
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
What kind of

787
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
What relationship do you

788
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
4C

789
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
With them

790
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
Open up the sneaker brands in and even you know the streetwear brands and and Luxury Inn and everywhere else

791
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
All converging the same place which is you know

792
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
Ultimately two to work together

793
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,960
The best example of where this all goes is what happened

794
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
So

795
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
10-15 years ago

796
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
Teams and leagues were wrecked

797
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
Ticket scalpers

798
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,224
Ticket websites today official resale Marketplace in Major League Baseball

799
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272

You know when other taking website started to pair up in and now step up as

801
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Primary ticket

802
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,000
Got the Sixers the Yankees and a few other teams Naruto what they've done is they've basically created one market

803
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
One Market that's what the stock market

804
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Enterprise

805
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
That's the evolution

806
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
Is to work with Nike to work with Adidas to work with

807
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,776
You know the street or Brands to release product directly into the

808
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
To literally

809
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
IPO products

810
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Initial

811
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,760
We've done some of these and and stay tuned like in the next

812
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
Three to four months

813
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
Another half-a-dozen IPOs coming

814
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
With brandy

815
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Including some really big sneaker brands

816
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
This where you get to a point where

817
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Disappear this line between read

818
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,888
Tell Reese other just one market about those brands

819
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,472
You're engaging with us and with the secondary Market saheila

820
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008

Wework website traffic

822
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Foot Locker

823
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
We have more customers than than most any Sneaker Boutique or sneaker retailer so it's an evolution and na

824
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Inevitable Evolution that we all end up

825
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
Working together global

826
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
And lumps globally

827
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,672
The other side of the equation

828
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
Emissions

829
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
So overtime how would the

830
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
Online

831
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Commerce

832
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Interact with

833
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,352
Offline

834
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Store

835
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,776
Just so you know we just opened our first brick-and-mortar location in SoHo in New York about two blocks south of

836
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,104
Love Supreme on Lafayette and

837
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,176
I was careful to say brick-and-mortar not retail cuz we don't sell anything

838
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
Whereoware Market

839
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
The primary purpose of that Loki

840
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,040
Station is for seller drop off

841
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
4 Cellars who've already sold

842
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,160
Something on stockx to come in and drop it off we authenticate in the back of the sea

843
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,720
Store so someone can get paid out much quicker

844
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,512
And then we can have that product can get it

845
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,072
Okay but the evolution of that

846
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Beijing sanlitun

847
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
We've done pop-up locations in

848
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
London la

849
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,520
Chicago Atlanta and will continue to do more in

850
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
More permanent

851
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
Devolution it's about bread

852
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
But having a

853
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,432
The brand experience on the ground in these locations

854
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
And where you know sneaker culture to our culture and our

855
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Customers are

856
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Really

857
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
Favorable situation to beware

858
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
I don't have to rely on on

859
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Brick-and-mortar sales

860
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,000
In order to to pay the bills

861
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
And once you do that

862
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:04,192
And think about it from a brand standpoint and you can be more creative you can take rest you can have it all a lot more fun in in

863
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
I'm doing that knowing that

864
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
The Core Business

865
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Is it online

866
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
This is how you

867
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
Movies I've seen in

868
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Japan Inn

869
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Korea Taiwan

870
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
China

871
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
It's how you can go to offline store

872
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Use QR code

873
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Skyrim buy something

874
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
You don't have to

875
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
Take it with you

876
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
Ship your house

877
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Later so you don't have to touch anything

878
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
The scan

879
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Haywood Mobile Wallet

880
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
Extremely

881
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Easy in French

882
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Also it's a

883
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Phenomenal

884
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
Example of consumer Behavior because

885
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Because for us what happens is

886
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
Open the first pop up

887
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Yeah we only had people that were

888
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,616
Working the pop-up authenticators intake

889
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
Not very quickly realize

890
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,944
Did the most valuable people to have on-site

891
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
Uber customer service

892
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,344
And a half people there that could answer those questions that we used to come in via email or chat

893
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
And if you would explain it so that I could buy

894
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
And that

895
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
What is massively powerful cuz it leads to exactly what you do

896
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,632
You sit there in the shop on their phone or otherwise had questions and had friction around using the product

897
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,960
And now I can do that in the prodigal show up at their house y'all in a couple days

898
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,728
Exhaust

899
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
Why eBay isn't

900
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Yeah I mean

901
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
EBay

902
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,088
Great and will always be great for that like long tail product

903
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,928
Right you want to find some unique one-of-a-kind item eBay has as

904
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,232
What's the scale for that put the eBay model

905
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
Is is antiquated

906
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,632
Right I mean Thursday there's no catalog bases there's no structure data

907
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
And they can't

908
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
To implement this

909
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:45,568
Is 4 even just a core reason right if you will look for that the shoes I'm wearing right now on eBay you will get

910
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
500

911
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Zen music

912
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Have to figure out

913
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
This person that personalizes

914
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
600 yd

915
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,296
800 yuan how many views has person have visor cap

916
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
All that stuff is nonsense

917
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
Is confusing you go on stockx

918
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
There's one

919
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Product

920
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,304
That promise you will buy share of Nike stock there's one ticker symbol for Nike stock and everything happens at the

921
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
That one place

922
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
Is this the standardization to be able to have

923
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
You don't single product page

924
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Catalog base

925
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Experience

926
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
That eBay would literally have to

927
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
How to create an entire new

928
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Rebuild an entire site

929
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
To do that so

930
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
You know we're not connect

931
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
Concerned about someone like eBay coming in

932
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,808
Replicating what we're doing as much as we would be more concerned about someone building something

933
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Scratch

934
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,392
And then competing with us somewhere that were not with it at

935
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Geographical your dick

936
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
Products

937
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,488
Every single thing that we've done

938
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,816
Is infiltration of that model

939
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
In and how we handle payments and how we handle shipping

940
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Indica

941
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Experience

942
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
And the man with great is

943
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
Is it taking a while

944
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,824
But every one of those things builds moat around the business because like you have to

945
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
To be fully committed to that model

946
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,920
In every way that you go the product to be able

947
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Actually do that and so

948
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Got reaction

949
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Intent to that question

950
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
Like you know eBay is probably the last

951
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Can replicate

952
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
NBA

953
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
Book off

954
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Ground Zero

955
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
New China 2

956
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
What is today

957
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
It's not hard with sassy stock

958
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Doing well in China

959
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
What are you playing

960
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
That we got in China

961
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
You already have

962
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
If 15% of your boy

963
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Coming from China

964
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
So it's early indicator

965
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Something big

966
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
Yet there are also local competitors

967
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Players

968
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
RV sites

969
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
So how do you think

970
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Chinese market

971
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
Yeah yeah this is

972
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
It is the price of the most

973
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Important question for us right now

974
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,096
In terms of our short and medium-term strategy

975
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
China is

976
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Is maybe the only

977
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
Sing the We don't know exactly what

978
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,520
What we're doing and we're still exploring a lot of different options because there are

979
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,848
Very formidable you know marketplaces on the ground in China

980
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
First sneakers

981
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
But we have this

982
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
Supply and there's a really unique

983
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
Distinction between

984
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
You got that what what has

985
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
What happened in the past

986
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
Marketplaces in in US companies coming to China

987
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,440
Versus this scenario where we have the supply that

988
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Because most

989
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
It comes in the market

990
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
For sellers are

991
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
Pentofrost we have some some big decisions to make

992
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
Quickly around

993
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Who do we partner with

994
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
Could we try to compete with

995
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
And where do we set up those

996
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
Those teams in those operations

997
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
I mentioned earlier

998
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
100% of a bottleneck

999
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
Every part of this

1000
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Just people

1001
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
Here's here as well right

1002
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,760
We still need to hire you know great leader for

1003
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
For China but also for it for all of us

1004
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,880
And build a local team in weather that local

1005
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
What team sits in Hong Kong or Singapore or mainland China

1006
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,792
And then where is the operations team sit when we authenticate products that sit

1007
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,376
And either those food three places or somewhere else like those the key question

1008
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,520
Oceans and then it's at the function of you who do you work with here do you work with one of the existing sneaker marketplaces

1009
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
And partner with them

1010
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,896
Do you compete with them do you work with one of the big players the Baba's rjd's

1011
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,200
And so those are the all the different order

1012
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016
Decision points that were in the middle of of determine right now

1013
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:11,648
I mean like I said everywhere else that we were really Clear Vision of of Haddix

1014
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Did you do this

1015
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,232
In the short medium term and manager

1016
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Show me different option

1017
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,608
For how we can do this knowing that 15% of our business is already

1018
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
Here

1019
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
There was a couple weeks ago

1020
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,056
Christopher Ward shoe and all the sudden it was the biggest shoe on stockx

1021
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
The impact

1022
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
So so clean

1023
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
You know over Chinese New Year

1024
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
There was a shoe this is the best story there was a shoe it's called

1025
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
Air Jordan 1 mid

1026
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
This is a shoe that is

1027
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Discount

1028
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Nobody

1029
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Us where is it

1030
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
But there was a black

1031
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
Gold colorway of the Jordan 1 mid

1032
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952
Did during Chinese New Year

1033
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
We can the number one selling shoe on stockx

1034
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
For like 2 weeks

1035
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,632
Because it was black and gold it was because it was during Chinese New Year

1036
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,936
And some celebrities born in all the sudden

1037
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
And all the US Dollars figured out they were all going to finish line

1038
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,056
Buying it on sale I mean

1039
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592
It is so clear the impact

1040
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,896
At the China and so we really you know it's important for us to

1041
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
How to figure out the right way to do it

1042
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,248
I was on YouTube last night and there's actually

1043
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
A tutorial on how to buy

1044
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
Sneakers from stockx

1045
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
YouTube

1046
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Sandy has

1047
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
115000

1048
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:24,096
We don't like we don't have local language

1049
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:29,984
We just rolled out of town and I will continue to roll out European languages but obviously

1050
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,032
Located

1051
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,152
What is your local payment methods we have to do in a process

1052
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
I'm doing it then the biggest

1053
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
Questions around who do you partner

1054
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Figure it out but yeah

1055
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,576
So what do you say to sneakerheads

1056
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Who's this to you

1057
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Having a stock market

1058
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
For something that we love is

1059
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Kind of ruining

1060
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
The fun

1061
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Define destiny

1062
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,376
Yeah it is

1063
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:03,776
So is right like this idea that you can like go fine like great sneakers for like a d or like this

1064
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,336
Cover them like you just it it doesn't exist anymore

1065
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
In the midnight

1066
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
And he's there was a guy whose name is bobbito Garcia and he wrote a book

1067
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,480
Games where the Seminole Sneakerhead Bible

1068
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
In the midnight

1069
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
In the title of the book was

1070
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
Where'd you get those

1071
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,368
Where'd you get those that used to be the seminal Quest

1072
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Nobody asked

1073
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,024
A question anymore we have the internet we know where to get everything we know when everything's coming out and where is being released now

1074
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,656
Can we get it can we physically be able to get it no because we're not willing to sleep outside of a sneaker store for 3 days

1075
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
We don't know the manager of the store but it's

1076
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
All the game

1077
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
Like that idea

1078
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
Vigo yeah there's a community we could all

1079
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:41,408
I like that doesn't exist anymore until we've done is just we've created access

1080
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
Grandparents year-round would it become

1081
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
A very fragmented

1082
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Aiden and Messi

1083
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,856
Did it just hard for anyone to be able to play unless they really really have you know that

1084
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Inside baseball opportunity

1085
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
And I

1086
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
AHS

1087
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,864
So another words sneaker has nowadays actually really appreciate what you're doing

1088
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Yeah well

1089
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
They certainly have voted with their

1090
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Wallets right

1091
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
I mean we are PS4 again

1092
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Yeah

1093
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
Yeah I mean

1094
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
That way between FBS scoreboard

1095
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Just that dumbass

1096
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
Growthwright like what

1097
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
About awareness

1098
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Right

1099
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,784
This just an easier way to be able to buy any product

1100
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
And that's also attended a what

1101
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
What someone what what

1102
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
What consumers want

1103
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
I really

1104
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,768
Interesting conversation last night at dinner with a woman who said listen

1105
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Sustainability

1106
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
But

1107
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
For consumer goods

1108
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,144
People on SOA vote with their

Yelizaveta purchase

1113
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
And like that's what

1114
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,336
The stock market model creates for

1115
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
So as a serial

1116
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Do you have

1117
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
You know one piece of advice that you want to

1118
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Pass it on to other

1119
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,440
Yeah so I have two related please advise that I sort of always using here and there the most basic

1120
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
But they're like

1121
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
It's so important to the first is his talk to everybody

1122
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,888
Don't think someone's going to steal your idea or show up with an NDA.

1123
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
To talk to someone like

1124
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:13,312
The refinement of those ideas and find those people to work with like it's just important get out there and just talked to everybody

1125
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
But everything

1126
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
And then secondly is like

1127
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
I just do something

1128
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:21,504
Like that the idea that you have to have this perfect idea or perfect plan you know is is Judge

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784

1130
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
I could never in a million years have

1131
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,904
