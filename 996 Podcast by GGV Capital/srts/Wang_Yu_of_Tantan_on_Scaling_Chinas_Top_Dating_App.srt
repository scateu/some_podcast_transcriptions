Hi everyone this is you is great to be here

Movies are at what was it like for you

55
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,168
So because my father was doing research

56
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
And he was invited to Sweden to Be Our Guest

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Researcher

58
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
And after he was in them

59
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
19

60
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
86

61
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200

62
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
The whole family

63
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
So we moved in 88

64
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
So very big dipper

65
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
The back in those days

66
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
The world that sign you through

67
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Still

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
In the early they self open up in Belton

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
China

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Lights off

71
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
All our furniture

72
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,400
Didn't belong to us we belong to

73
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
The people that.

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
Did they kind of like

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
10 years or so

78
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,712
Lived in two difference

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Switch

80
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,832
Is probably quite different than the Sweden people people could imagine

81
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Rights because

82
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
We had one Suite in the whole test

83
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
What kind of like nominations

84
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
I got to get in touch with all sorts

85
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
Different cultures so that was very

86
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
Secondary School

87
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Because I was

88
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Interested in

89
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
I'm so

90
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
I went into the city 2

91
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
Go to a school with a special matthan

92
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Science class

93
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
And that was more like the

94
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
How do you say

95
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
The canal

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Elite part of

97
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
I'll sweeten the difference between immigrant area

98
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
Call drink

99
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
Most central part of Stockholm

100
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
I would say that's almost as you know ask difference

101
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
Between China and Sweden

102
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Very big

103
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
Tasha's of you know

104
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
How to look at the world

105
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Which I think has

106
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Serve me a lot

107
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,431
How so you get to your 4th base with you look at the world

108
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
But

109
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
And it's often traffic today

110
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
And each one has their own reasoning

111
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Which makes sense from their own

112
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Perspectives and narrative

113
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
And did you get to

114
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Early Autumn

115
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Get acquainted with the whole

116
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Notion of narrative

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
Rights because there's a whole history behind

118
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
Why you think is right

119
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
So

120
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
You stop

121
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,079
Looking at things in terms of black and white

122
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,199
Number to Newton Center Simsbury

123
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,783
On our show and she talked about her experience of

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Gahr High School in the US

125
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
In 2007

126
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
You decide to move back to

127
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
The China

128
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,791
I was in China I live in China work in China but in 2006

129
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
And 2013

130
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
What prompted you to move back China

131
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
So

132
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
Right

133
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
Queen College

134
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
And

135
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,895
I'm starting to work I work for a while after Cincinnati

136
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
I started to have a lot of business

137
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,783
And I think it started when because I was doing

138
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,831
VoIP work

139
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Sony Ericsson

140
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,183
And my manager there wanted me to

141
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
Join the Zone company

142
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
To do

143
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Pyp for solving

144
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Between countries

145
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,703
And I came up with this idea of how to reduce to cause significant

146
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Please review IP

147
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
So basically it's a solution where

148
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,847
Before you go on the airplane

149
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
You transfer your number

150
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
URI directory number to our server locally

151
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Safe

152
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
Is Eufaula from Stockholm to Beijing

153
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
Can you transfer it to the stock on AR stock number

154
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,695
And when you arrive in Beijing you buy a new SIM card and then you

155
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Send SMS

156
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,303
Telling us with your new SIM card number is

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
And all

158
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,679
Calls to your sweetest number it will gets brought it to your Chinese number

159
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
So you pay to level two

160
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
When you want to call out

161
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,359
If you call a Swedish Swedish number just call from as good as normal Swedish

162
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,663
Did you call a Chinese number or anything

163
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Afford number

164
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
You called our local server in soccer

165
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
And then you pay to local fees again

166
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
So you can start paying

167
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
Somewhere between 6 and 12 R&B per minute

168
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Becomes like less than one

169
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
And another one

170
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
To this day that I think has a solution

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,167
Although I mean room is much less of a problem just cause has been reducing the

172
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,055
Butts back in those days this would Bieber in you and would solve the problem

173
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
So if we file for a pittance

174
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
We wanted to do this

175
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
Company and the manager went as far as to offer me a CTO position

176
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Waze

177
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Its 20% stake in the company

178
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
Anfernee was like okay so it wasn't hard in this

179
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Did the whole situation took me like

180
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
A week or so to a map

181
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
So I started coming like

182
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Something snapped

183
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
And I couldn't understood that

184
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,167
For any business what you need to do

185
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
Especially if you can like Norma Morales aviane

186

00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
Define the pinpoint

188
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
Yunnan people complain about

189
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Stuff all the time so you fine

190
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Anything people to complain about stuff to paint

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
You solve it with technology and you find a way

192
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Charge money

193
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
And that's the desert

194
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,367
So you know it business ideas what's coming up

195
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
Everyday

196
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
In every conversation

197
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
So it sounds like

198
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
I was bound to start

199
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,863
I wanted to go back to China because I even though I was

200
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Quite comfortable with the Swedish culture

201
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
A lot of friends

202
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Horseweed

203
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
But I still felt

204
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
More Chinese

205
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
The volume song

206
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
And I like China more

207
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
So I wanted to go back to China want to start a company

208
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,295
And I think of the Chinese people in Stockholm there's not definition

209
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,439
I think me and Sophia were the only ones I knew of that those wanted to start a company and wanted to go back

210
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
China

211
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,279
So we naturally kind of started to

212
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Look for business idea

213
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
That's why I did it

214
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
And I remember P1

215
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Back then he was a very

216
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Cool

217
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Fashion website

218
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
It was a first website in China

219
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
That has a black

220
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Aqua color

221
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
And it was still cool

222
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
But I never reach out to contact you cuz I thought

223
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
Well maybe it's too early for its time

224
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,159
Users in China

225
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Grassroots Market

226
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,327
People who can appreciate piwine will be very nice and only in Beijing shanghai

227
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
What were your lessons

228
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
From

229
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
Why did you do this particular concept and this user interface

230
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
What did you learn after doing it

231
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
So the reason we did P1 us

232
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
The major reason was that

233
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
We saw that

234
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Sensui

235
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Sophia had been away from China for worth

236
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
4 years

237
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
The time in I hardly ever lived in

238
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
China Red Sea

239
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
We thought that if we would just

240
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Nina flat-out competes with

241
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
Play the Grassroots entrepreneurs in China we would

242
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
So we would have to come up with something different

243
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
And back in those days

244
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
I mean

245
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Hikes in Seville

246
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
A lot of business ideas were

247
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Borrowed from

248
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
The US

249
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,431
So our stuff we're coming from Sweden

250
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
We were pretty sure no one has seen anything like

251
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Even if they saw our

252
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
But they wouldn't

253
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
I understand you describe the product a little bit

254
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,439
So it was like a high-end

255
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Community

256
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
Assassin community

257
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
And it was invitation-only that's why it was kept

258
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Spotify.

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
And we have a lot of street style photographers

260
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
Who would Scouts for people who are really stylish

261
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
In and outside of

262
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
I am shopping mall

263
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
They were just

264
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
Exploding all the time

265
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Then they would ask

266
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
If the person wanted to get the

267
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
And we were so picky

268
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
.

269
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,647
People really wanted to a lot of people dressed up just to get

270
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Stop

271
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,767
I want to take the picture we took their contact info and invited

272
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,887
And the only if they sign up to P2P one would they be able to

273
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Get the picture

274
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Sol commercial rates were super high

275
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
What's like 80%

276
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
And The photographers were

277
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,199
Paid for each qualified user the actual generated so it was not based on the working time or two photos

278
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Amount of users we got

279
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
So is requisition cost was around

280
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
15 RMB

281
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
60 R&B

282
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
4 attack

283
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Qualitative user was actually pretty pretty sure

284
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
Is very good so we got millions of users

285
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,839
And to give an example of the quality of the user's right so

286
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,191
At 1 points

287
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
I often even said they wanted some fashion people

288
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
So they asked us to my 30 user

289
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
And we didn't think too much of it so

290
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
We sent out emails

291
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
2 random users and we got 30

292
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
Not even one of them bought a car

293
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
The quality

294
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,391
Because I think about this people who went to

295
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,279
I like 1 hour and see in the 2020s right word

296
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
The day had a lot of money purchase power

297
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
So

298
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Even though we didn't have so much traffic

299
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,263
All the luxury Brands we're out of Kaiser at work Pines gas

300
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
So we we degenerates

301
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Significant CPI numbers

302
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
It was like over a thousand rmb

303
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,503
We have you know at the max I think we have like $20,000 you

304
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Big business

305
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,415
Three main messages

306
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
From the whole endeavor

307
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
No we tried for seven eight years

308
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
With all sorts of different pivot

309
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
If you want to try to get it to work

310
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
We just couldn't

311
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
Rights and did the three main lessons was

312
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Wine with tuna

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
But like I said

314
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,967
We thought that you know even though this is a nice markets but China has so many peoples that they still a big

315
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
China internet

316
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
You want to get

317
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
Because that's the value of Chinese internet

318
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
So we can like

319
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Big.

320
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
That's one but the second part it is

321
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
Probably more important and that's the pain point

322
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
Is not very strong thing.

323
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,935
But fashion socializing if something

324
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
You can live without

325
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
So

326
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,567
If they don't have a problem it doesn't matter how good the solution is

327
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,151
And the sad part is that since you don't

328
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
The product was too heavy

329
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
Since we didn't have a killer feature

330
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
We tried to compensate that but I didn't work pictures

331
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
And that's not a good way

332
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
To to try to succeed with internet startup

333
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
So when we stopped going to town town where you wanted water tube

334
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Nocatee

335
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
These mistakes right

336
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
So we wanted to go for a super strong pain

337
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
The witches

338
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
We spend a lot of time trying to Define.

339
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,751
Right and our positioning is like solving

340
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,055
Singles have a lack of China Smithfield

341
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
That's art.

342
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
It's neither for hookups

343
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Or for getting married

344
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
Because those are actually kind of like

345
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Sub portions of the market

346
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
What small portion

347
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Took him to be frank because

348
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Even though all four guys there's a you know

349
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Quite high level of

350
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Acceptance for hookups

351
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
Four girls still in China in Asia

352
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
You know it's it's not as pronounced

353
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
So we're talking about 5 to 10% of the

354
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
The female Market

355
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
Heavily limits how big you can be

356
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
But if you define it as

357
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
You know

358
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Meeting

359
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
If you're a single

360
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
That's something everyone

361
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
So by doing that

362
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
You open up the whole Market space

363
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
A lot

364
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
By the dodo

365
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,463
So that's a hard isn't it how we defined or the dipen points

366
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
It's obviously a Big Mac market

367
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
And the sad part is that the product is very simple

368
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
Are the products even though being simple

369
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
Fits the Asian and especially the Chinese

370
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Culture very well

371
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
I think much better than it does

372
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
For the Westin

373
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
And and that's because

374
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Chinese people

375
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Don't have

376
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Acertijos

377
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,807
Solve the problem

378
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,695
Let me for most of the day for most of the people in China

379
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
It's indecent to approach someone you don't know

380
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
It's still like that in the culture

381
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,935
Having a lot of girlfriends boyfriends before you get married that's totally fine

382
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
Getting in touch that first step it's very awkward

383
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
So that's why

384
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
There are hardly any

385
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Hardee's

386
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Rights in college

387
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
And

388
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
Most people don't go to top Soundbars

389
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,599
Rides and if you meet someone on the subway where in the mall is on you

390
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Talk to them

391
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
That's a hottie

392
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
But that's one issue did the second issue is that

393
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Mosto

394
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
Chinese young people are not in their hometown

395
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
That's quite unique

396
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,055
So there is either in a different city to study with work

397
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,383
And they're much more lonely

398
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Because

399
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
They don't have the family and friends are

400
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
And no one to introduce

401
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
So it's usually just go to work

402
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
Sleep alone

403
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Everyday

404
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
So it's super lonely

405
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
And the 10

406
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
Even though being very simple

407
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Spitz this

408
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
This problem 512

409
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
You never need to flirt

410
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,655
You never need to

411
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Take the first step

412
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
Because when you swipe someone

413
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
When you when you slide someone left or right

414
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
That person doesn't know

415
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
But they only know

416
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
If you like each other

417
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
And then both take the take the first step of the same time

418
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
And for the guy

419
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
You never expose yourself you never get rejected

420
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
Issue

421
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
And if you get if you do get mad

422
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
Talking to the girl is

423
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
You're very confident

424
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
You know that she's interested

425
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
She doesn't get the grass this is it doesn't bother and standby a lot of guys

426
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,287
And the girl also has a super Heights accessory

427
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Because

428
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
Portage our numbers

429
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
60% of the guys

430
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
Es6

431
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Girls like 6

432
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
X device

433
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
So

434
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
For the girls

435
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
It's almost like in the short match

436
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
If they like someone

437
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
So they feel like you don't like the

438
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Emperor II parts

439
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,471
The search for girls is that they can be proactive

440
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Usually socially rights

441
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
Female demon in the West

442
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
They're waiting for the guys to approach that right

443
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,687
They can be proactive ride so it's completely

444
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
How do you say even playing field

445
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
So they can choose who they like

446
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
And that's something that you speak

447
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,415
Bytes of data people approaching approaching them in real life

448
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
Are awesome not the ones they like

449
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
And

450
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,095
In something once they like pastel like a 60% chance of matching with

451
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
So the experience is very good

452
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,031
So even though as far as the service employees division just flip some cars and and you know

453
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,407
I solved this initiating the first Contact

454
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,991
Which I think is much bigger problem in China

455
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,135
But that's how we have been many dating websites and then apps

456
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
In China as was outside the China

457
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
When you were doing tan-tan

458
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
What were the features

459
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
That you were thinking of that's

460
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Different

461
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
From everything that's out there

462
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
And what are the features that are distinctive Chinese

463
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
That a Western Ave

464
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Won't be able to

465
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,591
Satisfy

466
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
So

467
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
I don't think it's so much

468
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
About

469
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
What features do you have

470
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Supposed to

471
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
Like how you operates the whole service

472
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
What kind of values do you have

473
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
While doing that

474
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:16,095
So I think there were like a hundred products doing more of the same product

475
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
And they all failed

476
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
And they sell not because

477
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,103
We were doing a good job and I'll containing them

478
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
And even though I don't sing to this day that it's

479
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
Really

480
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Difficult

481
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
It becomes very difficult if you don't have the proper experience

482
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
And we only gained experience by basically

483
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,439
Sailing with p1478 ears

484
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,767
So we basically made all the mistakes

485
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
You could make

486
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
We succeeded

487
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
By not feeding them

488
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
And for a new startup

489
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
For new entrepreneurs

490
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
Who haven't made those mistakes

491
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
I think you would need to have a lot of luck

492
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
To avoid

493
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
For us specifically rights

494
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
In this kind of service

495
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
First off

496
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
You decide

497
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,063
Is everyone going to see each other only one

498
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Fort Worth or are you going to like

499
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Repeat

500
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Other people you see

501
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
Since you don't have too many users in the beginning Wright's most

502
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Startup choose to repeat

503
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
That's a bad idea

504
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Because

505
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
If you like someone

506
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
Just waiting for them to like you back

507
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Right

508
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
So if you see them again this is waste of your time

509
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,359
If you don't like someone

510
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
What's up

511
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,943
What you want to optimize for its time its efficiency right

512
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Amount of time you spend versus

513
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,575
Getting a someone you can meet all flying that likes

514
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Right

515
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
That's a proper person

516
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
That's what you want

517
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,207
So you only see which which person won

518
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:51,071
The second is that we want to see fresh people you don't want to see people who raps like 3 months ago

519
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
And that's also a big issue

520
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
For a

521
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
New service since you don't have

522
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
How many users

523
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,751
In many of the other services you see people who are

524
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
After 3 months ago and then you feel like he's a ghost town

525
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,663
So we decided early on you can only see people crafted maximum within like

526
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
48 hours

527
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
But did you have to be active within 48 48 hours

528
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
Those two restrictions

529
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
Then you have to

530
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
Can understand what you're doing and I don't think

531
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
Hardly any of the competitors would we have

532
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
Realize this right so

533
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
Ringtones on each person slides

534
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
200 Parts on average

535
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Verde

536
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
Nuzlocke

537
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
200

538
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
Change

539
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
If each person slides

540
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Donut cards

541
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
You only see the first one

542
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
I want to see fresh user

543
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
What does it mean for new service

544
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
It means that locally within the city

545
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
You have to grow by 200200 girls a day

546
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
For this to be sustainable

547
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Bratz

548
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,256
But at the same time if you do grow by 200 guys Wonder Girls a day

549
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,816
No one will hit the bottom of the stack

550
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,168
Because most users are aren't active every day thereafter I'm not average maybe every second day

551
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
And if you don't hit the bottom of the style

552
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,384
They don't care if there's one card left for a Million Parts

553
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
So you're

554
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Essentially

555
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,784
Operating as if you were dominating Market already in terms of use Experian

556
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
So you can you can very early on give you sore

557
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
Stop music.

558
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
And since we had this offline

559
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Street style

560
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Acquisition

561
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Experience

562
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
WeChat

563
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Get good looking guys and girls

564
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Offline

565
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,728
We just skip the whole Street South Park we just use

566
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Male and female models

567
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,592
Male Hollister with the fact good looking girls

568
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Attract

569
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
Does the concept of being or a price

570
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Yes

571
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
So it's so you could get

572
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Park rides

573
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
You get the city to live

574
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,416
I don't think any of the competitors

575
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Smash dude

576
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
So we first

577
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
Did that in Beijing and any changes

578
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
It didn't work in Shanghai

579
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
That's very interesting people don't

580
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Dirt

581
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,544
They're just not going to work

582
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Awesome

583
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,832
Pretzel that supposed to earn experience in in Beijing for some to get some matches

584
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
You talked to all those 10 girls

585
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
Maybe 5 will dancer

586
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,536
Should get some matches if you don't say anything five of the girls will talk to you

587
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
That that's how big of a difference is there is

588
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:40,032
So why want to get Beijing Zoo to work we had this problem like how do we have the right there Manga

589
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,896
If you have 2 offline get each City to work that's a massive investment

590
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
It doesn't

591
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Feel like it's going to Skilled

592
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Right

593
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,320
So something we try this very interesting what's that

594
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
We changed

595
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
The maximum distance

596
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
From

597
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
100 km

598
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
200

599
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,632
100 + means infinite's bus the single biggest

600
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,448
Optimization we have done in the history of time

601
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
Like just that single change

602
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Made everyone laugh

603
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
So in a small City before you can maybe slip

604
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Clyde Carson

605
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
Right now we can slip those five cars and people in the other surrounding cities and if those were not enough you could see people

606
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
Score super happy users

607
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,464
Even if you were not so happy as long as you interact with this happy users

608
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,536
People tended to not care so much about location

609
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
Muffaletta sandwich

610
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,216
So immediately we got the whole China 2bs acted more lesson temperature retention the song

611
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
Is Beijing in chengdu

612
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
So we could just do it

613
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,640
Atmosphere of the Hulk

614
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:54,784
What's up left the maximum distance is it a hundred plus kilometers

615
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,112
Is Asheville I think like $2,000

616
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
Has China

617
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,304
Rustic 1200 miles

618
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
There's a lot of people close by

619
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
You don't notice that

620
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
No limits

621
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,240
It's only when there's not people around but that you noticed

622
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
How do you date

623
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Live far away from you

624
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
Oh yes I mean they were early on they were

625
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:30,880
Took a plane to me through this I mean it's insane the first day

626
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
Says you can only use each person once right

627
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,768
We had one of our own the female workers employees

628
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
Who ran downstairs like what's up what's up

629
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:44,192
So she bought a new SIM card to register new number new account because she miss

630
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Swiped

631
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
A die

632
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,032
So she wants to sweat that guy yet

633
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,616
Within the first month we had the first

634
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Married couple

635
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Rotisserie thank you email

636
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
That's how I fishing rods

637
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
So it's quite amazing

638
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
Persepolis look like

639
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,928
Western Dental

640
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
They usually connect to Facebook

641
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
So by doing that

642
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
They get the lot for free

643
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
I guess Facebook profiles are very good

644
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,704
Wright State the first of all

645
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
Almost

646
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
At least in the West

647
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
It's almost always of the real person

648
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Right

649
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
I saw the real person in the

650
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
It's not

651
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
Trying to look good

652
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:37,952
It's not better than the profile pictures upload for then

653
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,792
That's one the second is a lot of

654
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,400
They get their contacts for free to get Sturm Facebook fretrest for free so they know who their friends are

655
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
They also get their profile information

656
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,336
So the only thing you need to do is if he's right there with descriptionari sell everything else that you get for free

657
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,432
Also you get much higher conversion rate from down on the after signing up

658
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,224
Because it's like a one button press

659
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,040
So in China obviously can't do that

660
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
And

661
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Send

662
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,392
The Western Ave scannable

663
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,696
Odoo success because

664
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
Of this connection to Facebook

665
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,048
If you want to get this to work in China

666
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
You have to find a way to emulate

667
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
That success

668
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
Pretzel

669
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
So from the first day

670
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,872
WeedMaps

671
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
Not moderated all user profiles

672
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,272
So we remove all profiles

673
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
Who did not have a proper

674
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Which is like 40%

675
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Because that's how China is

676
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,024
And you obviously can't use WeChat because WeChat is it won't even worse than like 40

677
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,120
So we would ever use it when you sign up you actually invisible

678
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,424
No one can see if you can spot the other user

679
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,848
But what is quite efficient

680
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,200
And if you passed and people start seeing you don't listen that you don't need to know

681
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,040
If you didn't have motivation you'll get the phone saying hey you can use this

682
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,832
And you have to change your profile picture

683
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
So we did that from day one

684
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
So there has never been a system automatically pings user as the S8 become more active

685
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,608
They need to contribute more to their own profile

686
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
But is also like

687
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,728
Tan-tan no one has ever been seen

688
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,056
That has not been manually past moderation

689
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Okay

690
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
So that's very

691
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Big sacrifice

692
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,480
Take a self I think we have probably killed off

693
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
Like 80 million accounts

694
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,624
Enough

695
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
Power to do that manual

696
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Monterey

697
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
I mean we have hundreds of people doing now

698
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,424
This makes sense for you because like you said most user and upload look at 200 photos

699
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Yeah

700
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:01,568
So you want to make sure that these are high-quality to under photos

701
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,432
Right so I mean if you do that your excitement goes down a lot

702
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:13,344
But it's also we have to do that then we have to develop like a profile information system

703
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
For users to fill in the profile

704
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
They need to feel more alive so it's all

705
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
We have profile tags

706
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
And I think that's like 85% of the user

707
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Filling out tax

708
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
That's always also

709
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
Quite Vegas assassin

710
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
And then since I sign up with their phone numbers

711
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
We used to foam mattress

712
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Instead of the Facebook

713
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
So what we do there is that

714
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
We blocked all your phone contacts

715
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
It's like almost everyone

716
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
They don't want to see their color

717
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
What About Us

718
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,048
What they want

719
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Right

720
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:01,216
We push people who are secondary

721
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
The friends of friends are actually okay

722
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Got it

723
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
So that's how we used to call

724
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:15,552
Are you sign up and they automatically paying your whole contact list

725
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,648
That's what I mean you can call it features but I think it's more like it

726
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
You know operational Rockford IL

727
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Exactly how you operate

728
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
Are you Union

729
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
And you got everything through

730
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
The useless

731
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Cases

732
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,680
Make sure that user experience is optimized

733
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,056
For your moderation do you use automation like machine learning

734
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,104
We're looking at that for now but

735
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
So far is Alden Iowa

736
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,712
And that's the thing with China is quite cheap

737
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,064
So I said the funny thing is that we looked at some external

738
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
AI Solutions right for doing this

739
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
At which everyone else uses

740
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
More expensive Facebook

741
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Popular

742
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,192
So it took you don't even automate this you don't need to

743
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
Operation it

744
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
In China you can

745
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
So you have to be able to do that

746
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
So do people just moves

747
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,944
How do you prevent people from just moving the conversation to WeChat

748
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:21,600
Wednesday meat on Santa we want to maximize use experience so we don't want to print

749
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,904
I mean that's a natural need

750
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,976
I mean would we prevent them from exchanging phone numbers

751
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
. that's silly

752
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,584
Which has is probably more convenient than phone numbers

753
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
At this point

754
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,216
So where did what's the problem we saw like I said is 4

755
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Singles to meet people

756
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,056
We're not falling the hole

757
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,664
Keep in touch with your friends part because that would be just directly competing with each other

758
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Yep

759
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,784
A WeChat is not good for meeting new people

760
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:56,928
No no no no that's intentional use their biggest issue is that it's getting diluted right

761
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,768
Dating is a heavy that neuter of the French reference

762
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
So they don't want that is very weak.

763
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,776
And another thing is that even

764
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
If they change WeChat

765
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
Does the conversations tend to be quite short clip

766
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
Because it's not a friend

767
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
This is a potential

768
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Girlfriend voice

769
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,672
Is it works out then that's one person that you got if it doesn't work out you never talked to the right

770
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,488
So it doesn't really matter if that thing happens on

771
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,304
Countdown for WeChat because it's not like a long-term

772
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Relationship

773
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,728
Could you discuss the monetization strategy for 10:10 and would you monetize the same way if it was a western

774
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Product

775
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,312
Tim Short Term I think our Revenue

776
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,664
Strategy is very similar to how we would do it in the West

777
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
Right now it's kind of subscription-based

778
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,736
It's like buddy out of service

779
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
You pay a monthly fee

780
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
For a

781
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
Different sorts of

782
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
A premium features

783
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
What is a premium product right you can use it there's no

784
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
Can use it very well as a free user

785
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
But if you

786
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
Buy a subscription

787
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
It's much better

788
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,544
So that's what we're doing and actually

789
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
Butts

790
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,688
One of the things with China versus the West I think

791
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Is that

792
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
The median arcuate

793
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Tend to be lower

794
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,368
But you can definitely get the average are put to be higher

795
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:36,000
Salar outliers mostly about the top 1%

796
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
If you find Revenue models were there's no limits on how much you can spend because the subscription obviously if you want to spend more

797
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,240
There is healing right

798
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
But if you find

799
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
Irelia model such a sin

800
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,408
Games or live streaming rights where you can spend as much as he wants

801
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
The pool house

802
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
Yeah and then there's people spending tens of millions amount

803
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
Brighton

804
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,136
Those are at like 1% of the revenues

805
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,720
And you use a significant increase the

806
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
The average RP

807
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,560
So those are things we are going to look at

808
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
Ecobee4

809
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,424
But there's no need for us to be too aggressive about it yet because

810
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
We're still melted in a gross

811
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
So it's not mushy

812
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
If you look at the

813
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,920
Profiles of the most active users on 1010

814
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Are there all

815
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
Just young users or are they

816
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
Different

817
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
Profiles different

818
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Kinds of user

819
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:37,696
Nowadays since we have reached a certain scale we used to be very much about

820
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Miriam Makeba

821
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,024
What is canopy in expanding

822
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,304
So is it

823
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
It's more

824
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,400
Expanding towards all sorts of people

825
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
But it's

826
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
More of a focus around young people

827
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,872
Now it's like 25

828
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
Interesting used to be in college

829
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
Nose people helping

830
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:06,112
Out of college and working for a lot of surge of users were like 35 buses

831
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
And for the loss of War 35

832
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Or even older

833
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
What has attracted them

834
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
To come

835
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,168
But the thing is like I said there are really knows alternative

836
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,728
Looks like neither online or offline

837
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
So if you want to meet someone

838
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Which

839
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,872
If you're like a single or the divorced person or something

840
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
I mean

841
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
That's like a

842
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,504
Kung Fu right that's it like a super

843
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
You have to

844
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,624
So as long as they know about us they're going to try it.

845
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,976
How do you think the dating culture is Tianjin do you think 10th and contributed to that change

846
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,792
Only hope we have contributed

847
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,912
I think the Revolutionary service was really cute

848
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
So they can alike

849
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Open up this whole

850
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
Web friends

851
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Kind of notion

852
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
It's kind of like

853
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
Facebook

854
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,640
Which had an order this world about dating

855
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,736
And they were smart about it so this quickly switch over to friends management

856
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Which is much larger

857
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
Frosty

858
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,392
WeChat already owns that market that doesn't really make sense

859
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
See that's how they did it

860
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,976
It was all about

861
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Strangers

862
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,280
Don't have any friends

863
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
That's so

864
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,656
I mean people my age that I know of

865
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
Drop in China

866
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,752
I mean half of the MetLife.

867
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Throughout

868
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
That's how big I think

869
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
So

870
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,224
I think the whole you know online Romancing

871
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
Revolutionize

872
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,904
Widely accepted among the population for use

873
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,952
So that's nothing

874
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
Made any difference

875
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
I think what were you kinda like

876
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
Hopefully contributed to is that

877
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
We made it easy

878
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
In recent

879
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,704
Biggest reasons your sister

880
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,264
Has not been too many good solution

881
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
And I wouldn't say we are

882
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
That's awesome

883
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Either

884
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Butts

885
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
We're definitely better than most of the competitors

886
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
So

887
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
That's why even though I think we have

888
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,856
Big room for improvements

889
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
We're still

890
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Better so.

891
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
Significant

892
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,168
A matches like over ten billion matches today send each matches like over the two people right so it's like

893
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
20 billion experiences

894
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,800
And even like a we don't know how many people

895
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
You know got together because of this

896
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,896
But even like a very conservative

897
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,944
Estimate is tens of Millions

898
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
With n

899
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
There is like

900
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,112
300 million singles word you know people who could

901
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Be counted in that category

902
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
So tell him

903
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Quite significant

904
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
Witness with any dating app

905
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,840
Idiopathic effect measures

906
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,168
Not prevent frost and harassment so far

907
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,216
Especially for the production of the women use

908
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
What are the things that you have done

909
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,080
That your products that work well

910
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,408
And what are the other new measures you may want to add

911
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
Overtime Timothy music

912
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
Express even better and safer

913
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
So

914
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
I can't talk

915
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,320
In Broad Strokes about

916
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
What we have done we can't I can't go into details because

917
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,416
It's Secret

918
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
It's like a

919
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,584
Charter anti-hacker can obtain

920
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
I'd like

921
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
Ever continuous prices also

922
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,776
That the spammers and Salon they tend to operate in

923
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Did they have a huge like

924
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Supply chain

925
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,920
That's all there is there are people who are specialized in terms of

926
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Trading accounts

927
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,808
People who are specialized in terms of

928
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Getting matches

929
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,208
34A specialized in terms of getting those matches to add other accounts on WeChat

930
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,072
And then there is another group of people who taught Chats on WeChat to get their business.

931
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,144
Assembly line

932
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
Old fourth Parsons operated by different people

933
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,032
And it's quite professionally operated

934
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
What I think we even know the office

935
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
And I by now I think there's only like one or two players left that still are able to do anything

936
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Because we busy

937
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,160
The barrier text barrier of getting

938
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
Is today being able to do anything

939
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
So big now

940
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
Most people just can't do it

941
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,352
So it is all about this kind of like

942
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
Pacioretty how to hack your account

943
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Game

944
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
You

945
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,008
Prevent them from being able to do each of these four steps

946
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Lights

947
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,848
You have to do it in a way where

948
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
Even if they know what you do

949
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
They can't do anything about it

950
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
He cannot be baseball all strategies

951
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
If they don't know what we're doing

952
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,136
Then it works if they know then you can just recommend it

953
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:59,232
Beds for sample if they build a certain type of profiles and we we

954
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
Find certain keyword

955
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
And we we we we Banda Ms on a TV

956
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,120
Then it's very easy for the day because

957
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
And you just remove the keyboard

958
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,472
By doing this what we did is that we educated

959
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
So we made them better we made them

960
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
Create

961
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,104
Profiles in the future that look more like a real person

962
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
Which is really bad you don't want you want you don't want. It's right there

963
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
If you reach write essay in Indian you can

964
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
Cast metal

965
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
So it's kind of like an enigma

966
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,648
You can never use the information you get from ending

967
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
You have to get there you have to

968
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
Kill them with other means

969
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,840
Because the whole thing is that you don't you don't you can't let them know that you know

970
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,656
So it's quite complicated but but in the end you have to

971
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
Use methods were

972
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,520
Even if they know what you do there's just no way around it

973
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
It's like a hard block

974
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,128
Whosampled the day by Bunches of love

975
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,176
Phone numbers like 10000.

976
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Sequential phone numbers right

977
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
So if you see

978
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,344
Certain patterns are in infinity band or 10000

979
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Becomes much more expensive than by those numbers

980
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
Stuff like that

981
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
I didn't we have problems mental

982
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Thousands of different goals

983
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,376
And it isn't a i formulas for 404 how to cash them

984
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Difficult

985
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,240
ShopRite like a Spam account in Samsung

986
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
I think we have probably done this

987
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,664
Better than any other player in the social sphere and I include all the friends management

988
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Services Selter

989
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,552
I mean we talked to two people managing and dispatch on WeChat they were scared of

990
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
Like

991
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
How high we set the bar

992
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,184
80% of people we kill off are not even

993
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
Define that's timers

994
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
So

995
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,864
The result is that you don't have to see that many spammers on

996
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,168
At least compared to most other services.

997
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:50,592
So in 2018 we all win this this so-called phone call or Pete for social apps in China with a lot

998
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:56,223
Water companies launching new chat apps or social networks and investors pouring a lot of money into these products

999
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
But it's

1000
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:03,391
, we agree that it's still very difficult to challenge the dominant position that WeChat has in all Chinese people social

1001
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Do you think startups

1002
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
In the field should

1003
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,535
Seek to challenge at all or should they just work with WeChat

1004
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
I think like

1005
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
Social is a pretty Broad

1006
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Concept

1007
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,239
But this phone call what we're referring to I think

1008
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,799
Part of its with where we talk about you know

1009
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:25,151
Socializing with strangers. Kind of adopted because of our acquisition

1010
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
I think

1011
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,991
People people

1012
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
Succeed with social app

1013
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
Exit opportunities

1014
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
So.

1015
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
I think more than half

1016
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:42,303
And then the other part which is people doing you don't like the friends management part trying to challenge WeChat

1017
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,863
And I think it's smashed if more difficult

1018
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
I wouldn't say that it's impossible

1019
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
I think there's definitely

1020
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Opportunities out there because

1021
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,567
To the two days there is not been a proper

1022
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,127
Implementation of something like

1023
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
Instagram

1024
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Or

1025
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Snapchat

1026
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
In China

1027
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,759
People failed

1028
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
4 years

1029
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
We doing Facebook

1030
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
In China

1031
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
Yogi hot Tyson

1032
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
God's favor

1033
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Facebook

1034
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,607
It went with the whole friends feet something that works at all in China

1035
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
And obviously

1036
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,703
Right so is it is it is not about

1037
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,519
If the concept works or not this is just about

1038
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,055
If you are able to operate

1039
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
Correctly like I said

1040
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,895
Send it

1041
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Socialism

1042
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,759
Quite difficult you have to really get into the minds of users

1043
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
And then you have to implement a simple today

1044
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,391
So I think you need a lot of experience

1045
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,791
You know a lot like birds

1046
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
I think

1047
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Entrepreneurs like that

1048
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,727
So I think

1049
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,311
If I'm seen with tried something like that he would have a pretty good track

1050
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,383
He was come out right on

1051
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
He knows his stuff work with social but there's not

1052
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,831
478 years

1053
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,927
It's not that people work without experience

1054
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
Become a master at Social

1055
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,767
So I think the biggest block

1056
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,191
So that combination just hasn't really happened yet

1057
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Only very few

1058
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,871
Can do it maybe you can or do it again or someone like Alex true or lie

1059
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
Lewis from

1060
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,943
Musically if it come out

1061
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
Let's do it again baby

1062
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
There's not a lot of people

1063
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,183
And you need a lot of luck and I mean which I think is much more dominant than Facebook it says follow

1064
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,767
Because they have the whole i m park

1065
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,839
And I am I think it's even more important than friends feat

1066
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,631
Earlier you mentioned

1067
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,447
That that when it comes to our proof of Chinese users

1068
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
The median

1069
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Arpu is low

1070
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,079
But the average the mean could be high because of the whales

1071
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Of the Hyatt

1072
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
Yes so

1073
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,223
Ization He also mentioned maybe gaming or

1074
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
Live streaming are better ways to

1075
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Capture the whales

1076
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
Getting to spend

1077
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
Without much upper limit

1078
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
Don't when it comes to motivation for you

1079
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,767
Why did you choose not to build a towel yourself

1080
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Instead

1081
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
Decide to sell

1082
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
2

1083
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,167
Who was pretty good answers to areas

1084
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,215
And we were thinking about selling

1085
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
Besides mom or did you think of anyone else by

1086
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Tencent

1087
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
We also

1088
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Has capability

1089
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
MS2 areas

1090
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
So did the thing with Mama on

1091
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
We were not looking for a

1092
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,783
In a position we were racing around

1093
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
And it was going

1094
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Exceptionally well

1095
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,695
So I think like two weeks after we open up the round

1096
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,743
We already had term sheet

1097
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,791
It's an unfinished

1098
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
So

1099
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
We would have been able to close the ear out

1100
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
But at that point

1101
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,007
Momo approached us to R&S advisor China Renaissance

1102
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
And we have never met

1103
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Tanya before

1104
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,431
So are we expecting was funny quotes

1105
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,503
Interesting idea to meet meet up and we did it

1106
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,319
And we hit it off quite well

1107
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
Body of Sonic ice

1108
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,415
Yeah I mean like I said it's quite

1109
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,231
Difficult to succeed in in the social sphere

1110
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
Right

1111
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
So

1112
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,303
You noticed that

1113
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,143
A lot of the philosophies are actually quite similar similar

1114
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,703
I mean mom has gotten a lot of

1115
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,103
You know from media and also before I know how smart he is

1116
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Andy Anderson

1117
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,455
So that was feeling

1118
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,831
Installed where they with monetization

1119
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
You know what to expect

1120
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,415
But nowadays since we have

1121
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:57,279
Succeeded quite well with its already we are

1122
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,863
Quiet confidence right

1123
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,191
Just a year ago but we had

1124
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,263
Less than ten times of what we haven't tried so

1125
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Weed in Reno

1126
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
What will happen

1127
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,687
And for us to keep growing we would need to spend much more in Athens Market

1128
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,015
We will need to significantly increase our marketing budget

1129
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,575
So the risks were definitely

1130
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
I thought that

1131
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,487
On the stock exchange their market cap so companies were

1132
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
A little bit too high

1133
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,351
So very big chance of like a big drop

1134
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
And now I know it's because of this

1135
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Something ride the bus

1136
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,751
Anything else could also have

1137
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
You made it happen then you could have even worse

1138
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,455
So if that happened and we would stand having you spend our money on marketing

1139
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,783
Revenues to grow

1140
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,575
We will be in that pretty.

1141
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,367
Stop so we definitely had that

1142
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Risks to

1143
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
And the second part is that

1144
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
Working

1145
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,023
Along with mama tambien

1146
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,351
I mean if look at us today we are we are running the company

1147
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Quiet in the Tennessee

1148
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
In terms of the product

1149
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,447
And operationally

1150
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
So

1151
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
Price difference

1152
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
Getting acquired versus racing after you know around

1153
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,407
It's actually not that the Earth

1154
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
The feeling is quite

1155
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,015
Scimitar and we're getting a lot of help

1156
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,831
From a stronger

1157
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Morris.

1158
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
Text

1159
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,439
Weihai

1160
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,023
A lot of different strengths in terms of how we operate our products

1161
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
So by saying the strength

1162
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
It's

1163
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,119
It's quite helpful for both sides

1164
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,703
You know together we Morris own the Hallmark

1165
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
And the value of that versus you know just

1166
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,823
You know competing is I think is much better

1167
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Yes

1168
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
Stop. That's how we thought about it

1169
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:54,271
And iiii don't forget it's even though we have managed to get some Revenue swans

1170
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
In

1171
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,183
No more I like you I think

1172
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
Audi

1173
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,255
Or tencent approach you as well

1174
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,815
Alibaba was investor in Toronto

1175
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Ashley

1176
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,423
And tencent is someone we have spoken with for a long time

1177
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
And the issue there is

1178
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
It's like I said you know

1179
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
Shoot challenge is the delusion

1180
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,431
So it's hard to see how we can significantly

1181
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,247
Contribution tg2 2 to mm

1182
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,623
Regardless how well

1183
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,183
We do is more like a financial a message for them

1184
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
So that's why I did

1185
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,303
The date they want to focus more on you know it's a teachable

1186
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
If we

1187
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,911
You know properties with $0.10

1188
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,959
In the way we do

1189
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
We would not get as much

1190
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,823
You know how them priority as we're getting

1191
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,407
And the Synergy would be quite different

1192
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
WeChat is not there

1193
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
But as soon as you can wear with QQ

1194
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Could

1195
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
But

1196
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
It will be very different conversation

1197
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
Yes and QQ is like a monster into like those who fought at the end the end the organization rights

1198
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,863
Toyota at Mama

1199
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,007
Yeah I mean this is really been a pleasure

1200
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,335
Has your day today changed

1201
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:27,967
Too much I mean we do try to extract it as much energy as possible but

1202
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:31,551
We both think it's better to operate small end table

1203
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,391
Streaming and gaming operations

1204
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
Do you plan to

1205
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,975
Leverage their know-how

1206
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,279
And I do more on your own platform

1207
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
We're just going to leverage their know-how

1208
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:51,263
It's more that we're trying to find ways to get inspired by Gaming and live streaming

1209
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,543
Degenerative

1210
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,103
You know models that are similar

1211
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
Masses are exactly the same

1212
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,015
And if we do something like live streaming but I wanted to be

1213
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,551
A little bit more

1214
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855
Kind of like how

1215
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Trifle dessert

1216
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Craigslist

1217
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
Probably like the biggest live streaming

1218
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,327
Player out there and you could also say that they are like a live streaming company

1219
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,911
But you definitely don't feel that they're alive streaming how products

1220
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,959
It's a lot more social

1221
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
So that's

1222
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,287
If we do something like that that's how I wanted to feel like

1223
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:29,151
And that's the challenge but there's no urgency either

1224
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
So so

1225
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
It's more and more about girls

1226
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:37,343
I think a lot of Founders in Chinese specially the younger Founders tend to have is attachment

1227
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,647
To what they built and they're less

1228
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
Open to

1229
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,207
M&a ideas

1230
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,023
What is your advice to Founders like

1231
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,583
At what point should you say

1232
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,399
I built this but it's probably better off

1233
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
As part of you know another company

1234
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
Yeah I don't know how

1235
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,799
How blunt I can be

1236
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,103
Just completely blondes

1237
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
If you do not feel

1238
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
As the founder

1239
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:05,503
You don't get quite far from seeing the money

1240
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,319
But that's a major difference

1241
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
Yeah you got a lot of faith

1242
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:18,047
And I don't know if you're doing if you're doing a starter for face work for it

1243
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
Money in the long run I think most people

1244
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
For the money

1245
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,447
This week in a basketball forum

1246
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,799
But the Detroit is find someone who can be a partner

1247
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,615
If you went out that your garage

1248
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,943
Then you pretty much giving up your baby in take a shower in

1249
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,759
You won't have much control the product afterwards anymore

1250
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Exactly

1251
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
So for this episode we experimented with

1252
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:47,743
Crowdsourcing questions from our listeners community in a couple questions from our listeners

1253
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:52,607
And by the way here's a message for our listeners if you want to contribute questions

1254
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
The haunted house on the show please join our listeners which a group of slack Channel at 9 and 6. Gbc.com

1255
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:04,895
So here's a question from Jenny was a co-founder of walk the chat a WeChat marketing agency what is the

1256
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,943
Chris Astoria managing

1257
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,551
Data in China what kind of regulatory difficulties have you encountered with

1258
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:15,391
Regard to data on your platform for example users my post

1259
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,279
Revealing photos of themselves and how do you make full use of data other than for optimizing a product

1260
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Okay so

1261
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,399
Tom Thumb we try to be a very data-driven

1262
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,983
P1 for many years

1263
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,519
And with this

1264
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
Is it a sin all sources

1265
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Wrong way

1266
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,127
But I think in a long

1267
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Run

1268
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,479
We felt everything we saw from Facebook made

1269
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
So much sense

1270
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,063
So we wanted to operate the products

1271
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
Run a T Test

1272
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,207
Don't try to be to top-down driven

1273
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
Don't rely on genius theaters

1274
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:59,935
Did anyone with the bright ideas to try out their stuff and it did if datawise it's good

1275
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,471
If it's not you drop

1276
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,007
And sales tax

1277
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
Sailor Lee

1278
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
You know release early and its rates

1279
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
That that sort of

1280
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
Thinking right

1281
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,991
And aside from that in terms of data obviously

1282
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
So I'll wear them

1283
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,575
And for us

1284
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
I mean

1285
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
The people you see is

1286
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
Is based on

1287
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
An algorithm

1288
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
So that's like

1289
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
The key part of our product

1290
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,815
So that's obviously a big

1291
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
Carter Harvey news

1292
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Data

1293
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,191
To try to optimize the user experience report for users

1294
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:32,959
But

1295
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
Think of that ass

1296
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,311
Having any

1297
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
Privacy plication

1298
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Because no one

1299
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
I was looking at it it's just like machine learning

1300
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,735
In terms of other other parts

1301
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,807
Like I said we manually moderate

1302
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
So

1303
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,367
All explicit content

1304
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
Are filtered out

1305
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
So I don't think you have

1306
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,511
Ever you would ever see anything bad on them

1307
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,583
That's been the culture for so long now

1308
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,655
People don't upload explicit content

1309
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
How do you spell flight like

1310
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
It's less than

1311
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,007
0.1% of our content

1312
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,543
That actually is bad

1313
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
It's not

1314
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,431
A person that just like a shoe or something

1315
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,479
In the dust of the biggest issue

1316
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,807
So expressive, and stuff like that is actually not a big issue

1317
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
And like I said spammers evens to do something

1318
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,439
Because we have so strict

1319
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,791
Monitoring of every like automatic

1320
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,351
So they did they cancel

1321
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,887
So

1322
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,959
Even people saying bad words

1323
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
It's a

1324
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
Super small percentage of

1325
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
Hobbs architects

1326
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,663
Here's the next question from json Liu

1327
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,199
A software engineer at Google

1328
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,527
How did you validate your product market fit

1329
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,831
And get that first round

1330
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
Active users

1331
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
And what a mess

1332
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
Actress do you use

1333
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,999
Help you to do part of the interracial

1334
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
Yeah so

1335
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,863
I think I went through muscle.

1336
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,423
One part was this offline

1337
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Acquisition of users

1338
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,287
One part was that we invited all uses on p12 Jun-hyung

1339
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,359
And that's like an unique as if no one else has

1340
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Because that

1341
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:20,479
Basically the best-looking guys and girls you can find in China

1342
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Rats

1343
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:25,855
We don't get too many people to sign up with like 20,000

1344
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,695
Interval scale didn't make a big difference between X alexiad users

1345
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,743
You just can't get anything better

1346
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,327
So so so so that's one part and then

1347
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:41,727
And the rest I can describe in terms of like the philosophy and the end of operation rationale

1348
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,007
Who won the 2000 starter

1349
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
Underestimate

1350
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
How much learning

1351
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,615
One has to have the patience

1352
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
Just two people

1353
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,455
Without doing pee while you are never

1354
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,247
Handmade thinking work

1355
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:57,599
The idea could be exactly the same

1356
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:03,743
Far out wrong in like so many seals of our philosophies

1357
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Ouija 1

1358
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
At the front

1359
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Time points

1360
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,703
You know it would just be laughable experience from a big company what is a human attention

1361
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
Orali

1362
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,775
Or Google may help somewhat

1363
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,615
But unless you make your fair share of mistakes and learn from them

1364
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
It's not enough

1365
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
Exactly I mean

1366
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
One example

1367
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,759
The first two three years AP1

1368
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,831
We are not products ribbon nortek driven

1369
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,111
We were Grand River

1370
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,695
So all was about building this

1371
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
High and ran people with

1372
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,399
But that's not how you succeed with scaling internet

1373
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,727
But with all that experience you wouldn't have the initial users

1374
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
Oh no

1375
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,775
Exactly

1376
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:52,639
I mean I just know why you can succeed without trying to do it brand ribbon this is no way

1377
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,687
And also feels like

1378
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:58,271
No matter what you want to do you have to do something to you personally

1379
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,551
Passionately believe in

1380
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:04,159
So that even if the real you talk is different from other people's wrote

1381
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
Overtime

1382
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,463
You learn and adjust

1383
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,767
Everything you did before becoming used for

1384
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,791
For the next venture

1385
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Definitely

1386
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:18,751
You have finally a question from eating you along a business developing professionally Hong Kong with also Swedish Chinese

1387
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,079
What are the skill sets and valleys from Sweden that has helped you

1388
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:26,943
Imbued are startup in China what are the advantages and disadvantages of being sweaters Chinese

1389
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,807
So internship first disadvantages I knew very little about China

1390
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,111
And the problem was that

1391
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:40,767
I was I was so bad I didn't understand how bad it was

1392
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,119
That's that's a like a common issue I think with most things I've seen many employees as well

1393
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,655
Or or competitors

1394
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,423
They're just

1395
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
You're not good enough to understand how bad you are

1396
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
It took me seven years

1397
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
To realize that okay I don't understand this job

1398
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,967
That's very honest

1399
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
I tried to compensate for that

1400
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,343
Only took a year to starting to understand more, better

1401
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,671
That's a bit of a mess you see the problem is hard to solve

1402
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
Like I said

1403
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,399
Having seen many perspectives of different things

1404
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
I think you have the much open mind

1405
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
About them everything

1406
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,311
And Sweden is a very

1407
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
Communistic

1408
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:36,831
I think it's even a communist level

1409
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,951
It is a cultural issue tried so

1410
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Is everyone is married

1411
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
That I think keeps employees happy

1412
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,887
I'd say it's easier to

1413
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,447
To to interact with people

1414
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
Well

1415
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,519
You don't have this body bossy attitude

1416
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
So I think that's one of the things that have

1417
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
We have had going for us

1418
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
We have pretty happy employees generally

1419
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:06,527
But you mentioned that you don't believe in having a genius boss

1420
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:12,159
So everybody can have the idea and you stayed at to test it tested that's good

1421
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:17,023
If you look at Facebook most of the stuff that actually made in words

1422
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
We're not

1423
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
From something

1424
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,655
What's something

1425
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,703
So the genius of Zuckerberg is trying

1426
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,751
To build a platform that

1427
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
Purchases

1428
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,103
Brides and what makes it very easy

1429
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,943
Back in the days where they were doing just PHP in web websites

1430
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,247
They could babysit single lines and colors

1431
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
I mean I don't think anyone has ever

1432
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:46,207
I also think because of your experience living

1433
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:49,535
The Western Society you know how dating could be different

1434
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
And how

1435
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,607
The ways people meet each other could be different

1436
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,887
Because of you

1437
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,471
Robin China all you see is how the Chinese

1438
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
Way of interacting

1439
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:03,103
And also we have a lot of information from Western companies

1440
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,431
Right and I think it's quite hard to understand them

1441
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,711
Without having my

1442
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,247
Experience my sweetheart

1443
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,319
Which should I open ask one more question before

1444
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,855
Zara cosita quickfire

1445
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Session

1446
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,695
Which is like you said not many founders

1447
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
I've experienced

1448
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,279
Living and working overseas

1449
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,095
In addition to making something work in China

1450
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
A lot of Chinese models

1451
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
Can be exported

1452
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
2

1453
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
The other Emerging Markets

1454
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
Other world

1455
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
The next new 1 billion

1456
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,639
Users will come from outside of us and China

1457
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:41,503
So what do you think of companies like bytedance trying to expand

1458
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,295
In four markets

1459
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,831
And for you personally

1460
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,903
You feel that either inside 10 times

1461
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
Or more or

1462
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,487
Something new are you home later

1463
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,303
Do you want to do something that's more global

1464
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
In the next ten

1465
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,351
Frontier

1466
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
Justice symbol

1467
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
Yes definitely

1468
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
I mean

1469
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
Once in a time in T1 we

1470
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Try to Define our core values

1471
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
They didn't help at all

1472
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,663
I mean for what it's worth one of them was like a Global Perspective

1473
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,967
So I think that's one of the things that makes it

1474
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
Different than other companies

1475
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
So we're definitely have a global Outlook

1476
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,367
Everything we do but we have to focus on China

1477
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,719
And we have a good shot

1478
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
You know those

1479
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Expanding

1480
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
In two different areas in Social

1481
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,655
In China and also if you know but we've been dating and social about abroad

1482
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,471
So that's something we have already started doing

1483
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
You know some working but it's not

1484
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
The highest priority yet

1485
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,407
I think that's a Subaru

1486
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
Impress company that that's

1487
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:47,807
They're probably did the one in China has implemented this whole

1488
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
Can a Facebook

1489
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,879
Type of operation

1490
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,695
Data-driven

1491
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,231
A b testing town like

1492
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,047
Open up everyone can try different sorts of things

1493
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,327
Culture

1494
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
I am going to like your faucet

1495
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,447
Did they are very aggressive

1496
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Brett

1497
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
Maybe to Abra

1498
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
So if there's any

1499
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
If there's anything.

1500
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
You know

1501
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
Wood

1502
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,199
B22 there a disadvantage it's my feeder aggressiveness

1503
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,479
That's also their strength

1504
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,295
So we will see how it goes

1505
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,343
But it's definitely

1506
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Exciting company

1507
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,695
And one-of-a-kind I think in the world

1508
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
There's no one

1509
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,279
The apps I've seen the in the west who are

1510
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,095
You know Jose to their level of rest.

1511
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,727
We do see a lot of Founders from Latin America from Southeast Asia

1512
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
India

1513
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
Beginning not just want to learn from us

1514
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:46,175
Breaking Christian learn from what fungus in China have done as well

1515
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,479
It is super exciting for us

1516
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,063
To be in the middle of everything and help Founders learn from each other

1517
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,623
We we think. I'm building a Global

1518
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:58,207
Community Global product this is much more interesting way to live

1519
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:06,143
So next we'll jump into Irondequoit fire questions so we can just say the first thing that comes to your mind

1520
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423

Assistant jobs

1522
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287

1523
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
Able to

1524
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,639
Absopure visions of what series

1525
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,175
What what is doing in

1526
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
Haven't

1527
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015
So well

1528
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,343
And have been able to get this whole team to

1529
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
You know

1530
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
How do you say race

1531
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,207

1532
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,279
To his level and get it to get them. Shift

1533
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047

1534
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
On time

1535
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,119
And I think that's also came from

1536
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
His

1537
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Misfortune

1538
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,519
He would never have been able to do that do it if everything is well

1539
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
Desperately

1540
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,151
What's a book you read recently that you recommend

1541
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,247
Have not read too many books recently

1542
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,439
I was not too impressed by the first book

1543
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,975
And then I was

1544
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,279
And even less impressed by the

1545
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,815
Beginning of the second book but

1546
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,119
From the second part of a second blog on Tumblr

1547
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,399

Really

1563
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:48,799

1573
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,951
Took too much time is allowed

1574
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,255
