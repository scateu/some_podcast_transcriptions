She worked at Google

53
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Where he co-founded

54
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Google bring

55
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
Deep learning

56
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816

Thanks for having me

63
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
Let's talk about what are you up to

64
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Custom discussion

65
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
About what

66
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
What's your latest

67
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
Since you left baidu

68
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Can you share with us

69
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
What excite you

70
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
Good morning is this the idea of building an AI Paula Society I think that AI technology has

71
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
Has advanced enough that we see a relatively clear part 2

72
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,888
Making self-driving cars a reality for everyone maybe someday

73
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Giving every child a precise Tutera

74
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
Maybe also giving everyone

75
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
High-quality low-cost access to healthcare

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,432
They radiating every segment of society every major industry will be transformed by a over the neck

77
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Decade

78
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
And I think that's all

79
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:34,624
No one company not even as the Logitech comfort you can do all the work what's up

80
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,464
Let a ibus in all the ways it can be to prove human life

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
So

82
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
I recently announced one of things I'm doing is announcing a new set of courses on Coursera on teeth learning

83
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,984
They try to train out maybe the millions of people me the millions of your listeners.

84
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,104
Neat that could benefit from learning PCI to so use the most creative ways that

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
I myself would never have prenup

86
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
You recently started a project called Deep learning. AI

87
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
Could you show us more about what that's about and how that

88
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Effort has been going

89
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Sophie funny.

90
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,280
Treating this new educational content review courses on deep learning

91
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
Hosted on Coursera

92
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Oh and I hope will help

93
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
Educate puffy millions of people

94
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,520
What's the latest deep learning to so that they can go and invent all the wonderful things

95
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
That I can can be invented with deep learning

96
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Cuz you'll be more of it

97
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
To see model or two model who

98
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
The audience

99
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
What US

100
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
Yep today we have learned his individual learning is coming to call Sarah to take quizzes on deep learning

101
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
And also

102
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
Are there also over 500

103
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,512
Companies and governments working directly with Coursera

104
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,096
They tried to educate that were forces or the citizens of these different countries

105
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
So I think that's a cool star has been a great

106
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
Educational to

107
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
To reach lots of individuals as well as

108
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Companies and governments

109
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
So Andrew given that your last work at a Chinese checker

110
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,712
I wonder how China figures in your vision for AI

111
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,320
Especially now that we're seeing a lot more research and experts coming out of town

112
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
Are you seeing an increase in

113
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Interest from China in your courses and your project

114
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
If special the newly-announced government fight in China on a I didn't reason they are in China has always been

115
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
I think it's even harder in the last few months

116
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,007
So I planted grass with netezza in Chinese

117
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,151
Supposed a lot of our educational content on their website in China to make it more easy accessible

118
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
But I think the China

119
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
Ecosystem is just incredible

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,391
Globally the two top incentives of innovation for here today are Silicon Valley in Beijing

121
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
The office Silicon Valley in Beijing I think

122
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,047
You know calendar London a few other places maybe New York also very good

123
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,935
Not yet seen any other senses with the intensity and Italian than the rapid loss to you

124
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
Silicon Valley in Beijing

125
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
So we see on Twitter you ask

126
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Recruiting

127
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
Osaka

128
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
So far and where they

129
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Where the Talent come from

130
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,527
You know since announcing deep learning AI I was surprised at the number of people

131
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
Contacted us even before we posted any job positions to try to volunteer or work with us if you're as ways

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
What building of a team Volta

133
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Help with

134
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,911
Something for doing what you think is what was some new projects that we haven't announced yet

135
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
So I hope that's what you've learned. Yeah you can train out many people

136
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
That will do wonderful things that maybe someday someone in a village will figure out how to use machine learning to optimize

137
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
What's a supplier

138
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
Help nature locally and improve

139
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
I need water. That's great

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,135
There's some AR vertical applications I'm excited about this well so we just

141
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:52,511
Building a team took off to some of those things now have you seen a lot of applicants coming from

142
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
I'm tryna and a lot of Chinese students

143
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
For your online courses

144
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,239
Yeah right I'm seeing a lot of interest definitely in the US and in China

145
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,823
Tell work if I said to proceed you say off utilities

146
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
I think they I frankly is global almost see a lot of interest in sleeping Valley everything also a lot of interest in India

147
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,295
And if you end of the road

148
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,135
The recent rise of deep learning the recent rise of AI technology

149
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,439
Gives everyone a chance to build

150
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
The next generation of companies

151
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,071
One of the things I learned in washing the rise of the internet

152
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Is maybe 20-25 years ago

153
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
Was that if you take a shopping mall and go to website for it that does not turn the shopping mall into an internet company

154
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,687
What makes a Trudy internet company is not just where I want you run their website is much deeper than that is what are not

155
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:48,575
YouTube pervasive a b testing whether or not you're short animation times I should probably everyday route 261

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,231
With the rise of a I think that was starting where all sides to figure out what is it that you need to find an AI company how do you unlock

157
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Take your company

158
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Tavares AI capabilities

159
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,679
And I think this gives yeah Rich opportunities both to incompetence as well as such as Google and Baidu

160
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
Transform themselves into AI companies

161
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
As with a lot of opportunities for

162
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:13,919
New cities and countries and you companies to arise W maybe the future of eating a organization

163
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,759
He was still in the early days of this exciting wave of the Dollar Man

164
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
What are you say

165
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
For the first class

166
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
You're offering

167
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
Michael Cera

168
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
You put it all last week

169
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
That was over a thousand people

170
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Sign up

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
The first

172
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
24-hours already

173
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
Oh that's why on campus Santa Claus

174
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,703
Staz over thousand people of the closer cause this much larger than a thousand what's the number now

175
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:43,103
Yoda first machine learning course that offer Uncle Sarah had / 1.8 million in Romans so

176
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
OverWatch.

177
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,687
Over the last several years have lost five

178
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,855
Interest in the number of people were bringing into the Machinery community

179
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
When you look at these

180
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Should have inbound interest

181
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Is the

182
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Have you ever done any analysis

183
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Breakdown by Jack

184
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Graffiti words coming from

185
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Willows Global Buy

186
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
How is a concentrator on the

187
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Countries or

188
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,823
So I think the majority of learning machine learning a lot of them come from

189
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
The US China India

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
I'm also a lot from the UK

191
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
And I think a lot from Germany as one of her correctly

192
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Is really quite Global Pets

193
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
The top three

194
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
In the area of a startup

195
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Have you seen

196
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
Or through your source to network

197
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Here

198
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
The type of a startup

199
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
LARPing fun

200
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Today or B

201
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
You started

202
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
What's kebab

203
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
In the end

204
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Nexiq

205
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
You know I'm excited about a ice application into a lot of different vertical Industries

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
So couple Industries assessment

207
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
I looking at include Healthcare

208
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Education

209
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,463
That's up to you seen a lot of Industries Destra CIT Revolution

210
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Digitization Revolution

211
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,143
And that Trace data Western enables the AI Revolution to come in and eat today's entry in value

212
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Soap

213
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,983
Maybe 10 years ago in the law of energy say Healthcare

214
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,615
Aulani activities was recorded on a piece of paper that might be found in some filing cabinet

215
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
Ohio

216
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
That the overtime

217
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
Thanks the rise of electronic medical records

218
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
Globally

219
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
Now is that piece of paper floating around in

220
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,231
I like how it is all very well and all that is now stored in databases is much with digital

221
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,863
I just burped opportunities for AI to come in and learn from down and make predictions entry value

222
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
And just as I am

223
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Long time ago your ex

224
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
Would have been a physical piece of film today is much more likely to be Digital Image as of the digitization

225
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Healthcare

226
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,455
Creates a lot of opportunities for learning algorithms for AI

227
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
And I think the education as well

228
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
You know 10 years ago

229
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
A lot of sage University education what the professor saying a bunch of warts

230
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
The Aether Wildest Dream the students brain

231
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,559
For the most part no digital trace of that

232
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,679
The things the rise of online education such as cerebral

233
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
There's not much more Digital Data about what was previously unlock activities in the your student's grade

234
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,199
I want to see species of paper floating all around the world but now some fraction of that

235
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,271
Standard digital realm and now does it take to record

236
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,855
What students are the Whispers questions directly and indirectly

237
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
And all that data

238
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Means that

239
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
AI now much more than several years ago can I come in to understand the patterns of student Behavior who's there

240
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,911
How to really help students ID both of these examples of Industries

241
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,959
Weather it Revolution

242
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Is well underway and disc

243
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Tri-City Theatre

244
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
For the AI Revolution

245
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
To also gain momentum

246
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
I get there

247
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Data has been created in

248
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
What's needed to

249
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Make the

250
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
AR Revolution

251
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Impossible

252
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
But

253
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Do you see

254
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Startups

255
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
Take advantage of that or is more bigger

256
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Zico Baidu

257
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Or Google

258
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Healthcare

259
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
Service provider you have a lot of data

260
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Cartoon Network

261
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
So you only share that data

262
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
With someone

263
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Do you see that

264
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Big companies have a vent

265
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
It's over song

266
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
In space

267
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Houston startups

268
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Do something different

269
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,967
You know I think that date are is very vertical eyes so

270
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,343
One thing that makes the launch web search engine businesses defensible is they have a theater acid

271
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,719
The tells you if you searching a certain term you're more likely to click on this URL rather than that URL

272
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
It's raining so even though you know I thought

273
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
Phenomenal

274
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
Good sense of how websites technology work

275
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
Access to that data I said I would have no idea how to lead a small team to build something competitive but having

276
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,223
Said that I all the web search quickdata is asking you question about whether or not useful

277
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
But some other business example

278
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,415
How is website to pick dates are useful for reading x-ray Radiology Imaging useful

279
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
For that and so I think that

280
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,559
In other vertical applications where there isn't already a big incumbent

281
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
The dominating the market

282
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
I think that

283
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Vacations where

284
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
Small team beautiful scrappiness which is hard work and sweat Zora or if you punish it's cuz straight to get in a day

285
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Data to start giving momentum

286
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
So Andrew Gillum that were in the business of venture capital

287
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
I'm wondering if you were a VC investor

288
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
AI startups

289
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
What were the qualities that you look for it

290
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,647
And what will get you excited about AI starter

291
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
What will get you excited

292
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Two one two

293
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
At work with a stye

294
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
Ndny don't know the starter is going to work is a judgement decision that takes into

295
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Solazzo things

296
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Ranging from

297
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Yeah

298
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Maybe one thing I've used to

299
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,639
I used to tell all of my team's is dad in GNR bosses the customer

300
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Right now y'all set bosses I should not to see you

301
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,831
That's fine to co suzushi much easier than size find a customer and is not one customer over these

302
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,695
Millions or hundreds of millions of people that will go with that feat why don't know what to use your product tray

303
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:22,047
So Indian I think my bosses since it is usually either

304
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
The customer

305
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
Santa is a very complex piece of judgment I guess

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,495
What are not you the right team that I brought out the technology YouTube channel

307
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
Serve the customer in a way that makes sense

308
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,967
Emory

309
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Who yesterday

310
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
I heart I hear you speak about

311
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
3 years ago

312
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
On the different path

313
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
How to do machine learning

314
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Deep learning is only one of them

315
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Deep learning

316
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Is cashing a lot of

317
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
The wave today

318
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,775
Is the right usage of the R&D dollars going into the area

319
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
And you how does an imp

320
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Other

321
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Pass that machine learning

322
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
I think that AI technology has many components including

323
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
Deep learning albums audio Network

324
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
I should love a different

325
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,207
It's a lot of stuff to spend of AI

326
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,023
Having said that I think the thing doesn't dance moves

327
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Rapidly recently is

328
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
Given to large part by the rise of dates are the rise of computational power igp compute

329
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
You think it also

330
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Innovation

331
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
Now because deep learning has advanced so rapidly in the Lost

332
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
TSA

333
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,295
This tree is very rich opportunity set this is a lot of stuff can now do if you running late

334
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
Speech recognition interactive face recognition

335
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,695
That that that we just didn't know how to do two years ago

336
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,815
Today computers can look at pictures and figure out what's in the picture much better than ever before.

337
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,911
Recognizing faces recognizing animals figure out whether the objects in the picture

338
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Videos

339
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
So what does that tree value

340
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,871
I think speech recognition is working for more activity than ever before this is what enables

341
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
Product to Amazon Alexa and by Tuesday Heroes Google's OK Google and so on

342
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
So you skates is a speech to be invented

343
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
To get that

344
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Pakistan to look at

345
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,183
I think that's computers are starting to

346
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Read medical record

347
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,535
The patent is

348
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
What if you have a large amount of data typically has labeled data

349
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,447
Then Tiffany out of us letting us

350
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,543
Make predictions or recognize the types of dates are labeled data

351
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,871
NFL football today

352
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Work to be done

353
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,503
Define decree to business use cases if it has into the appropriate business or appropriate

354
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Prada contact

355
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
So I think

356
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,719
Not a reason the excitement so much excitement since his auntie because this is the piece of the eye

357
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
The most rapidly in the last couple years

358
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Rapid progress

359
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Teresa rich

360
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Set of opportunities.

361
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,239
Keto friendly no one know very few people are trying to tap yet

362
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,127
Incontro siding other pieces of AI technology into some of the bugs were it so you don't need to understand what you saying is like

363
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,967
Light knowledge of sanitation in signing autographs from all those other tooth

364
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
I find him useful in a variety of projects yet

365
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:27,391
But they haven't gone through this step change the way that deep learning has the most couple years so

366
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
Even though their option is there

367
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
Maybe the set of untapped opportunities there

368
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Might not be as

369
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,607
Why Jesse said upon top of trinities in April by the news

370
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
Recently there have been reports of

371
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,543
Potential security issues around AI so there was a

372
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
The study that found that voice control assist

373
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,943
Potentially be hijacked by ultrasound commands a human cannot hear

374
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
Are you worried about the security issues at all

375
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,159
Fortunately there are many deep learning research is aware of the security issues and so this time around

376
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
A lot of us are developing the

377
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:07,327
Deep learning algorithms together I worth keeping in mind the security of vacation so I think

378
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,399
As we are trust face recognition systems more and more

379
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Researches daroff

380
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,031
Stephanie working on defenses against the attacks other than passing paper

381
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
Other than Carnegie Mellon University they showed that

382
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
If you wear a certain

383
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Turkish

384
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Shell pattern glasses

385
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
Sitka spruce

386
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
A face recognition system into thinking your IQ someone else

387
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
But fortunately

388
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
We've seen enough

389
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Computer security that there now

390
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Hershey top

391
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,023
Computer security researchers and talk utility researchers working together

392
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
They try to address these

393
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,631
I would say the solution. Definitely not

394
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Fully developed

395
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,287
We actually don't know what that Solutions are but it's enough research attention on this I feel pretty good about the fall for it

396
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
I like to know I remember 2016

397
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
When

398
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Deepmind

399
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
A contest on

400
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
Go play golf against the top player from South Korea

401
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
I was five matches

402
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Before the first one

403
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Happen

404
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Most people

405
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Especially in China

406
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Stop. There's no emotion

407
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
What what what did you say

408
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Before the first match

409
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
And we were surprised at all by

410
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Yeah

411
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
The results

412
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:20,031
I think deep mine has had amazing breakthroughs and getting computers to play games ranging from their work on a tie

413
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Paris

414
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,871
To all the various games I think they've done

415
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,991
Fantastic job show me the results of the morning is really good at playing video games that's what's playing games like go

416
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
So you can take that to this

417
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:36,415
You know in terms of

418
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
Michigan urology

419
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
I'm really excited by

420
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,607
The work done by a few groups at University of California Berkeley

421
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Elsewhere

422
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:50,239
Are the pine decide to technology to robotics. Say I personally do not work on

423
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,103
Having computers play video games

424
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,943
But I think that one of those exciting applications of this type of Technology

425
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Is using it

426
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,783
To control robots much better than ever before

427
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,623
Very impressed by some of the work they originated all of UC Berkeley

428
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
Peter of yuan circular beans research groups

429
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
B16.

430
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
Using robotics

431
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Have you seen that kind of

432
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
Study or

433
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
Efforts elsewhere in other labs

434
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
Think that's one more research groups around the world I guess I'll talk to you before selenium for

435
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,967
Temperatures in Canada Acceptance in Germany a few groups in the US

436
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
Also a few large corporations are not doing that

437
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Maybe a lot

438
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Fundamental breakthroughs I felt

439
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
Took place in Berkeley but it definitely becoming more pop

440
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,791
In terms of applications these technology

441
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
Equis are you there a few people Staffing where I can order

442
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
I think it's really become quite

443
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
Photos were up here I think I still have a seditionist antiviral adjunct faculty

444
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
Distanta remains

445
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,455
Has always been there remains one of the top centers of AI technology

446
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
And I think I'm

447
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,599
Well pretty multiple universities in Alpha corporate Labs have had a huge impact

448
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Running

449
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
Yeah if I hadn't been doing

450
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:20,095
Tell the world that I was in awe Fitness contract there's no way I would have started an ethical brand Chief right now

451
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
SRI dosa

452
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
Cardinals here at the top of the statue

453
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
So this fortunate struct

454
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,615
Huge application of AIS in self-driving cars

455
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,479
Within the self-driving car ecosystem what do you think are some of the holes in terms of

456
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,599
Arizona people have not devoted enough research or energy to

457
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:49,791
You know so I guess I'm on the boulder Dr. And then Jenny reusable Dozer varicella

458
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Sylvester in it

459
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
I think Dr. Eliezer very exciting, thiruvalla potential

460
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
I think that's a

461
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,455
Vehicles will become a reality price sooner than those people think that it's not something to worry about either because

462
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,343
Do you think people will also adapt to it faster than most people currently think they would.

463
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
So that's one piece of

464
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
The AI future

465
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Excited about

466
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,584
Yeah I remember when I was at undergrad students I started to see

467
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
Videos of autonomous driving work

468
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,704
Done to add some Congee Mellon University and then

469
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
Over the years by Alta preferably was Stanford's participation in Urban Cowboy

470
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
Duffy grandchild inside small

471
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,992
Sebastian thrun Stanford

472
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
I think that

473
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,112
Technology timing is important in hindsight I think 10 years ago

474
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Around the Time of the Doctor challenges

475
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,512
Surrounding ecosystem of Technology just wasn't ready to support

476
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,656
Trudy safe and skate of autonomous driving but I think it's only in the last couple years did I fear the technology

477
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:05,568
Pasta making this not just them aware but making this girl is exactly much clearer now than ever

478
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
I think most of it was given

479
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
A Rise Above

480
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:13,760
I know that's extend the availability of stanza

481
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Running

482
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Google's offices

483
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
It's been a lot of money investing

484
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
This area

485
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
And we will probably

486
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Bigger and bigger

487
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
You think that is still

488
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
All opportunity left

489
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
4

490
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Nu startup

491
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
How to do that

492
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Purina USA

493
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:35,520
I think that dry. AR has a lot of very promising Technologies and approaches

494
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,408
They might be enough room for others in addition to dry the iFit will see

495
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,368
You know I want to see you so dry

496
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,440
Sound Advice

497
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
Ready made by students and also my spouse

498
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,632
Self help them out a bit one of they need me there

499
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,216
The tower tarot Simply Amazing

500
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
I hate you

501
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,592
Yeah Ameritas 145 is that I have to do anything

502
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,664
That would verify

503
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:19,296
I think that I helped them out here when dating

504
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,928
Phenomenal Talent up and down so I think they

505
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
This is a great thing and also

506
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Did you see opportunities

507
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Worldwide

508
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Beyonce us mark

509
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
For sure

510
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
That's you travel around the world

511
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
Where are the some of the other mark

512
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
You see progress so Innovations be made

513
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
In autonomous driving

514
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
Yeah yeah because we actually have

515
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,224
Foundations of specific government that makes it okay for me to needs to see governments bed

516
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,040
I think that regulations will play it

517
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,600
Throw in the risers on the driving and

518
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,160
Government I think that

519
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,280
Some governments are moving faster than us and the countries that are able to

520
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,888
Get the right regulations in place will will have a nontrivial guyses run epic advantage

521
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
The rise of Silas driving

522
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
Do you have any advice for US government

523
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
Any level with a state-level or Miss

524
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Decibel level

525
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Ocr national level 2

526
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
To do more

527
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
It sounds like

528
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Innovations

529
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Are happening

530
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Morro Bay

531
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Ecosystem

532
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Nitrous on the starter

533
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
An ecosystem evolve government increased

534
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,232
Yeah you know I think we do a lot of smart people on US government

535
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
I think that

536
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,816
That's covered your stomach move even faster

537
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
Maybe I just ate a lot of governments that there is level since United States as well as internationally have you started

538
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,800
Drive AI so maybe I'll just leave it at that

539
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,152
So would you advise startups in this area to work with big companies or compete against

540
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,528
Yo I think the question is whether or not it's a complex

541
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,600
Strategic calculation for any startup I think that

542
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,464
The great opportunities for startups to go to The Pretender also sometimes wear

543
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,048
Haunting of a large company you could enable a large the smallest on South

544
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
To go much faster

545
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
So I think it really depends on the details

546
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
October 8th

547
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Harley Quinn

548
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
What up becomes a doing

549
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
Google what's that weigh more than Earth

550
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Weather

551
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Sort of open

552
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Project

553
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
When you look at

554
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Different

555
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Big companies trying to do this

556
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
Somewhere building

557
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
I can get on their own

558
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Somewhere walking with

559
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
Do you see one system

560
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Better

561
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
The other foot

562
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
Yeah it's early days I think I didn't know we were always do the few years and see how the competition plays out so abusive

563
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
Let's talk about China

564
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
You were born in the UK

565
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
And then you move

566
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,736
Hong Kong and Singapore

567
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
He came to the US

568
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
And you

569
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Baidu

570
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
When you look at its what

571
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
Kind of innovation

572
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Happening in Asia

573
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Homicide

574
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
Impact yourself

575
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Career decisions

576
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Kind of things that your

577
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Working on these days

578
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
Haitian background

579
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
You know the China

580
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
I called a China internet

581
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,336
Community ecosystem

582
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:27,968
Is almost a totally different world than the US / Global Internet ecosystem

583
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
And so I find it really important I find it

584
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
Very helpful tips

585
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,440
See what's happening in both ecosystems and to learn from.

586
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
System self

587
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
I didn't today

588
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,144
One more people realize that a lot of products invented in the US that then later go to China as

589
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
Buy Sakura sarada mother idea is that first take off in China

590
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,032
And then your own you only quite a bit later

591
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
Make its way over the us so I think that

592
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,640
Beetles that are able to

593
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,456
Really monitor both ecosystems and learn from both

594
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,528
I will just learn faster and see the best ideas much sooner

595
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
Within the fear of AI would you think are some areas in which the u.s. is ahead of China and what are some areas where

596
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
Where China has a surprisingly over the US

597
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,072
I need the historic for you as well as today did you as husband

598
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,680
Ahead of China in terms of basic Alfred make Innovation cyclical Alta

599
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
You know

600
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
Detailed very important technology

601
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
Conventions I see more of those invented

602
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,384
In the US and China are there China

603
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,688
Really impressed by something

604
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,784
Technology inventions in computer vision for example in China

605
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,880
Dulce out of the big companies or government lab or university lab

606
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
What word do you see those

607
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
Basic Technology Innovation

608
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Happening in

609
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
I think that didn't

610
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
China a lot of stuff

611
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Basic research

612
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,192
Is done by the large corporations in also

613
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,496
Some of the universities are doing a pretty good job

614
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Somehow I feel like there are more

615
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,712
Startups in the US that feel a R&D labs and fewest on sales in China if you like basic research

616
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,040
Essential Innovations but maybe

617
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
I was I was thinking

618
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Assume right

619
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
A lot of innovation

620
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
I'm just a few big companies

621
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,912
The capital to pay for the laundry social organizations but some of them nice job

622
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
Also want that also more and more

623
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Huawei Maybe

624
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Alibaba and tencent

625
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,992
I feel like Baidu. They are in China

626
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,552
The other companies are definitely working on it

627
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,368
Is taking off

628
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,440
Because China is a society move so quickly

629
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:52,096
I feel like consumer products seem to have the ability to just go from zero to a hundred much faster in China

630
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
The US

631
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:58,752
And a lot of reasons for this I guess for us to maybe a peanut

632
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
Societies of their field market segments have to fight for one of the times you think the US is like a hundred more

633
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,528
Ticket adoption are proud of you to fight one of the time for the

634
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Adoption rules China

635
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
You know

636
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Maybe has

637
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,184
700 Moccasin Road I'm on making all of these numbers up

638
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,280
And so things seem able to drop faster in China

639
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,376
Did I see that new products in your business model sometimes take off faster

640
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,424
China and the fact that China is

641
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,008
Motor mobile for society ready for all the people in China

642
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
The cell phone was the first competition device rather than in the US would we most of us use a laptop order

643
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,224
Stop cell phone

644
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,064
So that also enables mobile products to take off pretty quickly

645
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
So I think is really valuable to you

646
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
I want some of the trends in China because

647
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,024
Some of them not not all of them some of the things you see it having China

648
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,888
Might be a Harbinger might be early signal of what might happen in the USA dress well

649
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,192
So the trends that you just mentioned

650
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Sounds like

651
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
Large population

652
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,104
I wonder if these also give rise to a lot of lotion

653
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
And after China goes

654
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Houses for sale

655
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Adoption

656
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
How can I go beyond that and

657
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
And actually the world at Universal

658
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
I feel like in terms of

659
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,000
AI Power Products this is low-hanging fruit all over the place all. Jones con

660
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
Walk around without stumbling on all this

661
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,400
Fruit that's not even though hangers already fall asleep

662
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,680
Resume examples

663
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:38,080
I mentioned how can education is 240 Kohl's Longmont use a lot of work to do these Health Care

664
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
College education products

665
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
But he was very clear that

666
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:47,552
Are there off Healthcare and educational experiences that we could deliver our they just were not possible 2 years ago

667
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
Cuz none of us knowing that the technology

668
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Hannity today

669
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,304
You know what the number of great opportunities still vastly exceeds the number of teams that qualified to pursue these off of

670
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,168
I think he has a v a i and business skills

671
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,008
This has many opportunities they could go out there or did I don't think

672
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,152
Yeah. That might not see any competition at least for some time because it just isn't that much a i Talent around

673
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
So you work at both Google and

674
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,760
Baidu how do you compare and contrast

675
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
National culture

676
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Approach to work and

677
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Hubba hubba 2

678
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Innovate

679
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,096
I think both countries I think both Google and Baidu are gray is very difficult to

680
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
I'm headed to because

681
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Ottavio hefei

682
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:40,800
Very different products very different Samsung 11 also very different products very different

683
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,128
Comfy couches that operate in different countries

684
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,760
I love the super high quality engineering both companies

685
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,112
Just a wonderful keep I got that work with Echo companies

686
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:59,744
There's one thing I like especially about China which is just a speed of decision-making I feel like

687
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
Y'all teams at Baidu

688
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
Mount satellite about 1300

689
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,472
1300

690
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:14,848
He is more like a very small us. Up so so that's one thing that

691
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:20,224
I think the China internet ecosystem is very good at dissipates a competition is so fast

692
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,064
They tries teams to naturally make decisions very fast as well

693
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,136
Large and small companies in the US

694
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
He's like

695
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,952
The pace of decision-making is a bit

696
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,584
Is it not as aggressive and that this pros and cons right when you can take a bit more time to make decision

697
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
Maybe the decisions are slightly high quality

698
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,936
And also you know

699
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
How is your lifestyle different

700
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
When you were at baijiu versus

701
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
We work much longer hours

702
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
The Bible

703
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:55,552
I think I pressed seaworth long always pretty much all my life going back to when I was a student so

704
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:00,928
I don't know that that's very different than the gain in in in in China

705
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,560
Chinese internet companies not just by due to global yalgaar are famous for

706
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,608
Yeah people working very hard

707
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
Open 6 days a week

708
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,336
Best auto de PR against massage

709
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,968
You saw you know

710
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
I think that

711
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,392
So far a lot of excitement about ARS focus on their tech companies like Google and Baidu

712
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,000
They had a very high technology base to build on and so it was a lot of t-top

713
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:41,376
And so this is why I do have some of the most phenomenal

714
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:47,520
Having said that I think about it coming and Padme I will be in other Industries as well

715
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,104
I've even sad if the ultimate impact of AI

716
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
What a I need to do

717
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,760
Let's go transform Healthcare LOL Veigar counter medication

718
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
Construction and then really all those other industry there are specific non-tech companies in AI that you're excited

719
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:11,328
Yeah I think I see a lot of starters emerging entering different business verticals

720
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:15,680
Shenzhen large companies

721
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,800
Set of data that can make the best user

722
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
You know I don't know

723
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:26,176
I think

724
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
Other companies really worth more

725
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
Digital assets even not

726
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
Traditionally considered tech companies

727
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
If you have lost data asset

728
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,672
Desperado the accountant Yaki

729
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,720

Cody has been adopting a tie

731
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
Very rapidly repeat the industry sectors that competes with the data ass

732
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
Best position to do this

733
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Yeah we're going to study

734
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
A while ago

735
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008

Containers to go you have a lot more

741
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Traditional economy.

742
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
And the banks

743

Taco riendo

750
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
And I was 17

751
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,864
The question to be interesting

752
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Will the next 10 years

753
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
How many of these

754
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
Industrial offline

755
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Dichotomy company

756
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Culebra jie

757
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Other

758
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
T2 mount

759
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,104
The comeback

760
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm a lot more fish

761
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Or nah

762
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,784
What are the interesting things that happened in Tech watches in AI is

763
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,184
In the tech world all of us I used to needing to learn new things every 3 years already

764
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
Is new technologies invented all the times that we went through

765
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
The internet error

766
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
Set up to Cloud to mobile and now they are

767
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:52,704
That's all of it that used to the ground shifting under our feet every 5 years in that I'm using to ship

768
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,776
What's happened in the Lost decade is

769
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,616
Now Tech has infective pretty much every major industry

770
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:05,248
Guess I'm so Aztec continues to shift every 5 years now everyone needs to ship every 5 years

771
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,856
So the tech World we're kind of used to that we're accustomed to this way of life

772
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:14,464
I think the other Industries because the pace of change is not driven by this

773
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,072
Say 5 year cycle that Tech has they will need to get used to the pace of change as well

774
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
Is Weber is data replace

775
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Oil and credit

776
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Commodity

777
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
And how you test data

778
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
Determined

779
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,288
How much in a week

780
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Decrease

781
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,456
Yeah yes and then and also you can throw their which is that when you have someone invent said mobile

782
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,832
What's happening cast 10 years ago the iPhone order when someone invents Technologies

783
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:46,464
Now these fundamental shifts in the tech landscape because all these other industries that using tag

784
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,656
So when the root went went in with a basis of competition always your building a big business

785
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,240
Changes every 5 years then you need a new way of operating

786
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
This is one of the

787
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,848
Exit already check-in affecting these other Industries move.

788
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,944
These other Industries also need to change every few years girls exciting times

789
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,504
Football is one of the interesting example is Domino

790
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
That they were the

791
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Most

792
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
A forward thinker

793
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Adoption of

794
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
Internet and mobile

795
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Incognito

796
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
Christian behr

797
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,608
Revenue growth and their stock price grow

798
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376

Parvo

801
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Is a mind-boggling

802
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
See how it

803
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
Traditional economy company

804
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
That

805
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
Willing to adopt technology

806
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
Straight

807
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Denon

808
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,320
I think these things to move people's market caps

809
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
Missouri Credit

810
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
You obviously care a lot about you

811
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Jack Ma

812
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
Said recently that we

813
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
T chart kiss

814
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
Computers cannot

815
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
I'll do better

816
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
One thing about AI is up

817
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Because it moves so fast

818
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
When you train someone on a i

819
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
Maybe the skills to learn this year will become upset

820
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Sweet in 3D

821
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
So how would you advise young people

822
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
How to equip in South

823
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
In a long time

824
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
And how should we approach a

825
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Age of AI

826
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
You know I think

827
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Was it

828
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,136
I think that the most valuable skill in the future might be the ability to keep learning because

829
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:25,536
I took 4 as I think that's a i displacing jobs would be significant but then it may also be someone over Heights OH

830
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,864
Typical us are poison ivy is maybe in the next 20 years

831
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,496
30% of jobs in the US are at risk of Automation and that sounds really scary like 30% how

832
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,848
But the flip side of that is maybe as many as 70% of all your also known as

833
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,896
Slept displacement in the back

834
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,736
We can't find enough people to do it all those jobs we can't find enough

835
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Teachers we can't find enough

836
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Healthcare workers

837
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:52,160
For some reason we also and we also can't find enough wind turbine technician

838
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
So they're Long Beach jobs that

839
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,024
We just can't find enough people to

840
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,864
To do so is much more of a re-skilling retraining issue

841
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,704
Then Humanity has no work left to do kind of problem

842
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
He said that

843
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:12,896
Now that Tech has infected all these other Industries I think that most other Industries weather Industries

844
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,736
Does Pikachu's that you need to learn something new every few years

845
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,088
Technology your business is built on continues to change every few years

846
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
Looking back

847
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
How did you

848
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Discover

849
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
That way I was going to be

850
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Big

851
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
Major

852
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
Play a role in your life

853
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,008
Tell people outside a I feel like it's Sunday to call

854
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Writing a loss

855
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
He is loving

856
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:46,688
I'm is an EIN cider I feel like they are has been making steady progress exponentially

857
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Real talk about red

858
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,064
The steady progress giraffe is you're up for the Lost movie 20 years and

859
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
The thing is

860
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Decide.

861
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
I have something to say

862
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
Very interesting

863
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
Decide to do a skin burn

864
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
Semper

865
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
I was a freshman

866
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
Freshman year in college inside

867
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
Hey I want to spin around for a while

868
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
I wish I wasn't smart enough

869
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Said I was the one

870
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
How did you recognize.

871
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
When was living in Singapore my father

872
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,504
Eye doctor

873
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
Wava

874
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,160
Was looking into doing a eyewear for automated diagnosis from him

875
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,000
The other Define easier than my career was way back in Singapore

876
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,376
I wanted an internship where I just remembered having to do a lot of photocopying

877
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
And

878
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,496
I was definitely

879
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,664
You thinking G it only we could also be at all this photocopying or three maybe I can spend my time doing some

880
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,784
And then when it's not to understand that way I can help us ultimately all the things we did not know that

881
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,088
Want to make a fool then I wont.

882
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Apus

883
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,952
Korean AI pretty much all of my most of my professional life

884
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Moved

885
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
Too many places growing up

886
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
Would you think we're some of

887
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Challenging

888
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,960
Things about going to new environments especially the move

889
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
To the US

890
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
So I moved to the US

891
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,640
Start Amy carnegie mellon University in Pittsburgh

892
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,712
When I came here when I was wet every 17 years old

893
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
I got time I should probably return to Singapore night when I got my bachelor's degree oven the ResCare does a seven-year-old at that time again

894
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:35,232
You know my worth to the US was going to be for like quite fine oh yeah

895
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
I don't know I think

896
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
I really enjoy and I think

897
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,424
People really benefit from seeing multiple organizations red Android

898
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:49,824
Same time, you better in MIT and groupie and stab fat and gain to see a few different companies

899
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:55,455
You notice so much knowledge that's treated in the US and so much notice is treated in China

900
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,295
And most people underestimate how much there is in the other community

901
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,087
Although I don't know I think

902
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
I don't know maybe that's not totally true ID

903
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,207
People in China enough people in China Rita

904
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:10,303
What's going on in the US

905
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,839
Vice versa

906
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Still I think

907
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:19,519
Which of these ecosystems has so much to learn from the other is this the sissies underestimate about different energy to both of them

908
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
So I've always been to

909
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
Would you enjoy being the most

910
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
And what kind of food do you like

911
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
I like whatever

912
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
Yeah yeah

913
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,463
Yeah I don't even know I feel lost

914
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,583
Now I feel nothing of her food and then now you don't remind my my wife and I we both either all sushi

915
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
Pictures of August

916
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:51,007
What point did you decide that you want to stay in the US

917
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
And pursue a career

918
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
Sure is that a

919
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
PhD and then there are the great us universities

920
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,623
Umit and then Andrew from my advisor Michael Jordan their broccoli and then

921
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
After that I thought you know

922
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:15,071
Tiana position to stand that was that was a great place so I keep on working on and trying to advance a high so I warmed up

923
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
Sticking around

924
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,423
Do you see that at different universities.

925
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
To Coast

926
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
Approach to Innovation or

927
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Encouraging

928
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Startups

929
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,895
Stevia versus very special place I feel like them

930
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
If you want to

931
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,527
The fashion industry

932
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,855
If you want to break into film business

933
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
And if you want to work in Tech

934
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,487
Does that one place is much better than all the others in the US

935
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,815
Citing Stanford University is in a very special place and

936
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
Maybe I json example

937
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,263
Many years ago my students started working on GPU Computing forthethrone are very early reading fluency

938
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
Lava Tubes.

939
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,591
Use gpus off a TV running

940
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
The reason we want that we are writing a paper I don't think that clever

941
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,391
We had friends in the video right now

942
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,791
And we're just lucky that the right friends and share the right signals and so we said hey let's let's let's do some research on GPU

943
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Computer running

944
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,727
And if we had been living somewhere else other than Silicon Valley I know it whenever I want to

945
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,591
Yeah we would have seen it that early and then they able to do the work to help me through until community

946
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
Atenolol examples Italian

947
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,223
Speaking of the right friends who are some people you think

948
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,807
Really helped or mentor to you throughout your career or

949
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,623
You worked I enjoyed working with or

950
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,695
So-called the rightful

951
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Flights

952
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,631
I think by your honesty is too many to the way my mother is afraid of naming if you feed rabbits

953
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,215
But I didn't really fortunate

954
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,775
Dementors was an undergrad

955
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,871
Tanger Mall Michael Corinthos Michael Jordan

956
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Sterisil

957
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:10,527
And then and then it started all of the Snapchat CS faculty were great I don't even want but they're all trades

958
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,599
And then don't have Coursera

959
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:17,439
Square a fantastic

960
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:22,047
Like I'm a video competitors I won't even send for you can look up online who they were

961
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:29,215
And then yeah and then and then video I thought it was fantastic I think that you were off in this room

962
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,031
Radius property

963
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,871
Technology and Business Leaders in the world

964
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
Right I think that talks

965
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,247
A lot of people that have learned a lot from Robin

966
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,807
So I'm curious how did you first meet Robin Lee

967
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,159
So I had a friend the way back

968
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,695
Who is working at

969
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Baidu and

970
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,535
When I told him I want to be able to look at

971
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655
Using Robin to me

972
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,215
China has a long line

973
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,007
Robin Leach St hours

974
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
About what

975
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,591
Holding up to look like

976
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
I think I'd let it go

977
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Robin is Ashley Young

978
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:20,159
Very clear strategic thinking and quite a few times he kind of sees further than a lot of other people so he's really want

979
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,207
I got very much at Meijer

980
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
It's a

981
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
Impressive to us when we visit

982
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
CMU in January

983
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
UCI Professor Moore

2 a cm

988
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Having

989
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Kind of

990
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
Exchange of

991
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
Experiences

992
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Makes a lot

993
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
More likely

994
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
The Fosters Nick

995
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479

Around and

998
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Anthony

999
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
Together collaborating different things

1000
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
I think the Stanford University year has long had a deep connection to a second Audi in fact

1001
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
Sephiroth you say that you throw

1002
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,423
Creating the second out either we all now know today

1003
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,471
So I think that

1004
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,543
The transfer of knowledge is often a two-way street

1005
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
Right then

1006
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,871
The whole Community benefits

1007
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,175
Your everyone is community benefit is true

1008
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,735
Are the pieces that communities are ranging from

1009
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:21,855
Basic research and patients is that abuse on a company's a couple sharing with researches

1010
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,159
What are the most important Alden Resort

1011
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,743
Datasets that then turn house drives to research for it

1012
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,839
I feel like Joe Dirt

1013
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:36,447
He's a hundred or maybe a thousand example it exciting things happening today

1014
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,543
Almost impossible to summarize interview sentences

1015
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
It's just

1016
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,871
AI has turned into this

1017
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:49,247
Cute engine of opportunity in and then and potential value creation

1018
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
Podcast this year

1019
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Some of the best pack

1020
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
Not that

Are working on

1025
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
And also the

1026
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
We're hoping that

1027
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,327
Elmore University

1028
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863

And ideas

1031
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
To be used

1032
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Exchanged

1033
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
So that

1034
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
More innovation

1035
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
Timeout

1036
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,223
Four on the next section of the

1037
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Podcast

1038
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,831
Would ask you a series of rapid-fire

1039
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
?

1040
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,647
An intrapreneur

1041
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
That you admire the most

1042
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
And why

1043
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Umich Robert earlier

1044
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Do you have anyone else

1045
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,095
Another executive

1046
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,679
One of the best CEOs in America and I

00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,239
Often listened to his talk

1048
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,567
Sometimes my sometimes just on YouTube I feel like I see

1049
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,615
Learn a lot from a strategic thinking

1050
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,711
I think one of the amazing things about Amazon under Jeff Bezos is Dad

1051
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
If somehow

1052
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:58,623
Dothan Mall. Let them keep on building up mucus instead of Evil Within this giant company in historically

1053
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,951
That's something been very difficult to do and I was on this one of the bed

1054
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:10,399
Where you at by do you made it mandatory for senior Executives to join a book club can you share some titles you guys

1059
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,735
As long as on business strategy

1060
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,319
Take a Simpsons writer of innovation

1061
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
To his new book

1062
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
Competing against luck

1063
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,607
26 books that Malcolm Gladwell

1065
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:49,311

00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
That's really the two

1068
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Building Products

1069
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
When after use

1070
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Most often

1071
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
The people may have been a

1072
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Besides Google

1073
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Yeah I read a lot

1074
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
So there are few

1075
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
Magazines that I read

1076
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,023
Thank you so nice. Enjoy include new hoverboards

1077
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,351
Review The Economist Uber business week

Most of eat near Wall Street Journal New York Times

Subscribe to clean a lot of things

1080
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
So what

1081
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
Pawcasso videos

1082
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:28,991
I'm not a frequent user of YouTube just occasionally

1083
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:36,927
You have mentioned that when you decide how to spend your time you're up two criteria wanted

1084
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
Weather

1085
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,279
You're doing can change the world and the other is

1086
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,351
How much you're learning so which one thing you did that you say

1087
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,935
May change the world and what's one thing you did that taught you that

1088
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:53,567
Get out I think that's by offering a set of courses on Coursera

1089
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
It's not so much me changing the world is me giving you or me giving others the power to change the world sound very faint

1090
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,831
And I think in terms of learning new things I think that

1091
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
As I

1092
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,255
Try to apply AI to healthcare I find myself very volatile Healthcare education if I myself

1093
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,047
Continue to learn a lot about

1094
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
