00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
Within the big company you asked for 6

127
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151

You are so precious

130
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
From ground up

131
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,111
So I've been doing all that I didn't think that it was so the team were looking for his

132
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
The capability

133
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,951
To master do you Hardware design Manufacturing

134
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Vertical integration

135
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
The hardware side from China

136
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
And the

137
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
Capability to really understand the user and Mark

138
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
Here you are

139
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
And the crossbow.

140
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Ass back that you said

141
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
The chi

142
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
To success

143
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
That's the reason I did always started

144
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Company buy or sell

145
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Annie's assembled a team

146
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Unless

147
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
September usually incorporate a company in January

148
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
And we thought first launched in the market in June in all the ads

149
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
The pilot it was only a hundred

150
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
15 x +

151
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
And the first Major Market large was it

152
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
July

153
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
You can see out

154
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,631
Ever since. Even last four months that we did $70 Asians on the hardware you know you normally eat a razor

155
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
Software and we launched 17 cities and

156
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
And schools

157
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
In the last rocket

158
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,823
So there are a lot of people who are skeptical about

159
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
White back sure it would work in the US

160
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
In China it's not surprising that works because it has a

161
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,807
Huge population and a lot of cities with a lot of urban population and

162
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
Not a lot of people have cars

163
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,183
And there a lot of traffic jams so it's natural that bikes will work

164
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,791
But in the US people are more spread out a lot of people live in the suburbs and own cars

165
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
So what made you think that this model can work in the US

166
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
Yeah that's a really good question so answer you faster and I was right to ultra cleaners God will you look for validations right

167
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
I took it off the market size but if there's a real user need

168
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
And before we put a tree

169
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,479
And there are things. I think the not well known outside of the industry

170
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
That I'd like to share with the audience

171
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Your number one thing is...

172
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Bike

173
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
Per capita ownership in SLC in the US is 4 hours

174
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,071
China is a needle well-known for liking evolve bicycles but that was the story

175
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
You have to look back

176
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
414 yuan 15 years ago

177
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
But after 14 years of eighties and nineties

178
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,287
Writing a d or even even in the late 90s early too

179
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Mm nobody really

180
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
Use bike as Transportation anymore

181
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,711

Approach should I enema we did also bottom

204
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
Bottom up approach will look at it every single match holding out the density two populations without bike-share is different from any other

Did Last Mile Transportation challenge

224
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,047
That works. We're trying to sell Fiori's universe

225
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:14,911

229
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Free transportation

230
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
He's very like it

231

Yo City like

239
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Say San Francisco

240
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Then we have

241
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,567
I don't know how we do know there's only part

242
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
That's running across City and no other alternative

243
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,711
And I figure we also look at it what's the dark base

244
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
You know solution even though that the experience was not graded the availability is low

245
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,695
He died be in New York to see if I could still be able to

Today in their Peak seasons and three rights provided Popeye

249
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
You mean the cold weather

250
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,191
And also their huge

251
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Is there as well

252
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
And that's a reason

253
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
It All Falls Down

254
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Believe there's a

255
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Marketeer and then

256
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
Boss we are a little bit fortunate in that way

257
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,247
Six months of diligent for investment turn into a 6 months

258
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
Well thought-out file preparation

259
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831

You know

263
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Opportunity for us

264
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,487
To think about through a lot of things before we started

265
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
Building tools hours question liberal further

The subway you have a high-speed rail you have

270
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
A Rideshare already

271
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
So why do you need Bike Share on top of that people to ride bikes anymore

272
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
420 30 years

273
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,367
Interesting uses Center beside

274
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Since the subway

275
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
Lights of being bailed out

It went after tr34 cities

288
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
And in those cities

289
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
Subway system is not as built and people

290
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Take the bike

291

305
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
We got a rotten and we're look when we look at of transportation's. There's three things need to be in place you want to be happy

306
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
A viable Transportation means you know affordability is one of the other in the USA as I mentioned

307
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,343
The affordability actually rather difficult

308
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
The bus line rods

309
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415

Availability is a whole other thing. You don't have to pick time. He will guarantee that you will

319
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,415
Now to be able to get a uber you guaranteed he would not be able to drive you are

320
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
Cardinal out of the garage you or whatnot

Mostly from the train and bus stations 30 40% we said we have GPS on each of the bike ride

335
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
When we look at the Heat

336
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
We will notice. Is starting with m points is very close to the

337
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455
Or it's a bus stop so that's the number one usage similar to China as well encouragement or two cities

What rides per bike per day the hollows the average distance

377
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759

399
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
20 million population in Beijing today

00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Walks around Derry NH

401
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943

Talk about you know the 800,000 Residence Inn San Francisco everyday.

00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
3 million people

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
Endowed is a very different thing you know

405
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Compared to USA

406
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Panda China

407
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
And then we

408
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
4 South Bend

409
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
It's at over a hundred about her mm in Residence

410
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
And we did a calculation for donut doodle

411
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Golden Steer 300 cities

412
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
In the US

413
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
At least a hundred thousand

414
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Most of the

415
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Top

416
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
102

417
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
300

418
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Ghost Rider series

419
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Half of $100

420
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:38,623
That's right and that's how we look at it as well and we look at the other size of the Denver metro area

421
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,927
And then that's why I said downtown

422
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
And I would look at that

423
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Well that's all the criteria

424
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,839
Are you look at South Patton Dia initially thought.

425
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,447
DSS Barnwell be saturated or in always a thousand bikes

426
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
Now we think that Atlas

427
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
4000

428
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Bikes

429
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
That will be nice

430
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,895
So you take away the process of Notre Dame in

431
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
The game day on Saturdays

432
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223

433
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783

434
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Forest City like Southbend

435
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087

437
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559

438
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Enough saturation

439
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887

454
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
What the first and foremost is that our strategy that I didn't know we had a lot of fun

455
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895

457
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247

519
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,832
5 1/2 days a week in over the weekend. Although op'ration know what I'd probably

520
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
Do more work right

521
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,392

And the way we do. I think they're just a few things that the kosher on a mission and a vision

527
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
For the company has

528
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
I've been very clear

529
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
And naturally

530
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
That it is

531
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,592

For this company is would be the long-lasting great company

536
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256

So you have a pretty bicultural team

568
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
UFT members in China and then even many members

569
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
If your team here are Chinese

570
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
When your

And on the other hand not even look at some other engineering team

588
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Doubt their role requires

589
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008

You will be much more

922
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
We just like grown up

923
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,824
Yeah he's just like you. All we ask you to talk about their house today is like

924
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,872
Building a house is much easier

925
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,480
And take much longer

926
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
You can put in a basket

927
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
And he's still not asking

928
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:24,672
Analogy same out here. You know applies to like eBay or early days with

929
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,768
Want to go to China that uses that workover company

930
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
That we have to charge a Cellars

931
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
Like their photos come company

932
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,656
Alibaba

933
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,520
The same thing applies again again the Bean Bean

934
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,872
Successful company and cocoa Supermarket but USA York

935
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Y'all are naturally

936
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,712
Connected better and adulterous Battistelli easier

937
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:53,600
To copy Louis company to move to Europe has a very different culture that is about March

938
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,440
So I think it's got to be difficult for many of the year

939
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,560
Wow. You're not not to mention that whether they can ask fast as we are but

940
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
Jesse Jena weather

941
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
Successful

942
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,728
So in China One huge problem that we are saying is that bike sharing companies have

943
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
Create a proliferation of bikes that are just

944
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:19,456
Invading this public spaces in a lot of tiny cities there now littered with colorful bikes everywhere

945
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
From sidewalks

946
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
The parking laws so building entry

947
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:26,112
And some Municipal governments have you shoot orders to ban

948
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,672
Bike sharing companies from releasing new bikes

949
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,000
And also the dockless nature of your service means that people can

950
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,352
Practically don't them anywhere so how do you prevent a similar problem from happen

951
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Play in the US

952
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,168
Yeah I took the three

953
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:43,008
Ways to look at that the first says. As a company that

954
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,336
You know that's one of the reason why we set up a strategy

955
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,128
You will work closely with us City

956
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
You stand up like

957
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Galloway Rock

958
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,736
It stopped if I get their wisdom later

Visit Mission Ford account

960

Ward limebike

961
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,392
Is to drive more bike usage as a

962
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,184
Transportation what percentage of

963
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,512
Traffic but also to make our city Greener healthy area last

964
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
That's part of it is

965
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
DIA parking

966
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
So we walk with

967
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,728
The City Bark closely and also weed

968
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:18,592
Typically we do is crazy instead of dumping you $100,000 / 9

969
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,688
Got to work till a thousand this month and that gradually increases over time

979
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Just because it's red

980
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
And there's no difference

981
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
Where is a rent

982
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,384

That guidance

984
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199

No question I have is at

995
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
They are

996
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
Other startups here

997
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Something similar

998
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
Minnesota Twins in China and trying to make

Thought you're not so expensive

1001
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,295
How do you assess

1002
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
The strength of weak

1003
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
You are a few

1004
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Appears

1005
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879

1006
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
Is there anyone out there.

Intense volume process

1009
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:44,863
Walk depends on which angry look at them could it be good to be bad not so much

1010
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,495
I think Dad has it as a business what you just read idea healthy competition is always well

1011
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
And we

1012
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
You don't see nada from the

1013
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127
Industry perspective or problem Adventure perspective

1014
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
That's right. Every category

1015
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,991
Doubt it will be expanded by the healthy cow

1016
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:07,391
Competition as long as every companies will hold up I exactly and it was a much bigger

1017
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
A party comes off the appropriate joke

1018
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719

Who do you think will win the bike sharing War in China

1036
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,495
It's a little hard to say I think in China. The other the landscape is very different from you ask

1037
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,079
Justia the Unicorn. Makes it will be challenging so the Bike Share

1038
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,663
Wolpe the emphasize on the success of the bike shirts different

1039
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
From here

1040
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:08,319
Which does not support that so you end up in the end

1041
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
The point

1042
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
Will use acquisition Channel War

1043
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
Water usage

1044
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
Channel 4

1045
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
It's right before example.

1046
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Payment

1047
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
For example uibe

1048
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
Appetizing workout

1049
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
To Rice your

1050
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:24,959
Yanny chin you are in China now that's the fall of the things difference and the second differences.

1051
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
The bike-share company in China is a little bit

1052
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,079
That. Hanzel of a tide

1053
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
You no way. It cannot do

1054
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Mobile payment

1055
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:39,551
Because that's already buy a test at both are you bothering this category try and they cannot really do Rideshare over

1056
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
What can I do with a decision

1057
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:48,511
They cannot really deal with you no food ordering delivery since there's may try and that's all am I in

1058
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
They also share the same

1059
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,607
UMass art and craft

1060
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,655
Iodous acid for imagination

1061
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
Rising theater

1062
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,031
Not necessary outside to outside will be Camp I think they

1063
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
Options

1064
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
What choices will be parallel

1065
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:11,295
Create something

1066
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,831
Has anyone had someone

1067
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Really bad on the other what I see

1068
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:21,023
And and a blue waffle

1069
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
That's how I made was

1070
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:27,935
And the reason being started we're just suck at you know that when I said

1071
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,519
So we are forced to be more innovative

1072
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:36,127
Anodontia came inside on a membership site all the things that never passed speed on YouTube

1073
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,295
Analogy that applies here. Instead of a more natural to hate weekend

1074
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,391
You know the bike sharing China can't do Mobile payment War

1075
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,975
Food delivery is what what not that date their limited on those

1076
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Could be from where you know Vape

1077
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
All about questions

In the future

1083
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,967
Nothing over here

1084
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,527
In the US do you see

1085
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,855
Big a company coming in sharing their traffic

1086
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
Bike Shipping Company

1087
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,647
Yes or no

1088
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,951
And then the second follow-up questions.

1089
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,279
If there's becomes don't come in in this space

1090
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,583
Is the view as too far away from their equipment

1091
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
He seems like you could build a business

1092
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Who's here

Matrix

1119
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,743
There's no one means

1120
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
Cap fitting order

1121
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559

1123
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
Got to work

1124
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,679
You know some kind of

1125
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,519
Company that offers them all and then think this case but I

1126
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:44,127
You don't think that it will be more to write your company share you don't traffic or user

1127

1128
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
I think he's more likely

1129
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
The other way around

1130
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,759
How about people think that

1131
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,343
Usbank Walmart bikes and markets too small

1132
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
Your most natural exit is to

The Chinese guy that's much bigger

Absentee to each other all increase the

And there are many, there are many companies in deposit is not

1161
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135

It's not a sad Italian wrong strategy will went out but they're not a focus enough

1163
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255

You're sort of the end result

1201
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
In China

1202
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
And how use are utilized

1203
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271

Doug mistakes Waterhouse

1211
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,935
Be the best practices so we're as a company we're willing to

1212
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
Even

1213
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,775
Revising the team by taking that tire company

1214
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
Put a job down and go to

1215
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,431
Just a few years ago people were talking about C2C or

1216
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,455
Copy to China

1217
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,831
But now we're starting to share the opposite copy from China wear a lot of entrepreneurs are taking busy

1218
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
Tomatoes from China

1219
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
And applying it to the US

1220
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,719
And I think dockless bike sharing is an example of that

1221
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
I wonder what other examples of

1222
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
Are you from China that you

1223
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
I've seen recently

1224
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,887
They're actually a lot

1225
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,447
Across different Industries

1226
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,751
I think it's not really you know a

1227
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:27,359
I think General categorisation off like coffee from where to where the year of

1228
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Tumi

1229
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,919
Is that Lil Bit to generalize

1230
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,759
God what I see is that each of the market because stood devolving

1231
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
Unevenly

1232
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,575
Dodger Stadium date

1233
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111

1234
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
Define innovation

1235
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439

1236
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975

1237
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999

So nobody is leading all the way is a Medicaid services

1239
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
Core technology

1240
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,423
And those are the things do a lot of innovation

1241
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
You coming from here

1242
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,471
Buffalo China.

1243
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
2

1244
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,823
What three aspects of I've looked in the past decade were

1245
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
Till YouTube

1246
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,407
Case right you'll number one thing is really just me

1247
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,455

And that's one thing in a second thing that I didn't quite a lot of Innovations

1255
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:30,591
In the past with China because I don't sizing is not enough to support in the

May not Nassar beat a DNA while taking me to watch while but I understand that the science fair

1285
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
Understanding of data

1286
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,047
This case is

1287
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,327
The production

1288
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,655
What what in the industrial unit capability

1289
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
Becomes core

1290
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
Octopus

1291
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,519
It's dip the battle is not one who has the

1292
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
Bass looking

1293
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
Design off the bike

1294
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
You know ability to

1295
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,687
Scalable high-quality

1296
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Low cost

1297
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,759
Good enough as a pet

1298
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
Ablation not necessary to

1299
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
Peter Ferrari

1300
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,671
So you this case this is reflection off the strength of the English

1301
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Generalized

1302
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,791
What China is innovating

1303
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Because of those

1304
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
Yeah you a c Xenoblade

1305
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,399
Because.

1306
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
You know you still fishing he rebuked

1307
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,775
Because coach her here and all. That's how I see it in some of the examples.

1308
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,359
Free-to-play game is being one of them's ever since like

1309
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,127
Mm

1310
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,663
Safe to have 7 years

1311
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
And that has to be

1312
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
Gradually becomes a main main track

1313
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,391
Quick speech at a wallaby conference data fall like free

1314
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,927
Would you play all that I once loved

1315
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,911
Is cheap since you charge her $0.10 for item

1316
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,727
Value companies Cortez that that's a real comet

1317
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,031
In the second, we got inside

1318
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
Youth small company makes more games

1319
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,615
We make $60 box

1320
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
Speaker inside

1321
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,455
We all die

1322
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
And that's the philosophy in it

1323
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,783
But after. We see you

1324
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
We've seen what happens

1325
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,343
Facebook

1326
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,879
Pokemon losing

1327
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:29,791
That's why I love a big trap and when we Imagine Dragons people.

1328
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,095
Understand what we're doing

1329
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
You keep that away. Game

1330
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,423
Why the game only last 5 minutes

1331
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,727
Is that off of our session

1332
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,103
And that's a driven by

1333
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Diu Novation

1334
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,151

1351
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
Novation

From China

1353
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,407

Source of inspiration

1359
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,623
How that impacts how they roll out

Is life better

1393
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,655
That's how we tended to look at

1394
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Things that swell

1395
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
That picture will be the foundation

1396
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
Doom for switch

From there

1400
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,943
So let's go into the final part of this podcast

1401
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,247
Which is a quick-fire round of questions

1402
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
The first one is

1403
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,599
An entrepreneur that you admire the most and why

1404
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:07,487
What prison is a maybe a little controversial board is Warren Buffett

1405
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,071
That I think. He holds on his value he's being a very

1406
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
You know in time

1407
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
His whole life is

1408
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,191
Andean

1409
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Greedy

Sapporo Japan

1413
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,407
And that was the inspiration why I founded

1414
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
Interesting

1415
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,319
Next question something you read recently

1416
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599

Sustain

1430
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Why they can't

1431
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,695

Said meaning to them

1443
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,055
So that is

1444
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
So you know Moana

So hard why we devoted ourselves

1452
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
That's why we

1453
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,207
Do you think it's not necessary

1454
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975

Not necessary

1462
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
Touch from the emotion side but more from Orr

1463
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
Probably everyone Brad

The way I see it is.

1515
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,703
You know the fundamentals

To do something.

1529
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,279
That's valuable are we trying to solve a real things

1530
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,815
In the foundation release

1531
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
The company

You all. It is more on the on the

1533
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Listen

1534
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,215
Set up a structure wise

1535
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,519

01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:13,247
Culture that you will not work regardless. How great

1541
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
Yes regardless that would work

1542
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
Ended lossing the forecast

1543
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
I think it is more

1544
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159

1545
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183

1567
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,151
If anyone looking to the history

1568
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
Enough

1569
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,199
And looking till

You know me.

1581
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,495
Everyday you work

1582
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,519
Wakonda document

1583
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,055
It's not right

1584
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Whatever

1585
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:49,503
You know I mean political environment

1586
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,295
Intrinsic value it is

1587
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,879
That's it works for certain. In time doesn't mean that it has a

1588
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
About to be on that particular

1589
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:01,279
. even even

1590
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
The society

1591
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,095
Good Lovin by some of them does not

1592
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Have I do today

1593
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,959
And they will just

1594
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Keep on doing the same

1595
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,055
Closing all time without thinking about it what

1596
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:19,455
It's behind it but I think that's why

1597
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,783
Pricing as I optimistically you know ultra-premium

1598
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
God I

1599
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,599
Do believe

1600
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,927
Kind of long-term

1601
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,231
Lot of people would say they do

1602
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,071
But in reality you can look at action they take

1603
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
Deduct

1604
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
It takes your car.

1605
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,423
U-Haul Valley was a lot of Maureen

Body Darby

1610
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,199
So. It I think it's a little bit controversial how to say you be asking anyone nobody will admit it

1611
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,783
But I have to charge it from

1612
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,111
I think. Do you know that something why I mentioned Warren Buffett

1613
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,743
It's a long-term value and also D at the fundamentals of those Valley

1614
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:09,119
You know someone say everyone will say

1615
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
God damn we've seen.

1616
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,007
And then

1617
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
What will be the third example

1618
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,591
I'm something that you believe in our people.

1619
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,663
Sky

I do have a lot

1621
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,831
And I do believe that the

1622
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:35,999
Diversity this is a little bit difficult to explain that I do believe in diversity

1623
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,327
The value of diversity and Dad how decreased

1624
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,655
You know I ditional value summer leave immediately could it be

1625

Appointed to some of David

1627
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,847
Ryan tangible and also it takes time

1628
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,455
Yandina human history right we can't even go from like when the time will

1629
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Human

1630
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Becomes

1631
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,319
Walk out the woods and becomes human

1632
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,367
And history. That was

1633
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,647
Place of cyclical

1634
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
Controlling there

1635
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Any

1636
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:11,327
Society in history task me isolated any society that is not embracing that that was your part of it

1637
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
Atrophy over time

1638
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
I pretty much gone

1639
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:19,519
Yeah. That is something that I I believe in but not necessary everyone

1640
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:26,687
The end. That is something that from the history perspective we said that results in from wherever

1641
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Lucian

1642
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,759
We know the reasons yeah

1643
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,295
From the reality

1644
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,575
Perspective died we

1645
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,743
We cannot already tell you know what's adding value and at some point idea did diversity

1646
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,767
Also means uncomfort

1647
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,071
Add means.

1648
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
Uopeople

1649

1652
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
How do you spell Moana

1653
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,455
And doubt as that uncomfortableness and therefore there are people

1654
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
Will not embrace

1655
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,759
Diversity

1656
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:06,367
But but I will say believing there then you won't be more

1657
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,695
You know I'm crazy and tolerance some of the differences but look at it

1658
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
Topeka Value Place

1659
