Kick-off 2018

65
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,864
During a first visit China in 1997

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,912
Let's go by I can chat about

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Contact

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
He was a government official assigned

69
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
To you to be a translator in

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
How to get around on the Great Wall

71
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
And that time what was your impression of him

72
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
And back then did you have any inkling at all

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
He was going to do something big on the next

74
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Do decades

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Back then you were

76
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
The king of Internet

77
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
Yahoo whistle

78
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Highest volume

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
In a company in tire world

80
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
What struck you about China

81
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,936
Well I know I was born and raised in Taiwan as you all know Hans and and it was since I came to the

82
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
U.s. I never went back to Asia very often and so being able to go back to China for the first time in 1990s

83
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
7 was a thrill

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
And you know meeting Jack then was very interesting because I was immediately

85
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
Struck by how inquisitive and how curious he was about the internet and internet was not very big and it in China

86
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
1997

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096
Jack spoke grade English you never spend time outside of China so he learned it in China which was also very unusual back then

88
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
But it was clear that he was an entrepreneur at heart even from 1997 now of course I had no idea what he

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
He would go on to do

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,384
He may not have had any idea what he was going to go on today and if so what

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
7 million that users. He was very very small and internet connections were terrible and

92
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,624
And so this was very much an early days kind of a

93
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,232
Time so I would say that overtime obviously

94
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Country embraced internet but at that time

95
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Is really

96
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Kind of early days

97
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Backwaters

98
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
Did you guys talk about the internet at all

99
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,823
He was very inquisitive he asked about the web he asked about

100
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
The internet and he asked about

101
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
All the

102
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,991
Information part of it I think he had some experience building

103
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,599
Directories are or things like that for telecommunication at Yellow Pages yasso

104
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
So he was very knowledgeable about a lot of aspects of a Yahoo was that sandwich was a large directory in a search engine

105
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
So we did talk a lot about that and he

106
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Clearly was

107
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Not your typical

108
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Government person

109
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Back then

110
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,543
Ultra Asian people were trying to figure out what internet is what in MN

111
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
And I think that I've got time

112
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
The market leaders in Taiwan

113
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
China

114
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
Or Hong Kong Japan

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Or just starting

116
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
What was your impression of

117
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Asus potential

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Internet

119
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Market

120
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
Well in 1997 when I visited China and it first met Jack this was on the heels of the previous year

121
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
Your 1996 started Yahoo Japan with

122
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
SoftBank in in La Sushi song so

123
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
Tommasi as he is now is very much a Visionary he pushes and must be 10 or 20 years ahead of

124
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
Where the trend is and he saw the opportunity he was one of our First Investors in Yahoo in the last day

125
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
Public but also his condition was to

126
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Start Yahoo Japan and I think

127
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
We were in no position

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
Back then we were a young company I think we have less than 50 people and we were too busy in the US but

129
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
But he was so persistent and forceful as author is still today

130
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,775
That we agreed to launch Yahoo Japan and probably some sort of the record time he supplied

131
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
All the labor he put some of his best executive even put his younger brother ties already as one of our big Surfers

132
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
So we had launched Yahoo Japan the previous year and it was

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
Difficult to get it launched but then we saw the early successes of having been first-to-market there is so

134
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:25,023
To your question I think there is this very palpable energy around Asia not only in Japan

135
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,351
When did Korea exactly Korea was really just

136
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
It's beginning to take off and then obviously China wasn't far behind

137
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Since Yahoo Japan work out so well over time

138
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
Will you think I would do something similar

139
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Evener solely as then

140
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
For other parts of Asia

141
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:46,527
Yeah we try to do the same model elsewhere we try to do Yahoo Korea it did not work out as well and I see

142
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,135
I think there was some very strong incumbent competitors in Korea that has turned out to be

143
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,231
Huge Dom and neighbor in the windows guys

144
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,607
Any China we knew we had to plant a flag early and try to get some things going

145
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
But also ultimately

146
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
We need a partners

147
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,031
To survive in China given not only to Market which is usually the driving

148
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Dr. Bhatt

149
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
China yells I have

150
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Did the government

151
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
And the regulatory side of it that made it very unique

152
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,111
As you know it's not easy for US tech company to operate in China what do you think are some of

153
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,207
The most common challenges faced by us companies when they try to go to China

154
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,839
Well I think number one is really understanding

155
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,447
What is the goal and how do you fix it what do you define success

156
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
And

157
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
And part of

158
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,127
The early days of the internet in China in the late 90s and early 2000s

159
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
The challenge word

160
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,503
Really that the regulatory side was just also growing up

161
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,551
So they were trying to figure out how to

162
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,439
Regulate the internet industry at the same time all these companies were coming up some companies were

163
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
Less regulated and others and

164
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
And I think now there is more less

165
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,727
More clear roadmap for for companies that want to be in China

166
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
And I think

167
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,359
The last 20 years have shown the government also has been

168
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
They've been open on some ways and clothes and other ways about letting company is in and I think part of it is

169
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Having

170
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
Partners or having investors

171
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Maybe like

172
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
GDB yourselves

173
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
Who understands sort of the

174
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
The highs and lows of the rise and fall of different

175
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
Sensibilities within the Chinese culture in the Chinese government

176
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
On the topic of local partners

177
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
How do you pick

178
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,847
A local printer that fits your company culture and how do you make sure that they're actually empowered

179
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,479
Oh yeah that's a good question

180
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,063
We were very lucky in Japan to have

181
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
SoftBank is our local partner who

182
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,767
Put all their way behind us Japan is notoriously difficult as a market

183
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
And and for us

184
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
To have had mosses

185
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
Support and

186
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,311
I'm backing was really critical but but it was also one where we

187
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
You know he is he had

188
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,479
Majority of equity in yoga pants

189
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
Case where he had

190
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,135
More of the stake of the company for us to 2

191
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
That in order for us to be successful there

192
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
In other places I think it just depends it really if you can find a great local team

193
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Command local manager

194
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
A lot of times

195
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,495
That's the key ingredient whether you find a partner or not

196
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,615
And it depends on what kind of company because if it's a large Fish Company and

197
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,991
And there isn't so much local Innovation or or or product

198
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Localization is required

199
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,927
That's one formula in and you we seen a lot of us companies that basically used

200
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
The market as more of a sales and marketing Market

201
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Where is

202
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,119
A lot of our companies today especially our Venture companies in portfolio companies

203
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
Do require not only product rollout but also

204
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Some indigenous

205
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
Localization or innovation that needs to happen

206
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
And there you need more talented executive team

207
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
Stand just your standard sales and marketing section

208
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,783
So it really kind of depends on it but ultimately comes down to running the business you know people

209
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,391
It's stuck on running finding Equity partners of government Partners or

210
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
Capital you know but ultimately

211
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,023
It's who's running the business day today on the ground and

212
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Goleta Marketplace and

213
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
Are successful examples tend to be people who

214
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
Are great getting the product out into the market that

215
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Fits the Chinese market

216
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,591
And I think that's a that's a secret sauce that's hard to come by and and

217
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,223
It helps to have other backing and other Capital Partners but usually

218
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
It's much more about the people on the ground

219
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Right you had a

220
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
If you attempt

221
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
Status in China yes

222
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,511
Obviously the most recent one the final one look extremely well yeah

223
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
Investing

224
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
My car to the Yahoo ever did

225
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
After the initial Inception

226
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
But

227
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,799
Before that. Boy you work with that don't we appreciate someone extremely controversial figure

228
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
How did you decide to pick him in the first place

229
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Over someone like a robin lior

230
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
Or what anyone else in China

231
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,135
In and was insisting on having a hundred percent ownership

232
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Reacquisition

233
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Or

234
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
What you did the second time with Jack

235
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
A poncho

236
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
But material steak

237
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
I will not be a better strategy for our us company

238
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Looking at

239
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Funny vagina

240
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
Well we realized that in China that we needed a local operating person

241
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
As I said being in China

242
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Running a product set

243
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Without

244
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Local

245
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Exactly team was very very difficult

246
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:12,415
And this is still before the regulatory side was clear about what Yahoo is allowed to do what is not allowed to do so

247
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
We did a choir 371 and really used a position to buy the management team which is stronger

248
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
End

249
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,423
And his team only is as you know he's very Scrappy

250
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
He's bald he's got to complain about a Russian Roulette well he doesn't really believe he really just sees himself

251
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
Desert room ever again specialty Neil this is almost 20 years ago he was really a Maverick and so I would say that

252
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,111
Challenged from the standpoint of him being a subsidiary within a large US company at what time

253
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
But his approach to the Chinese market is sort of

254
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Ability to kind of come up with

255
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,559
Things that really can disrupt the market to this day he has done that

256
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
I actually learned a lot from him

257
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
And you know our episode in China

258
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,727
The challenge was and is now kind of a

259
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,591
A seminal moment if you will was meeting with the government officials and

260
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
And them in

261
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
None

262
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
Not so uncertain term saying that you know Yahoo really you shouldn't shouldn't be operating in China and

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,439
Or even what was the way they said that you know we have this regulation that's coming up

264
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Next year that will make

265
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
What you guys are doing the illegal in

266
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,911
Courses in regulation I think the never got past but you kind of get the idea that you down they really

267
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Suggested that we don't operate in the media and

268
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
Information business in China so

269
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,383
That was when we got the hint and we said well you know if we're going to

270
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,271
Pull out of China we want to put our efforts with somebody that we think of you winner

271
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
3721 acquisition already yes this is supposed to be 71

272
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Because we all did 100%

273
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
And

274
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
And the government

275
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Was

276
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Not really

277
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Keen on having

278
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,911
A foreign-owned entity that has potential

279
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Information to Media

280
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Presents so

281
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
So we we knew we had to get out a coffee you would have

282
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
Part of the debate was you know if we're going to

283
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
Leave China we should parlay hour

284
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Alcester

285
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
Into something else

286
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
And that's when we went down this investment path

287
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,535
And and I'll be asleep by that time we've reconnected with Jack but also more importantly the

288
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
That e-commerce

289
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
This was not an area that was subject to

290
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Foreign investment

291
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
And so we thought that if we can

292
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Translate hour

293
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
Holdings in China or operations in China into

294
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,967
Investment in a minority investment the government will be fine with that in and obviously too

295
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
Area B Commerce I was I was fine so

296
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
So that's how we ended up

297
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
At least

298
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
Sequentially get there

299
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
1 billion cash

300
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Plus Yahoo

301
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
Will China yes for 40% stake in

302
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
It's so

303
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,423
They seem to bother you so model of a afterwards with a 5 billion side billing pus-y yeah

304
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
That was pretty

305
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
But I remember I mean

306
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
That what this was

307
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,831
Done in 2005

308
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Summit

309
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
In Pebble Beach

310
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,231
And bananas nouns in June or July

311
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,839
Earth-shattering cuz he was on the kilobyte or going public

312
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Bye Felicia

313
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Quadruple post

314
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Listing to about 5 billion

315
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,823
And you have to fight being dollar company what when Prophet pocket when private in China

316
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,151
Abraham said they had these coming had no business being out on my chin

317
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
The design of Justified

318
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,039
How did you how were you able to make that

319
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Decision

320
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
To do this

321
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
And how are you without you as a CEO this deal will never have gotten I wasn't the CEO at Terry Semel was a CEO in

322
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
The Terry was

323
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,911
You're with me in China that moment when the government told us that we

324
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Couldn't be in China anymore

325
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Terry was

326
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
Extremely positive about China and quite frankly

327
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
Doesn't get enough credit for all the things

328
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
We

329
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
Yell in my mind and thinking back about it it was a very obvious

330
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Things to do

331
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Dylan and I think a lot of people

332
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,183
Say this about decisions that you feel good about right decisions that you don't really

333
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,023
Think of all the difficulties but I think in retrospect you're right it is

334
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
A huge

335
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Investment

336
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
For a company

337
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,471
Like Yahoo to use how much of our cash to bet on that kind of valuation on that market

338
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
Improving Market obviously

339
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,479
Guidance guidepost one is you know we saw the success in Japan

340
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,855
Where we were in the auction business and commerce business so we saw you know betting on

341
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
The disorder of the

342
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Betting on the on the leader

343
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
Even though there's not a lot of tech you know there is

344
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,351
A lot of marketplace Dynamics are already starting to take

345
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
And the second thing

346
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
Which I've talked about publicly is that

347
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,287
During the time we were running Yahoo China weather is

348
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
Sorority more with

349
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
Cojones

350
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
We try to establish our e-commerce business

351
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
Using the same Playbook

352
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
That we did in Japan and

353
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
We were just

354
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,319
Getting killed in completely annihilated by taobao

355
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
And

356
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
And we knew how Fierce and how

357
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
Smart & house for teacher

358
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Yelp

359
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
Comic-Con the grand level but also on the Tactical level

360
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
Jack and his team was and I think that we threw that competition We Believe

361
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
I called his caterpillar

362
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,359
So so it was It was kind of in the

363
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,967
Humbling experience of having competed with Jack that we realized we'd rather partner with him then

364
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
The tide compete with them

365
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
And I think Jack

366
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,135
And then I'll probably benefited from that investment as well they really like you said you know

367
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Put them on the map as a sort of the leading internet company in China

368
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,583
It's so it was the right time clearly we were

369
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Besides a

370
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Jack ma Ali Baba

371
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Hopi language

372
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
Working with someone like a robin Li and Baidu or

373
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Ponemah in pain sent to you by

374
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,407
Well I I think I your choice well I don't know if we had a choice

375
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
The clearly

376
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
There are great entrepreneurs and they they are

377
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
Proving you know if you look at Pony

378
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,647
You know I'm with you and me a WeChat you know that position WeChat

379
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Turn out to be one of those

380
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,791
Salmon oil to we try to come on yeah it's unbelievable

381
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,191
And anyway we can talk about their history and how they made multiple transitions just in business models in India

382
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,591
But I always say that the simple answer is that while they're great entrepreneurs

383
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
For Yahoo to be involved

384
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
And

385
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Search

386
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
Which is Baidu or in

387
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
QQ wechat Communications

388
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
The messaging would have been difficult

389
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
And I think

390
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
I think e-commerce was the

391
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
The obvious safe place for us to be

392
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Government

393
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
So that was a factor

394
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
Famous earlier about

395
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Getting very

396
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Clear

397
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,215
Understanding from times government what you could do cannot do in China

398
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:27,615
Twice a day with clear but it was never clear that you could do something so

399
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
So

400
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Sew-in in. Contacts

401
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,647
Do you think that switching to talk a little bit

402
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,511
Travis Uber decide to do a deal with Ed which was a

403
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
Did you prepare for Leo

404
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Silver China

405
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
2dd in exchange for stake in DD and IBD have

406
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Mistaken buber in the US

407
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
As well

408
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Do you think that was

409
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
A similar context

410
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
10 years later

411
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,615
You know I'm an observer

412
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
On the board for DD and

413
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
But I don't really know the details of

414
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:09,343
That transaction might my guess is that there was some government

415
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
It certainly

416
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,159
Agreement for them to

417
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,999
There has to be some sort of government approval for DD and yd

418
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
Commercial previously

419
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,399
And then when Deedee and hoober resolved their competition in China

420
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
The government hats at least

421
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Let it happen

422
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
Because they were sexually

423
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,359
The last two players left so whether there was

424
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Significant

425
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Issues

426
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
With Uber being a US company

427
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
In China

428
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
You certainly can speculate that you know it's you

429
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Have

430
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
Massive amounts of data around transfer

431
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Petition in routes

432
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Some people's

433
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,999
Moving patterns that that could be construed as something that's sensitive and so

434
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
What the weather that really was a factor or not who knows

435
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Looks at me I wasn't part of the

436
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,911
Let's discuss the truck driver has shared internal struggles that

437
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
His understanding

438
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
From Chinese government was

439
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Subsidy

440
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
In this case

441
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,431
Cookie ends up being illegal soon

442
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
Uber and obviously they think twice about what

443
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
Yeah

444
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
It's um

445
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Yahoo welcome to

446
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Welcome to China

447
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:19,744
Not another thing happened here as well in the US

448
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,352
Where Alabama's most recent the interest inquiring a payment processor in the US

449
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
Whiskey night in this is even after

450
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
Jacket already famously met with President Trump

451
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
And had a great conversation

452
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,312
If a person from Praise Him

453
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Afterwards

454
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
So seems like this is just a lot up

455
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Politics

456
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
And

457
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Polarization

458
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
Around us China business dealing

459
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,088
You know wait that's kind of

460
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
Not really a line with end-of-line business

461
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Economics

462
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
Yeah I think it's one of our

463
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
Givenchy GV

464
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
Interested in a lot of our investment

465
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Commonalities is

466
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
RBC cross-border in icing

467
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
The US China cross-border

468
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
Issues are getting more complex rather than lust

469
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
And as tech companies become bigger bigger

470
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
If you look

471
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
Ali Baba

472
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Or Amazon or

473
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
You know obviously you're

474
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
You're faang stocks and companies

475
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
There are

476
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
Enormous complexities now

477
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
ATL

478
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
With regards to

479
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
Aldi's deals are evaluated or proposed deals in

480
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,352
It's not even just internet deals right I mean if you look at all the semiconductor deals in the last

481
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Couple years

482
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
The regulatory body

483
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
The US which

484
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
Cepheus is

485
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
It is it

486
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
This is largely a political

487
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
Body so I think it becomes much more difficult

488
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
4/3 of these bigger companies to do deals

489
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:48,320
That may of touch on other people so you can imagine it's not maybe just a government that don't want certain deals

490
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
What happened like the one you're talking about

491
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
Maybe other companies I don't want that

492
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
And they were popular

493
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,840
Yeah so I think it's a politicized issue right now between the two countries we certainly hope that that environment atmosphere which

494
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
Change over time

495
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
As I think the best outcome is for

496
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,728
More free-flowing of products and ideas

497
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
And then capabilities markets

498
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
But for now it seems like we're entering more of a more

499
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Cautious

500
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Time between the two

501
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,736
I know that for example from the perspective of visa and master

502
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,784
They're extremely worried about ipe

503
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
Turn up volume of body paint

504
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Together

505
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
Is becoming closer and closer to what

506
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
I'm beside myself

507
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
Also in China

508
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
So

509
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
It's like you said there's notches

510
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,168
Political issue but also for other place in the market

511
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
People just wary of

512
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Deify suspension.

513
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,544
Chinese companies hire

514
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
In general

515
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,152
Retin-A with Chinese tourists being the

516
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Fast-growing outbound

517
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Traffic anywhere

518
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
Empowered that you put on top of that

519
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Is it makes any

520
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Existing playing any

521
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Boston Market

522
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Weary

523
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
What could happen

524
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
So it's almost as if

525
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
This may not be the perfect analogy

526
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Nut

527
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,448
The Chinese company in the US company are going out to different parts of the world

528
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
We see that

529
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
You probably have seen as well

530
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
Us companies do better in Western Europe

531
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
Canada

532
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Australia New Zealand

533
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
America

534
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,968
And

535
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
Executives with NFL

536
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Indian descent

537
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
In emerging companies have

538
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,160
Show me I didn't do well in India as well

539
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,512
Where is a Chinese company to battery in Southeast Asia including onesia

540
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,816
The Muslim countries in the Middle East and

541
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
North Africa

542
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Eastern Europe

543
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,960
Seems like the world is almost divided into half

544
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
A look at a Chinese Hall fees

545
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
1 Belair Road

546
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Expanding into

547
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Middle East

548
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
Give me different parts of Europe in North

549
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
And Africa in general

550
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
That the world is

551
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Coming more more

552
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,624
Yeah and it's not clear how

553
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,720
The weather is really two camps or not it I think eyes to us

554
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
Current policy tends to be

555
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
Yeah retrenching from a lot of Art

556
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,120
Even being a longtime allies it's

557
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
It's unclear why leave in the US influence

558
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
Sinfar Marcus Wu

559
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Will continue but I do think

560
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
And having us as most Dino

561
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
Inadvertently or IR or

562
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
I think he wrote it yesterday or today that

563
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
The US has helped make China great

564
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:33,696
Nnic part of it Florida go yeah I think I think part of it

565
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,792
It is as you said that that the government policy of 1,000 Road is

566
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
Taking a lot of

567
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,352
Government

568
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Resources

569
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
To build infrastructure.

570
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,752
Ties development into Southeast Asia

571
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,080
Sir the Indochina independent in Indonesia

572
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
And then you know sort of

573
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,688
Westward it through the Stans in

574
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
And into Africa

575
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,528
It won't be surprising I think

576
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,320
To see Chinese companies also

577
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
The private sector being taken advantage of the sort of the

578
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
The Tailwind that the government is

579
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
So if you had the chance

580
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
To do it again would you have tried

581
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,424
Operator in China from day one or would you have picked a local

582
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,216
Or invest in a little coat

583
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
Company from day one

584
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,104
I am always those are hard questions because

585
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
I think I think

586
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
With

587
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Our experience

588
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
It was a moment in time

589
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
You know

590
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Today if you were to

591
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Try to start

592
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:39,232
Yeah you wouldn't start what we started back has because the rules are more clear than more players than

593
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Marcus Montebello

594
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,400
It is you know we would have to find another kind of a Greenfield early-stage

595
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
Endeavour. To have a question but

596
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
But I would say that

597
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
Having

598
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
Spent the time of China operate in China

599
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,408
Have you spent a time through Acquisitions and trying to acquire Chinese company

600
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Having spent her Time competed

601
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
With Carbone Alibaba

602
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
You know he led us to this very

603
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
As I said, so natural

604
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,928
An obvious decision to invest in Alibaba

605
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
Which I don't think we would have done

606
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
Have we gone in there turning dust

607
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,120
Yo ass up here investors because we didn't have the skill set of being an investor

608
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
Or

609
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,984
Or trying to find a partner and believe me we try to find Partners but

610
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
The finding a JV partner something else would have been

611
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
I think also break

612
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Palazzo

613
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,944
I'm so envious because you know it's it's almost

614
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,272
Like the old saying goes you know every every step we took was for a reason

615
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
And

616
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,184
Now we we never imagined I never imagined that fine dusting Alibaba 2005 we would end up having

617
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
Alibaba being nearly half a billion dollar company

618
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,816
But but certainly we felt like they were our best chance

619
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
Successful

620
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
In China

621
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
Through their hard work and their

622
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
What kind of advice

623
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
Do you give to us companies

624
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:00,640
For seek your advice as they try to go to China and what do you think that companies like

625
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,480
Facebook or Airbnb should do as they approached Chinese

626
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,040
Well I think

627
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,624
I told a lot of our companies to try to go early

628
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
Not necessarily to set up a very inflexible joint venture or anything like that but go early to explore more

629
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
How to get to know people build relationships

630
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,192
Understand the market and understand their product Market fit it really is two different worlds now

631
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,240
Lighting the Chinese market especially

632
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,800
Almost every Market B2B b2c

633
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
Is I think that's different

634
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
In China is in anywhere else from The Uso

635
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,504
So there is no sort of hey we can do what we did in the US and it working

636
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
China more the other way around these days

637
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
It will get to that song

638
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,904
So that's that's one thing is to just

639
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
Did understand China early a meet people early

640
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,584
And the same thing is if there really is an ambition to China there has to be a plan

641
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,656
But also you have to probably go in there before

642
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Too big

643
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
And I think there is

644
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Some weariness by

645
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,824
The multiple different factions within China weather is the government

646
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
Or the private sector or

647
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,456
Whoever to say Hey you know if your large large company like Airbnb or Facebook

648
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Time in the China

649
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:14,368
There's more worried about them coming in and going against what a government

650
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
Policy is real government agenda is

651
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,768
I think Airbnb probably has had more success than safe Facebook

652
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
But over time I think all these

653
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
All these things will work

654
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
Play out in the way.

655
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,216
It really depends on I think with the market would accept in China and the government works

656
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,776
But I think by going somewhere early

657
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Helps companies

658
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
Not have that big

659
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Serta company syndrome

660
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Can you put on them

661
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,736
It's much tougher on the company cuz they're not big

662
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,296
But I think it's a really do China as a core Market

663
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
They should do that

664
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Soonerride

665
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
Has the lesson is that it's never too early to

666
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:53,280
Two-factor China into a girl's plan and hire people

667
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
It could be a

668
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,400
Yo I think if you run a company or used to run companies

669
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
You know you think about

670
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Energy markets in

671
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:06,848
1224 maybe you know and I'll set 36 months and I think in China you just have to take much longer term

672
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
It may take you five years

673
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
To get anywhere

674
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,016
May take you 10 years and we know plenty of companies

675
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,112
I've been there for a long time and still have very little market share but there

676
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Continue to work

677
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
And trying to cultivate a relationship

678
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
China I say this with a lot of Arkham

679
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
China

680
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
It's not a place for transaction

681
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
China's really play

682
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,448
Play relationships and if you viewed as a transaction to say Hill going to start as a vegan

683
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Not this off of our checklist

684
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
I'm going to move on to the next country

685
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:41,152
It's not what chances are he's not going to go well and

686
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,712
Whereas I think it's those people who really

687
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:50,368
Sustained, Capital large wants to companies to go to there

688
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Country and do something for them

689
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
You know their China now try try this is

690
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
20 years ago self

691
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,792
So the China status is also changed so I think it really

692
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,096
It really takes a different kind of attitude

693
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
And long-term View

694
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
It's not just

695
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Another Market

696
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
It seems like

697
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
Any founding team in the US

698
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
I don't have someone

699
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Who's from

700
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
China origin

701
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
I need to send

702
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
It makes a lot hotter

703
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,248
We're both in Welsh

704
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
In

705
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
Peterson pastor

706
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,880
And also having Denny was a co-founder

707
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
It was from China

708
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Easier

709
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
I wish to figure out how to Leverage

710
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
Well yeah and then I think these are all generations right I think right now there are

711
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,752
Example you're exactly right having somebody that understood

712
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
China in Chinese

713
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
I can go back there and function there

714
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,504
Which is not all the Chinese kill can I I can't go back and function there but but Danny can and I think

715
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
That's critical but I think over time

716
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,856
As China becomes a market that

717
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,160
Everybody has to be able to

718
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Expose himself to

719
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
Because it's probably

720
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,352
You know it right now is still the US and maybe Western Europe but pretty soon China

721
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
Is the top one or two Market that you have to

722
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:12,544
Be successful at if you're building a company so so that that that may or may not be

723
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
Exclusively.

724
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,872
Dimaio's people who are Chinese I mean

725
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:21,248
But so far it has been that you really takes a while to to really understand China and

726
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,320
And you being an expat there is not the easiest

727
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,464
Thing to do know in a very very Dynamic competitive and I mean your show is called

728
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
I-96 right I mean not to

729
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,328
A very shocking kind of thing for people who visit there

730
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,424
But I'm still down at 2 p.m.

731
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
United States in China

732
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
If you look at

733
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Two set of data points

734
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Looking about edition of Amazon worth

735
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
Probably somewhere

736
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
Arguably

737
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Call China Inn

738
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Parts of Southeast Asia

739
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Amazon has

740
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
Walmart

741
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
China

742
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
I've got to get about Alicia

743
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
Is

744
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Bakehouse

745
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
You look at DD

746
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
Versus

747
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,072
Uber do you start a 4 years after Uber

748
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,632
You're not an observer

749
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
They are

750
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
Primarily a Chinese company

751
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
Investments LLC

752
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,360
Uber has been all around the world with minority stake in China

753
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
Yet

754
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
Bobby some to company

755
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
Arabic symbols wechat

756
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
So

757
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
The Chinese market has just been

758
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
For the right

759
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
Mobile internet company who has the right product Market fit

760
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Who do walk 9

761
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
Computer company install a much faster

762
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
That anybody else

763
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Has never happened

764
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,472
What does that mean and how is going to impact silicone body

765
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
I noticed some of the smartest

766
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
Product people

767
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
Instagram Maui

768
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,128
Are increasingly paying attention to what's happening China Buffet

769
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
WeChat

770
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
With alipay

771
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
And so forth

772
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
And I change the way they see my building products

773
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Neu us

774
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Infor

775
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Other markets

776
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
Is that a growing trend

777
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
Okay or is it just more of anomaly

778
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Still

779
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Prediction 5

780
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
Special 10 years old

781
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
How would the teacher

782
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Nissan

783
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,240
GOI it's a really good question and I think

784
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
Part of the reality is that

785
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
The volume

786
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,640
That you know the companies that you talked about whether it's

787
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,432
You know Alibaba tencent or

788
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
DD

789
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
The volume they do everyday

790
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Astound

791
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,088
Real people who don't spend time there

792
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
You know so

793
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,208
It's it's adding another zero sometimes to zero the one you talk about

794
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:43,328
Scully China whether its mate while I'm doing deliveries or either doing

795
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
The number transactions in

796
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Denali pay in tencent Tempe

797
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
Or the number is a TD kids

798
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
Get some

799
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
It is so there is a

800
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
Scale factor that is

801
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
Extremely important

802
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
I think in

803
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
When people develop new products

804
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
In China is set

805
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
Necessarily need the fanciest

806
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Technologist

807
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
Bodega

808
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Handle the kind of scale that's much much much higher

809
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
Right and be stable

810
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
There's a

811
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
So there's an element of

812
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,120
And as those companies growing as those companies scale

813
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,216
Hey you think they can they can take that advantage of stability and scale

814
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,288
Elsewhere that us companies we have to read

815
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,848
Do to get the kind of scale elsewhere

816
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
Especially

817
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,224
So that's one one element the other element I think is that

818
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
There is still a

819
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:39,136
A lot of more fundamental Innovation here in Silicon Valley it is still the Melting Pot of

820
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
The world

821
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Dustin

822
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,000
Apparently all we have on froze you and I both by have on Forest Home every

823
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,376
Country has a very diverse

824
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,008
Set of entrepreneurs and I think in China is still relatively mono in a monolithic in terms of their most

825
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Chinese butt

826
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,104
But you're starting to see Innovation that is

827
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
Really for China Market sick

828
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,224
It really indigenous and really local

829
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
And using business models developed

830
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
You're saying because of the scale and

831
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Can you sing

832
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,112
The density of the population

833
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,696
Allow certain things to happen in China that won't happen in Uso

834
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,792
We're saying business model differences right not just technology a product

835
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Differences but really starting to

836
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,608
Whiskey Business

837
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:26,752
And I think that's what's going to happen in 5 to 10 years where you going to have business models that really hard Innovative and different in China then

838
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Then the US

839
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,616
A little closer to Ali Baba but you know the new retail that the Ali Baba is

840
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Is advancing

841
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
Yo yeah it's really hard to do here in the US but he really works in the in China

842
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,344
So did that I think you're just beginning to see

843
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,720
China going from the early days of the internet being sort of a copycat culture

844
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,536
Two more indigenous development

845
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
For local market products

846
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,168
Which is now graduated to eat more indigenous business models innovation

847
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,240
And we have all those things really working it's kind of like a flywheel right

848
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,056
Sing

849
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Not only

850
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
Alibaba tencent Baidu being

851
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,920
Large players in oral mucosa

852
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,712
Systems in terms of Hindustan

853
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
An m&a

854
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,576
You're saying there next Generation in ddn

855
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Mate1

856
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,648
And those people are now very aggressive

857
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
Faster than Eminem

858
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
As well so

859
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
Did the relay

860
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
Creating their own sort of ecosystem there

861
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,192
I think part of the reason sings scale so fast in China is due to the leapfrogging effect

862
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
So sure how to skip credit cards into mobile

863
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,056
Cement skipped on-premise software

864
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,616
Get landline to mobile

865
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
How much do you think

866
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
The growth can be attributed to the Sea facts and

867
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
How can companies continue to

868
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,576
Scale once this low-hanging fruits are already paid

869
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,232
It's a great coach I do think the Frost has been a great benefit to China but

870
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
You also have to remember

871
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
India could have done the same LeapFrog

872
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
And

873
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
By most measures there

874
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:02,240
Most developed countries could all have the power

875
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,664
Rhysand and so so I think there is

876
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,736
Far behind in China when they

877
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,040
Could have arguably been about the same starting point

878
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
The mid-90s

879
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
He's right so

880
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,208
So I do think that the LeapFrog is something that China as a country

881
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,488
We're very conscious

882
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,304
Trying to take advantage of and this probably lot of it is

883
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
The government leadership and put the put a lot of it is I think the entrepreneurial spirit

884
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
To say hey

885
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
You know we're going to solve a problem

886
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,264
And we're going to solve a problem with

887
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
No existing

888
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,640
Yes it and whether it's Logistics which they didn't have vassalage

889
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
Network like

890
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
FedEx

891
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Whatever

892
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Or

893
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
Like you said landline

894
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Mobile phones or

895
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,440
A number of other ways in which China develop faster than

896
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
I think e-commerce is one of them

897
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Right I mean

898
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,840
For awhile retail e-commerce coexisted but but it's

899
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Clear that you Commerce

900
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,424
Has more benefit without having to go build

901
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Stores

902
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
So I think I think there is a conscious effort

903
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,312
For China to do these leapfrogging move

904
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
Looks now but I think

905
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
Overtime

906
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Yo

907
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
Sting scale

908
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,248
It's harder and harder to leave froggy can't really leave frog

909
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Existing

910
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
Scaled infrastructure so

911
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
That may slow down

912
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
Growth at some point which

913
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
It has to slow down

914
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,976
But that the question really is is

915
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Is there new areas

916
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Pecan Grove

917
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Just as fast

918
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
From LeapFrog

919
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Is and that's

920
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
You mentioned

921
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,936
Cloud and SAS I think

922
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
I think there's actually

923
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
An argument to be made that

924
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,568
Assassin China is still very

925
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
Must do everyday

926
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
There's not a very

927
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
Yes all the cloud is Big player AWS

928
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Just getting started their butt

929
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,296
But it's not like here where

930
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,088
You know major major major business

931
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,952
There are still a lot of room to grow I think in digital

932
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
Media in China

933
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
And I think that's an area where

934
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
There's still a lot of opportunity so so

935
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
My guess is that

936
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
Azaria mature they need to keep

937
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Can you define leapfrogging out

938
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Unity Sand

939
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
And it's not surprising that a lot of these

940
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
Large

941
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,640
Internet companies in China are starting to look outside of China

942
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
You know Indonesia being a

943
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
Key Battleground for a lot of companies

944
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,296
But it's going to happen elsewhere

945
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
It seems like

946
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
And look up question.

947
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Supposed

948
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
A lot of smart

949
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,976
Journalist in The Wire

950
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Your times were

951
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Masonry caulk

952
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
A similar question

953
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Thinking that

954
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Chana benefit

955
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Behind in

956
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
LeapFrog dog

957
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
It's easier somehow

958
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
Implies easy

959
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Weebly you look at the

960
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
Florist

961
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
Portal days

962
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
2

963
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,760
Gaming dice to the

964
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
Search messaging e-commerce days

965
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Now to the mobile internet days

966
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
The quality of Engineers continue to go up

967
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,488
And for one reason or the other

968
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
A lot of be smart people

969
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
May have been educated

970
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
Or working us

971
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,912
Weather stupid glass ceiling or other factors

972
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
It was

973
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
He kind of made it easier for them to

974
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
Not easier but can of pumpkin to

975
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,152
Try to go back to town and we can walk there and be here to do it

976
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,480
And not something like that this into a China India comparison

977
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
But

978
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
A lot of Indian

979
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,136
Executives who may have been interrupted in India

980
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
Interrupting beanbags successful in the valley

981
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,512
And in in Boston in Seattle and so forth

982
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,376
The town that would have to compare what time they may have been able to prevail

983
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
India to the next level

984
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
Ends up staying here any us

985
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Where is the same level

986
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,800
Quality of talent and took going back to China

987
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Installed a whole new internet suck

988
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,663
It obviously government played a part in

989
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,735
Allowing that to happen and not try to Uber regulator too much

990
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
And so

991
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
One thing I also notice is on

992
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
For the Chinese

993
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
Intrapreneurs nobody's for Generations

994
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
In some sense

995
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
We are there and we are lucky

996
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
Was the time

997
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
That this week and a half

998
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
In the spirit of any number two possible

999
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,959
If you come up with new ways to increase efficiency

1000
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Intuit ecosystem

1001
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Which

1002
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
I mean who would have thought.

1003
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
10 years ago

1004
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,663
What are the most valuable companies in China will be none government-owned

1005
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
Ram 2500

1006
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:34,623
He was China petrochemical mobile it was ICBC Bank

1007
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
These days

1008
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,535
That that that you had number one number two most powerful company in China being completely Private Eyes

1009
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
And run by Angela Norris

1010
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
Induction cook celery

1011
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Open next

1012
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
10 years

1013
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,983
Ben that's something that no one with all possible

1014
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
10 years ago

1015
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,567
So something about internet something that fit

1016
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,639
Chinese Innovation and Entrepreneurship

1017
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
That kind of Defense each other to

1018
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
Make the screen

1019
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Change

1020
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
In China

1021
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
The question is

1022
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,087
Could that be exported

1023
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
2

1024
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,903
Indonesia Middle East

1025
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Do other countries wear

1026
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
One belt One roemmich play a factor

1027
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
And somehow

1028
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
This model can be a interesting

1029
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
Develop

1030
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Teen model

1031
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
For other emerging market

1032
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
That didn't have

1033
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,519
May not be able to do that on their own

1034
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
But now could be affecting my check

1035
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,871
It's a great question Hans in the end I think

1036
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,735
Yo just to go back on something you said I I think there's a little bit of

1037
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,575
There's not another perspective with regards to

1038
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Chinese entrepreneurs

1039
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,903
I think that

1040
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
As the China Market has

1041
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:46,047
Taking off and then started Rising quite frankly they were probably more opportunities for

1042
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
Them to go back

1043
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
I'ma career in

1044
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,007
And contribution stamp points and staying here in the USA I don't know if there's really a glass ceiling

1045
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Get into that

1046
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
Privacy glass going for

1047
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Indian tech executives

1048
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
And a number of other ethnicities

1049
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,015
So it may just be that opportunity China is much bigger and you can party argue that

1050
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
You know for Indian

1051
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
Global Executive to go back to India

1052
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
What are they going to do there

1053
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
Alright so

1054
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,951
So it really does speak to the the rise of China's

1055
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,975
Economy in the rise

1056
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
Anna's development

1057
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
To attract

1058
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
The make that

1059
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Makemake coming back

1060
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Fort Lauderdale

1061
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Oversea-chinese to be attractive

1062
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,495
If not all of them have been successful but I think that there continues to be a massive

1063
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
Tallinn China

1064
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,615
And so there is no question that has you think about

1065
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,943
Yeah we highlighted you highlighted a number of great entrepreneurs and show

1066
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
But you don't

1067
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
You need hundreds of thousands of

1068
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Skilled

1069
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
Techworkers

1070
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,463
Programmers and coders and developers and now you know Big Data

1071
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
Today I capable

1072
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Engineer

1073
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
These are

1074
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Extreme shortage

1075
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,607
Did China even know they're trying to crank

1076
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Come outside

1077
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,679
To me it's more the opportunity back

1078
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
In the market that they

1079
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
That they have the Heritage from rather than

1080
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
Danny Nelson

1081
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,615
To that point the question is can Chinese companies

1082
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Stand outside

1083
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,991
China or help countries markets that have not been developed outside China

1084
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
I think that's the next

1085
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,343
Big question in the mixpix phase for China's

1086
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
Gross

1087
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,743
Everybody's trying to do a little differently I think governments are getting smarter post Uber and post

1088
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Aldi's

1089
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,815
Companies come in and in so

1090
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,143
It's going to be less straightforward I think then

1091
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
The past 20 years regulations

1092
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Going to deal with local

1093
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
People

1094
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Probably they won

1095
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,871
Especially if your large company and Sully's become sort of

1096
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Upfront

1097
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
Negotiated

1098
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Political government deals

1099
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
Many instances

1100
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
And

1101
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,623
And end and so I think it takes a different skill-set to do Maneuvers in

1102
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
All these different countries

1103
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Who all have Tiffany's

1104
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,511
Being able to contact create not only a

1105
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,839
Sustainable Market but also develop Talent locally

1106
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
Because it's hard to export bunch

1107
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
Chinese managers into

1108
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
Country for very very long time

1109
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,775
Hussein kind of Japan try to do that

1110
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,567
Didn't work in the eighties and nineties

1111
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:12,479
So it's got to be a different way we nobody knows what it is yet but I think it's going to it's going to be the next big challenge for lotto

1112
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,087
Rebecca Webb Alabama

1113
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Export in Chinese

1114
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Manager

1115
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,511
We also have seen

1116
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Up companies

1117
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
Building up sizable press

1118
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
In Middle East

1119
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Is also a

1120
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Area B Commerce

1121
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Curated

1122
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Morning

1123
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
T-Mobile

1124
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
2

1125
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
Markets

1126
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
The Muslim country

1127
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,175
And they're growing extremely fast

1128
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,759
You can tell that then the consumers in Muslim country

1129
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,575
Did I used to getting diskin flux up Goods at

1130
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
Such cheap

1131
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Affordable prices

1132
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,951
In Soca quality at great prices

1133
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
Rate formula flea market

1134
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
And so

1135
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
It is seems like

1136
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
The Chinese companies even with

1137
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
Too much government

1138
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
Overtly supporting them

1139
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,775
Are fighting weight expending

1140
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
So

1141
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
And the old man have sex

1142
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
If not talk till 7

1143
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
So

1144
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
It seems like

1145
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,759
One could also guess that the

1146
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
Local executives

1147
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,599
India Muslim countries

1148
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,135
The work any Chinese companies

1149
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,183
Eventually maybe their own

1150
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,487
Yeah Jerry Yang and Jack Ma

1151
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
In those countries

1152
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,047
So

1153
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
Guess my question is that

1154
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
Us by not letting Chinese in

1155
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Missing out getting these

1156
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Cedar Point

1157
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
Know what's going on around the world

1158
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,799
Ensure for short-term

1159
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,359
You prevented a Chinese company from coming into the US

1160
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,639
Footlocker.com

1161
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,943
You're missing all what's potentially

1162
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Possible

1163
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
Not making that

1164
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
Nestor changes hit you need

1165
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Global basis

1166
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Earlier

1167
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,439
Yeah well I think any barrier

1168
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,279
You know I'm a globalist so I think any barrier is generally negative

1169
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
You could argue that

1170
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,887
The us being more

1171
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
Protectionist now than before

1172
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
Yes

1173
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
Missing out on some

1174
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
Trends that could be happening elsewhere in the world in

1175
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
And I think

1176
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
China has been criticized

1177
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
Last 20 years were not

1178
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,991
Open brightness setting from the great things I may become

1179
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
Companies like Google and

1180
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,319
Facebook are doing so

1181
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:29,695
So you know I think it's easy to point out that these barriers tend to have a negative effect but also

1182
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,231
Overtime I think

1183
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Yelp

1184
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,583
It remains to be seen how how these different

1185
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
Marcus would develop because if

1186
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
Markets that China now Dustin

1187
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
And I'm more like China there is

1188
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,311
And it's not just the market dynamics but it

1189
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,431
The way to a government-to-government think about it and in the trade and everything else so

1190
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,735
I think the stakes are much higher

1191
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,063
And I'll come back to that same a couple times but I think the stakes are much higher in

1192
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
And whoever wants to

1193
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
To win in these markets now how to

1194
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,207
Go in with much more at

1195
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,375
I wonder out of the Chinese Tech Giants

1196
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
Which one do you think is best equipped

1197
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:14,751
To go Global in this is a question for both hands and Jerry

1198
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Wow

1199
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
Face on Face Off

1200
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
You know it

1201
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
I I think

1202
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,247
My

1203
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,807
Original business was it was an internet

1204
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
Portal or search

1205
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,159
Reformation business and so I think

1206
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:37,279
I think of information businesses as a little bit easier to move around and I would say you know

1207
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,815
Tencent is probably in that

1208
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Camp

1209
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
They have

1210
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,447
Unbelievable acid in WeChat and

1211
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,543
And if the capabilities on WeChat is offered

1212
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
You know in other markets

1213
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,127
In its full capacity

1214
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,175
I think it'd be very very difficult for others

1215
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Some people compete

1216
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
And

1217
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
Yesterday

1218
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
There is what happened

1219
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
Lions line in

1220
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:06,207
I think I have them all but you know but but I do think that the power of the network and

1221
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,255
Power software is very easy to go out now

1222
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Alibaba

1223
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,583
Clearly is the other one that

1224
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,863
House payment

1225
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:17,215
Special way of entering markets and their e commerce is

1226
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
Is once they establish it is very very very powerful as well soap in terms of being a the mood quickly I would imagine

1227
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
Moving a messaging app around is probably

1228
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Liberty zrn

1229
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,527
Does a soap or hasn't demonstrated

1230
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
Sea level commitment

1231
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
Dot Alabama

1232
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
Yeah

1233
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
That's a great question I don't know I don't know

1234
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,767
I think they're happy to let the Chinese diaspora

1235
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Spread that WeChat for now

1236
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,583
Got it

1237
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
What are you what do you think

1238
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,679
I noticed that the Alibaba tencent Generation Y

1239
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,727
Chorus pedal be over 45

1240
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
I'm over 50

1241
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,543
And that's a generation

1242
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,591
Uncle Rob still treating the West

1243
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,151
As you know where a lot of innovation happening

1244
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
It's a very healthy dose

1245
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
The Interpreter was seeing

1246
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Not our

1247
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Chainsaw race

1248
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,623
30 and 40 Grand Pointe Chinese internet Market

1249
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,159
Start to grow fast

1250
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,511
They do respect the us but there's a lot more ambition in their part

1251
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
2

1252
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
Show. They're always better why

1253
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,375
That look at the camera

1254
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,191
DD or timing at that hotel

1255
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,751
Or at the one singing at the

1256
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,031
Which one all of them

1257
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,823
Show more question

1258
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
Globalization

1259
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
And even the younger into

1260
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Penora's

1261
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
In Hangzhou

1262
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Not alright

1263
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
Used to things David cross border

1264
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,551
Are building companies are in suits

1265
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
Focusing on China album

1266
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
In there

1267
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,975
A question is even stronger than detention or Audi

1268
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
To do that

1269
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,095
So I think you would be extremely interested in the next 10 years

1270
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,703
I do like you think that everything's become a lot more politicized

1271
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
So

1272
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,287
A Chinese company I'm more likely to do well in

1273
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
Countries. Org

1274
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,591
Politically friendly

1275
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
And hence

1276
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
The Muslim countries

1277
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
So you'll be injured

1278
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
C2C

1279
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
What happened

1280
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,439
I like your answer you're basically saying I'm old and you're young

1281
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:26,239
That's why we're all doing this

1282
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,127
Picture of young people I think

1283
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,431
Your story of meeting Jack

1284
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
Confirmed she says that and I've always felt this way that we should judge people not just by who they are today about

1285
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Also by

1286
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,903
Who did Kobe coming

1287
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
10-20 years

1288
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,791
Now you're an investor how much of investing do you think is

1289
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,607
Judging people and like their future trajectory

1290
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,399
And how much of it is

1291
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Your business

1292
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,983
Well I ate it's really good question I think

1293
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,799
If you are investing at the stage

1294
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,591
That we are at AMA

1295
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,663
It really is early-stage sometimes

1296
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,223
Two Founders in a garage in

1297
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
Just with an idea and so

1298
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:15,647
How's it anyting pre-series younossi door or late seed even some series a companies

1299
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
You're really

1300
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,511
80% investing on the team

1301
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,607
I think where they want to go to the market it matters I think this sort of

1302
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,911
The product idea matter is obviously

1303
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:33,311
But it's very different than later stage investing you if you look at a series Bo gross then it doesn't matter where you're spending

1304
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,895
Capitals go to market but it before you go to market really is about

1305
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
The ideas behind the entrepreneur and

1306
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,295
Johanns knows this but the sum of our

1307
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
Some of my most

1308
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
2 + 1

1309
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
Public companies

1310
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,671
Have started the company under one premise

1311
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,207
And now they're doing something

1312
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,511
I almost a hundred eighty degrees

1313
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
And

1314
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,119
And I think you can only explain that by

1315
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:03,519
Having busted in people who are you know doggedly persistent in

1316
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
In solving problems in Falling weather

1317
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,383
Gut instinct

1318
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:14,015
What advice do you have for people who are trying to develop this good judgment

1319
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
Other people

1320
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:20,415
Honestly The more I've done this and you know what coming up on six years here as an investor

1321
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,047
Demarcus hackett's luck you know it it really is I mean obviously

1322
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
I said I jokingly but I do think that

1323
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,143
If you look at our successful entrepreneurs

1324
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,215
There are people who are very experienced their people who are first time

1325
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
You look at

1326
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,543
Some of entrepreneurs who failed multiple times

1327
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
You know someone very experienced in somewhere are

1328
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
And and we all know

1329
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,223
I believe that's the case for me personally that

1330
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,759
Building Company starting companies

1331
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,063
You got to work really hard to have

1332
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,623
Prepare all your life to do it you have to really

1333
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
Do it will help all all commitment at full passion

1334
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
But

1335
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,767
Luck has a huge part to do with

1336
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,839
And for me to have started Yahoo when we did

1337
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
It was really

1338
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,167
I think the good timing more than anything else

1339
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,287
Put me to meet you back as somebody that you know what does mon my first DUI made in China is it

1340
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,823
Is blind Luxo

1341
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,175
I think you you have to work hard and you have to prepare yourself but I think luck is a huge part of

1342
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
Making success and I think

1343
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,039
In our now if I had an algorithm to pick

1344
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,927
That would be worth selling but I think

1345
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,767
You look at cryptocurrency right I mean four years ago

1346
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,839
Yeah it would have bet on it right so

1347
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:38,239
So I think you really and then remains to be seen so I think it really it really comes down to at least in my mind

1348
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
Understanding the rationale

1349
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,591
How they are different things how they

1350
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
The water they motivations are

1351
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:48,223
How they plan to deal with adversity

1352
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,551
How they tell their stories sometimes just listen to Somebody's pitch

1353
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Changes your

1354
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
Opinion about

1355
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,159
Sometimes you eat look like

1356
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,439
Slide inside my goddess

1357
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719

Andy in the office

1359
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,815
Be true to self car

1360
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,655
So to me it's it's really a seal game and it's not about numbers

1361
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,727
I don't know what I would say is hardest for investing because you just

1362
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
You just never know

1363
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
You really you're really rolling the dice

1364
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,359
Another person you met really all his muscle

1365
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,895
Amazon Yoshi sign of self

1366
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
South Bank

1367
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,455
What do you think of

1368
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Vision Spa

1369
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
And how that's changing

1370
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,855
Well you know

1371
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
I think Massa

1372
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,695
Yo from the first day I met him

1373
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:37,375
What's the different than what I was going to say he know he is the most persistent

1374
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,399
Tireless

1375
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
You know he keeps

1376
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,495
Pushing himself and pushing people around him

1377
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,055
You know he has and he's

1378
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Emacs

1379
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,871
He makes big butts

1380
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,431
And people remember a lot of his

1381
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,735
Successes Yahoo fortunately was one of his early

1382
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,295
Successes but he's also have plenty of failures

1383
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
But you never less the failures.

1384
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Guitar hymn

1385
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,135
He just goes back in

1386
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,927
And fight harder and I think

1387
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,999
What the vision fund has done is allow him

1388
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
2

1389
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,839
Achieve something that I think he's always wanted to do which is

1390
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:14,751
Brothers being an investor that has some influence but not passive income

1391
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,847
Like most investors are quite frankly even odds for the all week

1392
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,919
You can pound the table and a note sound spinner doesn't want to listen

1393
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:25,247
But in his case because of the checkbook and because

1394
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:29,855
Of the platform he has a very clear platform that he wants to build around

1395
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,183
Ai and around iot and around

1396
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:37,279
The emergence of cloud that he feels like he can use that power of the capitol

1397
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
To create a next-generation platform

1398
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,119
Perform a car at 2

1399
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Modernized

1400
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
The correct notion but I think any of you sing the the beginnings of that with Didi and Uber in

1401
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,103
Transportation

1402
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,407
Betting big on on a Ahi

1403
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,455
Is big believer in Singularity

1404
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,247
I think he's very purpose

1405
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,599
And I think she wants to do more than just being a passive investor in the ready

1406
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
Couple of companies grow up in

1407
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
Sell it

1408
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,463
God wants to influence them you want to drive a certain direction

1409
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,511
And it's a big bold that and that's

1410
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
Best Masa

1411
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,095
Just take a look at it the ride sharing Market

1412
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,911

So nevermind China already his master in grab nanachi

00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
Profolio

1416
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
Number one in Southeast Asia

1417
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,895
Is investor in Orlando in India

1418
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
And by investing all these Uber competitors

1419
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
In the biggest markets

1420
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
Outside of us

1421
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
Eaton sub

1422
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,087
Indirectly or directly car you

1423
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,623
2 tribella virus remover

1424
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,183
Now he can you message Uber much more sacrifices

1425
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
In

1426
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:45,119
He may be easier to replicate at the Uber China DDO in Southeast Asia and India

1427
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,679
To have the local number one player buyout

1428
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
Uber prices locally

1429
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:53,567
Little Burgundy Baltimore that resource pack home driving for example

1430
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:58,175
Uber Eats you out of my shirt on the other business more profitable in more interesting and more

1431
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
Disruptive in

1432
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,503
So in some sense he trying to

1433
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,295
Using the resources you have

1434
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,111
To rationalize their the the market

1435
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,391
Deformed baby carrots

1436
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,863
As you said you know that to the extent that

1437
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
People compete and

1438
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
And cooperate

1439
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,751
In different regions on the Rideshare as a market for example

1440
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:29,151
You know it's a it's a win-win-win right I mean nobody's subsidizing and losing money in burning car

1441
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,687
And then for him

1442
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
That

1443
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
Drives up his investment Bassett Valley

1444
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,855
So he's he's got a very clear view of how

1445
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,135
These things could be made to be

1446
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Be successful

1447
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,951
But he still got

1448
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,743
You still got a lot to prove

1449
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,071
In terms of being able to really realize some of these things over

1450
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,631
But I think he sees

1451
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:54,239
That's a mistake

1452
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:58,079
Are we what are like Yahoo like Alibaba is going to make

1453
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Baltimore

1454
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
That's that's that's a plan

1455
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,967
Yahoo's investment in Alibaba has been called

1456
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
The best invest

1457
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,807
An American company has ever made in a Chinese

1458
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,623
Which investment do you think has been a second

1459
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:16,511
Look I I think it's an American company but

1460
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:21,887
Open asper yunnan

1461
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,191
And we went in at what beat

1462
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,007
2039 Dolley Madison it's incredible

1463
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,799
And they almost 35% 34

1464
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,871
Whatever it is

1465
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,455
So there is there the stories that

1466
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
That I think seem incredible now but

1467
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,807
But I think

1468
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,599
It's what makes

1469
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,159
This whole Venture business so interesting is that

1470
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
Joey doesn't

1471
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,791
Brian to start WhatsApp

1472
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
And

1473
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Have 50 people on Cell to Facebook

1474
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,399
But for $19

1475
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,495
Is is those kinds of Silicon Valley stories or Beijing

1476
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,311
Stories you know that that makes every entrepreneur want to

1477
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
To do this but

1478
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,687
But I also think

1479
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:11,295
You know we may be coming into the area where we might see more of those kinds of invest

1480
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,831
Commence by the Lots.

1481
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,903
The skills a lot bigger than the scales a lot

1482
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
And

1483
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Now there's disproportionate

1484
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Kind of

1485
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,303
Dynamics in the marketplace for

1486
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,863
Winners

1487
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,423
And so I think that's the that's the

1488
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,543
That's going to be the big thing is who's the next winter in a very big space and

1489
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
Argue

1490
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,639
That died today sign ups

1491
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,175
Cons of big players

1492
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
Time in the US

1493
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
18 China

1494
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
Well I think

1495
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,623
He's always you look at investors right

1496
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,903
And you guys are one of them

1497
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,207
And in most investors

1498
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:50,975
Invest

1499
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
Thinking that

1500
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
You know on the upside

1501
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
They will be the next B8

1502
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,167
Whatever but on the downside they can sell it to one of these guys

1503
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:04,799
Smite right and you've had plenty companies we have plenty of companies that always come to this Crossroad where

1504
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,079
I can go raise

1505
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,615
Alamo money

1506
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,895
Or I can sell a company

1507
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
Yeah

1508
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,455
A lot of companies

1509
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,759
Even if not for those may or may not want to sell it

1510
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,295
Company lot of investors will take

1511
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
They take the opposition

1512
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
So I think

1513
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:22,207
I don't think it's so much that startups are pawns I think the investment community

1514
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
And by the way I think the large companies are much

1515
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
Wasabi now

1516
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,071
And the

1517
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,375
Capital is coming not just from the traditional

1518
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,655
Venture capital

1519
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
Farmstead also

1520
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:36,287
A lot of corporate money and a lot of other money that's in the in the in the mix

1521
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,335
So, Sovereign wealth

1522
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,151
Cansado wealth funds really starting to play a role

1523
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,199
Because you know they have to get the return somewhere

1524
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,831
So I think it's more complex than just saying companies are ponds

1525
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,367
Did I think Realty investors

1526
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,647
Stop pushing for certain outcomes

1527
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
In most cases

1528
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,279
Delta rational and sell

1529
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,839
Sweetheart by companies on wannabe

1530
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,679
Completely irrational for very very very long time and maybe some things like magic leap

1531
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
Or something

1532
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
Could do that but

1533
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,311
But is very very difficult for I think for a large number of

1534
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,103
Small startups to

1535
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,151
Be able to maintain than race cars

1536
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
With their investors

1537
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
If there's a

1538
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,319
Alternative to sell at ocado try to actually argue that

1539
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
In the older days

1540
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,415
If you're at you remember in 10 years ago

1541
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,463
Most most of the Chinese Zodiac

1542
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,023
Run the risk of being clone by the big boy

1543
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:33,631
Voice record

1544
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,167
Petite these days

1545
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,727
Does the competition among themselves are so fierce

1546
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:41,055
You almost have the issue of balance of power that

1547
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,103
Baby brother by volume

1548
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,175
To save them self time to compete against each other

1549
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,711
Shut that she argues that

1550
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
Better.

1551
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
Than ever before

1552
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:54,367
Yeah and I think we all were saying a little bit of that in the US where

1553
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,903
You know I would say

1554
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
5 years ago

1555
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,023
The big internet companies in the US work what much more quizzes

1556
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,351
And recently I would say that you know

1557
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:10,751
They're they're much less so they're still Acquisitions here and there but they're more discipline their their lot less alcohol

1558
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:14,335
There is a lot less of the unit billion-dollar outcomes

1559
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,407
Fuel injector

1560
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
So

1561
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,271
And I suspect that China will go through that same phase at some point

1562
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,623
You been done to me these are just cyclist things right and so

1563
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,647
Startups

1564
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,719
In some ways I think it's a much more rational world

1565
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,071
Here in Silicon Valley now you have to you can't count on getting a choir 2 years from now

1566
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,631
Yo you you have to come up with something that

1567
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:44,031
Stainable and cause you said to become

1568
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,079
Companies here are building everything, Google

1569
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
You know is

1570
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Is

1571
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
Is building

1572
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,431
Everything from

1573
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,247
YOLO autonomous driving to

1574
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,319
Solving aging

1575
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:03,743
Activities are typically maybe Resort may be reserved for the startups

1576
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,047
Can years ago now the big companies are doing it

1577
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:09,631
Periodically so is your startup and you getting venture capital

1578
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:14,751
You have to come up with something that a big companies aren't going to do and I think that's also its shift

1579
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,335
11 yo you have to solve problems at the big guys

1580
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,919
Either don't want to solve or we don't have time

1581
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
Before I left that

1582
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,223
If they won't get to

1583
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
And oh. That's a totally different challenge

1584
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,391
So looking forward do you think the US

1585
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,671
And trying to take ecosys

1586
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,463
Systems will become more

1587
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,023
Integrado or more separate and ink

1588
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,887
Cuz I feel like for every app in the US or is that equivalent in China

1589
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,959
And both ecosystems are just very surprised

1590
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,007
People are at the people are separated in

1591
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,311
Countries

1592
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,639
I know I think I think today if you

1593
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
Can I can't even name one

1594
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
Really that

1595
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,271
App that you would use in the US

1596
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,087
You know to high-frequency that you would go to China and use

1597
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,415
Maybe you can come up to 1 but

1598
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,231
But I do think that's been

1599
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:11,327
You know two to ecosystem in that and then we talked about this I think

1600
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:19,007
The evolution of lost 15-20 years from copycat to indigenous product Innovation to know indigenous

1601
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,311
Innovation in China

1602
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,871
That is really playing out

1603
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,943
But they're alright I think they are

1604
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,503
Ways in which

1605
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,319
Companies with attack ecosystems

1606
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,855
Can be more integrated

1607
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:39,487
Eventually things that run on the cloud here should run on the cloud there and vice versa or whether it's

1608
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,071
You know sort of the B2B world or enterprise software world

1609
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,119
Logic that you don't really need

1610
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
2 salesforce's

1611
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
Dot-com

1612
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
Torrentday.com

1613
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,079
There's no real you're managing

1614
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,639
Yeah your Enterprise probably is the same

1615
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,175
From a product

1616
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
Respect cross-border

1617
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,015
Producing from a consumer standpoint

1618
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,599
Did the consumer behaviors in the language and cultures are different enough that

1619
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
You probably will see

1620
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,927
A separate ecosystem

1621
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,255
And some of the basics like mail messaging and maps

1622
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,327
Search they're already fully developed in

1623
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
So I think

1624
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,911
It's hard to say those things will revert back to them

1625
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
The two countries so

1626
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:25,311
And to me it is no longer just about politics and saying the

1627
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,103
Companies the country somewhere work with

1628
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
If that's not the case

1629
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
Marcus already developed

1630
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,943
Nicole Troy NY

1631
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,759
The only ones I can think of them more

1632
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,807
Airbnb URL

1633
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
You can see

1634
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,439
It's not as big in China

1635
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
Tiara baidu

1636
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
That's why you pay Ali Baba's partner

1637
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
Yeah

1638
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,983
And also

1639
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,263
It seems like

1640
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,799
Json

1641
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,079
Pointy made

1642
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
The earlier about

1643
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,639
This is probably Innovations in

1644
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
In China

1645
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,991
It just seems that e-commerce

1646
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
Virtual item sale

1647
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
Anything less than advertised

1648
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,879
How are you said you was are paid up his model

1649
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
Becoming such a

1650
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
Speaker in phone

1651
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
Which is not a case here

1652
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
And.

1653
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,327
Companies that know how to do that well scan user

1654
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
I want to pay for things

1655
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,399
Are better at emerging-market

1656
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,679
Cats in general

1657
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,471
Amazing General get ice developed

1658
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
You're absolutely right I

1659
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,103
You know advertising is

1660
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,943
Has you know really boost a Google and Facebook here

1661
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
In the US

1662
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,527
And probably you know obviously Western Europe

1663
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
But

1664
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,599
Advertising as a business model

1665
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,391
This is very small purse

1666
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,439
Countries including China

1667
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,231
Enchiladas

1668
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,815
So

1669
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,351
People pay for poor performance

1670
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
And also

1671
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
User pay for

1672
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
Sam's auction

1673
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Yan

1674
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,519
It's hard to imagine 10 years ago.

1675
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
Chinese music

1676
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:07,455
The growth of body intensity

1677
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
It's incredible

1678
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,039
Last question I wanted to ask his own

1679
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
Super apps

1680
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,599
So actually just last week

1681
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:17,439
WeChat launch their mini games and also made their many programs

1682
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
More powerful and

1683
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:23,327
I feel like we tried it's just becoming closer and closer to an operating so

1684
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,655
So far Chinese people it doesn't really matter if you have

1685
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
IPhone or Android

1686
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
Silver time that

1687
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,615
And with Yahoo as well that vertically integrated

1688
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
Large platforms tend to get a

1689
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,199
Attacked by more

1690
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Category Focus

1691
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Players

1692
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
Do you think

1693
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,831
Super apps like Facebook and we each had our

1694
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Sustainable

1695
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,719
It's it it's a great question I think

1696
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,743
It is

1697
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,791
The case that

1698
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
If you are

1699
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Smart

1700
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,375
You can

1701
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,423
Continue to Leverage

1702
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,239
Traffic in the eyeballs you have

1703
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
In two more more particle appliques

1704
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
And so it's

1705
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
Not surprising

1706
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,687
I think you forgot my face book has always

1707
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,735
Worried that if

1708
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
They weren't

1709
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
They have their own

1710
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
Phone or that if and only wants to

1711
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,671
Cut them out because they're not an operating system

1712
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,279
But I think if you developed enough

1713
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
Critical application

1714
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
Within

1715
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,143
The same umbrella and it's interesting to see them

1716
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:35,263
Embed some functionality of impella Facebooking on Facebook

1717
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,079
Pap and then they they split off messenger and

1718
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
If kept on Instagram

1719
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,175
WhatsApp separate so

1720
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,967
It's a multi-app strategy

1721
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
Brighten Facebook's case

1722
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,807
In WeChat I am not seeing them go

1723
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:53,951
Multi bird house all one they really going to really put it in one

1724
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:58,815
And wishing dangers that I best in the company where try to do all things to all people

1725
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
You run out of

1726
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:06,751
You are so how

1727
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,335
How companies can navigate that kind of

1728
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:15,967
Growth is really tricky from a product design standpoint from user perspective

1729
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,551
Yeah I cook the Calera gelato machine learning and AI to do that but

1730
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,087
Ultimately I think

1731
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,135
You know it it depends on whether

1732
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
They are

1733
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,719
Getting more back from creating these particles rather than

1734
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
Sprite if you hear

1735
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,535
Creating a vertical and then you

1736
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
Getting less traffic back then

1737
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,351
Something's wrong so

1738
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:38,751
I I know the WeChat team little bit I think they're really really really smart but but I things are your gift

1739
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,567
Well taken in that that could be one of their challenges is

1740
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,615
They have to continue to

1741
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,407
Messaging while the continuum

1742
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
Be able to do a lot of these

1743
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,991
Poli payments well but

1744
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,039
Do they get into every little thing there is

1745
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,391
And and that means there's going to be room for others to

1746
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,719
Either partner will come up with their own

1747
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Hotel East

1748
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
Very interesting.

1749
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
Case study right I mean

1750
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:09,215
There should be no reason Telltale beer if you have to have been existed at all and then for them

1751
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,775
Is really an opportunity that

1752
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
That that Esau

1753
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,871
When we were coming over question

1754
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
Interview

1755
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:20,223
Did you swipe question was something that fascinated us

1756
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,063
Guess I you uke argue that Yahoo is for some reason

1757
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
What did everything

1758
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,111
You did more work than

1759
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Google ever did in the

1760
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,951
Early days the internet that was so needed

1761
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,023
And then that you have a Facebook and and WeChat

1762
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
Dot.

1763
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
Doesn't need to do everything themselves anymore

1764
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,399
APA format other app

1765
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
Plugged into it

1766
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,727
Is there any enough other ass around

1767
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
1020 years later

1768
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,847
And so if you look at the model and you look at

1769
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,407
What someone total has done

1770
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
Is take

1771
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,479
An app that

1772
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,015
News aggregation.

1773
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,063
Reporter has something like that

1774
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,343
As somehow

1775
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,391
Madoff popular enough and

1776
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,415
Frequently using

1777
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,231
Power another assortment of

1778
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,511
Michonne from video app

1779
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
So

1780
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,863
It is going to be interesting

1781
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
How hot are you

1782
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,983
What are the other ways to spell something.

1783
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,079
Somehow deep voice not going to notice in front of them

1784
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Is something there

1785
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
Kind of familiar with

1786
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
But

1787
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:26,271
If you don't know how to do that

1788
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,879
Then you could be argument be a part of the big company but if you can get that right

1789
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
Yeah you can always win

1790
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,815
Pick your battles but also I think there is an underlying user need or demand that they

1791
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
Fulfilled

1792
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,119
And I think that's

1793
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,959
Cuz you know you're absolutely right hands in describing what

1794
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
Somebody needs to create but this sounds like

1795
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:51,359
I'm missing parts on Haystack in Mission Impossible but

1796
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:54,687
But for those people who end up doing it they listen to the customer

1797
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,711
And they

1798
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
Learn from their customers

1799
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:01,343
And it still happens every day and that's why it's so fun to do what we're doing

1800
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,183
But we might last question is around Apple

1801
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,231
In in China

1802
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,047
When Apple first went to China

1803
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Whistle

1804
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,583
IPhone

1805
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,631
That the government doesn't know what it is

1806
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
Interesting

1807
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,935
Got another phone

1808
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,215
Thumbs up

1809
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,007
All Commodities no problem

1810
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,823
After 10 plus years

1811
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,151
It is no longer just a phone is a computer it has a

1812
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,431
Lotto since the beta

1813
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,223
That any government would

1814
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,503
What I want to know more about

1815
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,039
What what

1816
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,831
If you have to make a prediction

1817
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,159
What does Apple need to do over next 10 years

1818
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,695
Continue to do what they do

1819
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,023
Wow is almost an anomaly

1820
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,303
Compared to Yahoo

1821
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,095
Compared to Facebook

1822
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:49,983
Apus always been cited as the most successful American company in China

1823
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:53,055
Today and that nobody talks about it and

1824
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,103
I think part of it is

1825
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,127
That they have

1826
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
I understand

1827
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,223
Don't know them very well but I understand

1828
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,247
Tim Cook personally

1829
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,551
Before UCLA

1830
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
NetSpend

1831
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:11,743
It goes back to sort of what we talked about building a relationship understanding the culture

1832
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,303
Really finding the value add for

1833
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,399
The country of China and make that value proposition

1834
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:22,239
Unique enough that

1835
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:26,847
But it's not I don't think it's a one way street I think there is some checking balances in China wear

1836
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,871
You can't just

1837
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
Arbitrarily decide Apple goes out

1838
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,455
Can you imagine the Uproar so

1839
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:35,551
So there is there is a process and an apple has spent a lot time investing

1840
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,599
Not just money but also

1841
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,927
Lot of relationships in the lotto

1842
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,511
Valleyride bus manufacturing and otherwise

1843
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Look at me

1844
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,815
I think the next 10 years

1845
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
Is

1846
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,119
It's going to be very different

1847
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
Especially given

1848
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,703
Given that that

1849
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,263
Now this is like you said it's not just a handset is

1850
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,799
It's more of a software company

1851
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,335
How do you spell retainer companies in

1852
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
Never before

1853
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,175
And as China

1854
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:05,759
Works through their own thinking about cloud and

1855
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,527
How

1856
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Cloudworks

1857
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
In China

1858
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:13,695
And I would argue that's an area where they're still fairly early and thinking through hell

1859
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,743
Data regulations regimes

1860
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,535
Yes I would Apple I would

1861
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:22,655
Spend the time to think through how they can be added to that process like they've done and so

1862
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,727
So is there smart and do the right thing say they will

1863
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,287
Continue to be viewed as a valued

1864
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,823
Player in China

1865
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
And if they

1866
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,431
Arbutus Athen they will have problems just like everybody else

1867
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Heading

1868
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,735
Their role in the whole world

1869
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
Did the Uber thing

1870
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
Is not as publicized

1871
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,367
Dakota messenger Uber in devising DD

1872
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,927
And I made a huge difference in outcome

1873
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,975
And also

1874
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,023
UC temp spend a lot of time

1875
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,815
Visiting Chinese startup

1876
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:54,399
I've started develop locally in China

1877
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:58,495
And doing well on Apple a store in the US and in China

1878
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,055
But many of them have ambition to grow Beyond Time

1879
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
And to extend the Apple

1880
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,871
What could be a facilitator

1881
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
Of attendance

1882
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
What system

1883
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,711
Exporting the outside of China

1884
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,759
It kind of fits what the oppressor

1885
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
She is trying to do

1886
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Extending China soft power beyond China

1887
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,623
And it so

1888
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
You can talk to him

1889
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
Working very hard

1890
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:22,559
Mice out of your house many others but it certainly looks

1891
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,095
Like they

1892
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
They

1893
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,703
They have a plan that is executed you know for well over decade

1894
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,287
Right so far last part of the

1895
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,079
Podcast we have a

1896
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
Quick fire questions

1897
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
Okay

1898
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Who is an entrepreneur that you admire the most

1899
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
And why

1900
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
Besides

1901
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,783
Yuan besides Jack who else

1902
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:48,415
Well I think we talked about I mean the ones that I'm really impressed by in China is Chun-Li

1903
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:54,815
Engine jingle accommodation is a DD is really unreliable and

1904
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,607
In some way to me is

1905
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,631
One of the most

1906
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,447
Yessir TJ but

1907
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
A bike rounded entrepreneurs

1908
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,031
I've met and so

1909
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,079
It's not it's not a

1910
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
Surprised that he's

1911
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,383
Where he's at today

1912
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,431
And by the way I think he is

1913
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,503
12 by 12 by

1914
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:18,111
7 is never a time that he's not working and

1915
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,135
It's incredible

1916
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
I might sure of

1917
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
Fortunate working with

1918
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
I think somebody is probably the

1919
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
Fastest

1920
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,839
Growing

1921
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
Executive order Last 5 Years

1922
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,935
From where you was before you where is now

1923
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,727
Is the biggest lie by

1924
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
I've ever seen

1925
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,799
I just absolutely is.

1926
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,335
End

1927
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:43,199
A lot of people say that he doesn't speak English but I think he is

1928
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:48,575
I he must understand at all because you show intuitively strategic it's incredible so

1929
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
Yeah

1930
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,927
What's the best and worst

1931
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
Decision you've ever

1932
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
Resizing

1933
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:00,607
OC keep saying that

1934
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:07,007
Obviously investing Alibaba was turned out to be the best decision but you know

1935
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
Probably times he will say that was the worst

1936
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,591
Decision

1937
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:16,991
But I will say that it's always

1938
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:21,087
Your toughest decisions are the ones that people will say it's your pastor worse than

1939
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,391
Only time will tell

1940
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
Which one is which

1941
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,743
What motivates you to wake up

1942
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,767
Each one of these days

1943
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,583
What's tell keep you up at night

1944
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
NYSEG

1945
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:40,799
Doing a podcast with Hans

1946
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,127
What you look like I feel like

1947
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:47,455
Is that the energy that I see from a lot of entrepreneurs

1948
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527
Where a lot of them are moonshot ideas

1949
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,623
You know it that's the business I'm into turn invested in things I might change the world

1950
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,927
Maybe it's one-in-a-billion chance but

1951
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
And and that kiss me up in the

1952
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:02,303
Turn O2 to know who I'm going to see you and hear their ideas

1953
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:07,167
A lot of it is also getting helping them navigate through building the company but I think

1954
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,447
There

1955
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,495
Passion and energy is

1956
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
This is

1957
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,055
He's really inspiring and kind of feets

1958
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,104
So we said earlier it keeps us Young

1959

1960

Xiamen for friend of

1961
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:21,248
What's possible that I think as human beings that's really

1962
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,320
That's really your very life yeah

1963
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,856
End and yes I think

1964
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,184
Making returns is is part of the score carding

1965
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
But in my case I feel like

1966
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,256
Benefiting from

01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,280

1968
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
It's been a real toy

1969
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:39,936
Now when they run into trouble that's what that's that's what keeps me up at night so

1970
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,752
That comes with the territory
