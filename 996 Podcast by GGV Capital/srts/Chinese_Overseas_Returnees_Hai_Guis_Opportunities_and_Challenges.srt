There has been an increasing number of sea turtles in recent years

63
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
As China's Tech

Mabel and check this out if you haven't

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,768
So sea turtles face both opportunities and challenges when they come back

86
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
To try to

87
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,888
And indeed there more internationally minded than Chinese people who have never lived abroad

88
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,496
They speak better English and they can bring back practices from other parts of the world socialist

89
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Silicon Valley

90
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
They also faced many challenges

91
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,688
Chief among those is a problem called put UTC or not connected to the energy of the land

92
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
So has what is your definition of

93
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
Yeah he practice was speaking in China is operates quite differently

94
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
From Westworld

95
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,952
So if you are being away from China for 5-10 years

96
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Go back and understand how Grassroots

97
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
People are how things get done

98
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,864
That's beyond what's in the official guidebook

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,936
That you quite someone who understand what's going on on the line

What was you have spent so many years abroad when you come back you naturally just

107
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,000
Like have English words pop up when you're speaking Chinese and that might raise the impression that

108
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
You're just

109
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303

00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119

Just

113
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
It's just naturally

114
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
The way you're thinking or speaking

115
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
So

116
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
How do you sing

117
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615

118
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431

122
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
You and I both went through that.

123
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Move back to China

124
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
In 2005

125
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
2006

126
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
And back then

127
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
I had lived in

128
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
No person I was born in Taiwan

129
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
I grew up in La winter

00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
What's American citizen when I move to China

132
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Did China is not a

133
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Play symbols for Marowak

134
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
It is very easy to use

135
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
English words

136
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799

139
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
In

140
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
Very easy

141
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Juicy Lucy.

142
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,759
In order to become more Chinese I need to do more

143
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Which means including tie

144
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Trains to tear

145
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
34 City

146
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
You eat all kinds of funny food

147
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,071
Some people remember idioms and old Chinese saying sweet Chinese history books

148
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
To be able to recall lessons

149
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Dance from the past

150
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
To show that you understand how this line works

151
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,287
Are you know that I tried is about to country with many differences across regions

152
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
The more you appreciate China is

153
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
A collection of many different cities and regions

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
And know the difference is the more people respect you

155
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
For understanding how to operate in this alarm

156
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Yeah I think that's a really good

157
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
Piece of advice because a lot of

158
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Highways

159
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
They don't realize how much they have missed out on by not being a

160
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
China

161
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
For a number of years

162
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,655
Because China develop so fast and has such a vast

163
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Amount

164
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
History

165
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
So

166
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
The people who stay here

167
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
Actually absorb a lot just by being here though

168
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
You're missing out on

169
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
Play if you're just by virtue of not being

170
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
It is really easy to

171
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,575
Go to China with the attitude that your Superior you'll see how the West work

172
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,391
You know what's best practice from Silicon Valley

173
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Where New York

174
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
And it seem like you're better

175
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
But in China since the growth is growing so fast

176
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
So much has changed

177
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
The group your

178
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
Your ability to adjust to that

179
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
And in Ingo

180
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,775
Is it very difficult for someone

181
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
Pool has been even longer

182
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
To be able to keep up

183
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
And the differences are so obvious

184
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
People have been around in China

185
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
That is very hard to win the respect

186
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,647
Can people when you're not sitting in your not understanding

187
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Call appreciate

188
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
How amazing this girl has been

189
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,351
So what are some common pitfalls that you have seen Highway entrepreneurs right in two

190
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Besides this Cube race

191
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
I think you better look at our portfolio companies

192
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Either as founders

193
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Or as

194
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Managers

195
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
People usually think that

196
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
The shortest distance between two points

197
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Is a straight line

198
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Butt emoji

199
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Buy infant

200
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Department sort

201
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
Different business partners to get something

202
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,159
You got to figure out what everyone's

203
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Imagen de is in

204
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
Find a common ground to make that work

205
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Sometimes they could be

206
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
Conflicting goals they had a

207
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Figure out a way to

208
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
Figure out how to move everyone lawn

209
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
Inability to

210
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Treat people nice

211
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Build a relationship without trust

212
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
People who talk about business

213
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
This is not yours

214
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
Jackson butt

215
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
You people

216
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Need to do you a favor so you

217
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
You do the math papers make a do a favorite back later

218
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
All died

219
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Takes work

220
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,391
Bentonite doesn't happen in the business center or in the office

221
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
So not respect

222
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
China is no different than any other place you have been helping me.

223
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
At same time

224
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Channels movies much faster

225
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
That's having somebody in New York

226
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
Most people don't realize

227
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Chinese companies

228
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
10 years ago were small and

229
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
White midi 120th of a size

230
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
These days

231
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
Chinese companies are

232
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Similar in size

233
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Aetna

234
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,759
2% of us counterparts and China is the largest

235
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
Internet calling me the world with more consumers anywhere else

236
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,671
So the speed of change the Hobbies companies grow look at bytedance

237
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Example

238
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
The work schedule is 5 days a week plus

239
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Wednesday

240
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
A weekend

241
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Two week at the month

242
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
It is normal

243
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
In this work schedule is

244
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
99

245
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
Something 9 to 12

246
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
So

247
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
The pace of change

248
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
The pace of growth

249
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
How fast

250
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
People get irate

251
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
It's much quicker

252
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
In in Somalia in the New York

253
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
We talked about prophecies

254
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
Before something gets done then let's go planning

255
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
In China is just

256
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
Getting it done just do it first and then

257
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Give the problem you fix a uterus move on

258
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,511
So you get more stuff done in short. Time even though the

259
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Buffer

260
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Not as smooth not-so-nice

261
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
Better results Yashica more stop talking more efficient

262
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
Productivity

263
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,055
You see you if you're willing to spend more time in and not talked about as much angira fast

264
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
Difference in style becomes very evident

265
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Within the first week of anybody who come by

266
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Do I think I'm in jail

267
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
In terms of the decision making process

268
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Is a lot of

269
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
My friends in the valley or in the US

270
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Ask me or should I

271
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,975
Stay at Google or Facebook or Uber or should I go back to

272
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
China and if I go back

273
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
It's the right time

274
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
In terms of his decision-making what do you think should be the

275
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Top consideration

276
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
When these potential

277
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Sea turtles are considering

278
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
I think it gets harder and harder to come back

279
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Before you go to ready

280
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
A lot of

281
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
Mainland Chinese students want to go to the US

282
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
Work for a few years getting some experience

283
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,831
But it's not a easy in the US to get a lot of experience

284
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
English or creative thought

285
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
So because

286
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,023
No Chinese companies like Alibaba in a 10-second teaches worth somewhere between 350 billion dollar market

287
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
Comparable to Econo Parts in the US

288
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Adidas

289
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,727
It's going to be hard to hard to have a superior position in the Chinese company if you haven't learned a child

290
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
In the US

291
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
And you actually write faster in Chinese company number four

292
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:26,175
So I will actually argue that it's important for tencent

293
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
Come back to China

294
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Quickly as possible

295
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,343
How to do the work in u.s. for 2-3 years and not worry about what they're missing out

296
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,463
Just come back and acclimate themselves into the scene and climb

297
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Trying to

298
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
Become somebody was more senior in the US then come back later

299
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
It's not that easy

300
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
You can make it work

301
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
But the odds of success as she gets smaller

302
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
The more time you spend in USA my pen

303
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
Because Dad didn't listen to some estate available

304
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Chinese Innovation Chinese

305
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Hillbilly hot tub

306
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
Now in the most cutting-edge things

307
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
The most interesting

308
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,575
Aspects of a semiconductor technology or AI or machine learning

309
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
If you are really smart in the US you have achieved

310
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
I love us

311
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,767
Success in the short fighting someone very cutting-edge stuff

312
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Your exception to the rule

313
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
You can

314
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
Go back to China and I'll come up with something and expect

315
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Carpe

316
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Pick a position

317
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
But if you don't

318
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Stay on top of it

319
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,775
Within 2-3 years utility will gota

320
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
What do you think

321
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
I think there's also the danger of just settling in

322
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
So like

323
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
A lot of

324
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
People in the valley or in the US

325
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Alfred

326
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
Stay there for

327
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
Three to four years they start to think about things like green cards buying

328
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
House

329
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
Having a family in the US

330
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
What do is just becomes harder and harder

331
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
To move around and consider moving to China

332
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
So I guess

333
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
In the twenties people are the most mobile

334
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
In general

335
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,543
And Beijing or China is just such a dynamic

336
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
Play the requires a lot of energy

337
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
So

338
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
I also recommend like friends around me to

339
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Go to China when they're young

340
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
You recently moved back to China

341
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,063
How do you spend four years of Harbor

342
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Prior to 3 years in Singapore

343
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
And then what used to be the first year in

344
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
What's it like for you

345
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Comparing

346
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
The difference between Silicon Valley in Beijing

347
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
The biggest difference is

348
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
It's just everything multi

349
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
Surplice decide the amount of

350
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
People you need to meet

351
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
Information you need to absorb

352
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
The deals you're processing

353
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Just the sheer amount of

354
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,967
Stuff that you need to deal with just increases by a lot when you're in Beijing because China is the world

355
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Largest consumer internet

356
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Beijing

357
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
It's like one of the most populous

358
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Studies

359
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,951
So it is very energetic and dynamic and exciting

360
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,791
And I also really like this get things done attitude in China

361
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,863
And this focus on execution above everything else

362
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,191
Because if you don't execute faster your competitors will

363
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
And forever a new vertical that pops up

364
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,567
It's like several hundred companies competing for market share

365
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
The competition is just so brutal

366
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
And I feel like one under-appreciated aspect is that there are a lot of opportunities for highways interested in emerging

367
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Markets outside of us in China

368
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
So in the past it was more bridging us and China

369
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:20,511
Bridging China and Emerging Markets because all of these markets

370
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Are looking to China for

371
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Business models and lesson

372
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
I see the difference between secretary and us

373
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Typically it

374
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
Is a difference of

375
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
22

376
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,823
But for every meeting you have metal Parts in China get usually have double

377
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
The number of meetings

378
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
This is more people to meet more people wanted me

379
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Then you talk to the point that

380
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
More more Founders are coming to China

381
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
To learn

382
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
We actually notice I asked

383
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
Early as 2011-2012

384
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
There were a lot of Founders from India the king

385
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,279
These are among the very best in the Bahamas

386
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
The bear bear species India

387
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
Since then

388
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
In 2013-14

389
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
We see a lot of Founders Inn

390
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
NBC from Southeast Asia

391
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,847
And then fast forward to 2016-2017

392
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
Which are seen Founders NBC's from Latin America

393
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Supposed to be Brazil Colombia to Mexico

394
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Come to China

395
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,575
And it's very interesting to see

396
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,671
Other Emerging Markets of sizable domestic markets

397
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Where's the Bryson Middle Class

398
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Lots of organization

399
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,607
Growing economy or Mercury in transition with volatility

400
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
Come to China to learn more how Chinese companies

401
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Have deal with those issues

402
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
CC shoes and solve something to societal problems

403
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Over the last

404
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
And it just being increasingly is China as a place

405
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,271
To some degree Hangzhou City so you just have to go and visit

406
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,831
In order to see how Baidu Audi

407
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Tencent

408
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
A WeChat

409
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
King Ghidorah xiaomi jadi mate wanted

410
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
All these companies

411
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Operate

412
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
And it's just fascinating

413
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
Start seeing more more Chinese companies

414
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,679
Many of them I mentioned earlier to expand your business

415
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
Xian China what is the Russian city Investments

416
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
JB's order of operations

417
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,383
And so we are seeing more startups from China

418
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
Not having a fresh market be awesome China

419
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
Diverting their expense in China to build

420
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
A lot of apps

421
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Indian market

422
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
So it has become

423
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
There's increasingly more needed for Highway to play Roll

424
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,559
So I think the sooner had Way come back to China when they're younger when they don't have that kind of Burden the family in the more they can do

425
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Do I make him back

426
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,935
I also felt that the premium of being a highway in China

427
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Has someone

428
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Decrease / 2

429
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Past few years one because

430
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
There's so many of us

431
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
They asked the number of Chinese

432
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
Students will study abroad increases

433
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
Also naturally increases and

434
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
Because the immigration policies in the US

435
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
Have become less friendly to

436
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
Foreign Talent

437
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Alarm were coming back

438
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
Today and also because a lot of

439
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,583
It used to be that all at least you graduated from one of the top US schools are you

440
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
You have worked at Google Facebook Airbnb you're considered

441
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Automatically

442
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
Superior to

443
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
Your Chinese equivalent but that's no longer there

444
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
The case because you're actually missing out

445
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
On a lot of

446
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
The local Tampa

447
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
How things get done in China in

448
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Don't actually understand the Chinese

449
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Consumer Market

450
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,855
So do you agree that the premium of

451
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Being a highway

452
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Decrease 10

453
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
How

454
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
We can ask

455
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Leverage our International

456
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Experience

457
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
In that context

458
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Yeah that's a great question

459
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
If I look at the numbers

460
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Talking to.

461
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Sex

462
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,471
The number of Chinese immigrants in the US

463
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
Was only 10000

464
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
That's not including the garage

465
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Just Underground

466
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Just lost mother

467
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
10 years later in 2016

468
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
No number when out by 14x

469
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
240 mm

470
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,367
Factor the size of the quietest room

471
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
To the group

472
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
Back in 2016 there were roughly 300

473
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
50

474
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Thousand

475
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Chinese students in the US

476
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Roughly one-third

477
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
More than one-third of all forms

478
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
So you hire have that kind of

479
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Pool of

480
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Students to

481
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
That was going to work for us

482
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
In the US and Emerson

483
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
To come back to China

484
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
Pacific Tile and pool of a hike weights

485
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
But

486
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Cedar Point

487
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Has the premium being Highway going down

488
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Yes

489
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
Because like I mentioned earlier

490
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
The Chinese way of doing things is do a first

491
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Do you adjust later

492
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Planning is important

493
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
But not its importance getting stuff

494
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,303
Done visiting a grown conomy

495
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
The market is expanding

496
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Does it matter how you plan

497
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,239
You will know more about the result of Your Action

498
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
If you do it first and then adjustment

499
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
You can come more productive

500
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Da Wei

501
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Mus

502
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
Is market more saturated

503
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
That everything you do could be quite destructive to

504
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Vested interest

505
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,855
You have to plan and think harder about what you're doing

506
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
In order to get some things done

507
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,463
Is the market is not growing as a

508
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
As a whole but China's different

509
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
There's so many things

510
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Does Brooklyn

511
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
Some of things offline without working

512
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
You are better off trying things

513
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Prior hypothesis

514
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
The store now

515
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
And give feedback normal to move

516
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Ford and adjust

517
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,591
And that way of doing is what people China used to

518
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
From schools

519
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
From

520
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
Working in Workforce for the fur

521
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
First few years after college

522
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
If you don't have that kind of

523
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Pace

524
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Clock speed

525
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
An approach ingrained in you

526
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
You going to stick out as a

527
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
Sore thumb very very quickly as a haiku

528
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
And so

529
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:45,887
How do you navigate and get stuff done so we can live with your friends or your contacts

530
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Your Professional Network

531
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Yolanda Bass

532
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Quickly get these things done

533
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Python

534
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,591
It becomes very obvious in the first week to their job

535
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
That the hike we will operate a much slower

536
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
Much less efficiently

537
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,015
Then their counterparts who have been China whole time and didn't leave

538
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
So if you go out for a professional degree Stanford or Berkeley

539
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Aldi's close

540
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:13,279
Sooner and come back the better and when you come back how can you leverage while using outside

541
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,119
Helping Chinese companies expand overseas

542
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,423
Dealing with foreign business partners

543
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
These are

544
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,543
Easley area so that when you can speak better English to understand the culture

545
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
Are you going to about it

546
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,223
For most of the schools that Chinese many students go to in the US or else Warehouse in China

547
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
Your many

548
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Students from other country

549
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
How many merchants

550
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Want to learn more about China

551
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
So while you're outside as a highway

552
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
You should

Namoura help you to work with them once you go back to China

559
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
Just the first thing that people should do

560
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
The second thing is

561
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Can I unplug will be more Frank on this

562
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,247
It is not easy is not natural

563
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
To figure out

564
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295

00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
You want to buy Ironman

568
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Figure out a way to

569
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
Build a team and work well with a team

570
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,095
So that as a team yeah she can get more stuff done then

571
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
The collection of individuals

572
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,775
Is something that you get to learn when you assume that Stanford or Berkeley you are Harbor or or other than delete this

573
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
Many of the property states are done in teams

574
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
And there's many

575
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,711
Extracurricular activities and sports and other things that you can do that working

576
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,063
The more you learn how to work in teams the more you know how to become a leader in things

577
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,391
The more you can effectively can be when you come back to China

578
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
As a highway

579
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
Those are the two things that's a more General

580
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Specifically

581
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Before you go out

582
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
Figure out like what China needs help on

583
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,447
What is machine learning with AI or semiconductor whatever

584
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Areas

585
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
If you happen to have a

586
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Interest in.

587
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
We are

588
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
Outside of China

589
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
Learn more about the best practices

590
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
So I can come back in a play some Professional Knowledge

591
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
That people in China just don't have a haven't had exposed

592
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,319
Those are the three ways I can think about hybrid about it while they're out

593
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
And be able to do more when they come

594
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
Yes

595
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Stafflinq

596
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,744
So when it comes to younger Highway Founders that have become

597
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Successful searches

598
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
Calendar of shabu-shabu and 100 and others

599
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,656
What do you think they did right

600
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,240
I think first of all all these are just very smart

601
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Individual

602
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
I did learn extremely quickly

603
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
So if they learn

604
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
Multiple disciplinary field

605
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
Text Keisha and

606
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Technology

607
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760

Sociology

609
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
And just more they see

610
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,928
It helps him to come up with ideas and approaches

611
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
Is that a lot of people

612
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
If I take

613
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Michelle

614
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Example

615
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
When you first went to

616
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
She'll die in Shanghai for college

617
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Not the first time he ever took an airplane

618
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Okay on the airplane ride

619
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
And that's when he was 18

620
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,544
Fast forward 10 years later it has been to a hundred different countries

621
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
Torres transformation

622
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
As someone whose

623
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
To be at

624
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
Who came from the ground

625
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
When he was 18

626
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
To someone who becomes a hike way 10 years later

627

Epitomizes

631
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Let's kind of transformation

632
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
And globalization

633
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
How many Chinese

634
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Consumers

What his consumers

640
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Are going through

641
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
And be able to relate

642
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
Him give him things.

643
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Aspire them to

644
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Want more

645
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,712
With the loading shown with a monkey

646
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
She's a Google training

647
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Help them to

648
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Figure out how to take

649
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,368
Using algorithm

650
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Etymology

651
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
Solvay traditional epic

652
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
Kishin prob

653
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
And I said multiple

654
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Disciplinary in nature

655
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,352
And when he started Alicia it wasn't obvious.

656
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,656
Leveraging algorithm alone can solve

657
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
The common problem of needles

658
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
Devaluing better English

659
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Accent

660
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
And know what to say

661
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
In interviews and it need a lot of

662
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Life cycle

663
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,712
Why does wasn't as successful with his today so you wasn't obvious that bass

664
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
Improvements and changes

665
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Consumers

666
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
But he he was

667
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,368
As early as don't you mean by that

668
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
To take an approach

669
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,696
Reply to a real problem how to take

670
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Trenton hundreds of millions of Chinese

671
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
Consumers in English

672
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,912
It is very interesting, both of them coming from different backgrounds

673
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,984
Leverage your life experiences human way

674
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,824
DYFS it's the wave of the next wave of where Chinatown

675
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
So in terms of

676
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Founding startups

677
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
What are some areas

678
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Where are you staying

679
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Highways

680
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
Have an advantage

681
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Over

682
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,624
Non highways when it comes to either starting companies or working at

683
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Like which

684
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,720
Tracks or vertical should they consider

685
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
I seen the most obvious when these days

686
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Is too hot

687
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Chinese companies Go Global

688
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
How to say

689
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
The

690
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,496
Population dividend mobile internet user dividend

691
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
From China

692
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Decreased is already

693
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
800 million

694
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,432
Smartphone users in China Auto population of 1.4 billion

695
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,040
You sure do you know there are a hundred million more people could go online but

696
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
The book of it has

697
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
And the growth has

698
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Slow down

699
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,416
And a lot more apps

700
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Tt4u with your time

701
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
As well

702
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
So you can still build an interesting consumer companies or apps

703
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
In China but a 10 sub.

704
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
How come down

705
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,472
Yet China has been through over the last 18 years and throw the history of tgv

706
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
Yeah come through for five different generations of

707
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Startups already

708
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
Docker knowledge

709
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
Acumulador for five generations

710
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,712
Are incredibly useful in other places such as India

711
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,552
. I only start to experience 40 in the last 2 years

712
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
This is why you will look at it leaderboard

713
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
Up top apps in India

714
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
The more than

715
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,720
50%

716
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
Come from

717
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
China at least as of now

718
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,144
That may not be sustainable. Percentage will definitely go down as an Indian founders

719
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,984
Get a better and smarter and more experienced and then extremely pokeweed which

720
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,544
So for the time being

721
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Highway cam

722
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Definitely

723
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,176
More value in companies from China That's expanding overseas

724
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
Many Chinese Founders have not lived in India have lived

725
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
Not to be Southeast Asia

726
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,648
So if you have a high-quality who's more familiar with this weekend

727
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,232
How do you make friends while there were studying a friends released

728
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
These two regions

729
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
We can definitely

730
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Taobao

731
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Ami.

732
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,144
Encourages all

733
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Chinese students or Professionals in the US to actually stay in

734
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
In touch with what's going on

735
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
In China

736
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,896
There are a lot of resources these days and we have the benefit of

737
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,504
Being able to access not just the English resources but also the Chinese resources

738
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
So actually

739
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:04,416
Spend a lot of time just reading Tech news in Chinese writing Chinese business books history books

740
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,488
Understanding contemporary China and also

741
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
The past

742
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Because

743
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
Being from Chinese really an advantage

744
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Today is

745
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,168
It's quite lucky to be able to speak

746
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
One of the world

747
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Hardest languages

748
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
And have the culture Affinity to the world's most populous

749
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
Nation and also the largest

750
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Internet economy

751
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,456
So I think there are a lot of opportunities that come with

752
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
Having this background

753
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
And we should really make the most out of it

754
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
By doing something

755
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,880
That's at least really related to China

756
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,952
Are you don't have to be in China but I think even

757
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
If

758
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
We stay in the US

759
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
They're just a lot of opportunities to work on China related

760
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
I can see

761
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,912
Type in their 20s

762
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
Move to Singapore in

763
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
Towards a car. Spend time in Southeast Asia

764
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
Or move to

765
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Bangalore

766
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Mumbai

767
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,688
Or even go to Latin America like some Paulo

768
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
Mexico City

769
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
Because the

770
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Knowledge

771
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
The one cats

772
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
From

773
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,160
Different all these different WeChat official accounts

774
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
From

775
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
All the different Chinese apps out there

776
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
About what's happening in China RN

777
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Bible useful

778
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
2

779
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
Founders in this Emerging Markets

780
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
So the more

781
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,240
Cupquake and play the role of bridge

782
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
Between China and Russia world the more value

783
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
They can generate

784
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Guess they can watch

785
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Yes

786
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
So make friends from Salvador make friends from

787
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Brazil

788
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
India I think

789
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Definitely

790
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
Any one of the best

791
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Assets of

792
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Going to a

793
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,208
Us college with a lot of diversity is

794
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
You got to make friends

795
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
What people would that you wouldn't

796
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Have met otherwise

797
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
And that's really a huge asset

798
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,680
Like 10 years down the road Maybe not immediately but

799
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
In the far future

800
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
Maybe you do business with someone

801
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Imagine School

802
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Who knows

803
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
I know I was young once

804
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
I'm much older today

805
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
But I was young once

806
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
And very easy to have

807
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
How to start a compare with your college buddies

808
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
You see how successful

809
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
World

810
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
Who got what promotion who got a

811
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,952
Salary increase in Sulphur

812
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
It's very easy to keep a score

813
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Cuz that's what people used to doing

814
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
And everybody is a high-achieving students

815
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,608
In the well in the

816
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Exams

817
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Dwell

818
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
In

819
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Successful applications

820
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
But one has to think of playing a long game

821
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,336
I even look at my own career the first 10 years

822
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
Was a lot of

823
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Things

824
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
Dad had a lot of rural movements

825
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
But not a lot of vertical

826
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Jumps

827
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
The next 10 years

828
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Hi

829
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
Did so much more

830
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,416
Because of the preparation for the first 10 years

831
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
And it's very difficult find about that

832
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
To take a 10 or 20 year review of the

833
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Taqueria

834
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
I know that

835
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
China's growth

836
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,376
It was one of my Munster

837
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,936
Take the story in the last 20 years

838
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,544
We have found them people knowing from Countryside into cities

839
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
That does not like kind of growth

840
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Trying to happen

841
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
Anywhere else

842
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Yet

843
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
We all

844
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Sync

845
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
Igtv definitely know that china's model is

846
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,088
Very exportable to other places

847
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
You will be localized he will be changed

848
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
You be innovative

849
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,512
But the face that foundation on what about the last 20 years

850
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:25,888
Are incredibly valuable to Founders who want to make a difference in their own emerging-market over the next 10-20 years

851
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
If the highways are patient

852
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
And willing to

853
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
Engage Reach Out

854
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Learn

855
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Cher

856
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
We want to play better

857
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
As a as a winning team

858
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
You're just so much that can be done

859
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
Between China and emerging markets around the world

860
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
So I highly encourage everyone to beat

861
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Take a more long-term View

862
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
To their career in their life

863
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,256
So in terms of where highways can add value I generally see to Pat's

864
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,304
One is to help Chinese companies

865
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,144
Go Global and the others to help global companies enter China

866
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,472
I think recently I didn't really get the sense that

867
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:07,872
Helping Chinese companies Go Global is a lot practical passport

868
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Being successful

869
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
What way do you think

870
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
I think it's

871
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Difficult

872
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
For someone

873
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
718 San Francisco or London Broil in New York

874
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
To understand what's happening China

875
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
So helping

876
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
International Company

877
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
Expanding China

878
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
It's not easy

879
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,048
Is very hard to understand China when you're nice

880
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
In China

881
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,608
So if I look at it

882
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Our experience working with Airbnb

883
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
We have

884
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Being pressed

885
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,984
What how much support

886
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,800
Leadership Airbnb in San Francisco willing to provide

887
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,592
And what a great job

888
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
The Army maternity

889
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
Blood by tile

890
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
I've done over last

891
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,968
Just under one year

892
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,248
I was with

893
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Competition that

894
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Earlier

895
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
But it has not been an easy

896
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
Yet in Alaska

897
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
Step 3 years

898
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
You see that

899
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
A material portion of

900
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
Top apps India come from China

901
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,096
So the ability of Chinese companies

902
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
Synapse make a difference oversea Market

903
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
In the short-term

904
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Is much greater

905
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,776
So if our hike way I will spend time

906
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,104
You don't have way in the twenties I would spend time helping tennis conmigo broth

907
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,712
UTV action of a lot of resources in programming

908
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,760
For highways or Chinese students

909
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
And professionals who are living overseas

910
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,392
Two recently will organize a program called gdb fellows

911
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,464
Which is designed for sea turtles to get re-acclimated

912
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Two Chinese startup ecosystem in business environment

913
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
So during a program we have 34 global-minded young leaders

914
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,192
Who came to Beijing and completed a one-week intensive training

915
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,240
Antagonize partnership in China

916
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,848
So R34 fellows were carefully selected from over 400

917
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Qualified app

918
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
And they come from

919
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
Top institutions from

920
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Around the world

921
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,016
The most well-represented schools were

922
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
Harvard Stanford MIT

923
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Itea Berkeley

924
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,416
And many of them are working at Sycamore Valley Tech companies such as Google Facebook

925
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
Uber and Apple

926
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:03,072
And all of them are native speakers of Chinese or equivalent and are fascinated by the rise of

927
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
So Chinese internet

928
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Sector over the past decade

929
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,728
So during a program we brought the fellows to visit the

930
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
Headquarters of 8

931
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,080
Chinese unicorn internet companies and also heard from

932
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
21 Founders or executives

933
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,200
Who shared lessons on what it's like to start and run company

934
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
Our speakers came from some of the

935
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
Most valuable internet companies in China including

936
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
Bytedance

937
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,136
BD xiaomi

938
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,024
Joshua choir show faceplusplus we are bound keep hello chuxing and others

939
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,328
That many of them at Stevie purple wheels

940
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
Entering these closed-door sessions.

941
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
Speakers shirt not just tip

942
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
Tips for success but also

943
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Candid stories of failures

944
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,312
Some pitfalls that they ran into on their startup Journey

945
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,944
So the program is kind of like a lightweight NBA on all things related to China's Tech equals

946
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
So hot

947
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,296

948
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576

Opposed to fellows and what

950
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
They took away from

951
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
Yeah I think when you laugh

952
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
First talked about this idea

953
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
We have seen

954
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Fellowship work

955
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
That's them for the oldest

956
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Bcfellowship

957
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656

As well

970
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,672
I think when you and I talked about this we increasingly realize that

971
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
They're just so many

972
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
