00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Makes sense

395
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
So we all know that Hardware is hard

396
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
So how do you

397
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Deal with

398
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
The whole

399
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Supply chain

400
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Manage

401
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Like this huge operation

402
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
A lot of Opera

403
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,183
Well first of all we don't want to take the entire cry.

404
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
I think yesterday

405
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
HGTV

406
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Event

407
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
She told me I should Tony Fidelis at Asbury Park

408
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Earthquake

409
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Where you know he actually Envy

410
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Chinese

411
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
Because here in China

412
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
They are

413
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
A very good set of manufacturing base

414
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
And Howard

415
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Manufacturers

416
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
Where in the USA live

417
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:27,039
That's exactly what happened

418
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
But we know what we're looking at China Market

419
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
It's about

420
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
Annually there about

421
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
30 million

422
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,999
New electric scooters Mosel asset but still I mean

423
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
Scooters sold their so

424
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,375
Nostrum Supply chains there a lot of manufacturing

425
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
Suppliers to provide

426
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Components

427
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,055
And also for Mamaki compounds the DTM battery

428
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,151
That manufacturing is also tender in China

429
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
Driven by electric vehicles

430
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
So it would be benefiting from those

431
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
But I'm having said that

432
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,671
We did trying to wait but have to spend a lot of effort into upgrading

433
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Are the quality of RC

434
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Suppliers

435
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
Because those supplies used to be providing

436
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,583
Ask partner part 2

437
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,935
You know traditional as a scooters most doesn't have that high-quality

438
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Requirements

439
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
So we have to have a very strong

440
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,823
Basically the supplier quality management team

441
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
You actually sitting in our suppliers manufacturer

442
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431

444
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
To the helps him to improve

445
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
And that was it was

446
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,879
Litter the effort we put in so it wasn't about shortage of Manpower shortage of

447
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Materials

448
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
It was a shortage of

449
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
High quality stuff

450
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Brightening awareness

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
The team will hire what you know are entirely

452
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
You guys manage our

453
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Supply chain

454
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
You know wait wait wait higher from

457
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
Something from automobile

458
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Amazon Prime cancel music

459
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,967
Consumer electronics manager quality

460
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Used to be run

461
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,551
How is bucolic I-4

462
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Like a high-precision

463
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
I like a meter

00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
I think about that he's thinking that closet you know standard

00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Scooter industry

467
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
So that was basically

468
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
How we got our

469
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
Play Spotify Gabby to be standard

470
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
And also the stand

471
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,687
Next time

472
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,479
He always has really good manufacture

473
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
All the

474
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Difference industry we have a really

475
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Like diversify supply chain

476
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
The some of them from a motorcycle

477
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Kind of cheetah mobile phone

478
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,279
SUV using all the ships we got the benefit from it like

00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Smart watch

480
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,119
Business because we have accused

481
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143

00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,471
All those chips they have super mature Manufacturing

483
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
How to sync the Wii

484
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
And you we're not designing all the chips

485
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,919
I think they saw we always say Technologies pretty cold

486
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,527
Our job is to integrate every code

487
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Acknowledge

488
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
To have warm

489
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
Experience delivery driver user

490
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
That's a keeper

491
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Sewing to sell some juice

492
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,511
Originally you were selling

493
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
E Scooters

494
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Online

495
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
E-commerce company

496
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
And then

497
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Switched

498
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Evolve and adapt

499
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
What stores as well

500
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
What was the thinking

501
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
The doing that

502
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
And how did you quickly

503
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Pet stores in

504
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Something different

505
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:37,247
I think it's a great question I think it wasn't driven by sales a was actually driven by services

506
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,063
Because when we initially so unlike what were big hit

507
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,183
Hunting 2015 with wafer stood on that JD crowdfunding so actually

508
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,279
I broke the shadycroft any record in China

509
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
72 million RMB sales in 15 days

510
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
What record not ranked number 6

511
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
How is it being very hot

512
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,103
But what would happen when our user got a scooter because it is

513
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,503
It's not a toy so that the use of databases when you use those things on daily basis you will need to guess

514
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,575
Service that you know you made got a flat tire or the things

515
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
And that time our service network

516
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Party

517
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Knoxville home service network

518
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,280
Hulu user feel like little dizzy got a high-end product

00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,376
How do we receive a service A1 Tree Service

520
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,704
And they were complaints of Chinese users

521
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
I mean

522
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:36,128
Is there a variable

523
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
Brenda service naturally evolved become

524
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Cellsense wall

525
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
So that's how the decision was made

526
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,048
How is spread out in China and the globally was

527
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,704
Distributors ask Distributors what do even call them Distributors we call them City partners

528
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,824
Will even make you know she'll new name cards for them will be like a new technology

529
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104

531
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
We carefully select those

532
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,760
Northeast Pewter City partners and what do we call them

533
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,320
Select the right person

534
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,392
Basically the people who actually really believe in her car

535
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
I really believe in that window

536
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
Join this path

537
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
They also you know they can change the way how

538
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
In their City how people travel over

539
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
So yes we we got some really serious people who really love the boss that's how you know Dino you see like

540
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:41,152
Beijing 1900 oldest big cities that means we got City Partners come in and stop UTI stores

541
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,528
Yes I mean the end of day they will actually enjoying the economic benefit but initially

542
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
When they sign up the economic benefit was was not first intention because

543
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,512
Wright's Whitworth, those people a let's open up

544
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:02,400
A store like an Apple Store Furnitures everything Elvis there's a fire

545
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
Evolve

546
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Then

547
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,264
That you know provide service to our users

548

The user's inner-city I think they they just love that concept

552
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880

575
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472

00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Small boob

577
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
You also can pronounce

578
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
Is the new new

579
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
Something new

580
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
As something new

581
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,480
We are just like rasp or but also weird

582
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760

585
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:34,304
Just a little touch on that I think it's the news in Chinese little boy

586
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
That's a very good

587
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,936
Implantation on it's not like you're super proud

588
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:44,800
But you are little bit proud of the achievement that you have done

589
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
Through the effort

590
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Kind of a connotation

591
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,576
I think that's what we try to build into our user-specific by writing out

592
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Scooters

593
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,904
You feel that you know that you are little bit

594
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,280
Proud hopefully traffic you can use to

595
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:10,912

So in the first half of this year around 13% of your net revenue was derived from sales outside of

600
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
So could you talk about how

00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:47,520
You plan to go Global I know you're already in Europe so what are some other markets that you're excited about

602
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
Where are you

603
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848

00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,208
A few months after we get our product what's up

613
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
Okay I think we had that live ambition

614
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304

I from you're doing that, I know we were not even on the menu in the main exhibition

622
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184

00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Spare parts

625
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
Because of us

626
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,984
Really big trafficking in your area

627
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
So that should give us

628
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
The confidence that he

629
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
You know we got a chance in Europe and then

630
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,152
They are Distributors from America there.

631
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
How to say shh

00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
I think it's all about you know

634
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
How we

635
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Basically

636
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
Planar used to National Expansion

637
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
Not graduating you step-by-step fashion

638
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Also I can remember is

639
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
The day we are

640
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
The first time, if you ask me

641
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,840

Yeah but

647
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
We are proud

648
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
That's a Chinese company

649
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,576
I just switched up a little bit and talk about your IPO

650
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,648
The copper market right now is not very good

651
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,440
Some argue

652
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
You could be the last company that

653
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Republic

654
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
In the US

655
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
This way

656
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
What are some of your lessons

657
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Dora bikes

658
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
So you can share with us

659
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Our audience

660
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
About what you went

661
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Google IPO

662
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
What I mean is about what it takes to go

663
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Public

664
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,872
I think the advice number one is

665
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
Make sure to TVs on your voice

666
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,488
Is it truly inside

667
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Let's Nacho

668
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,704
It is this not a joke I think it's very appreciated throughout the process

669
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,288
Jenny's amazing

670
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
Devices that you know

671
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Really

672
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,480
Looking back I think nobody can control the timing right when we start the process

673
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
The time you look much better dress

674
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Daiso

675
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,416
Yeah so it's I think I know they wasn't even Marcus

676
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Wasn't good

677
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
Then there's nothing you can do about it

678
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,888
They prepare quickly prepare early and then the whole thing was actually is

679
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,216
The more I won't talk about his actions after that I feel I think

680
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,032
Why do both of us actually feel that excitement but just

681
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,896
The twin Society will push the button

682
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Bender

683
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
Can the pressure come in then you realize

684
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,576
You know that yesterday was a trust from

685
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Private investors

686
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,672
Not as the trust from public investors

687
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
Is then we feel like everyone who actually on my list

688
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,536
Even just widest year of our stock

689
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
With you

690
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,424
Responsible responsible because we want to make sure we could not deliver value to them

691
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,800
You know in your long-term fashion that means we need to work harder we need to basically

692
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Do what we do the best

693
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
Keep rolling a better product those are things

694
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
And then

695
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Is never stop

696
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
This game never stops when I was a private

697
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,928
I'm the product

698
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208

699
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256

701
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,912
I feel more proud forever product launch seriously

702
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
The things he sucks

703
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,040
This year we're allowed to protect Paris Negron

704
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
First time

705
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,952
Introduce our products

706
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Europe

707
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
And to the global

708
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Alex

709
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Much more

710
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
Like like pressure for me

711
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Because we should be

712
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:37,824
Really think about around the world what's the next 3 or 5 years about our

713
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Products to sculpt

714
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,480
Really deep to the other Technologies are the designs to helping people global

715
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:50,368
Where the first I'm not sure where the first Mobility company that launched product

716
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,952
But the first two wheel Mobility

717
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
The definition

718
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:01,120
Chinese Mobility company like four languages

719
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:06,496
Because it it will have 500K

Italian German French and Spanish

721
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:22,112
How many words are so lucky the Swedish guys actually speak pretty good English

722
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:33,888

00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960

Cuz I had to do that

727
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Yes

728
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Did you talk about

729
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,416
What a lot of people will come gradually

730
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Can you go public

731
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
What does that

732
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
Give you more pressure and going forward

733
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,352
You mentioned you actually sleep better or private

734
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
So

735
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,704
What are you most excited and most worried about

736
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,872
Most excited part for me is actually in a big list

737
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
The public

738
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664

Hate we have accomplished from 0 to 1

It is Chinese startup

746
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
But now

747
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
We are AAA puppy

748
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
The company that has a chance

749
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
To global market share

750
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Reciting.

751
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,936
Vicky busted window opportunity I think that's what

752
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Excites me about it

753
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
What worse me about

754
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
It's the same thing as

00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
No

756
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,080

759
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944

00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
Our team the entire team

761
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528

The whistle that window

774
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Opportunity

775
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
No it's actually you already had

776
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
How to say we need to get that

777
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
I said that

778
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Where the huge

779
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Pressure coming

780
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,688
Actually for

781
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Myself

782
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Play song

783
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,272
That's when the IPO is a pressure

784
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
That's it's not the most

785
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,392
Pressure part because I'm always the self pressure prison

786
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
And also the thing you saw

787
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,280

798
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Your team Express

799
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
That's what's showing

800
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
For me

801
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Is y a vowel

802
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
Xiaomi IPO

803
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Lamesa

804
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
After that

805
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,792
Open Vail

806
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
We see all of it

807
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
It's like that

808
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
Literally you

809
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
Broadcasting your products

810
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
You are a vision

811
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,264
Also your

812
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032

815
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
There

816
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
And then

817
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,968
Maybe like

818
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
Eyes exist

819
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Probably changed my life

820
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Because it's more

821
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Responsibility

822
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Plastics assembly moments for me

823
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,584
Looking back I think it's the old so moment for token but he's actually in that picture so he could remember

824
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,960
I was actually when I needed a couple until the first time we got the first product prototype

825
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,640
This guy was that you look at tokens face

826
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,944
You couldn't tell whether he's smiling or his

827
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,576
Quiet

828
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
That was a it was like a

829
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:43,488
Freeze up moment right

830
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,584
Then there were times when we first after we do today the crowdfunding

831
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,192
We knew going to break a record on the 15th day

832
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:58,592
When you aren't they want because if they want was so the number was huge

833
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:04,736
The midnight if they won when will the results came in because everybody

834
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Inlet

835
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
In the office

836
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:12,672
There's nobody leaves because

837
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Broadcast TV yelling for the numbers

838
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
That moment is like finally got something because of the initial the product was a concept

839
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Can you put on the stage where

840
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:33,152
Real money

841
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
They are people buying.

842
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
For the current funding the most

843
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Memorable

844
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
Who sings this song

845
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,696
They didn't see this product in real life

846
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
Missing in real life

847
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912

Quick-fire question

853
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
The first one is who is the entrepreneur you admire the most

854

By Patty McCoy

923
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,328
Hi Stacey. I think she would say

924
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
It was a HR ahead

925
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Netflix

926
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,496
And because we as we're Beauty our company with Luca Ashley

927
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
Is a culture super important

928
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
Netflix has

929
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
PPT

930
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896

Any we always think that it's actually

938
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,328
Even to have a long-lasting company I think

939
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
At the end it's about people it's about a culture

940
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
We still have much to learn

941
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
I think that is

942
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496

Everyday I do that once a week

1128
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,815

1129
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,399
Anyway, I should have got more free time

1130
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167

1131
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,775

Actually

1138
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,391
About to step back and reflect the actual matter

1139
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
Because I know that you know when looking back I should maybe just a three or four things actually really matters

1140
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
At the end

1141
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
But

1142
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,375
When you were in the job

1143
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,167
