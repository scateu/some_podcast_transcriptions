00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
Now you are very renowned investor in China but when you first started out there it was actually your first time in China

68
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
Thank you Sarah

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,944
So it's an interesting background I have I think if I

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Call back

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
To when I was 18 years old

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
And that was a time when I realized it

73
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
You know being one of

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,976
A tree 4 million population in Singapore

75
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
That's released

76
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
When you think about the wolf population at 7 billion

77
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
And I'm in a little country

78
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
With such a small Market

79
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
You know I followed it

80
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
I needed something bigger

81
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
I need the opportunity to go out and do

82
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Taobao without

83
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
As well naturally

84
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
Is in Nepal

85
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Student has a kid

86
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
Yeah told that you can't when you grow up to be in four different

87
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
You're either doctor a lawyer

88
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
An engineer or an accountant

89
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
Edmodo

90
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
I want to see you at the choices that work

91
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
But pulling the engineering route multiple choices it was

92
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
It just makes more sense

93
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Is to be in the US

94
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
Square education in the US on the technology site

95
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,519
At least ranks ahead of you know other countries

96
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
So that's how that's how I got to

97
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
The US

98
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
That's why I obviously

99
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
Singapore does it snow all the time

100
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,999
Never had a chance to go to Four Seasons on the East Coast

101
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,583
I let's go to a place where it's nice and conducive and hopefully safe

102
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,399
When I went to Cornell was my first trip to the USA

103
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
I didn't do it I had no idea how the colleges book

104
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,079
Is alpha-gal accepted by Cornell

105
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Check it out

106
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
To my suitcase

107
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
Blue by myself

108
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Spend the next four years

109
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Without coming back

110
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Singapore

111
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Back in 2001

112
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
I was graduating from Kellogg

113
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,607
I was going East West Kellogg Chicago

114
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Did my MBA

115
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,055
McDaniel won the market the world was crashing

116
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Play we had 911

117
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,407
In the US the whole internet bobbleheads

118
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
Crash and so when I looked around as well

119
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
The in between

120
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
Cornell in Kellogg you were in

121
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Engineer

122
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
You are flying drums

123
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
That's right

124
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,463
So before my MBA graduate in 01

125
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,815
IQ Spencer between Cornell and my MBA I spent about four and a half years

126
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,679
Newly walking the field so I was a electrical engineer India

127
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
What we called electronic warfare division

128
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Optical Technologies Aerospace

129
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
Facebook sounds really a jet engineer for 4 and 1/2 years

130
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
Every day I was out in the sun

131
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,759
Hanging out with the technicians in a fighter jet Pilots

132
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,343
But that's really way I learn about technology

133
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
Not just acknowledged on the book

134
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
But you know how things were built how things with

135
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Design

136
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Where you know systems are being you know

137
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Evolve

138
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Well the cutting technology

139
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
If you think about today's internet

140
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
Startups a lot of the car technology

141
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Came from the defense industry

142
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,847
So that was how I started my my career

143
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Having two

144
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
What kind of project for 3 years

145
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
To ensure that this you know the drawing gets developed

146
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
3 is really short action

147
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,415
In the in the in the lifetime of a commercial product product list

148
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
Weight loss

149
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
So you know that's how I got

150
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
To do my MBA

151
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
Deciding to do a

152
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
But then yeah and so you know one looking around the world

153
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
The next largest market at the time China Market

154
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Would you be up and coming

155
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
We saw Cena's IPO

156
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
In the US in 1990

157
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Online

158
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,199
And at Asia info with the other second IT services IPO in the US

159
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Until a few slight you know China was

160
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,367
You know coming up if you believe in Tech believe in Silicon Valley see the cross has happened

161
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
You have to believe that

162
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
There will be a similar Trend in

163
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
Broke my bone pit off my

164
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,143
Scholarship loans and then went to China again first time in China

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
No relationship no friends

166
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Started from Ground Zero

167
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,103
Since we much chuck Mandarin

168
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
Desert base off my 2 years old to

169
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,039
Previous education fundamental education Singapore

170
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
Education but really I haven't been using the language

171
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
And so we learn learn to read

172
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Plants in Chinese

173
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Learn to understand technical jargon in Chinese

174
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
A lot of entrepreneurs help

175
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Many of the CEOs today

176
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
EOS

177
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,007
Deal with that when I was dead they were the ones who taught me

178
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
How to speak

179
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,895
How to use the right phrases in Chinese

180
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
We got him

181
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
And now you're completely fluent

182
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
No I get by pretty well

183
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Don't limited you when you first

184
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Chengdu China

185
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
You start off in banking

186
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Was Marcus Allen

187
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
And I was going to

188
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Yeah that's right so in 2001

189
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,911
When I went to what I knew I wanted to go to China I had no idea how to start cuz I know nobody that

190
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,031
On top of that as a mission Aaliyah I actually had to pay off my initial and regret

191
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
Masters MBA scholarship

192
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
That's a lot of money

193
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Average family

194
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
The league

195
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991

196
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:30,879
Bourbonnais Fair

197
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
That's why I need a scholarship for my age

198
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
Education is so to really pay off

199
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
The best way to do it is

200
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
You know

201
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Be a banker

202
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,655
Real quick

203
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
Abortion the IBD Division and the ECM.

204
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
Very lucky as well cuz it was a tough time to be inventing

205
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
But the one year was

206
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Gimli

207
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,223
Cuz it got me to understand the whole

208
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Can ultimately you know

209
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Get to be a public

210
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:04,415
Company by that quickly cuz I realize you know when you are a fighter jet a great engineer

211
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
You don't last very well

212
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
And you don't last very long

213
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,815
In the banking environment

214
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
The great difficulty

215
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,727
And instead of pushing it all like beauty products I would like pushing papers and presentation and during translation

216
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
SOI Levin georgescu

217
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,335

00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,175
In the June timeframe and I saw a jackal

219
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,807
Jekyll is a real estate venture capital firm supported by in order Japanese vintage

220
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,647

From mm in

223
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
And that's why I did some O2

224
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
205

225
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095

And in the two months later you join 2 TV

229
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
That's why I still remember it

230
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Hans at a time

231
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
Came to China Yuan in Shanghai

232
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,247

Bessemer

234
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
And so

235
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
This was only time in the China Beach

00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
DC Market

237
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,463
Where a lot of the capital was still coming from like USA

238
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
Fallout 4 OST

239
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Korea and China

240
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
It's not just about

241
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Chinese language

242
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
You have to be extremely good with staying up late at night

243
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
Is you have to do late phone calls with

244

Do us call deposits Partners have to be doing a lot of translation

245
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919

Always will

251
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,815
Whether it's 10 a.m.

252
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,751
LOL my first deal

253
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
In inside of the Cove Restaurant

254
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
On the Border

255
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
That was a very interesting

256
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Yeah that was some

257
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Is it

258
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,391
Channel 506

259
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
Who's Blac Chyna

260
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
Set a timer

261
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Internet

262
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Tu.org

263
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,071
What's the ratio of blogs blogs very popular

264
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,959
But was extremely good experience always like to say that there was a time when I really got to know hun

265
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
A lot of investors around the table

266
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
What companies do well

267
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
That table get smaller

268
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
The people around the table get

269
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,575
Guess you know that multiplies get more people around the table everyone wanting to raise your hand

270
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
To be

271
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
I do recall we had

272
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
Do the interesting story we had another BC who wanted to be chairman

273
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Ausable

274
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,631
Because he thinks this is going to be a great company and he just wants credit

275
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
We have more Downs than UPS

276
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,055
And so is the sector got really hot Malcolm Pettit

277
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Just came in

278
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
The company didn't deliver

279
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
And the only

280
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,295
Think that I really remember it was at the end of the the heydaze you just answer me and the seal

281
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
In his room on the couch

282
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
Trying to figure out

283
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
He's about

284
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
It's about being dad with entrepreneurs not just a notch

285
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,839
I'm sorry but when they need a swelling

286
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
To be there as cheerleaders

287
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,727
But to you don't figure things out

288
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Speaking things out

289
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,359
And what with him to figure out and if if the end means that we have to wind down to company

290
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
And that's why we

291
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
And through that process

292
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
You know I was at Hans is my

293
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Congrats in war

294
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
If a photo wall together

295
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
You know

296
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
You know who's going to be in the trenches review

297
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Who is going to be there to watch your back

298
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
BC

299
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
You know it's not always a lonely business

300
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
If you have a great partner around the table

301
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
I think

302
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Effect of The Upside

303
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,447
Just enormous multiplier

304
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
Is important only for the Thunder to pick the right

305
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
Pick the right following

306
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
To be around the table

307
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,711
So I find it remarkable that both Hans and Jenny you guys

308
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,807
Didn't grow up email in China X robbing Taiwan and then the US

309
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,463
Jagrup in Singapore so what challenges did you face when you first went to China as investors how

310
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
Launch it take you to a climate to the local environment and how businesses down there

311
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
Yeah I think that not being

312
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
Born in China not having grown up in China

313
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
Really get me a healthy respect

314
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
For the country

315
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
People from D1

316
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,175
You go in Fightin you go in scat knowing that

317
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
You are starting at Ground Zero

318
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
At the base

319
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
I think what that does is allows me to be very open to

320
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
The people that meeting

321
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
To constantly be learning about what's new

322
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
You know what's normal what's local

323
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
To always

324
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,631
You don't have respect for the people around me because any one of them can be

325
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Teacher

326
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Write whether it's in a certain train

327
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
Whether it's in

328
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
Specific areas

329
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
A simple is hiring right how do you hire

330
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,895
In China how you how do you set up a company in China

331
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
How do you talk to entrepreneurs while he's smoking your face

332
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
Those are all the different

333
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
A local situations that we have to do

334
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Do with butthole

335
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Having an open mind

336
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
Going in knowing that you know that's only upside cuz that's what you're learning

337
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:32,607
Knowing that you don't have glenshee and so there's really nothing that you can rely on your back end

338
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Means that you have to work harder

339
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
You have to work longer time

340
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,263
You just have to make yourself better

341
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Compared to everybody

342
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
Living my expense with similar

343
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
I was forcing that when I went to China

344
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Chinese

345
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Is quite fluent

346
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
But the by way of

347
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Thinking was more American

348
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
And

349
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,255
Because I've been a student of Chinese history and history general for Lumpy

350
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Set a time

351
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
He was at for me it wasn't as difficult

352
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Adjust to

353
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
China

354
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
And I think that the p

355
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
People

356
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Attendance at World Market Lemoore open

357
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Thought I thought

358
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Is very much a meritocracy

359
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
If you went to work hard bring value

360
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,967
Generally try to help a company and not try to screw them

361
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Looking to put over some terms

362
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Not trying to make every

363
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Take every cent

364
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Every

365
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Youcam makeup

366
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Off the table

367
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
People appreciate your genuine

368
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
And willing money must go help

369
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,863
So I actually did my eight years of investing on the garden China probably a month

370
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Berate

371
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Steamboat ski boarding years my

372
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
And this is why I want to come back to the US

373
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
2013

374
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,567
People's immunity as a Mainland Chinese Avicii

375
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
You crack me up cuz I actually think that the US market

376
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
It's a lot easier

377
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
To make investments and dizzy

378
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
Antidiuretic intelligence super competitive

379
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Talk about it

380
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
The gold picassco 96 9 a.m. p.m.

381
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
But as Avicii

382
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Pretty much is oo7

383
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,511
12 a.m. to call volume always thinking about work

384
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
Always think about in a how to

385
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
When in when needed

386
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,679
Go to lunch Pandora's office don't leave until the size on the timesheet

387
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
What she signed on the dotted line

388
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,311
And you know some some people you move wire money before to Seaside

389
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,151
Just makes my lock out the deal. Kind of crazy stopping it will work in the US

390
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
Putting China it's what it takes to get a

391
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Get stuff done

392
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
And having

393
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
Throw into the fire and be able to

394
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
How to survive

395
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
Together with Jenny and then Elsa teaching

396
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
It's a very rewarding

397
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
Feeling that you have a lot of confidence

398
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Your teammates.

399
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Push comes to shove

400
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
You can get stuff done

401
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,607
So what a dick deeper into that point where you said

402
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
Almost more difficult to invest in China in the in the u.s. is that because there's a lot more competition there a lot more deals

403
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Open alarm or BCS

404
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,383
Yeah definitely a thing today the Demarcus

405
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Change the China Market has

406
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Evolve

407
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Substantially

408
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
The entrepreneurs Eva Mall

409
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,135
You know educated R I didn't know what's out there didn't know how to compare this a lot more information

410
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
On the web

411
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
And so they don't come from a point where

412
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,559
They are just learning their to come from a point where they are doing you to lose

413
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
On the beach

414
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
And and that

415
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,263
As tens mentioned Olia to BCC in China extremely extremely competitive

416
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
You know meetings take place at midnight

417
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
Vizzi's do sit in the office and do some sheets a sign and so

418
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
The level company

419
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Addition

420
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
Is is a lot higher

421
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
Are you tryna we will sit this is a great deal you have

422
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
To do what

423
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Whatever it takes

424
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
Julie is not just about putting one person in front of the entrepreneur

425
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Is putting the entire form

426
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,863
The the the company's values to companies

427
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
Experience in a week

428
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
Steam out there as well to help a portfolio

429
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,311
Sometimes we call on ozios to call Odyssey

430
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
And soul in China

431
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
You do have to be a lot more quiet

432
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
You have to figure out how to break the

433
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
How to get in front of

434
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Entrepreneurs

435
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,879
And so be you don't even after 17 years in China

436
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
We don't sit back

437
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,279
And just forgot oh you know we'll just wait for the entrepreneurs to come knock on my office all you know come visit

438
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
Where she out there

439
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Constantly in awe looking at what's new

440
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
A meeting with Yolanda

441
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
Trying to figure out you know the trends

442
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
And then when the deal is

443
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
You know we like the deal

444
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
We are there

445
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
So it's a battle it's a fight

446
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,527
And even when you're in investor into a company you also have to have a very good

447
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Perspective off the whole macro lens

448
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
Because cuz the spaces

449
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
Highly competitive today they may be two players

450
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
And the investor is the number one

451
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
Tomorrow the space Maybe 2000 players

452
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,375
You know especially when the big guys Alibaba

453
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Off the wall

454
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,215
Comes in and decide that this is the space you want to be

455
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
And so

456
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,591
Again it's not just micro around the company it's also having that

457
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Perspective on the macro level

458
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,967
And then that helps us to help to navigate

459
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
You know how the company of the

460
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Co navigate

461
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
The pop

462
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
You share the story of how you open up a

463
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
The office

464
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
As demonstration what it takes good stuff

465
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Going

466
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
How much regulation

467
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
Taping of Jumperoo

468
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
People to get stuff

469
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,399
Yeah so this is in 2005

470
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
China was juvenation

471
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,519
Baghdad you have no WeChat you have no alipay

472
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Payment was not great

473
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,103
Credit card you know most

474
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Shopsins

475
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,991
And Facilities don't accept credit card so is basically a very cache

476
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319
Zapata industry and it 05 when I went to China

477
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
We had to set up the company

478
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,439
He got the name for the company hire employees

479
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
And it was a really weird system

480
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Because

481
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
To hire employees

482
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
You need to

483
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
First set up the end

484
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
It takes 6 months

485
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
To set up an entity called Wolfie which is a wholly-owned foreign entity

486
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Back then

487
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
And so

488
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,103
Interior you cannot hire anyone within the 6 months time frame

489
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
And that after the entity set up

490
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
That's when you're allowed to have a bank account

491
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
And so that's what money

492
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:15,391
So so for the first 6 months it was a very interesting time. Cuz I literally went to China with us

493
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Suitcase of cash

494
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
RMB cash

495
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
And you know when to hire employees I have to tell them that they are not officially hired

496
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Have the right light but yet

497
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,472
A zodiac degree time for that

498
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
So-called freelance for that 6 months

499
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
And every mine

500
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
I will be back in the office

501
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
To pay them a salary

502
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176
Encash

503
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:43,040
And so you know it's that that's part of the process of starting up

504
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,624
All the operations back then today is a lot easier

505
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,952
05 so it takes a lot to not just a starting the operation

506
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,280
Full LGBT employees who took that leap of faith

507
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,328
To join ggv no one knows

508
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,608
I didn't have a Chinese

509
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,424
We had to figure out a Chinese name for entity

510
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,520
And so it's it's been a

511
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
Very amazing

512
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Johnny

513
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,640
You really getting you no hands dirty

514
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,712
Understanding what it means to set up my own Juju vdare

515
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,528
In the way I understand what start up to half

516
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
To go through

517
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
To really go from

518
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
02 Jacinto 0.1

519
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
Yeah I think

520
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
The pony makes very very

521
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Unique about China is at

522
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Entrepreneur

523
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
If you want to

524
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
You can grow up just

525
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
It's just so many hurdles to jump through

526
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
Simatai regulation red tape back then

527
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
And so

528
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
Over last 10 years

529
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Has he improved

530
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
But it just makes it

531
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Even though

532
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Tougher

533
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Competed to finish eighth this

534
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Do you need a even make

535
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Pick up weed

536
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Empire

537
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
The New Normal

538
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Cook Ford

539
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Biking through

540
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,184
It's also topper in China who's the company

541
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Scalp and skull so quickly

542
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Onesie

543
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Market of 1.3 billion

544
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Pokeball in

545
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
100 billion

546
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Users

547
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
So if you something worse even

548
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
So people willing to overpay or Liang

549
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Because they know that evil wards

550
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Spell bougie

551
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
And then like Jenny said

552
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Everyday every category

553
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
Every 2-3 years

554
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
To your something new happen

555
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,552
And in the process a lot of copycats

556
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Gets offended

557
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
As well so we have

558
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Pia fiercely

559
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Until 1 to

560
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Emerge as a winner

561
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
So we see that movie

562
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Play every year

563
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
2005

564
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
You get used to it getting us

565
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
System rhythm

566
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Pattern when I come back in 2013

567
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Kabaddi

568
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,776
Surprisingly somebody else

569
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Slow

570
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Compared to China

571
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Because the market is only more

572
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,944
Amateur is a lot of stuff offline that's already in decent shape

573
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
So that whatever all my option there is

574
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Automatic

575
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Khalid better

576
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
To differentiate

577
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Candy Bonanza

578
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Small Market

579
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
So it takes more time to

580
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
2 scale where China

581
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
LeapFrog effect of

582
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
The offline

583
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Fishing offline

584
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
Eton Park Stewart mix a lot easier

585
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Go buy something you hop in the

586
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
The competition

587
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Extremely fierce

588
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Bailiwick

589
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
Do you guys have any anecdotes

590
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:16,640
Sore crazy stories to share that illustrate how things work differently in China

591
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
So I think that

592
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
You know

593
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,784
Sure but we think about feces doing due diligence it's

594
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
Financial due diligence

595
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Business due diligence maybe some

596
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
Optical illusions

597
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
And of course legal YouTube

598
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Are you at half

599
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
You know that the party

600
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Consultants and advisors

601
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Come in and give it a

602
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Second look

603
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
In China doll with hat

604
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,936
Very interesting due diligence technique

605
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Cakes that we may have

606
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
How to develop

607
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,312
So back in the early days between 2000 to 2005

608
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Most of the entrepreneur Sweeney

609
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
There's really no one to ask

610
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
You know how did in your previous job little reference

611
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Does that you can get

612
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,344
And so early days I actually hire private

613
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Alligators

614
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Leo companies

615
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,488
And it's interesting because you don't really do that

616
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
Here in the US anymore

617
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,096
And so we asked you what was that party

618
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
Investigators to look through

619
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
The records of entrepreneurs

620
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
To see if they have

621
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,312
You know of any laws

622
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
And in the process some of the reports we find out

623
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
Vici find out interesting things like he has a second wife

624
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
What's up wife

625
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Multiple properties

626
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,600
And it's another way to join understand

627
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Nothing

628
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
Encryption

629
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
Category

630
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,352
Eolian because in Orion

631
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,168
2005 the Jews wasn't in after party

632
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
Service providers

633
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,288
Sufficient resources and information to help us

634
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
I understand what it means to do to

635
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Management

636
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:56,480
We can spend you know 20 30 hours with with the entrepreneurs week

637
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,040
You know all to understand it but that's not enough

638
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,904
Another example of a different types of due diligence is on the gaming

639
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Investments that we made

640
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,512
So does this company actually does cell communication

641
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Tools for gamers

642
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
So when we first met with the CEO

643
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,984
He was adamant that he's the number one market share leader

644
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Like in China

645
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,592
And when I asked him for data to support he has no data

646
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:27,456
He said I believe I'm number one I am number one

647
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:32,832
So it's not it's fight and there's no cuz this is a new category that's really not that party

648
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,392
Research firms that can help us as well

649
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
And so this is Rangers

650
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Time to 8:09

651
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
And so I should design a survey

652
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
Internal survey of

653
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
Bunch of questions

654
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
And then I got my entirety

655
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
Baby stuff at that time

656
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
We had like six

657
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,336
Azalea flower receptionist assistance

658
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
Associate

659
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
I don't think we had Associates

660
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
Dope so really just the only team in China and we went to Beijing Shanghai in

661
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Guangzhou

662
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,904
Do the internet cafes from Midnight

663
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Back then you no internet cafes with

664
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
He was a gamer

665
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,328
I'll don't have PCS at home they were just playing games right

666
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
Until we actually survey our guys

667
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
Non-investment team members that you went into survey

668
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,984
He was a 200

669
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
Person survey

670
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,128
So we had to ask a lot of people in between different cities

671
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,968
And the net result actually showed that amount of the competing products

672
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
Really at the close to 70

673
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
7576

674
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
6% market share

675
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:45,280
Still getting you know what he taught us is that in the market that's emerging in the market that was really really knew back then

676
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Are you just half

677
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Tool

678
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,424
Have more creative way to understand to verify the numbers

679
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
Less reliant on third-party

680
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,848
But more more depending on you know how creative we can to triangulate all the different data

681
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
That we have

682
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
Today is great I think today in China you can

683
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,504
Conduct 5000% sebae you can have online surveys

684
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,552
But back then it was

685
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Really

686
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
Heart

687
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,696
That's right this is like 8 or 9

688
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
For me I remember

689
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
One of my first and last

690
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Company called

691
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
U-high

692
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Car services

693
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Now there is

694
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
New York

695
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
And

696
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,240
I have us in them when we had

697
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
20 cars

698
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
No

699
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
They have like

700
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
50000

701
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
Without forgiving the first

702
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Check

703
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
The CEO open up

704
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
20 stores

705
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Skiing appear.

706
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Looks like 5 months

707
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,112
But make sure that the R20 stores there I literally went to

708
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
It's been less than a week

709
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
Went to Forest City

710
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
And Lissa Thornton stores

711
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
It interview the storm coming

712
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
MassHealth income

713
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
Car

714
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
Turn on the parking lot

715
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
That's how I know that yeah

716
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
I like him but it's not verified that he

717
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
He said he did what

718
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Youku

719
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
So doing whatever it takes

720
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
To verify Things Are

721
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Because otherwise

722
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
You know the company of the CEO should not be the one that we are betting on

723
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,112
But after that to verify

724
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
And both of you imagine that

725
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,280
I think everyone agrees that relationships are very important in China so I wonder how did you

726
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
When you went to China

727
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,632
No relationships how did you go about building that Network

728
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,472
Yeah so when you know you have no relationship it's good cuz

729
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
If nothing else

730
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,872
He started 0 and sold the way I've done it is really just to spend more time

731
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,896
Tmall meetings

732
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,736
For example when we first when I first started looking in the gaming space

733
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Baidu

734
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Play games

735
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,344
And I do understand simulator from my you know

736
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
Equibase

737
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,512
It's a very different Market in China and so what that means is really going to the internet cafes

738
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
Hanging out with gamers

739
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
Hanging out with Developers

740
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,424
I should spend a lot of time in Guangzhou xinjiang in the early days

741
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
Just having coffee talk

742
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
Swifty.

743
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,824
This are like game developers what's the most presentable

744
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,712
Where to find them

745
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
And so you go when you meet one you ask

746
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:18,880
The the first guy that you made after you have an hour you know coffee or tea with him

747
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
Whether he will recommend other people.

748
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
And So within certain geography

749
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Area

750
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
Veteran unicorn Journal Eastwood

751
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,888
Guangzhou 10 sentient and so the number of

752
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Software

753
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,216
And game developers are like The Advocate

754
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
Because you know they hang out

755
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
They have the only

756
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Art & Soul

757
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
You know getting to know

758
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
The first one

759
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Allows you to

760
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
But

761
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,296
It doesn't mean that that will be a deal that will come out of it

762
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,368
But through the process we get to hear a lot more about what

763
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
What are the trends

764
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,232
Which which fuel has gotten funding you know what's new

765
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,280
That so it's a

766
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
But I think once you start to

767
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,656
Trollface and you know sure that you are learning and yeah

768
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,728
And have a good yeah you can have a good attitude

769
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
People do open up

770
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
Do you

771
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,104
And those relationships actually last a long time

772
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,432
Today I may not hang out with them as much

773
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,784
But they are dead they know they know who I am do you know how to look for me

774
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
I went to sacudir that's out in that space

775
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
You know they will come by and say hey

776
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
So this is just one example

777
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
In the IT services

778
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,280
Space force investor in hyssop

779
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,608
That was I went all the high-tech parks

780
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,192
In China every single one from Dalian Beijing Guangzhou

781
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,520
Sushi Shanghai every single one talked

782
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
2D Hi-Tech products

783
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
Officer

784
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
Cuz back Daddy was a highly highly so

785
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
Supported by the government

786
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,992
And so then meeting with the top three to five

787
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Companies in

788
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,064
Indoor hotels for everyone

789
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,624
Italian I had to drink baijiu

790
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Sea Wolf Brooklyn

791
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,560
They also had a lot of Japanese influence

792
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,376
So you know that the alcohol culture is strong

793
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
They also play a lot of golf

794
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,008
I do remember there was one do you actually sign the timesheet on the Gulf

795
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
To happen

796
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,152
But it is also it does take the extra effort

797
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
To go deep

798
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Spend the time

799
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
Again you know to understand

800
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
I think as long as you

801
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Show respect

802
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,720
Are willing to listen to people you be surprised like how many people are actually willing to

803
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Yeah that's exactly right

804
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
I remember

805
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
I used to have

806
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
8 meetings a day

807
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
60

808
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
And

809
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
We willing to

810
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,240
Do so much

811
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
Downtown Boulder

812
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:48,128
You will need to do that and you'll very willing to help people leaving food out investor

813
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
You're waiting to share your knowledge

814
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
And you're

815
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
They are contacts

816
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
And your insights on the

817
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Thanks for your studying

818
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Do people

819
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
People think you're nice guy work hard and smart

820
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,672
They are very very open

821
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
So what you been with a lot of people

822
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
In the USSR

823
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Complain

824
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
It is harder for me

825
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Me too

826
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
Fully appreciate

827
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
Because if you

828
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
If I can go there

829
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
As I

830
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
The Foreigner

831
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
Make it work

832
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
And then

833
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
If it would be willing to

834
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Try it

835
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
So you could go to China without bias

836
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,944
And could really

837
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
Understand how works

838
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,272
And not feel Superior

839
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
I feel like this is

840
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Then I think the chance

841
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
I think that's a great message

842
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,464
For people who are

843
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
Putting crop in China

844
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,888
Cool maybe you are from the US or other parts of the country were interested in getting involved in China's Tech echoes

845
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
But don't know where to start I think just like having an open mind spend time they're getting to know that people can be very powerful

846
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
It helps you know how we can smoke

847
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,968
I always forgot to smoke at night

848
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,528
Drink if you need to but asking for me I didn't

849
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
View my eight years in China

850
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
I do have a drink more than

851
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Exclusively in Internet space

852
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,280
UC is very much that you don't need to go anywhere stuff

853
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
You can just focus on business

854
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
Show your

855
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
Your ward

856
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Throw in Charlton

857
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Discussions

858
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
YouTube

859
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,264
China is actually more open to entrepreneurs 10

860
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
A lot of times all us entrepreneurs

861
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
The afraid

862
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
On

863
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
And so you know what you

864
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
Before even setting foot in China

865
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Become a way in

866
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
You know they going there

867
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
With you

868
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,904
But I think I Echoes Hansa comments earlier if if

869
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
He and I

870
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Both

871
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:42,048
We haven't grown up in China we don't we did not go to school that we didn't work that

872
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
And we can

873
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
By just paying attention to entrepreneurs

874
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
Listening vs. speaking all the

875
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Time

876
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
You know and then to help

877
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
You willing to help

878
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,544
Be willing to learn

879
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Be very open-minded

880
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
You know that's that's always a way to

881
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
But you cannot do it

882
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Sitting in the US

883
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
Do understand China you have

884
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
To be in China

885
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,344
One day in a year

886
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
But if you're a CEO of a company wedding

887
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
How to break into China

888
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
You have to make the commitment not just a

889
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
Stands on Monday

890
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
But for you for you yourself

891
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
To be willing to

892
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Spend that time

893
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Living title

894
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,496
I think Jenny of said before that what motivates you to

895
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,080
To be investors real your love for technology I wonder where this

896
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,664
Confirm my why are you so passionate about the new technologies

897
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
Yeah I don't know I think I was born with it

898
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,088
Why I always have this

899
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Believe that

900
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
A single person

901
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Can change the world

902
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
Somehow I believe that

903
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
And I

904
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,144
Again and again in the last 17 years that individuals have the ability

905
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
To both markets

906
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
To change perceptions

907
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
And to create companies

908
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
You know that today

909
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Amazing

910
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Play look at Jack ma with

911
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
20 years ago

912
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
He was a

913
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Teacher

914
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Angel

915
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
And you don't

916
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Make even she can make it right

917
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Pizza Hut

918
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,208
I've always felt like you though individuals of believing that the individual can make changes

919
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Very important

920
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
And then tool

921
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
In today's age

922
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,120
Would that change the Monumental change position

923
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
Disruptive change versus evolutionary change

924
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
I might believe is that

925
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Hess

926
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,776
To leverage on something

927
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
And that Leverage

928
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Is likely to be

929
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Technology

930
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,944
Right because if you can have a robot that can achieve the toss of a thousand workers

931
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
But this one

932
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
They can remove

933
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
The repetitive

934
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,064
Cost at 1000 Wilcrest

935
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Have to do that sufficiency

936
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
And Ethel with with new ways of thinking new ways of competition new ways of Technology you can create brand new

937
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Products

938
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,328
And so I think that's where you get to lavaridge

939
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,472
Not by having a thousand percent do the same thing even smarter is not enough if you can Leverage

940
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
A cheap to do better

941
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Robot

942
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,336
To do better then I think that's how the will is be

943
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
So that's what drives me every day I want to see

944
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
You interesting

945
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,784
Products and services that can really go out and create something

946
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,088
That maybe we haven't thought off today

947
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Just like when

948
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
We got our first iPod offers

949
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
Ford meet with thought that was like a geek

950
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Gaming device

951
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,048
Today is not good gaming device

952
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
Today

953
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,632
Absolutely it's all uniform

954
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,680
Communication and

955
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,544
Civista information platform even the three-year-old cannot do without

956
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
Your iPhone or iPad right

957
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
Hans do you want

958
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
To elaborate on that

959
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Fink's

960
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,736
I was lucky that went to Stanford

961
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Cuwest

962
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Mybatis like

963
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
And see how he changed

964
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
Stamford bartending

965
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
The 90s

966
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
Is Dallas very very different

967
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
Thanks to all that unit of money

968
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
I donated

969
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
So eat when you see it a place I can

970
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Can change a lot universe

971
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
Image appreciate what

972
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Technology

973
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Juventus

974
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
In China

975
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
In 2005 was

976
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
The first one

977
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
Sitting in a second I'm going to China

978
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
The 1999

979
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
And when I remember when

980
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
Percent in 95 I was like oh my God

981
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
A while

982
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,088
To come out

983
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
In 95

984
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
When I first got into banking

985
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,184
I see that

986
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Chinese

987
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
I still limp

988
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
Or try to go public

989
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Put on your stockings

990
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
These are very

991
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
Old school companies

992
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,400
But you 99 you can still see that watch henna

993
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
I'm different

994
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Internet

995
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Has cotton people

996
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
What's the tension

997
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
And wants to go there again in 2000

998
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
3/8 Oz 1/4 oz

999
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
He just start seeing the Cubs

1000
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,896
Kingsbury

1001
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
And so

1002
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
When you see what you don't see

1003
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
She has done to a

1004
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Communist country

1005
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,832
We're now the most valuable company

1006
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
China are

1007
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
BusyBox

1008
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Listing in New York

1009
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,512
And Hong Kong and that's the intention and that much bigger than any other

1010
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
Cinema Enterprise in China in the happen

1011
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
In Little League

1012
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
Less than 20 years

1013
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
It makes you look bad

1014
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
See

1015
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,984
Why was part of that we were part of that change

1016
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,288
And makes you very proud

1017
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
That you like us

1018
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,384
Cat probably has had more impact

1019
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
In China than anywhere

1020
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Alice in the world

1021
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
In the last 50 years

1022
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Probably

1023
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:22,112
I think also in China people considered to be a force for good mostly

1024
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,928
Whereas people here are more likely to talk about

1025
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Like Emily Shop jobs or

1026
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,816
How new technology can

1027
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
Have negative impact on Paris

1028
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,936
Stakeholders but in China we don't see that much

1029
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Discussion

1030
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
Yeah I think a keyboardist because

1031
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,360
Government support so the Chinese government by and large

1032
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,664
This is one of the benefit of being in the country

1033
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Economy

1034
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,992
Before I went to China I never quite appreciate

1035
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,576
The communism

1036
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,136
As demonstrated by China

1037
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,256
Then know that I've been in China for 17 years I think that the planned economy is not always bad

1038
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
And by plan

1039
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:08,192
The Chinese government duplex right in the dimension in mm 205 is that okay China is going to now

1040
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
Upgrade our students

1041
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
And a Workforce for manufacturing

1042
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
To IT service

1043
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
And soul

1044
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
That's how high-tech pops

1045
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
You know supported in every

1046
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Tri-Cities

1047
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,528
That's why grants and scholarships were given to encourage

1048
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
The students do I choose

1049
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,624
To learn software programming

1050
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
And so that that created a huge Talon

1051
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Pool

1052
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
For the IT service

1053
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,816
Industries rifle Wednesday Services IBM Services Microsoft

1054
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
The local Enterprise like I saw

1055
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
You know what new software example

1056
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
Want to go into this

1057
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,520
Category day now have talent pool and because of governments

1058
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Supported

1059
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
Similarly fast forward today with AI

1060
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Hugh Janus

1061
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
Hot Topic

1062
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
The government has

1063
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Bee Tattoo

1064
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Really

1065
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,528
Investing in call R&D for AI

1066
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Talent

1067
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
How to develop AI

1068
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Pipe IP

1069
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
AI type

1070
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,232
Tallinn to attract International talents from different schools PHD programs

1071
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,816
You also come back so it's not just local policies by social

1072
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
International policies

1073
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
Bring that

1074
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Until I think having great government

1075
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
Does help

1076
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
You know the whole industry think about the

1077
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Possibilities

1078
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,360
I was talking to another company that was so manufacturing that was using robotics

1079
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
To automate some of the process

1080
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,200
And my question was

1081
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,272
Are you worried that your workers are going to get really

1082
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
Angry baby cuz you because some of the

1083
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
What stations are being replaced by

1084
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
The robots

1085
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
And you know his comment is that

1086
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,120
Number one they offered a job said I want to hire

1087
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
And I cannot find

1088
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,216
That skill set something as simple as

1089
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Picking mushrooms

1090
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,544
That's actually is skew set that

1091
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,895
Cannot now be trained because most of the youngsters don't want to be trained as a mushroom picker

1092
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,223
Light bulb and decimal one can find the Talon anyways

1093
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,015
Can you cannot do enough

1094
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Between them

1095
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
The number to

1096
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
The government every supporting by

1097
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
Subsidizing automation

1098
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:07,487
So over 20 30% of factory lines if you automate

1099
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,279
The applicant by the government

1100
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
And soul

1101
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,863
You could almost try this for free

1102
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,191
You know how to start automatron station and then the next day

1103
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,263
So again I think the government support isn't just

1104
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
Bubbleologist

1105
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Skin policy

1106
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,615
They are actually doing it in real

1107
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Stop CDC

1108
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,711
Support and you see it not just you know in factories

1109
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
We see it in the whole TV

1110
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,319
Sector the electrification of Carswell infrastructures

1111
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
What is being built

1112
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
Part 2 across all the different verticals

1113
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
So that's one

1114
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,487
The number to the Social grid

1115
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
Role model

1116
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
We talked about tencent we talked about Alibaba

1117
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,655
We have seen in China the Chinese entrepreneurs now have

1118
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,471
Seen that you can be special

1119
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,799
Show technology you can be a average guy and yet

1120
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
Be able to

1121
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,383
Will be the next Purnima or the next Jack Ma

1122
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Enough presidents to show that

1123
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
Is possible

1124
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,015
Anything lastly the mindset of parents

1125
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
Change

1126
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,855
Daniel 10-15 years ago in interview now Associates

1127
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
Most of the associates once they are in Great Schools and when they graduate the one

1128
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
Bridget was the government

1129
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,887
And then it was diyc like the Microsoft now.

1130
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
And then you know it was a startup

1131
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,007
And now when you talk to them if they want to do startups

1132
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
And so I think the whole mindset has

1133
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
So net-net I think that you could system is

1134
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Pretty healthy

1135
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,991
Yeah the number of stem graduates in China

1136
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
Increase dramatically now.

1137
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
15.6 million

1138
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Back in 26

1139
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,159
That's almost ten times.

1140
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,951
The size of a stem graduates

1141
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Science technology engineering

1142
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:45,791
India

1143
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
The US

1144
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Liberty India

1145
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,143
So there's a lot more people willing

1146
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,679
To learn talking

1147
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Try talking to Tech

1148
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,287
And as China continue to grow the size of a service engine

1149
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Continue to grow so

1150
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,895
Do you may lose job in one sector but the s

1151
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,967
Economy is growing at 7% year-on-year

1152
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
Do new jobs

1153
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,063
So tennis pretty smart to upgrade cell

1154
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,671
Well you calling me all those phone down compared to historical numbers are still growing

1155
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,231
Proximo some countries around the world

1156
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,047
So if can afford population to accept

1157
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,375
That $2 bill changes will make things even better

1158
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
RMB company

1159
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
Grow

1160
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,519
So I think that is a

1161
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Hattiesburg different Point NC

1162
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
Example of a motorcycle

1163
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,639
Versus us and Western Europe

1164
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
And that means easier

1165
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,991
For a i and others who knows Univision

1166
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,087
Yeah Usher argue that Chinese drama is very forward-looking

1167
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,927
Regarde-moi wants to get something done it got

1168
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
Done very efficiently very quickly

1169
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:52,863
So I wonder what advice do you have for us companies trying to navigate the political landscape there in

1170
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
How do you like predict weather governor

1171
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:59,775
Going to do in a certain sector how do you align your interest with a government interest

1172
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,127
I'll try to start at First Look at example of uber in

1173
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,919
Talk to Uber team in China

1174
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
That most of them

1175
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Feel.

1176
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
They were not extra

1177
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Discriminated

1178
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
By the

1179
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Chinese cover

1180
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,415
I have to go through and get approval for

1181
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
Didi China how to do this

1182
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,255
That's something Travis set himself

1183
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,815
That's correct so they were more or less

1184
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
Similar playing field for the most part

1185
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,983
And as an Uber team of all yours companies in China their PopularMMOs aggressive

1186
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
Yeah no work the hardest

1187
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,079
And what will it do things

1188
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
The more Chinese way

1189
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,175
So if you're willing to adopt locally

1190
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,735
And work long hours work smartly

1191
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Looks very hard

1192
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
The chest

1193
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
Success is a lot higher

1194
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,439
I think there's some sectors for sure that Chinese government to regulate and make a cup of foreign players

1195
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Infield media

1196
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,767
IND

1197
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
Social networking

1198
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
So

1199
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
I love Google in Facebook

1200
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
Space and talented

1201
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
But when it comes to e-commerce

1202
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
Friends or a lot of other things

1203
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
Us companies still have a great Advantage swimming

1204
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,871
Look out fer that the US

1205
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,663
And that USM

1206
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
Congress have

1207
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
Chinese internet companies buying us

1208
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
But you know Apple

1209
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Is still

1210
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,647
Is the most successful film company

1211
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,695
I must have in China

1212
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,279
Yeah poppleton raise more revenue from iTunes

1213
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,303
The App Store

1214
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
In China.

1215
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Anywhere else

1216
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,911
And you want to argue

1217
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:34,751
Your US Government through Apple can have access to some data

1218
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,055
And it's just a lot to happen

1219
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:42,687
So yes there's some boys I'm some government regulations issues but the Practical Chinese camp

1220
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
And you ask

1221
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
So it's not anything

1222
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
Tomorrow

1223
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
How willing you

1224
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
You're willing to die

1225
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,207
Right now we're at the Julie watching the regulatory

1226
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,047
Changes and what the government says India Congress

1227
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,095
Important as well

1228
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:05,727
Dimensional yeah right in 2000 to 05 when the Chinese government saying I want boost it

1229
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,799
What cause I want to be the next Bangalore

1230
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
Outsourcing

1231
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,151
You at companies like Microsoft HP

1232
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
HD

1233
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,247
Establishing ID centers

1234
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
In China

1235
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
To support this

1236
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,855
Scroll saw into a train engineer Siri

1237
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,439
And so understanding where the Chinese government is putting effort

1238
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,231
To grow to 2

1239
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,303
Like for example in the EI sector

1240
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,839
Tube to bring calendar

1241
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,399
It makes sense that Google has an R&D Center

1242
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
In China

1243
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,471
So understanding the trend reading the trance

1244
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,007
Don't go against the grain

1245
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,567
Once you understand where the big train is going

1246
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
And you can help this

1247
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
The part that grows

1248
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,431
Then whether your local company or whether you're International

1249
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
You going to have

1250
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
A way to play in the mall

1251
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,783
And getting it ahead

1252
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
Everybody else

1253
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
It's probably even better

1254
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,207
All your competitors are still thinking about how to beat the regulation

1255
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
And your your head up there

1256
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,839
By working with local governments to make sure that you're on the right track right weather

1257
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,399
As I mentioned some of this Evie Tran Dai Trang

1258
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
Then I think you have

1259
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,007
We are now seeing a lot of automotive

1260
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,079
Oh yes International ones trying to type into the China

1261
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,895
Automotive Market China is the world's largest

1262
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Automotive

1263
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
120 million

1264
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,783
Installed base of passenger car every year 22

1265
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,831
25 million new cars being sold

1266
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
In China

1267
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,927
And so if you are 40 I'm sitting here

1268
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,999
In the US or damla right in Europe

1269
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,047
All in in in Japan

1270
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,095
You you have to want to figure out how

1271
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
And so understanding The Strand understanding who you

1272
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,191
She talked to

1273
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Understanding who you

1274
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Do JV with

1275
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,055
Once you understand that random Bieber facts about

1276
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
In terms of the approach

1277
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,407
Write me mean that you have to do a JV first

1278
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Voloco partner

1279
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
You mean that you have

1280
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,759
Set up some Hi-Tech Development Centers

1281
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
In college

1282
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,551
Tallinn

1283
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,623
You made me and you taking Strategic investment stake

1284
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
Insound some of the startups in China

1285
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,231
And so that being very open to others different

1286
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,071
What will help companies to understand the local nuance

1287
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
Then that's a better formula

1288
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,447
But you look at Apple depriest pyrite

1289
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Invest in Didi

1290
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
Invest in Uber

1291
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
And as shown in

1292
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,591
China as a willingness

1293
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
Topless Porter Loco

1294
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,943
Entrepreneur startup community in Louisiana

1295
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
And

1296
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,527
Apple is helping a lot of a Chinese app

1297
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
Apps to expand

1298
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Through

1299
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
App Store to open

1300
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Markets

1301
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,695
MDC Tim Cook going to our proposal company like

1302
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719

Jenny and housing

1304
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
I sit on the board of

1305
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,119
To see all the Innovative Chinese company that's doing well

1306
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,911
And recognize them

1307
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
Through his

1308
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
On global basis

1309
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,311
So Apple smart and understanding that 10 camera what

1310
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
C10 company Go Global

1311
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,663
I'm just playing a role to help them to do that

1312
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
But not bees on

1313
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,295
When she or subsidy or favoring but these are great companies

1314
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
.

1315
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,367
You just like them the most gorgeous. Where else

1316
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
I'm outside of

1317
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
And

1318
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
For us

1319
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
We don't have

1320
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,767
A lot of special

1321
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,327
Insights before the government is going to do next

1322
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,607
Almost no one.

1323
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,215
So how do you figure out what regulation will not be as much problem going forward

1324
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
Utica white Chevy Market

1325
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Gumbo

1326
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,079
Beijing has a 20% car ownership

1327
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,383
Yet this has the biggest traffic problem

1328
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
That doesn't come out

1329
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
So and it says somebody has 70% ownership

1330
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,063
Already even get the given

1331
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
Uber and Lyft

1332
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
So if

1333
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
China

1334
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,695
Inviting people as many people buy cars

1335
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
As of the r

1336
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
Car lenders in Spokane Valley

1337
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,535
Can you imagine

1338
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,815
The street of Beijing

1339
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,863
3x 4X more cars on this today

1340
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,215
So you know no matter who is running the government

1341
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,823
Ride-sharing and bike-sharing has to be part of the solution help us all that traffic congestion

1342
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
As urbanization

1343
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Increase

1344
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Peking China

1345
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
You figure out where China is going

1346
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,271
I try to anticipate what I wanted a problem to be solved

1347
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,063
There are plenty of things that come out

1348
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,087
Play a positive role

1349
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
So figure out what China House 2

1350
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,439
Tell to make this country work

1351
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Yes

1352
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,023
Continue to grow and for Emerson continue

1353
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:18,911
So Jennie you focus a lot on a Frontier tax sector edges UV I wonder

1354
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,775
Where do you think China stands in the world and how it Compares 2 U S embarrassed feels of

1355
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
Frontier technology

1356
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,383
Full frontal tactile definition of Chicago Street differ

1357
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
The first

1358
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
She's around

1359
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,991
Shinto from

1360
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,319
Billy autonomous-driving all the way down to EV

1361
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
The first actor for us

1362
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
2nd sector is really in

1363
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Robotics

1364
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Animation

1365
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
About holiday

1366
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Patrice inch

1367
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
China Wei

1368
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Automating different

1369
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Workflow

1370
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
Different now what

1371
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
Isis that's happening not just

1372
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
City lodge effect

1373
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Please by Billy.

1374
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
Turn it down to the

1375
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Small medium

1376
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Usually around

1377
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,127
Which is a little bit mod software you know versus

1378
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,919
How to hotwire cars

1379
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
02

1380
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,759
IRobot if you look at this area fancy attack

1381
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,831
Is generally viewed as a new area both in the US and

1382
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,879
China Doll classified both

1383
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
To be at the first evening

1384
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
What does that mean

1385
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
Meanwhile at night I think that's

1386
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,791
Number one thing when you think about the talent pool

1387
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,095
This is really attached to a very hot liquid

1388
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:25,727
Contested space right now so whether it's a I tell any of the u.s. REI Thailand in China

1389
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
Elmo's at the

1390
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
The same level

1391
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
Where does a severe

1392
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,103
You know shortage of the right

1393
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
AI type of talent

1394
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
As engineering offices

1395
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
Stevens Brothers Jess PhD

1396
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
You know it's done algorithms all research

1397
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
In this area

1398
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,623
Chat with it on the talents is pretty similar same footing

1399
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,719
In terms of what these startups are focusing on that it's a bit of a day

1400
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,815
Difference so in the US we have seen startups when he called himself a i

1401
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,607
Companies tend to be more software

1402
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,679
Bass what is leveraging machine learning

1403
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,543
All in different vehicles with a simple banking application or in

1404
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,127
The computational area pretend to be a lot more

1405
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
Software

1406
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:11,551
Even in the automotive area with Seymour Alpha autonomous-driving startups in the u.s. trying to attack this issue

1407
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,647
In China we see a small white bass

1408
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,207
Trump all startup trying to take different

1409
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
Pieces of the

1410
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,279
So you're not restricted to just Southwest

1411
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
Solutions

1412
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,839
They are putting that software Solutions

1413
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
Go to hardware

1414
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,935
And so generally Chinese entrepreneurs are not has

1415
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,727
Afraid of the hardware

1416
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,615
Thumbs-up sometimes we think about hot when Subway Fuze I get two different DNA is two different verticals

1417
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:41,247
And a start-up should I do both and when they focus you should be either focused on software

1418
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,343
But then you will you know in the hallway I enable War

1419
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,903
Autonomous car on the robot

1420
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,695
It's an integrated product is

1421
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
The system with a hardware and software

1422
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,047
And so in that respect we have

1423
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,095
PC Mall innovation around complete

1424
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
Teksystems

1425
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,887
In China

1426
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
Stila Leon early days

1427
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,591
From a market perspective I think it's similar the problems and pinpoint that's being

1428
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
Address

1429
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
I'll being

1430
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
You're very similar whether it's cybersecurity in the US

1431
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,247
Stay around mobile cyber security

1432
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
It's a CMP employee that Chinese

1433
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
Especially in China

1434
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
You know with

1435
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
That module

1436
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Transactions

1437
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
Going through mobile platform as well

1438
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,719
So very similar problem sets

1439
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,071
So I actually predict that in the next 5 to 10 years has the whole AI Market

1440
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:31,423
Get my mom a chill has all this application starts to find its vertical

1441
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
Application

1442
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,031
The chance of companies that has more cross-border

1443
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
Interaction will go up

1444
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
Equip be

1445
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,479
Talon right us companies trying to leverage not just a talent pool that can find us

1446
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:49,343
But the reverse right can you attract more Chinese entrepreneurs to stay in the US

1447
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
That we have to rely on

1448
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:55,999
The goodness of the US government but I think you will see that all devices

1449
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
Supposed to write Chinese

1450
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,095
Startups actually hiring Us Talent

1451
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,143
And then allowing them to

1452
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
You know wolf

1453
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,447
Tool to China

1454
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,311
ABS on the talent pool exchange and then ultimately products

1455
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
As well

1456
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,127
Can you build better robots

1457
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,407
Can you build better

1458
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
Autonomous cars and have debt

1459
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
Y'all have a

1460
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
Impact on the globe

1461
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,527
That may happen

1462
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,111
Have I recently that the number of papers

1463
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:26,463
Machine learning and AI has just be a lot higher in China than the US

1464
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,559
Is a lot of more studies are being done where researchers working in the field

1465
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
No absolutely that's actually in line with

1466
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Depart as well

1467
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,983
So in the past I think it's not just papers as being redone or site

1468
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Ephesians

1469
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
IP

1470
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
Apologized

1471
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,383
It's an interesting Trend at 10 for

1472
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,175
15 years ago when we ask startup

1473
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
Dalian China

1474
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Default IP

1475
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
He was in

1476
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
So expensive

1477
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,319
It's not because they haven't

1478
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,367
Diamond audit don't have IP

1479
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,951
Is because a few that is just too expensive to fight on the international base

1480
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
Autism awareness

1481
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,815
That one day they will go International is pretty.

1482
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,887
Today if you ask any AI startup

1483
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
In China

1484
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,215
They will show you a jealous about IP

1485
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,007
So the weather

1486
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,335
The wellness that they have to protect what they have only on

1487
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,663
I meant that potentially Dave could go International as well

1488
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,711
Becoming malber higher

1489
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Possibility

1490
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,783
Just 10 years ago and so I think that that help

1491
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Bring up the weather

1492
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
I think it's always been there

1493
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,647
Is just at 10 15 years ago

1494
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,975
You know that awareness wasn't that we entrepreneurs and they just don't follow

1495
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,839
Lucky for us and China are mates

1496
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
Italicize

1497
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,423
Has China become number one marketing

1498
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
A lot of things

1499
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
People don't

1500
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
Realize is that

1501
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
Chinese speed

1502
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311

And try something new

1524
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887

Better

1530
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:26,015
For the last part of the podcast will have a set of standard questions that we ask every guess the first one is

1531
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
Who is Eric Bruner that you admire the most

1532
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,111
And why I know you're saying a lot

1533
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,647
But if there is one then

1534
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,207
Impressed you though I think the one that impressed

1535
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Music

1536
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
Amazon

1537
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,839
You're not the only one who's said that on the show

1538
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
Any reason why

1539
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,215
Well I think he's an entrepreneur who has never

1540
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
Stop tool

1541
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263

1542
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
His ability to

1543
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,335
To go from selling books online

1544
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
To general e Commerce

1545
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,407
Obviously that's one type of x

00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687

1547

To go from

00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
See

1552
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
22 selling services for

1553
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
This has to be

1554
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,207
That's something that most

1555
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,999
Please tell us a startup going to

1556
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,583
Right on Dundee focus focus on your car focus on your DNA

1557
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
And this is a spa

1558
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Different

1559
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
Does anything you can

1560
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,703
And then to have the guts

1561
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
How to go offline

1562
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,079
It'll do to be away from not just online but you say let's go by Whole Foods

1563
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,127
I just got to think about offline

1564
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,943
On top of that you know Amazon is

1565
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,295
On top of the leadership in terms of innovation that was one of the earliest

1566
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,855
Can we experiment with having drawings

1567
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,391
To do deliveries

1568
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
Right until we may not

1569
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
Either drawings

1570
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,511
On the everyday basis but I have to believe that

1571
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,815
The R&D what is still going on

1572
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
Quietly

1573
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,863
And hopefully we'll see some

1574
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,935
Soda level Innovation to level of God

1575
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
That this us example

1576
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,519
I think it's

1577
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
That's that's why

1578
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
China

1579
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Jeff bezo

1580
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
Idea Monterrey

1581
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,735
Yes but in the US increasingly is talk of

1582
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,783
I trust baking soda Amazon

1583
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,575
It's a powerful break up Amazon.

1584
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,879
So is the same set of

1585
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Megan Fox

1586
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Giving temporary differently

1587
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,511
What you do for fun

1588
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:17,375
So I'm I love travel as I said before I believe the wall the Earth

1589
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,191
What is been getting smaller as I grow older

1590
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:24,287
What is a bunch of continents out there that I haven't been

1591
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,591
So I do like to travel I do like to go away

1592
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:33,247
Away from just what Humanity

1593
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:39,135
I love to spend time with animals I love to separate spend time in nature

1594
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,207
In Africa or two back door

1595
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:45,279
That's right so I've been to Patagonia

1596
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:50,655
Hiking Adventure Peru I've been to Russia Kamchatka spending time with the Bears

1597
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,775
Literally definition

1598
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,335
So it's a really it's thoughts been

1599
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
Pretty good Nepal hiking

1600
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,967
Generally I like to be out there not in luxury

1601
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
Application but really rocking it out

1602
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,551
Spending time

1603
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,575
To understand

1604
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,391
You know in different parts of the wall what

1605
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,671
The different people dads

1606
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
The different couches

1607
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,743
And that I think that helps

1608
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,303
To give me a very good and healthy apple

1609
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Speciation

1610
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,143
Off my role model role in this world

1611
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,471
Cuz I sent you know that it is still possible

1612
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
All within my role to make changes

1613
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Two people around

1614
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
So much

1615
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
What is your system

1616
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,407
What's inside your backpack

1617
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:40,319
Yes oh I think that actually if you ask me what I have in my backpack on a daily basis

1618
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,463
So I will the survival track even my work back I have I carry my passport

1619
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,535
I always have my passport so I'm ready to fly

1620
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,351
Anytime

1621
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,911
I have different wallets for different currencies

1622
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,959
Cuz you know credit card doesn't work

1623
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:01,055
As I found out via Leone China it doesn't work in a lot of countries

1624
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:05,919
And so making sure that you have ways to have cash that you have ways to survive

1625
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,247
I think if you have cash and you have your passport

1626
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
You can basically survive

1627
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:11,807
Anywhere

1628
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,367
So far rocking it out in the wall

1629
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:20,767
Obviously your cash and a possible it doesn't really help and your phone doesn't really help either so I think he

1630
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
Good shoes

1631
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,607
You know nice warm jacket

1632
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,935
Make sure you have your water bottle so you can always get water

1633
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,239
I think with the tree you can always survive

1634
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,543
Somewhere else to carry

1635
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,079
121

1636
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,895
County Bank, bank account do you have

1637
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:41,503
I do have a few because I I woke in the USA in China

1638
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
Mostly in China

1639
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,087
You know I never grew up in Singapore

1640
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,391
Reverse call number

1641
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,255
The one of the guiding principle I have is always keep

1642
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,023
My life

1643
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
Simple

1644
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
Cuz things. So Campo

1645
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,143
Get it on the daily basis and can be bought

1646
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,447
Why so many details that I think that

1647
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,239
It helps not to add to those

1648
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,263
Complication every

1649
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,799
Still keep it simple

1650
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,847
Amazingly the One credit card

1651
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
Has helped me

1652
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,151
To go global

1653
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
In the last 20 years

1654
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:17,855
That's why I said it's the first car

1655
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Still with me

1656
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,463
Wear something you read recently that

1657
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,511
Text you a lot or you recommend

1658
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,559
Me a book or article or anything

1659
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,119
I realized three or five books

1660
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,911
Simultaneously and so

1661
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,495
I think they'll most recent books and reading may not be good for recommendation

1662
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:40,895
So recently I and has noses

1663
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:44,223
Avenue area that exploring and I'm very interested in

1664
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,039
And that's really is and in health

1665
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,623
Nutritional supplements in genetic engineering

1666
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,671
So I've been reading textbooks

1667
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,487
I know it's really strange service reading textbook

1668
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,815
How to get myself up in terms of the

1669
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
The fundamental and

1670
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,423
