Around the same time

86
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
But you were from South Africa

87
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
You were successful entrepreneur

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,576
Why did you decide to come to China

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672

Teacher electric give me a story about China which really

93
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Caught my attention

94
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
It was a

95
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,703
A crazy entrepreneurs story where the guy wind up

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Bringing chicken

97
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Making a whole bunch of money in 6 weeks

98
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Height of 6 month

99
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
And it was

100
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
So you did the good people here if anybody just went by the pear

101
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,271
The thing about the story was interesting is that it was about selling to

102
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
And nobody in that time was thinking about that

103
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
Everyone

104
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
About buying from

105
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
So I came here thinking will let me let me come in and

106
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Blow this place

107
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
And maybe something will catch

108
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,959
And when I was here I was searching constantly searching for

109
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
That's what I thought it was I thought it was something from

110
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
Forget that I was going to bring to China

111
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127

Investor in tencent yes exactly

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
I realize that what was missing here was lifestyle

117
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
It's difficult to explain to people

118
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
What you don't know you don't know

119
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
When the people here

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
Donuts great City but they just didn't know

121
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335

126
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
Yeah

127
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
Baseball 30 years ago no one thought of it when we when we

128
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
What I was really trying to do was

129
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
So the problem of myself

130
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Give me something else to do rotting.

131
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
2 bars and restaurants and stuff

132
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
And I live like a little

133
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
But that experience

134
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
I guess

135
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Was what we ended up importing

136
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
So we didn't importapart

137
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
Hijabi bribe Delphine to move with you

138
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487

00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
Original

141
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
So she was more successful that you

142
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,383
If I had none

143
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
How successful she was I would have been too nervous to

144
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,391
You know I saw a pretty girl like exactly exactly

145
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
But just as a as a heads up Delphine was always involved with me but she said she remained as an architect in a separate company for men

146
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327

Naked

148
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
But I must say

149
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,703
I could never have done any of this without her she's the

150
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
I see the the

151
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
The drowning that I need in life

152
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
And then so I have to credit

153
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
Fort Parkway those who haven't been to China

154
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199

160
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,815

161
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Everyone's influence body back

162
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,727
I was very very placed I grew up in a in a little town called knizner witch

163
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,847
I think it's probably one of the most beautiful corners of South Africa I went to a school it was

164
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
In the bush

165
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Let me know.

166
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663

00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943

172
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
9 years old

173
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Will you just dumped

174
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
In the bush with no parents no pictures no nothing

175
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,239
Like for me I'm formal come to always say to Delphine like when we in the countryside

176
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,567
I can never get you anywhere but put me in a shopping center

177
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
You know I think that

178
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,503
1 background influences you and in Africa

179
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
I don't know what I sent to find

180
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
African people tend to have a

181
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
An affinity to love and care for nature

182
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
So this is something at

183
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
It's very important to me now

184
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
In my life about

185
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,399
Not only what we've contributed to China and the way we build sustainable and operates

186
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Sustainably but now getting food

187
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
How we can perhaps use our influence

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
To help

189
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Save some of the animal problems that we're having

190
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
Yeah I think your background

191
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Always comes back to

192
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
How you draw a pig

193
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
If you done

194
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
If you can

195
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,367
If you experience that your whole life and then you come to some way with it isn't essentially any night chat

196
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
It's kind of obvious in stock

197
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
How difficult was

198
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Set free to start naked Resort

199
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
In China

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Wow at ya mean

201
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
The stories go on and on I mean it was never easy no businesses

202
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Was it

203
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Easy to to do what I did

204
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
I think there was a element of

205
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Look for me in the fact that I was at

206
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
African and a farmer

207
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
When you go out to

208
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
The countryside uniform is anywhere in the world are the same

209
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
But

210
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
I meant for me just dealing with

211
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
The farmers in Morgan Saint was

212
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
It's no different from dealing with a farmer's where I drop

213
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
So I don't have a great

214
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
Set of ego to Woodside

215
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
Maybe I have a big ego no Krishna

216
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,983
That looks like your Chinese name

217
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
I didn't give myself at night

218
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,527
The dead man was an air conditioner change my name

219
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
No

220
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
The thing is

221
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
It it Chinese real people

222
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
As long as you come down to

223
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
They label

224
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Drink baijiu

225
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Get to know them

226
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
B

227
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Genuine with them

228
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
They fall in love with you

229
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
You just like any other

230
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Rural people

231
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
So that was my

232
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
That was my

233
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
Benefit that other people didn't have

234
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
But having said that

235
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
What is go funding

236
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
UltraStar

237
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
Well that was interesting song permit

238
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Yeah

239
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Look

240
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
So we start small in China I think that's my advice to anyone get you grounding office result wasn't

241
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Very big was 21 room

242
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Skip

243
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
So we just needed a few million dollars it wasn't

244
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
That expensive

245
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
We did use some friends

246
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
To help

247
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Envestnet First Resort

248
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Animus

249
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
Tell you that was the first time I realize that I never want other

250
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,943
People's money I knew straight away like

251
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
They kept asking me like

252
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,551
So how's it going with the performance you going to give me a report and I said no

253
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
It's going fine and that's good enough

254
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,719
And then soon very soon I was like I don't want anything to do that so when we build

255
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Naked Stables Witcher

256
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
She's a huge

257
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Ambitious

258
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Just talk

259
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
I decided not to toot

260
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
To get any investors IU

261
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Used it

262
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
As the primary source of money

263
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,359
And I know it was the greatest thing I ever did because always see naked Stables we got a massive

264
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Unlock

265
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
We don't but I took a massive game

266
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
Very very

267
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Into

268
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Of course

269
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
Away from me that actually was in my account

270
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,191
You didn't use it

271
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
But anyway

272
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
How did you survive through that

273
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,615
Sneezy had a heart attack

274
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,431
Sears item by myocardial infarction

275
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
And I think

276
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Women entrepreneur

277
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Wind things

278
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
The worst

279
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Is that defines

280
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
Who you are and

281
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
I need money

282
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
What's up

283
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
Nothing else was going to solve my problem

284
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
So

285
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,375
I've been searching and I found two people that were willing to

286
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Blenders

287
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Loan shark money

288
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
28

289
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
I mean

290
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
Crazy stuff

291
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
I need it in a month

292
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
And they trusted they they looked me listen

293
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
You look

294
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,247
Trustworthy trustworthy I never had nothing to Leverage

295
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
Other than you know my smile

296
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,671
And I bet they help me out and Buzz

297
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Desperately wanted equity

298
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,767
Buzzfest

299
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
And then and then I made it through in it

300
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
I wish music

301
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
If I ever got the product finished

302
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
It would work

303
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,519
I proved that with the 21 RoomPlace 21 room place with David make money

304
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Island

305
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
Later in business in hotel business

306
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
That scale is

307
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Very very much

308
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
And them

309
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
So I knew it would work I just had

310
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
To get that I have to just

311
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Survive long enough

312
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Always been my mentor

313
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
To being an entrepreneur

314
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Stay alive

315
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
As long as you can

316
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
And if you stay alive

317
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Ultimately

318
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Come out of

319
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,423
I also wonder what people thought of your idea that time because

320
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,287
That concept of combining nature and luxury was pretty much unheard of in China

321
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
Luxury was like an oxymoron because

322
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
People Associated the Wilderness was like hardships and like peasants and it's there really think of that as what

323
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Like people with

324
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
The middle class would do right

325
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,487
Show me Rhapsody ride at least two sides like this my friends and mine best isn't they thought I was mad

326
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Everybody was a

327
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
Ron seriously what were you cannot gun for that amount of money

328
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
In the middle of nowhere

329
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
No one's going

330
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
End

331
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
It was a lot of that

332
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
To be honest I don't think they was

333
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
It was maybe one or two

334
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
People that

335
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Even gave me the

336
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Slices

337
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
They just wrote me off

338
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
And said this guy's nuts

339
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
If I didn't have much

340
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Unlike today

341
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,879
Sinuses is regarded as Resource Center

342
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,719
It was nothing any

343
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
You must know that

344
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
In my heart I knew that

345
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
People would need lifestyle but they would need to enjoy

346
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
But coming back to the

347
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
Consider that the idea of trying to keep

348
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
The natural

349
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Environmentally friendly and stuff like that

350
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
That wasn't

351
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Creative

352
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Marketing

353
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,527
Idea that was just because that's who Delphine and I are

354
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
If we have to build anything

355
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
It would be that way

356
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,207
So we can talk just to give you a context and when I took Delphine on honeymoon

357
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
It was in the Land Rover where we slept on the roof

358
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,119
Land Rover driving through Africa six countries in Africa

359
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Sleeping

360
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
With the Lions

361
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Amazing

362
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
And her parents

363
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,823
Come home, that was very very very upset with us

364
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Lego like

365
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
This is ridiculous

366
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,343
I don't think people understood in China but

367
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
But I did realize that I'll name

368
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
The Chinese name Luis

369
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
That's

370
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Helped every

371
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
Because in a way

372
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
No one at put those two characters

373
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
Heather before and when we did that occur

374
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
It kind of made a new word

375

377
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479

378
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Just was full

379
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
And I was like

380
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
All right

381
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135

And if our listeners who don't speak Chinese voice in me is naked heart

383
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559

384
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863

People different names

388
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
And there was a friend of ours you ask

389
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
He gave us those two characters

390
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639

391
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663

We did a survey across all company and no one liked it

393
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Except me

394
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063

395
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,135
I said that's the name and no other that's where we going

396
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
They would like not as terrible idea

397
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
To be fair she was

398
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
She was

399
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
She was ambivalent

400
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
To the idea she was like okay.

401
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,983
It's okay it's not okay but whatever you say will do that sir

402
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383

And always trying to use out trademark but

429
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
I guess that's been

430
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
We should be proud of that.

431
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
Or do I have it

432
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703

They must be having ships and giggles

443
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423

Started building that place I wasn't even City

451
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,447
I know but in a way I didn't deserve

452
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
That at that time I should be doing

453
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151

By Joe in those days was was it wasn't for me

460
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
It wasn't a scary thing it was like a necessity

461
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
The sum of those house with soap

462
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Cold in winter

463
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
My feet would be

464
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,959
Frozen and if I wasn't drinking goodbye Joe we would survive

465
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
The body was a full moon

466
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,847
Fuel to stay alive but

467
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
I got to know

468
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Old families

469
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
Getting

470
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,807
Horribly drunk and doing stupid things like shaving each other's hair off

471
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,391
One night I'll tell you a story I've been having this mess

472
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183

Skinny but strong

482
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
We started drinking and then

483
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,039
I realize that it was a ghost

484
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Everyone

485
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Sites like hidden away

486
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
In the forest

487
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
I said to him come you and me we're going to go to sleep

488
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Just the Two of Us

489
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
And you would like

490
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Scrapy

491
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
See you scared if I could get him there

492
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
We would resolve out

493
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,519
He would have to tell me show me it's fear or I would be able to look

494
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
You know like

495
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
Give him comfort and we might fight

496
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
As long as I get into the ghost

497
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Damn you

00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271

Kilauea family

501
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,696
We make a little fight inside the house in the middle of the house with no chimney

502
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
1 bit

503
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
And was broken

504
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560

Couldn't sleep

509
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
He was terrified

510
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
And I should have said

511
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
You want to go back home

512
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640

From then on we're best friends he thought I was a hero and I will probably tell you

515
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:49,440
That I'm I'm a Rockstar so that's how we solved our problems

516
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
Getting drunk and doing silly

517
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
So that's a great lessons for anybody from us

Do wasps bite you'll go to a ghost the haunted house

520
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
Before you talk about a naked have one more question

521
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
Back then

522
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Going to Mohegan Sun is like

523
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Picking out Las Vegas in the middle of nowhere

524
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Why won't

525
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
30 miles outside of

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,136
Ya Abdullah people things

527
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
This is like some

528
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
Decision was looking for was a place that was

529
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
Quiet

530
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Even more detailed

531
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,376
I'm looking for a place at the end of a road

532
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,168
So where they wouldn't be

533
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Sidibe

534
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
It's not a transient place

535
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
It's a place that you go to Anna

536
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
So my wife and I and my cicatriz

537
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Diamond and various people

538
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
I used to go on these like trips

539
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
Outside Shanghai just looking

540
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
A quiet place

541
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
To get off the main roads

542
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
All the signage and everything was in

543
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
In-N-Out

544
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:01,632
Chinese Chinese characters

545
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Beijing Jeep

546
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
So you know

547
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
It was quite

548
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,264
Trying to get off the Beaten Track

549
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Was never that easy

550
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,360
I'm so one of these trips actually took a bicycle

551
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,432
With a group called birdy bikes

552
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,248
And fortunately the guy was useless

553
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,112
And when we got lost we actually stumbled across this little village

554
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,440
Sanju which is on the Morgan Channel and I was like

555
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
The whole village

556
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Pretty much desert

557
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Did they was 12 old

558
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,608
And I just fell in love and I said this is it

559
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
I found it

560
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
And actually signed the lease that day

561
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
What's a lanai

562
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
Who is husband just passed away but

563
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
She was so happy that I was coming into

564
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
Shell House with it

565
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
Anderson

566
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
Business was just lonely sport elec

567
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Amazon on Old buildings

568
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Later on we ended up buying

569
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
The Landing

570
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
Jesse Melanson wasn't like some

571
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,720
And I'm like I win detail research on a slope for a quiet place

572
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Nantucket whale

573
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
Heartbroken

574
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,936
Traction did you gather for Nick a resort like I heard like the rooms are booked out all the time what kind

575
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Have people go there

576
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Yes

577
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
92% of all customers of Chinese

578
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,688
People don't realize that that mean we talked about naked knowing that you know is the word naked only lotion is really what is

579
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Famous

580
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
In China and that was always on

581
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
Emission put in the early early days

582
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Publix Gateway

583
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
Yeah my friends mine

584
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
Network somos Foreigner

585
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
No I've always believed no matter what you do

586
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
If you make a good product

587
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
Anyways good restaurant if you make good food

588
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,192
Yukon felt good food bodies really important

589
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
People mistake that

590
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Resort

591
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
It's about the experience

592
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
So it isn't about the room it isn't about

593
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
The food it's about

594
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
The actual experience

595
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
People sometimes forget that

596
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Pulteney place in China

597
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
I don't think the

598
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
That we have that good

599
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
At what we do

600
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
You think that everyone else is that bad

601
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
And because no one is actually bugs

602
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,304
Stop trying to back that nobody was trying to

603
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
But still today even

604
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,912
People voting results all the time

605
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
Connecting something to

606
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Famous

607
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
The part about like sex League

608
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
Experiences

609
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
They just build

610
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,456
Hotels in the mountains

611
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
This Is Random

612
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
But I think that that's going to make money

613
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,464
So let's talk about naked hot which is your co-working space

614
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,560
What motivated you to go into this space in the first place

615
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,400
Transitioning from luxury resort to a co-working

616
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,216
Yes I think the shed economy is something

617
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,056
It's always intrigued me I people don't realize but our results are actually

618
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
Like very much part of the shared economy

619
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,688
Very unusual from any Resort you'll see anywhere in the world

620
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Naked Stables

621
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
This is at

622
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,344
81 of 121 rooms are actually shared villas with multi

623
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Ballroom

624
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Meaning that people traveled as families

625
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
Groups of friends

626
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
And people are actually sharing it

627
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Something that

628
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
A lot of society

629
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Forget stuff

630
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,680
We used to do hundreds of years ago

631
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
Site to desktop

632
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
How people lived evil Georgia

633
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
People's homes Bo

634
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Travelin Man

635
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
And spend time with you

636
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
So that's kind of gone

637
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,920
And Donnie time we get together with people today seems to be in restaurant

638
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,736
But so when we did that it was kind of bringing people

639
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,576
Together and that intrigued me so

640
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
I wish I realized that

641
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
You know we could scale this business.

642
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,744
The coworking business very fast a tile design

643
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
Ideas my wife and I had we could

644
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
Maybe be more creative

645
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
And what we have more chance

646
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Do things end

647
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
To be very very Frank

648
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,472
Like

649
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
Co-working office Texas

650
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
3 months

651
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
To build

652
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,616
There was one

653
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
It's kind of like

654
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:01,760
Struggle with like getting satisfaction United like this feeling of like a

655
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
Oh yeah that's beautiful we've done it

656
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,600
It takes so long

657
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
Give this this is like

658
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Just right where we going to get

659
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
Real insta

660
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
Satisfaction instant gratification

661
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,656
People also thought I was crazy

662
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
Being so aggressive

663
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
In the early stages

664
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
But

665
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
We saw immediately that

666
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
The future was

667
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Was this

668
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,664
This idea but I didn't actually know the business that well

669
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
I just got jumped into it and then alone

670
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
On the job could you first heard about it elsewhere

671
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
And don't say we can do better

672
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
Yes

673
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
A friend of mine

674
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
She said I should we should do it and

675
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:49,120
But I really didn't explore what it was all about we just kind of played with one or two and then

676
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
Very quickly and people

677
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,472
And we enjoy doing it so it was

678
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
I could process

679
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,664
At that time where there a lot of other co-working spaces in China already

680
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
No and they still on

681
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Because I don't believe most of the people of dream coworker

682
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
But no they were they were I think 3Q Hadfield one play

683
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
That was pretty much

684
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
So does pretty early on

685
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Bahamas

686
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Call my mom

687
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Flipping jug just for

688
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Passaic City

689
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
This is

690
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
I think

691
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Coaching at San Vicente

692
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
Just so Random

693
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
The people think

694
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
It's spacing

695
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
And already lost in space

696
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Is so far from

697
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
Space

698
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
That

699
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
But no one in

700
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
China seems to get that

701
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Which is

702
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
Kind of random for me

703
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
And I

704
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
Even though I talk about it all the time and I've done interviews about it all the time Adam Newman speaks about it all the time.

705
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
Continue just to

706
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
To treat this is a

707
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,288
Likely strain Space Marines.

708
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
TCU what are the

709
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,688
Five things

710
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
What three things

711
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,784
That you had to get a ride to make your

712
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
A lot more popular

713
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
The most and alphabetics.

714
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,440
So the most

715
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
Is being able

716
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
Let your members

717
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Connect with each other

718
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Without being invasive

719
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
I do that

720
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
True physicals

721
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
So you'll designing of the

722
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
How do you trade

723
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
The common area

724
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
Where people feel

725
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
Comfortable to come together and meet each other

726
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,664
And that's really important

727
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
Essentially

728
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,504
Trying to break down the barriers

729
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,368
Jean company the more that companies can interact with each other more businesslike

730
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Which of the most successful

731
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
Standing up to smaller they can keep the company

732
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,512
Search by using other companies

733
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,840
To solve some of the problems

734
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
An end we see today

735
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
Like so many more smaller companies operating

736
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,312
This is the future is no question

737
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,664
Physical space the second part was the technology to allow p

738
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Outside of the

739
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,272
How can I promote my business How can I

740
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
Promoted William How can I

741
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
I connect with other people in members Etc

742
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,440
And that was the technology platform which Nobody Does by the way

743
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
Yeah we work an acre

744
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
Being in a very

745
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,096
Effective way we spend a lot of energy on that

746
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,656
And I think that the sad part is

747
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Scale

748
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
Realizing that

749
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,104
That you can run this as a moment pop operation joint like a hood

750
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Credit union network

751
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Exactly so

752
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Yunnan Hotel

753
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,832
If you don't have enough rooms you'll never make money unless you are a home operated like

754
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
The mom and pop breakfast exactly

755
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
So this is the same

756
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
If you really want

757
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
The sexy Gap have

758
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
Huge ambitious

759
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,352
To change and then realize that you are a solution

760
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,632
Orlando

761
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
You are not renting from them

762
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
But you have to do

763
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,080
Just like a hotel no one's going to sign a management agreement with you if you haven't done it before

764
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
So you have to invest to earn money

765
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,968
Spices and then the landlord realized we don't have to

766
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:20,320
To be compared that we can work together so that's what happens today

767
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
We just find manager

768
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
But you have to prove

769
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
That's what

770
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,768
I read these stories in the internet constantly like you know

771
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Aren't you

772
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Exposed

773
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
HELOC what happens if the rental market changes in

774
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
You know suddenly you know

775
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
Global rent

776
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
When that hurt you

777
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
But it wouldn't

778
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
Be significant because most of the deals we do on linked

779
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
2

780
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Yunnan

781
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
Liability of rent

782
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
Reckon partner

783
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
Fight between

784
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
Sucks those are the factors that really

785
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Most

786
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
I'll praise Duncan

787
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
And you have to be a good part at the same time

788
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
People the Wonder Man

789
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
If you are eight

790
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
You clearly a guy was just in

791
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
For the short-term

792
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Big landlords

793
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
No you're not.

794
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,496
So for you did you take out some money this time

795
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
Your descale cooker

796
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:16,384
Will Sonny this I didn't choose random

797
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,784
I'm so firstly we invested heavily by self

798
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
We've had some law

799
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
I'll positive cash flow

800
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
Antutu running this business

801
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
And then in

802
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
We did Abby wrong

803
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,280
I would have pushed I'm by the way I've never done

804
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
Equity fundraising round in my life

805
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
And I might

806
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Repotted

807
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,216
But in the beer and we did a

808
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Convertible

809
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,080
Note right eye with the go capital and

810
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Trustbridge

811
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
And another company email

812
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
And

813
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,456
And so these guys

814
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,552
We were imminently about to close I'll see round which was in

815
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Was was finally

816
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
Inequity like finally

817
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
How to use a big round it was

818
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
Big valuation in

819
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,048
That's when we work stepped in

820
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:11,168
And so the guys that were in the beer and they had the opportunity to convert

821
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,240
Just an hour before the transaction

822
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Husband

823
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,336
So is effectively speaking you can say that that be round was a

824
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Account

825
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Only for one hour

826
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
You know that

827
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
I am old-fashioned

828
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,368
But I really don't like the idea that entrepreneurs

829
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
The throne money

830
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,208
I buy in distance I think it's

831
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Afloat

832
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Thing

833
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
It's work for a lot of company

834
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,352
Lots of cameras

835
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,888
I think entrepreneur

836
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Should have

837
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,960
More skin in the game

838
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,776
I think the other one profitable business

839
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,592
They should come with a LifeStraw

840
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
You know really

841
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
Black feel what it's like

842
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Imminently bankrupt

843
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:00,576
That's what I want to see more entrepreneurs like today in China

844
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,600
Disguising

845
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Get other people

846
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Anyway that's

847
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
I'm old-fashioned

848
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Got it

849
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:12,864
And I know I'd I can honestly now I don't need to do fuse other people's money so it's fine

850
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,912
So I'm good I'm done with

851
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
It's holy

852
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Using alipay

853
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,288
But I thought you were in a race around and expand

854
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:26,688
So you know technically yeah with the mudra I am no longer executively involved

855
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Didn't make it home

856
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,016
I'm on the board my wife and I

857
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
Will continue to advise

858
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
And we are hoping on this

859
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
Fundraising round.

860
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,976
But it's not my company Tinashe holder

861
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
I'm just not.

862
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
I'm not the alpha male anymore

863
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,656
I know one has to listen to me I can bring

864
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
You know advice

865
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
On the direction

866
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
So what punk music

867
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Do Duster

868
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Look

869
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,224
Operating that there is only good at projecting the division in the

870
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
The bread.

871
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Yeah what you doing

872
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Look

873
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
This business

874
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,648
We were going to what competing on two fronts

875
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
We compete

876
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
Appropriate position

877
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,536
So where we making these deals with various landlords

878
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,840
And that hurts on the one side

879
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,144
And with we fighting for the same custom

880
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
You know

881
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Normal competition is healthy

882
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Between companies

883
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,824
When you competing literally on

884
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
Two friends

885
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
The same company

886
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
And that company

887
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
Has a lot of other people's money

888
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,576
I knew that they really

889
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,160
Didn't care about how much they lose you heard me

890
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
And I've seen enough story

891
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
China news

892
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Scene

893
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
I also

894
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,800
I had a good connection with Adam we met

895
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
He made a big

896
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
He should have

897
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Taking me out two years

898
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:08,320
A whole bunch of uber as well

899
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
And so

900
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
He

901
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:15,488
You know I like where you was going and honestly we work had the same

902
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Ideas of

903
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,840
Yes really you guys are very like we just

904
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,472
Let the money making on the real estate wanted to figure out

905
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
How to solve a bigger penis

906
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
Hillsborough clerk

907
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
So

908
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,152
You know we had a very very strong

909
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,200
Technology team hair design team in

910
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Hospitality Street things we were

911
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
It didn't happened

912
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
Nnnn

913
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Realized

914
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Hospitality as much

915
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,744
So we brought that hospital to take ideas

916
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
We haven't

917
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,096
And just good partnership and I'm very very

918
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
I think we did

919
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Exactly the right thing

920
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
For the success

921
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
The bug company

922
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,288
Do you not stay in operation V clearly with their balance

923
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,848
I'm not employable

924
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,136
Will end in inches everyone will be unhappy

925
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:20,512
I see the Moda or just some of it will just not worry about yourself

926
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,352
I knew this many many many years ago that's why I became an entrepreneur

927
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Go back to school

928
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,496
I need anyone to tell me anything

929
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:36,896
Maybe I should just say hey Grant would you please go and do that I just wanted to tell me

930
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
So I was like okay I'm really bad at

931
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,272
Being told what to do.

932
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,320
I know that that one work but

933
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,368
I still have a big role to play and we were

934
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
And I don't know

935
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,488
What exactly that's going to be and how that's going to happen but

936
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,280
I believe in this industry

937
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,584
And I really believe in what we doing

938
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:01,472
So you know I will find a way to something besides Resorts and co-working space

939
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
What will be a surprise

940
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
Yeah.

941
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,152
I am very passionate about something

942
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
A big big problem

943
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Huge problem

944
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
That I want to solve

945
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Which is on

946
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
Which is the fact

947
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
The teachers the worst

948
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
Until I Bean

949
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
Exploring this a lot

950
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,840
I've been thinking about this a lot I spend most of my awake I was thinking about this problem

951
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
I tell people

952
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Sometimes that

953
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
100

954
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,776
50 years ago when you went to University didn't go to university

955
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
Because it was the name of the University

956
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Hobbits

957
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,896
You went there was a professor that you wanted to study under

958
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Yep and

959
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
You know when you

960
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
When you let her go

961
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Fishing it was someone he told you fishing off

962
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,808
Riding a bicycle cost

963
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
Everything was about teachers

964
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Lost

965
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
Today they are the whisper people

966
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,304
So I'm we have this concept kuebler

967
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Which is

968
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,912
The idea of it is trying to reverse that and make teachers

969
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
Fundamentally don't

970
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Revista

971
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,824
And make the University

972
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Hiya

973
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,640
The teachers on

974
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,432
Consulting basis employment

975
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
And if I can find a way to make

976
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Good teacher

977
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,136
Just go up to the top and go down to the bottom system

978
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
I believe we can

979
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
We can make

980
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
The most wealth

981
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,816
In the world this is obviously potential Global business

982
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,864
What would face one look

983
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
So we've already tested face

984
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,984
We tested in a very small narrow area and Wellness

985
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Yoga teacher

986
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
That was an area where I could

987
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,200
Explore the idea of simple and narrow and Edibles amazing control

988
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,760
Teacher to make 20 times more money than they can

989
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
20 time

990
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:56,160
Electricity in China in Shanghai

991
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,512
Russia we never said that's the area of microcosm built the soft they rolled it up

992
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Bulla

993
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
And the teacher that used to work for

994
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Wine glass

995
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Studio

996
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
That on our platform

997
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
Let make 20 times more

998
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
20 times more money

999
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Tulsa possible what's simple

1000
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:19,200
The institutions of today make all the money I mean by the institution is

1001
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
The Hobbit

1002
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Not the school

1003
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
The Wine Place

1004
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
Peach the OnePlus

1005
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
Studio

1006
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
Someone had the money

1007
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
To rent

1008
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,256
Space just put it out make it pretty

1009
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
I need used and abused

1010
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,376
The teachers who actually the hero

1011
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
And why the teacher isn't the hero

1012
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,520
No one remembers that teaches Toyota have co-working Space 2

1013
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,568
Co-working space

1014
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
Do help having that space

1015
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
Espaces everywhere you just don't realize it

1016
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
So we found

1017
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Spaces

1018
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Think think

1019
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
Hotels

1020
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
The gems and

1021
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,208
Restaurant so you need a technology platform that allows the booking of those things

1022
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:07,072
Exactly

1023
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
It's so much space

1024
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,936
Investor in a company

1025
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
Yeah you do

1026
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
When I get to Round Rock

1027
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,600
I really believe it needs a lot more thinking and I'm

1028
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,160
I'm I really want to figure out

1029
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
Quesadillas

1030
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,536
A small at the beginning now I think

1031
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,816
I can really disrupt

1032
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Everything

1033
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Can you have Juno help

1034
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,936
Deep teaching.

1035
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
The key Things Are

1036
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,288
The space and hyperspace you got to have a $2

1037
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:52,128
You got to have the industry relationship

1038
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
EasyBib

1039
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,503
So now I have for anyone else

1040
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,831
That is not easy yeah I have a lot of space around the week

1041
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
Second largest

1042
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:07,231
Can we water on have more more services

1043
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
They don't want to speed in renting space

1044
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Exactly

1045
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
That they're my company

1046
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
How are you spending your time these days how do you split your time between this

1047
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
MS project

1048
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
We are naked harbin naked

1049
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,503
Yeah so we still have this integration going on between the two companies not an emergency Z

1050
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
Yeah this is a challenging time

1051
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,879
We're in a lot of emotions happen if

1052
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
People feel nervous and

1053
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,999
Stop saw so I'm still playing an active role there

1054
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,351
Supporting a little bit on wework

1055
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,423
I'm doing this fundraising round way I can help

1056
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215

00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:53,567
I am well quite a new number of new resorts on the development so I spend

1058
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,919

1059
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
On the monster planning side

1060
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
With only people that can do that

1061
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Looking at

1062
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,807
How the result

1063
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Will XD

1064
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
And I look like so we still involved in that

1065
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,207
And then I'm spending a lot of time thinking about bullying

1066
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,047
And I'm building a team

1067
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447

1070
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431

00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
The

1084
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
Laa London

00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
I don't know how I'm gonna

1091
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
But I know that

1092
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
That's what I'm good at. I'm good at navigating

1093
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
The things that other people don't know how to do

1094
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
So we have for investments in LA

1095
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Isaac rubbing

1096
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,639
My mother still lives there

1097
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
Battalion

1098
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Good for lifestyle message

1099
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Brands

1100
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Media

1101
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:42,623
Ecommerce Resort in Napa

1102
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,183
Cold naked mapa

1103
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
And

1104
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,231
Coming soon

1105
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
What's the space

1106
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
We trying to pick up some of that

1107
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
Cheap land that was burned

1108
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,679
Bring it back

1109
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
Sounds good

1110
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,543
I've been to the naked hub

1111
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:05,663
Headquarters in Shanghai I felt like it was kind of very different from other co-working spaces of

1112
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:12,063
Been to there a lot of, areas like event spaces where people can get together there's like a food court

1113
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
Turn on the first floor

1114
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,903
For listeners who haven't been could you like give like

1115
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,487
Dislike a visual description of what naked hops look like and how

1116
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
They're different

1117
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:26,399
Yeah so I think the one area we we had the confidence in the carriage was

1118
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,215
To create that common space will it shed space

1119
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,519
Essentially a co-working

1120
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
Environment should

1121
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Triple five

1122
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Functions that you share

1123
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
When is the kitchen

1124
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
You know Siri

1125
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,735
Coffee area the other one is the living room

1126
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,575
We call a meeting rooms or Workshop spaces

1127
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
Hotels

1128
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
And then in the wellness

1129
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Spaces

1130
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
These

1131
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
We end up

1132
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
Using about 30% of all

1133
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
GFA

1134
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
Of the total area of a building

1135
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
Inputting into sheds by stats

1136
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,423
About double what must I do

1137
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Chinese Club leader

1138
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,543
But in order to do that you have to have the belief that you can sell

1139
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:10,175
Nothing like a hot day is productive and that we have another protocol naked agar

1140
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:15,039
Where people will be willing to to to pay increments small increments

1141
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Money on you

1142
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
People to use this

1143
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,183
And that's what we proved and we were very successful at that and

1144
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,791
I think the future will look more and more like that respect cuz it's so much more fish

1145
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Yusuf

1146
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Space

1147
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,167
And people don't realize but commercial Office Space

1148
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Is

1149
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
The most inefficient

1150
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,751
Thing in the world

1151
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,823
We normal office will use

1152
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
20 square meters

1153
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Per person

1154
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,455
I will use about 5 so we can reduce a file

1155
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,343
75% reduction on on space and think of how much less construction you have

1156
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
How much less space would be

1157
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,487
Actually being used meeting rooms in traditional office

1158
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,303
I'll just so inefficient like you'd like

1159
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,583
9%

1160
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,887
Of the month the room is being

1161
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
But that's not all

1162
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
That's not good use of space is not environment

1163
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Friendly's

1164
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
So I think naked was always trying to

1165
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
To figure out these

1166
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
Set of environmental questions

1167
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,455
At the core of what we were trying to do

1168
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
And through that you have to have

1169
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Courage

1170
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Conviction

1171
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
To to make that s*** space

1172
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,183
I'm very interested in new product that you are offering naked Hub go

1173
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:31,583
Hot dads step can be rented by the hours so users can see the available locations on a WeChat Mini

1174
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
Programs just like how they can view available bikes

1175
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
On a bike sharing app

1176
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,495
And they can pay by the hour and then enjoy free coffee

1177
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,079
I personally think there's a lot of demand for a flexible spaces like this

1178
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,223
Because people are always struggling to find suitable places to do a couple of hours of work in between meetings in the city

1179
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
So how did you come up with this

1180
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Idea

1181
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,831
Yes

1182
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:59,487
Very much a product person that's how I think every day but it's by the minute by the way not by the hour

1183
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:04,863
And the idea

1184
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Random space

1185
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,703
But for me it was more of a an Enterprise solution

1186
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,775
So companies especially large multinational

1187
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
They

1188
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,663
They trap they they will have offices with your inherent in one

1189
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:22,783
Location in the city and the city is a big place and get commuting around the city can take you out

1190
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
Open amount of time

1191
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
LOL hope

1192
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Who is that

1193
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,927
Multinationals will be able to do Society offices

1194
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Bible

1195
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
And then start to use a platform like this would have

1196
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
You know that

1197
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,583
50 different offices in one city

1198
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
I'm

1199
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
The idea really stems from

1200
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,727
What we see today in consumerism where people are buying

1201
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Things on smoking

1202
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
Just buy what I need

1203
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
End

1204
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,895
A novice T-Mobile can and the bike sharing apps

1205
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,455
Excellent. But so was Airbnb

1206
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
Subways

1207
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
Didi and Uber

1208
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
And what we've learned is that

1209
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Technology

1210
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Define essential

1211
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,231
Became a new tool for us to be able to do singers

1212
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
And without that

1213
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
We couldn't do this

1214
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,119
And the thing is just no one realized that this was

1215
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
Nothing that could be done

1216
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
We love it

1217
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,775
Become hugely successful with literally in pay the face

1218
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
Beta testing area balance

1219
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,103
It's like going through the roof

1220
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
I think we sign

1221
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
More

1222
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,711
Naked Hub go members and react

1223
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
He have

1224
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Real members

1225
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
And then we did that in

1226
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,463
But not not not surprised it is it is insanely cool obviously we will

1227
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Extremely lucky

1228
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Do you have a

1229
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
Done the steelbook

1230
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,655
If I had done the deal little bit late I could have got even more because naked hub goes

1231
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
Sex faces is God real

1232
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,471
Real traction

1233
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,775
And when you roll that out across

1234
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,823
The globe on on the Wii with platform

1235
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,431
It will be massive

1236
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,063
That's how you get people into the system and then you start

1237
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,671
Did you arrive out of revenue streams truck the real estate is never the future

1238
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,951
Betty

1239
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,511
Entry point

1240
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,071
The landlord collect the money on the register

1241
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,143
How to make a revenue stream

1242
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
Not utilized

1243
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,239
And there's so many service in Lyon top executive designer

1244
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,591
And and we always say this to develop is like we don't want to be in competition with you

1245
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,407
You guys are good at what you do but you carry on doing that

1246
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,015
And I will get there

1247
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Buy wework

1248
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
Kentucky naked and so

1249
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
These kind of products

1250
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Will make people

1251
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
Pokemon Mall

1252
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,559
More concert to UCB we're rolling out making up go to other places absolutely

1253
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,839
Shanghai is going to be at 8

1254
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,911
A testing ground for Lord of new products.

1255
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
We developed

1256
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
And then they were all in my

1257
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,239
On the way with platform

1258
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,775
So we we've got

1259
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:58,175
50 60 70 Engineers not working here in Shanghai in Rowena scale-up mm

1260
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
Engineers

1261
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,991
Focusing on product development

1262
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
You know how we can bring more

1263
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Solutions

1264
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,855
To the general

1265
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
Person on the street

1266
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
And by the way

1267
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
The first 15 minutes of

1268
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,975
Free when you walk in the naked hub

1269
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
You scan like and you get

1270
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
So you can let you get a taste of it

1271
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:21,215
They're going to have a beer in a coffee and walk out and pay nothing

1272
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,079
And I figured out that if you're a good be a consumer

1273
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,407
Then you can do the make a you can get drunk really quickly

1274
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,479
Without meaning to pay much money

1275
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
So students are highly recommended

1276
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:42,463
What will be your top advice for other non-chinese entrepreneurs who want to start businesses in China

1277
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,767
I think

1278
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,327
Most of the same things that you tell

1279
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
Entrepreneurs anywhere in the world

1280
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
Butts

1281
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,263
The most of the best advice but no one Chinese yeah okay I would say respect

1282
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
And learn from

1283
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,847
Do not have the arrogance

1284
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
2

1285
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,919
Thing that you know more that you know more

1286
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
Just so common for me

1287
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,991
Just seen foreigners do that

1288
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
The last 15 years

1289
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,927
And it's just so dumb cuz I just don't listen they don't take the time to actually try and understand what the the local guys are trying to

1290
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,975
I think that that

1291
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
What's the right word

1292
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,399
Presumptuous surrounding

1293
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:28,031
Bikes

1294
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,359
Do you know more

1295
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
I'm here

1296
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,223
I think that's my great

1297
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:44,159
Like icon think I'm better than anyone so would like at the lowest rung of like the low wrong things

1298
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,535
So yeah and learn from China and

1299
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
Enjoy it embrace it

1300
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
I actually really

1301
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,655
Localizer

1302
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,959
So many foreigners

1303
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:01,567
I'll do that that if you don't get it in the first you need done localized just leave

1304
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
Cuz you never gain

1305
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Paw Patrol

1306
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:10,015
As you know in China new retail is a buzzword started in

1307
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
January 2017

1308
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,855
And you also see a lot of

1309
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Amanda

1310
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,207
Snack shelves convenience stores a lot of stuff

1311
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,791
What's on my who's believer in the share economy and human connection

1312
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
How do you feel about that

1313
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,375
Trend that supposedly have

1314
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,679
I think it's the start of another

1315
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,727
I don't think that is exactly the

1316
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Dissolution

1317
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Going to see is going

1318
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,079
But it's going to be the thing that helps us learn

1319
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,639
Call retailer

1320
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
Is in a major major

1321
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
The whole

1322
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
And pure online is known as

1323
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,855
Walmart

1324
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,439
And this kind of unmanned retail is also not

1325
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,719
Perfect solution

1326
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Aimbot

1327
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
We are consumers

1328
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
Human beings

1329
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,351
Consumers

1330
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,887
Annie's to be a

1331
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:04,799
We just need to learn what it looks like shopping malls where are not at High Street stores at High Street

1332
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,871
Shops.on not at bat

1333
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
You know

1334
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
I think this

1335
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
New

1336
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
Retail idea is

1337
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,551
Is a stepping

1338
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
Stone in the direction

1339
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,623
If you're not drunk

1340
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
And you like the

1341
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Industry I think it's

1342
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,463
To think more about it

1343
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,999
I think it's going to be a lot more innovation

1344
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
In that area

1345
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
Me personally

1346
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,119
Phantom retail so

1347
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
I'm not thinking about

1348
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,215
But I think about services

1349
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,311
You think about experiences exactly

1350
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,663
For my children to my children children

1351
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,223
It's just wrong if I the worst place

Looking for the worst people in the world

1353
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
They're going to be the worst

1354
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
In the bathroom

1355
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,511
Really bad there for society and you even for to spend time and doing something that's impactful that's something

1356
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,791
Do you believe in God

1357
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
Exactly and Retail

1358
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:06,751
