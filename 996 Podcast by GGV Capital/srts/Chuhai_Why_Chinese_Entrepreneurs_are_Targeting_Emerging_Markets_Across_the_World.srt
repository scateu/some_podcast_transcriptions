00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
I'm tired of Technology

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,016
Imagine a 96 Park house but in Chinese

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,344

00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
A China for past 20 years

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:22,176
My name is Sarah Jeong an investment Analyst at ggv Capital and a former journalist

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
Why is the show called 96

22
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
6 is the work schedule than any Chinese Founders have organically adopted that is 9 a.m.

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
KTM 6 days a week

24
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
To us

25
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
996 captures intensity Drive in speed of Chinese internet companies many which

26
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,680
Are moving faster they even their American counterparts

27
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,592
Hi everyone on this episode we're going to continue our new series where Hans and I will talk about

28
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
A topic of Interest currently

29
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
So today we wanted to cover

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
A phenomenon cultural High which literally means

31
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Going overseas

32
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,648
Ides phenomena of Chinese on printers targeting emerging markets around the world

33
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,232
Soe hunts and I and I didn't igbt

34
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
A team has a paying attention to this

35
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Trend

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
For a long time now

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
I recently relocated

38
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,472
To the Beijing investment team and I've seen it with my own eyes how

39
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:22,592
So many of the Stardust we're seeing these days are in this category we're Chinese entrepreneurs

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
Are going outside of China

41
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Target

42
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,248
Consumers and users in Emerging Markets like southeast Asia India

43
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
Russian America in even app

44
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,136
And if you look heavy App Store ranking is Humana Emerging Markets

45
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Many of the top ranking

46
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
E-commerce and social apps are actually developed by Chinese

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
So Hans when did you start

48
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
To realize

49
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
That's what high or Chinese companies

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
Going overseas could be a big arch

51
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm probably the first DC in the world that coined the phrase

52
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Is too high

53
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
That was back in

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
2013

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
I think I saw a few things

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
That happened

57
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
It 2012

58
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
That made me decide that

59
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
This area

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Chinese company

61
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Expanding overseas

62
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
WSU jobs

63
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Opportunity for next

64
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Three things happen

65
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,440
That get me to send 3 data point

66
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Give me the sunset

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
This could be a

68
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Emergency

69
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
One WeChat came out in 2011

70
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
The product is so wealthy

71
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
You feel that

72
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Product. At least canx

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Respond to rest

74
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
Malaysia

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Awesome China

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
And over the next

77
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
18 months

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
You start to hop

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Which I was willing

80
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Make a push

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Into Taiwan and Southeast Asia

82
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
In India what

83
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Your today is doing well in some of these

84
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Including India

85
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
70 and a half

86
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
That caught my attention

87
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Was a xiaomi

88
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,232
I was part of the xiaomi team that try to

89
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
As early investing xiaomi

90
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Need help xiaomi

91
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Kookaburra

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
To leave Google

93
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Join xiaomi

94
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
And this happened in

95
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
2013

96
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
And we start talking

97
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
2

98
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
To go as early as 2012

99
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
And

100
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
The fact that he was willing to leave

101
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Does head of product for Android

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
To join xiaomi

103
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Was a seminal event

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
I think not only for xiaomi

105
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Before Chinese tech industry

106
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
Which you have an established Talent

107
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Train overseas

108
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
Community Emerging Markets aarhus

109
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Osborne Brazil

110
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Between Chinese company

111
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
And do these days

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
I think his followers

113
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
Sina weibo

114
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
I'll number is followers on

115
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
So that was a second thought was

116
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Chinese handset

117
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
Claire can expand

118
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Feel the market

119
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
32 point I was in

120
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
Adjusting was Alibaba was Act

121
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Always a part of

122
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
SoftBank in

123
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Japan

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
Also looking at

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Expansion investment opportunities

126
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
In Southeast Asia

127
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Which culminated

128
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
With them their investment in the future Act

129
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Lazada

130
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,279
And that wasn't just thought about it until you said other companies have been trying

131
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Odoo e-commerce

132
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
And most recently with by 10

133
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
Expecting to social networking Beyond China at

134
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
So starting in 2012

135
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
These few data points

136
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Give me the sun side

137
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
The Chinese Interceptor have to come through

138
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Fourth generation of Founders already

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
The Mount of learning.

140
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Accumulated

141
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
And a China is bullying

142
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
Countrywood for 5 tier cities

143
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,415
It was really nothing that's happening elsewhere in the world

144
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
That doesn't have a similar condition

145
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,511
Somewhere in China already a month

146
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
So I thought the Chinese company

147
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
When's the tea become more globalized

148
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Anderson

149
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Uncultured

150
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Better half

151
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Skill set

152
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
And a requisite knowledge

153
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
I'll probably

154
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Skill and build it into

155
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Internet companies

156
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Awesome

157
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
So that was the

158
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
The key reason why I decide to move

159
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Back to the Bay Area

160
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
From Beijing

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
And have been doing Investments

162
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
In this area ever since

163
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
Jennifer last few months

164
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
Just from talking with a lot of

165
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
Other receipts

166
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:55,071
Some people in the circle ice have a palpable sense that people saying mobile internet

167
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,935
Penetration in China has pretty much reached saturation so it's very

168
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
Hard to have that kind of exponential growth that we saw

169
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
Maybe a decade ago

170
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
And that's another reason

171
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Push a lot of Chinese entrepreneurs

172
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:13,503
To go outside of China to other markets where Mobile Internet is just starting to take off

173
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
I think back in 2013 I get a calculation

174
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Not Chinese

175
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
Smartphone users internet users roughly around

176
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
300 million

177
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Pcna users with roughly about

178
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
600 million

179
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
And over the next 5-6 years

180
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Both were we supposed

181
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Situation

182
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
And then when the world number you know users

183
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Expendable 3

184
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
4 billion

185
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,079
The next 2 billion will have to come also the US and China

186
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
Specifically Southeast Asia

187
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
India

188
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Naughty America

189
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
So it doesn't take a rocket scientist

190
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
You know where to pay attention

191
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
At some point in the future

192
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
This trim

193
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
Will come if that's out of 10 is internet founder

194
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Are ready

195
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
You take on the Opera

196
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,119
I remember he also said before that you can't imagine Chinese entrepreneurs moving to Jakarta

197
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
But it's hard to imagine American Founders kuwada

198
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Go all the way there why do you think that's the

199
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
I think you may have the knowledge of what do internet

200
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Space but

201
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
It's very difficult to go after Emerging Markets

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
From your home City

203
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
Guess it's time zone differences

204
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
And lack of interaction lockup

205
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Field what's happening on the

206
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
Street makes you less effect

207
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
By remote controlling it

208
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
I'm back home

209
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
So to be effective

210
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Chinese Founders or American founder

211
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Have to be willing to

212
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Bedtime Emoji mark

213
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
A look at where the American Founders are willing to go

214
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
What's some people to

215
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
RBC Canada

216
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
UK

217
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Parts of Western Europe

218
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Australia New Zealand

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Tool Essex and even Singapore

220
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Are places that people willing to go

221
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
EZ moving family to

222
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
It takes a lot more commitment

223
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Ask people to go to Jakarta

224
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
2 KL or even two different parts of

225
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
I'm tryna get along even South America

226
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Lotto America in Alpha

227
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
So just by

228
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Easy takes

229
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
To move around

230
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
NYX heart of American company

231
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
To expand globally

232
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
And look for the Chinese founders

233
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
You can see people

234
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,055
Working in Southeast Asia living in India

235
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,383
Will you be moving to and traveling to Latin America

236
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
He started singing all about doing stuff in Africa

237
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
So there more places than the Chinese founders

238
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
And teams are willing to go to and move to

239
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
And not make Gibson advantage

240
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Compete on the globe

241
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
So why do you think

242
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
We say that Emerging Markets will look

243
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
Palomar lights

244
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
China than the US

245
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Us mobile internet

246
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Take selfies

247
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,751
We look at a GDP per capita in India Indonesia is roughly about $3,000

248
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Per person per year

249
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
Amy look at gdp per capita for Latin America

250
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
New Mexico

251
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
And Brazil is roughly about 9000 10000

252
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Per person

253
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
15 years ago when we start active investing China

254
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
GDP per capita roughly about 3000

255
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
And that's kind of where

256
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Indonesia and India

257
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Are today

258
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,487
And look at Chinese that GDP per capita today

259
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Is roughly about 9000

260
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Comparable to Mexico and Brazil

261
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
So it's very difficult for emerging-market just

262
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Copy a model from us

263
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
And try to

264
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Localizer

265
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,311
Because the stage of development is different for different countries

266
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
China spend the first 10 years copy models from

267
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
From us

268
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
We had to do so much more

269
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Customization innovation

270
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
To make it work

271
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
For emerging markets

272
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Alibaba

273
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Intensity tennis shoes look like

274
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
AOL

275
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Icq messenger

276
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
And eBay

277
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,071
But over the first 10 years of Chinese in the history both become very different

278
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Companies instead

279
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Because

280
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Chinese market is very different

281
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
Users have different needs

282
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,263
So as a result we feel that Chinese consumers

283
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
I've trained the Chinese founders

284
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
And companies

285
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,895
To be able to deal with other Emerging Markets better as

286
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
At the same time

287
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,759
That the Chinese teams in general or less International lights

288
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
That's the European and American team

289
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
In general Chinese seems grasp of English

290
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
And Hall

291
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
Global UI

292
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Is quite different

293
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
So

294
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
The Chinese things also need to add more Talent

295
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,655
That are more globalized to help them to leverage and I'll let you know if I'm trying to ask

296
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,775
To some extent we also feel that the Chinese company should have woken up in the mistakes made by American come

297
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
They should be more willing to make

298
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Minority investor

299
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Or controlling Investments

300
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Into local companies

301
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
And help them to become local champions

302
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
At the end of the day

303
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,111
If American team or Chinese team are more willing to transfer knowledge they know

304
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
And Empower local founders

305
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Do more

306
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
That's usually the formula

307
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
That works out better

308
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
You look at that Chinese companies

309
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Such as

310
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Alibaba

311
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
They took investment from Yahoo

312
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,727
They work well with some of Yahoo detective such as that Jerry Yang

313
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
And

314
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,383
That helped them to be able to give out a desertion and focus on Innovation more in the whole Market

315
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
So if the Chinese company's annual can you want to do that

316
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,807
With local champions in Latin America southeast Asia and India

317
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
I think I'm going a long run

318
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
That will creep bigger outcome

319
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Together

320
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,255
Emerging Markets across the world are starting to look at Chinese company

321
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Instead of Silicon Valley once for

322
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
Inspiration so I think this month alone

323
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
We have

324
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Nat or heard of

325
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
Dependable of India. Hotel for a southeast Asia the maze

326
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
White wine for turkey that means you for India the alley pay

327
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Pay for Africans

328
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,175
51 credit for Brazil etcetera

329
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Just look at

330
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
That unicorn

331
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
Southeast Asia pretty much all of them are kind of modeled after a Chinese

332
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Tech Giants

333
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Seoul Korea is like tencent

334
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,487
Tokopedia and Lazada are like Alibaba gojackets like

335
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
Make wine and grab is like the

336
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
And travel OKC

337
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Wuxi trip and a lot of these

338
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
Chinese companies have actually invested

339
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Andy's coming

340
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
He's as well

341
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
So do you think

342
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
China offers a much better

343
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Model T replica

344
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Sephora for these markets

345
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
What do they need to pay attention to

346
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
When they try to draw inspiration

347
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,807
That's exactly right let him know story when I was

348
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
Investing in China back in 2011-12

349
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
B12

350
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Introduced to a company in India called a stop

351
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
And back then they were e-coupon clone

352
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
Dad trying to find an Express model

353
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
And I talked to them about

354
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Call ball

355
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Tmall and JD

356
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
The end up picking

357
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Tmall as a model

358
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
Even though I thought about would be a better fit for

359
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
And then does not become like a flipped car

360
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
They also put a small amount of money answer

361
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Through another fund

362
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Both are personal best

363
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
If we park

364
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,599
I sense become so the Amazon Indians

365
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Got sold to Walmart

366
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
So

367
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,231
As early as 2011 2012 you started already see

368
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Some of the Emerging Markets

369
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
The company is coming to

370
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
Chinatown to learn about

371
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
What the Chinese companies have done in the PC era

372
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Examples you cited

373
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
Where some examples of helping the mobile in Terraria

374
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,847
Go to the PC desktop internet error as well as the mobile internet error

375
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
Alesia lhasa 8 years

376
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
A lot of Thunders from

377
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Southeast Asia

378
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
India coming through China

379
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Twice a year

380
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Sometimes more

381
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
And what's amazing is that it's not just now the founders are

382
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
Comped even a VC's have

383
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
The top be seized from both southeast Asia and India

384
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Have come to Beijing and Shanghai

385
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
And sometimes they know our portfolio

386
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Even better

387
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
That's some of our peers in China

388
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
It's amazing how much you willing to study

389
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
In the amount of knowledge they have

390
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
Annapolis kind of statistic question we asked

391
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
Reminds us a lot about what a Chinese visa

392
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
15 years ago

393
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
Look at what has happened in the US

394
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
Tell me she's a bad business of recognizing patterns

395
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
How to recognize

396
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
And it's just very

397
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Inches into us

398
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
That one is happening 10

399
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
15 years ago

400
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Is repeating that these other Market

401
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
And what do they have pay attention to

402
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,679
I think that everyone should have cycle of innovation and growth

403
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
You still through certain places

404
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Initial phases

405
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
Just try to copy the model S work elsewhere

406
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,871
In overtime as the local teams gain more experience in

407
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Confidence is to realize that

408
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Some of the problems that are solving are coming

409
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
What's happening in different parts of China

410
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Blessing time they are going to be

411
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Material definition

412
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
And so when they are different

413
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
How do you apply the differences

414
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Any to your advantage

415
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
And Leverage What You Know

416
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
Wiz crib something that's more localized

417
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
If it's a local market

418
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Stop it,

419
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
You look at example of Alibaba

420
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
If they just copy eBay and charged

421
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
50% Commission

422
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
Like eBay did it it will never be

423
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
The fact that jackpots will need to make it

424
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Free

425
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,735
So that it can track us more selfish than anywhere else we have more Sellers and more SK use

426
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
Anywhere else

427
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
It's easier for taobao

428
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
Will become more popular that you should know

429
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Watch eBay

430
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
And

431
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
To come up with a local innovation of an hourly pay

432
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Which function as escort service

433
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
Guaranteed out of transactions

434
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Safe secure and

435
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
Minimizer disputes

436
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
Is also not a great way

437
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Localization

438
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
Not without the benefit of having credit card

439
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
A PayPal

440
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
So these are kind of changes that I'm sure the Indian companies in Southeast Asian companies like America

441
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
And that's what will make them successful

442
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
When they can do that way

443
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
Amy Chinese founder sometimes I sense

444
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
This hubris that because something worked

445
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
In China course it will work

446
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
And all these other Emerging Markets but a lot of

447
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
X

448
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,935
The infrastructure is not employed like the mobile payment is not in place where the logistics network is not s

449
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
Straw and there's like

450
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
What type is not like

451
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
There's still a lot of

452
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Differences

453
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
So I think that's another

454
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
Factor that people need to pay attention

455
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Attention to that

456
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
These are the

457
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Marcus even though they're developing fast

458
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
There a lot of conditions that are not

459
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
Place like they were in China

460
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,999
That's a great obligation 15 years ago Lotto American teams when it comes to China are they show a lot of Hughley as well

461
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
Sometimes even today we see that happened to

462
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
And they just think that whatever works elsewhere

463
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
Around the world

464
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Shells work in China 2

465
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
In

466
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
Unfortunately some of the Chinese founder

467
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Have the same degree

468
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Overconfidence as well

469
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
And when you do that and don't show enough respect

470
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
What are the differences in local markets

471
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
You're in for a rude awakening

472
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
So what

473
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Advice

474
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Do you have four

475
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Chinese

476
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
So high

477
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
Companies are trying to hire for local talent to understand

478
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
These markets better

479
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
I think they need to start with hiring

480
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
Local Chinese with Latinos comedy parlor

481
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,375
Example if you look at

482
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
Shopee in Southeast Asia

483
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,751
Forrest and his partner hired was able to recruit Chris

484
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
To join them to wrong shopping

485
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
And Chris's

486
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Force himself

487
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,199
Move to Southeast Asia after getting his MBA from Stanford

488
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
He was born and raised in tianjin

489
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
And you went to Southeast Asia

490
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
His wife want to live there

491
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
In Singapore so they start a business

492
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
In Southeast Asia

493
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
And

494
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
David Livingstone the gaming

495
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Significance of a pencil

496
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
Games of Southeast Asia

497
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,143
When they decide to go out to eat, as well they were able to recruit Chris

498
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
Between them and Chris someone who had to work at hazard.

499
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,287
Before and even before that moved to Singapore me with some metals

500
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,151
So he's someone who grew up through the Singapore education system have a lot of friends locally

501
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
Missing time still remain quite Chinese in

502
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Disconnect

503
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
What's happening

504
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
In China

505
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
So if you can recruit Allen locally

506
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
The undersigned for China and the local market

507
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Then they are able to

508
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Figure out whether the similarities and difference

509
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
And be able to make adjustments

510
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Accordingly

511
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
So having people who know the local market as well

512
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Pressing time have Chinese roots

513
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Is the first

514
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Kind of executive.

515
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
The Chinese company should hire in order to Leverage

516
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,055
And over time you see the people who report to Chris

517
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Nanny McPhee

518
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
From Southeast Asia the region

519
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
It's so

520
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,735
Overtime you have to localize at local team to understand how local

521
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Consumer taste

522
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Are different

523
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
Producing time

524
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
You continue leverage Lessons Learned From China

525
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,647
You help you to stay ahead of your competition

526
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Anything that's more of cross-cultural

527
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:11,071
Then cross-disciplinary and know the differences and similarities in people make the right adjustments

528
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
Are the team that most likely will succeed

529
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
And what about the other types of

530
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,751
Talent say it like Marcus like India there are not a lot of

531
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Chinese

532
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
People who have

533
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Is there a long time

534
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
Time ago or less

535
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
Right so I think for a company

536
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Places like India

537
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,247
Then is easier to see that a lot of talent from

538
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
Huawei ZTE Alibaba

539
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Who have operate a business there I'll be happy Chinese company

540
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
NW2 coming out with join startup

541
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Start tackling

542
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Those markets

543
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,119
So if you don't have a receipt as with bigger for long-time the next best thing is probably hired Chinese people

544
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
Chinese Executives web off radio

545
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Nemo's Marcus

546
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
For 5 to 10 years

547
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
To help you get started

548
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
The overtime abilities

549
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
The local team is critical

550
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
If you can do that

551
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
On top of the Chinese knowledge you have

552
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Your Chisholm

553
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
City will be much higher

554
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Have you said that

555
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
The companies I've done well in China

556
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Should I expand to

557
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Southeast Asia tour

558
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Or India on their own

559
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Initially probably

560
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:12,511
Should try the same time by the time they start going to this weekend they would be

561
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
Y'all companies there they want to be

562
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
The India or the

563
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Southeast Asia at the local version of what you're doing

564
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
So be open to partner

565
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,287
After you compete and get a sense of how they look when Cutters to behave

566
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
And how strong they are

567
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
It is actually makes sense

568
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Exploring kind of Strategic investment

569
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
And be able to partner

570
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,015
Is the more you win the partner I think you think I should go to the pie

571
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Bigger as well

572
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
There's a lot of

573
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Howard

574
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
Founders of very different

575
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Backgrounds

576
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
So there a lot of

577
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Cross-border e-commerce

578
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Companies are trying to

579
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
How to Leverage

580
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
Chinese supply chain to sell to these

581
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Emerging Markets

582
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
But people who understands

583
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
Supply chain in China tend not to understand local consumers in

584
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
Andy's markets and vice versa

585
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
You have two people who are very good at each

586
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,407
Co-founders together

587
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Make him be a very

588
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Powerful

589
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Why didn't one of the

590
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Best investments

591
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
What's that I made

592
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Probably wish

593
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,903
When I look at which the co-founders came from Eastern Europe

594
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
In China

595
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
Mac in Canada

596
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,303
Cooking school and then we're trained professionally in California

597
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
And I came out to do what way

598
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
So you have people from different parts of the world

599
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,983
Go to Martin allergist so they have a common background

600
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
In-N-Out the same time they were willing to

601
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
Adult at a local team in Shanghai that we played a role in helping us get started and they were able to hire a lot of

602
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Folks from China to help with

603
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Supply chain

604
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
So not. Formula

605
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
Seems to be the formula we seen other places

606
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
Founders with different back on swimming the partner

607
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,511
We just discussed as willing to work together are more likely the Belmonts

608
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
Successful

609
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,607
So I guess this one tip for

610
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Perspective

611
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
Entrepreneurs is just to step out of your

612
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Comfort zone and make friends

613
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Other backgrounds perspectives

614
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
I think it will always

615
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Playoff NBA

616
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Yes

617
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
When we lecture or give talks

618
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Still different NBA

619
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,967
Programs weather is in China where you at

620
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
We hollinghurst people

621
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
From different disciplines to get to know one.

622
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,928
Example was alright you care for you, so it makes sense for someone

623
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Supply chain expert

624
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
To work with somebody who's

625
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
Confederate consumer-facing

626
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Areas

627
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
In the area of enterprise

628
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
We also see

629
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,192
Teams do better at when they have a strong sales person

630
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,520
That knows how to get SMB store topper to Knology

631
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
+ someone who is very strong

632
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Software with sass

633
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
Dubuque development

634
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
Occupy the product and Send The Pain points

635
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
Of a people in different of vertigo

636
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,576
When you have teams that have different founders with different discipline

637
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Work well together

638
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Because we went to the same

639
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
Score what had to work

640
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Professional

641
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,744
How much is skull tattoos Ybor

642
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Chisholm

643
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
So I think as investors were also faced with a

644
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Question

645
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Weather to pick the

646
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,776
The Chinese Founders or the local one so for example there's just start two companies do exactly

647
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
I'm saying how would you

648
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
But that's usually a very tough choice

649
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
In areas of

650
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
Different categories what is social networking or gaming

651
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
E-commerce

652
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
It's difficult

653
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
To say

654
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Which one is better than the other

655
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
We have some success examples

656
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
Fun filled camp

657
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Each of these categories

658
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,864
When coming social networking it's easier to generalize and say

659
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
The local team will understand local markets better

660
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
Do you mean you see someone like

661
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Bytedance

662
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
Hotel and the throwing

663
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
That came up with tic toc that's done very well International

664
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,640
With a team that's mostly based in China

665
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Musically

666
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
Is not a good example

667
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
Miss repeat a lot of local teams in us and Europe

668
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
With the Prodigal Son

669
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Define biting

670
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
In Shanghai with a lar operation to back it up

671
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
So

672
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,744
Even in technology where one would think that local team should win

673
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
You can see comfort zone

674
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
When it comes to e-commerce

675
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
Usopp has a job

676
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,448
Tokopedia is doing well competes against shopee

677
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,008
And a lot of gooey Indie style corn

678
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,824
Let's do which one will win out what is Togepi D'oro jockey

679
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
So even eaten Commerce where

680
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
I've missed supply chain manager from China

681
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Should be helpful

682
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,016
You can still see the local team compete effectively in

683
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
So I think very difficult to analyze

684
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Which camera is better

685
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
But it comes on to you

686
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,440
Execution and how fast the Thunders of willing to learn

687
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,024
I see father some tokopedia bukalapak

688
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
It's been quite a bit of time in Hangzhou

689
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,632
When was invested by Alibaba not always Best Buy information

690
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Different and learning

691
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,008
So I think the key differentiation is not whether it's a local teamwork

692
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Chinese sing

693
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
It's really how fast

694
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
The teams learn about what they don't know

695
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
What are some examples of successful

696
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Zhuhai company

697
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
And what do you think was

698
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
The key to theirs

699
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
I think the

700
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,368
To accompany its original toy company that has done

701
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
Well you can probably say it's a highway

702
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
Probably asking is amazing

703
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,024
Booty from a telecom equipment

704
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Player 2 com

705
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
Consumer-facing headset

706
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
And to be able to be able to Global operation

707
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
A lot of that so I consider that you and I have bad

708
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,520
Many of them came out of my way in

709
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
ZTE as well

710
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,360
And so you see that they are well-trained

711
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
And can do things

712
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,224
Increasingly you look at an internet pure Internet space

713
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
One has to say that

714
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,576
You know Tokyo Ghoul has done Tokyo All In

715
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
Amazing job with Tik-Tok

716
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
In the bike dance

717
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
This is just

718
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Impressive company.

719
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Expand beyond beyond beyond China

720
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
E Commerce space

721
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
I think both the shoppie and wish

722
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Have shown that

723
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
If you

724
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
Have the building to send local markets

725
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
As well as being able to have the

726
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
The training

727
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
You takes in

728
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Chinese apply to understanding

729
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
You can build it

730
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Accessible

731
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
E-commerce races wow

732
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,480
So I think these are some of the names that people will watch

733
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
For for a long time

734
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,552
You stay all have

735
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
What it takes for something

736
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Lastly on xiaomi

737
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,976
Then India has become a fast-growing market for xiaomi in the number one

738
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Indiana

739
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
UCA Chinese brand

740
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,632
To do well in a country that historically not as friendly or open

741
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
Chinese ideas

742
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
Is remarkable

743
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,032
Nothing. A lot of credit goes to mono at xiaomi India

744
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
What's an amazing job

745
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
A building the brand

746
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
That touches hearts

747
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Hundreds of millions of

748
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,016
So how do hard that the right

749
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
GM

750
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Put a local market in

751
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Paragon

752
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,392
To really localized the way he or she sees

753
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Respect is an art

754
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Not the science

755
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,768
That sell me some stuff to crack the code for India

756
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
In terms of

757
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Picking Market

758
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
I think we're seeing a lot of activity

759
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
In southeast

760
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Asia India Middle East

761
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
Watch America in a little bit of Africa

762
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
So each of these different markets

763
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,616
It's have different characteristics so like India is a

764
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
The huge Market but the middle class

765
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Sizes of

766
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
Smaller in

767
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
The Artful is very low

768
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,064
And is very competitive so Middle East has a lot

769
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Higher

770
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Arpu

771
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,392
But the population might be a little bit

772
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
Smaller so

773
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
And so what do you think

774
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
When the Chinese Founders try to

775
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
To pick a market

776
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
Do they need to

777
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
To pay attention to

778
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Write different stages

779
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
Requires different kind of company

780
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,496
Maple India the best companies from China can do well

781
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
Centipede has a maker

782
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
Cuz that's the first thing in deep ocean

783
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,616
We need to buy him to get online

784
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,944
Whether they have a lot of money to spend out of it by the phone or not

785
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,552
It takes time to be able to ramp up disposable income level in order to buy more thing

786
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Be on the phone

787
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
So it happens in the stage

788
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
Voice authorization

789
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
Ecommerce Market is

790
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Less competitive

791
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Compared to India

792
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
American players on.

793
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
So sweet

794
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
Chinese company compete against local players

795
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
Some Chinese companies anyway

796
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
It's interesting that

797
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
All about ohms Lazada

798
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Automaster in

799
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
Tokopedia

800
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
SO3 of the

801
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224
Top energy, companies that you know these are all

802
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
You know Alibaba related

803
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
And it just fascinating

804
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:07,904
To see the Chinese company doing well in Southeast Asia

805
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,744
Now when you look at which markets are Chinese companies go after

806
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,352
I feel that the argument Marcus out there with both GDP per capita is high enough

807
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
Are population-based

808
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Is big enough

809
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
And that's actually like America

810
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,544
This is why I think the TD did the right thing to acquire 99 in Brazil

811
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Electrical problems growth Roll on America

812
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
I look at Brazil

813
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,944
Rio and Sao Paulo

814
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
Are two of the top three cities for Uber

815
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
Worldwide outside of China

816
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
So. America is actually a market

817
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,160
Where not many Americans are are willing to go

818
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,488
Now you see more European trained Executives there

819
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
And she have a vintage

820
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Being there

821
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,144
Local players in local shampoo

822
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,728
So I actually think that America is a market.

823
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
You don't see a lot of Chinese companies there today

824
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,336
But you will later because it

825
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,128
Capital is high enough

826
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Annette

827
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
7000 to 10000 range

828
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
US dollars rate

829
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
And also

830
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
The population size

831
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Is about 600 million +

832
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
With Brazil New Mexico

833
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Stop picking habit

834
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,184
So that's the market. I think we were here about Morganford

835
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
Right now going to India into Southeast Asia

836
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,072
It's easier and Middle East is easier from from China

837
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,400
Do you see teams doing that to each of these three three regions

838
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
May have its own limitations

839
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
India local teams in South East Asia

840
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Learning so quickly

841
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
Dottie eventage mod adventures

842
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
That Chinese team may have is getting less and less

843
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,248
So for the next five years I see Sully do that India

844
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Still the Middle East

845
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
What's the most popular place for Chinese tea

846
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
But the upside

847
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
May not be as high as

848
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
You could have been five years ago

849
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
That's the opposite of people missing

850
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Is South America

851
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
It takes a lot more hours to

852
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,072
Fly there so he's probably more rewarding

853
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,728
It takes a calculation it takes anywhere between 26 to 30 hours

854
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
To go from Beijing

855
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
To some Paulo

856
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
So it is not easy

857
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
Shrimp so you favors the team

858
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
The wooden to make that happen

859
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
And it's why I admired you so much

860
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Will be able to do that

861
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
And intense and also invested in new bank

862
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
Yes they invest in you back about the amount

863
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,904
And it's the biggest deal that a Chinese company did invest

864
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Penny Latimer

865
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,792
What's up you start to see more China 2

866
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
North America initiatives

867
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,656
Happen especially given Square surface is

868
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
With us

869
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Is very typical by any chance company goes through you

870
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
We talked about this

871
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Chinese Tech Giant

872
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,128
Sp80 by tencent and the baby Giants

873
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
TMD.

874
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Hotel May 20th DD

875
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,528
I think we came to the conclusion that bytedance has the highest chance

876
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
Becoming

877
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Internet company with

878
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
By offering its own

879
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Just by investing

880
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Steal others do you think that still

881
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
Host true I think what they've done.

882
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,376
India with hello is very impressive hello is there a vernacular

883
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
Short video app

884
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
Sono in English for not English

885
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
Speakers in India

886
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
And has gained a lot of traction

887
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,104
I just want to keep low profile so I won't talk about them too much

888
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,408
But it did what it doing is very impressive

889
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
How to give Pedialyte to credit

890
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
For being able to

891
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Make acquisition

892
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
In Brazil

893
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
And there were shots

894
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Rule Regional

895
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Within North America

896
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
Have you both companies

897
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
You showing that

898
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Chinese company can expand

899
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
Young China Beijing

900
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
Five football teams they also have a lot of room for

901
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Improvement and growth

902
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
By becoming more

903
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
Internationalize

904
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
And look alikes

905
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
In the queue

906
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
I think in general

907
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,520
The tenant seems to have enough skill set

908
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Drive

909
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,616
An experience to internationally while they rely

910
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Is the understanding

911
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Of the local

912
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Marcus and

913
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Hey Stan

914
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,760
Japan is a market we haven't talked about very much

915
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Pod Hotel

916
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808

In Japan

919
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
So over time

920
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
Has there more Innovation coming of China

921
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Stephen e Marcus

922
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
That's more developed

923
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
Like Europe

924
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
And that you find there's opportunity

925
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
I guess to finish off ggv active

926
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Invest

927
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704

928
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
These markets as well as

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
Local Founders in emerging-market

930
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
