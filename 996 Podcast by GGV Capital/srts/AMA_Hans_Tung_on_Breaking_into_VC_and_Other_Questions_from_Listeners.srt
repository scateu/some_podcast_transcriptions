39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Thank you Zara

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
So first I was kind of surprised but also not surprised that around half of all people who submit a question is wrote down

41
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
The same question

42
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
How do you break into VC

43
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
So let's first address this

44
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
Burning question that a lot of people seem to have

45
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
On their mind

46
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
Sure I did not

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Starting BC of right off of college

48
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
I was very fortunate to

49
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
In a class of 1990

50
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Free

51
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
So

52
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
That was a year. Netscape browser

53
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
What's the least

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
And the world become a very different

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Place thereafter

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
I think Peter Thiel was a couple years ahead of me

57
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
In Nigerian was a year behind me

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
And so that was that was the right time

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
How to be an internet business

60
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
But I didn't know anything about BC back then

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
I start my career in banking

62
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
In New York

63
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
And then Hong Kong

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Let's spend the next 5 years

65
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
Through Hong Kong Taipei in Singapore

66
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
Tech-related gross

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
Basically investing companies that were trying to do country Manufacturing

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
Semiconductor chip design

69
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,688
Internet was not a big focus at that point in time

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
And then run around 1999

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,576
The group of Ivy Leagues and stuff for graduates got together

72
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
2 * 2 startups

73
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
One after the other

74
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
And both know for intern

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,792
And not remind me a lot of love what people are doing about blockchain

76
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
Cryptocurrency

77
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Today

78
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
It's very similar

79
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
And I think if I didn't have that Starbucks.

80
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
I probably wouldn't know

81
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
I will be

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
Very interested

83
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Entrepreneurship

84
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Just NASA founder

85
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
Better suited as an ambassador

86
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
Combining my banking and micro Capital Investments parents

87
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
With my appreciation

88
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
4 hardest to go to start

89
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
How you spell it

90
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
So I think if I didn't have died

91
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
8 to 10 year experience

92
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Investment

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Finance

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
And as a found

95
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
I wouldn't know that busy was the right career for me

96
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,423
But to get into BC I still had to come back to the US

97
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Go to MIT for graduate school

98
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
And then join a Bessemer

99
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
And it was at Bessemer Tyler Noble

100
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
American BC

101
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
With appreciation for what would happen

102
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,759
In China so I think I'm very grateful for my ex calling

103
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
Forgive me the opportunity

104
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Adding my time in

105
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
China

106
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
See that

107
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
This a market of a bus

108
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
About to take off

109
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,511
I made a commitment to my family my wife and I to

110
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Tutu China

111
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
And build on my Visa Korea really

112
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
In China over the next eight years

113
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
18 mm

114
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
5

115
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
2013

116
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
I think my time at

117
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Dumb

118
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Teeming and also know it

119
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
Both were very fortunate

120
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
Because the the world for internet users worldwide

121
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Google, Pelion

122
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
24 billion

123
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
Smartphone

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
And then

125
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
China

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
Economy really took off

127
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
And I made a huge impact on Chinese growth

128
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
You know a ton of a star with possum

129
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
Back in 2005

130
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
So

131
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,351
To get into BC I think one has to have some kind of Consulting with banking background

132
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
And ideally some startups.

133
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Management

134
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Experience

135
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
So that you have appreciation of

136
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
What's a like

137
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Insider startup

138
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
What kind of issues. Founders go through

139
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
What kind of challenges

140
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
Have to overcome

141
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
In order to succeed

142
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
What kind of lessons

143
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
Can we learn from our mistakes that startups inevitably

144
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Will make

145
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
We have a sense of pace and rhythm

146
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
And I thought appreciation for

147
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
Thank you for Consulting analytical skills

148
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
New York

149
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
My better

150
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
Prepare to be a good PC

151
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
To what qualities do you look for when you are hiring

152
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
People to join the gvt

153
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
What I look for

154
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
Basically BC's looking for patterns

155
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
If you look at number of

156
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Founders

157
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Most startups have succeeded

158
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
There is a high correlation

159
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Temperature

160
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
And what are they becoming a eunuch

161
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
What is Harvard

162
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
Or other Ivy Leagues

163
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Versus

164
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
Stanford or Berkeley

165
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
And the Stanford Berkeley Chihuahua and B.

166
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
A pop of the tops

167
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
Sports generate most number of a unicorn

168
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
BM.

169
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Futon

170
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
A university

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Indifferent

172
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Cemu

173
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
And others

174
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
There's a high concentration

175
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
So

176
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
For VCS

177
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
Time to come from one of the top schools that have the network

178
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
And exposure

179
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
To start up

180
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Welding school

181
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
It's become increasingly tough getting to the BC busy

182
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Without having

183
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Prior exposure

184
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
2.

185
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
New Edition

186
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
If you have other language skills

187
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Especially if you come from China

188
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Speak Chinese fluently

189
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
And have spent time in China also have some kind of

190
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
Banking Consulting background

191
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Plus ideal you some kind of

192
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,335
Exposure to running a startup

193
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Those are all

194
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Recently acquired

195
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
To be harmed by one of the top

196
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Bobby Seifer

197
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
So the next question is

198
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,111
From two people Richard coward CEO of China emissions as well as

199
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Jacob who described

200
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
David the little African American who is moving to China in March

201
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:32,863
The question is what advice would you give to a foreigner starting a business in China and do you foresee

202
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
China being

203
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,983
As attractive as the us as a place to live and work in tap for foreigners

204
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Yeah

205
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Pop the question.

206
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
I've heard since I moved

207
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
China

208
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Are people coming back

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
In the time I was

210
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Antenna for 8 years

211
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
One more Foreigner

212
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Become interested in

213
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
The China model

214
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
In China experience

215
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
RBC

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
It's been only you notes GP invested

217
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Alibaba

218
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,975
As early as well come through yet about Edition 270 under $89

219
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
And now is a

220
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
500 billion dollar market cap company

221
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
With information is worth at least another hundred fifty

222
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
So when you see companies

223
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Grove. Much

224
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
You know something was happening

225
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Fundamentally

226
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
In that Society

227
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Internet

228
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
And sup

229
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Speaking of such a big impact

230
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
To allow this kind of

231
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
About equation

232
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
2

233
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
So

234
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
When you see the conduct

235
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
You learn a lot

236
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
How to help

237
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Scale over time

238
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
And if you have the ability to

239
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Learn quickly

240
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
And be willing to help them

241
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,863
That's the best way to create value and we can create value for the founders

242
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
You end up creating value for yourself

243
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,519
So if practically speaking if a foreigner wants to move

244
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
So China and

245
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
Start a company what kind of

246
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Preparations should I make today learn Chinese

247
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
Is it that you spoke with any local connection

248
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
It is not easy to

249
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
About you

250
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
On the process

251
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
China has caught up

252
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Therefore SF

253
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
You need to figure out how to

254
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Something unique

255
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
That China doesn't

256
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
Experience

257
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
If you're hired by a Facebook or a

258
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
Google or Amazon

259
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,543
Pick up a lot of product management knowledge

260
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
And Engineering skills

261
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Have yuan theater science in

262
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Algorithm

263
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Chinese companies would want

264
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
So importantly having that

265
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Harcore CS experience

266
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
Or parliamentary experience

267
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
Is going to be helpful for you to a body

268
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
China

269
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
Language skills and you know that

270
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
Not having a

271
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Speak my mind

272
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
It's not easy

273
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
It is important for foreigners

274
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
To learn how to speak Chinese

275
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
China is this the Talon

276
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Level is so great

277
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
In China

278
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
There are more than 4.6 million stem graduates a year

279
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
There's so many people at work

280
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
The basic fundamental skill set

281
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
So you don't have something unique

282
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Now to ask you a question whether

283
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Is a China or USA

284
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
You got the language scale

285
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
I think working China is an absolute must

286
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
PSI Chinese models

287
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Have much more

288
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Relevance for emerging markets

289
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
In Latin America in Indonesia and India

290
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
What is a

291
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
Bryson Middle Class loss of organization

292
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,007
High population density improving structure with High-Speed Rail and

293
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
And a subway system

294
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
So the experience of

295
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
China is much more relevant

296
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
Much more so than more spread out

297
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Cities in the US

298
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
In more advanced

299
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Customer experience

300
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
Having that language skills

301
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Having that something special

302
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
And then you willing to

303
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Just do it humble and learn a lot

304
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
What do someone wonders

305
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
I work in China

306
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,631
Not just be successful in China but learn lessons that give him very valuable

307
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
For other things.

308
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
I would like to argue that having that something special like

309
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Extensive experience of working

310
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
In your home country is

311
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
Even more valuable than being able to speak Chinese because a lot of people especially Chinese overseas returning these were already bilingual

312
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,783
Chinese in English and they also know

313
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Some Western societies pretty well

314
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,391
So like what is the rationale for hiring

315
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,279
How far to overhang the Chinese overseas returnee like you have to have something that the others don't have

316
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
Yeah and also as you know how many companies in China are thinking about going abroad

317
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
So

318
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
If you will come from him and Market

319
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,543
Chinese companies want to go to what is India or Southeast Asia

320
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Or parts of us

321
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
Your knowledge of the local market

322
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
As a mainstream user

323
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
A product

324
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
That understands how local

325
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
From China

326
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Overtime will be very bottom

327
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
Even for a wedding speak Chinese

328
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Find my URL

329
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,487
If your in the US you need to understand how US market

330
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,071
Misbehave not just in San Francisco New York or

331
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
But also how the states

332
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
Function how users consumers

333
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
And the southwest and the southeast

334
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Are different

335
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
The more you understand

336
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Epiphany

337
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
Somersby hate the Moor

338
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
On the Enterprise side

339
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Knowing how to

340
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Bill product

341
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Help company

342
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
He's become more efficient

343
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Better yet get more orders

344
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Becomes very useful

345
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Summit1g Focus career

346
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
OT Tech

347
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,071
That's the easiest for you to have

348
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
A differentiation in the US

349
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
And then eventually go to China

350
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Delphi what you have

351
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Learn

352
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
Assuming that

353
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
IP protection

354
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
To be able to evaluate and do more work

355
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Yeah I dressings at alessa's does no matter what you do just go really deep and do it really well and then you work for

356
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Red-bellied wherever you go

357
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
The next question is from Sudan

358
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,975
A software engineer at Google who is considering going back to China to start a car

359
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
What made you go to China and what made you come back

360
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Silicon Valley

361
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
The question

362
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
When I went to China

363
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
For me I knew that China is about

364
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
To undergrove some kind of changes

365
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
As early as 2003

366
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
I like the hall the political machine

367
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Handled

368
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Position

369
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
And also handled socks

370
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Crisis

371
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
So I filled approval Eternal should be stable

372
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
At least for next 10 years

373
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
For startups do better

374
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,183
Also having taken prison trip to China

375
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
This obvious that China needs

376
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Develop more technology

377
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Internally

378
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
What are semiconductors

379
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
But even more important

380
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,447
There's a chance. Internet

381
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Nashville

382
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263

00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
To do something completely different

519

My kids were young

523
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,463

Mandarin chinese better

525
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559

00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
He's very lonely you're at midnight

575
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Facing all empty.

576
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
And try to figure out what's a plan for

577
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
Tomorrow the next month next year and Beyond

578
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
It is Well the pressure

579
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
So haven't come through startup screen

580
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Myself and I suppose Jenny

581
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
We understand how funders think

582
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
In that position once

583
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
For we know

584
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
What to do

585
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
They have the Thunders win

586
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
If you are helpful to people

587
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
Founders Internet space extremely

588
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
FaceTime meritocracy

589
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
If you are value

590
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
And you are willing to help

591
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
People want others who want to be helpful to them

592
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,303
If you go on the others with some facts about them

593
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
Is very basic human needs

594
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,215
A lot of this is acting that are smarter than the founder

595
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Study can choose and decide

596
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
Thanks the basis of Lifestyle business

597
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
I think that's the furthest thing from truth

598
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Overtime

599
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
The help

600
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
OBC

601
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Will be around

602
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
Congress are smart and they talk to each other

603
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,927
The next question is from Justin Chon who is the equity investment Analyst at Lloyd George Management in Hong Kong

604
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
He says as a young investor I often they can

605
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,559
Mistakes and I try to struggle through and learn from them

606
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,399
I'll be grateful to hear from your experience in dealing with a fill-in Vespa

607
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,727
Or lessons that has shaped you to become a successful venture capital

608
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
How did you get through the failure in

609
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
How does that

610
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Applies to your process

611
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,431
BC business by nature is a low probability

612
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
It's almost like baseball

613
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,551
Inside this is quite a bit of Neurology in baseball

614
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Your

615
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Amazing

616
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,903
In NBC Eva 30% of a company's workout

617
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
You are Superstar

618
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
And it is a Slowking

619
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
Percentage Concept in baseball

620
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Which means I

621
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
Each home run

622
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
Counts more

623
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Andy

624
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Grand Slam

625
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
That brings up four runs to the home base

626
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Come even more

627
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
And that's how

628
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,287
You know

629
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
If you have to get up unicorns that ends up being

630
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Japan

631
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
And so

632
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
The things I think every BC need to have mistakes

633
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
And skip to the Unicorn

634
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
It's very difficult

635
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
Walk in and just start picking in

636
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
This is such a hard business

637
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
The startup

638
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
Does being a Founder is very hard to begin with

639
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,840
The chance of success as a Founder is less than 2%

640
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
And so

641
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Enough business

642
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
Worth

643
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,472
You want to do is sleep

644
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
What's the success rate

645
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
The odds are against you

646
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
So in that situation

647
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
In order to

648
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
Figure out how to be helpful

649
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Two people

650
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
And then learn from mistakes

651
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
I think some Investments

652
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
The common issues that we faced

653
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
Wer

654
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Founders

655
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Did not get along

656
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
The level

657
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Little becomes much

658
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Sears

659
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,888
I found this wasn't able to make the pivot as quickly as possible

660
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,472
So you as a VCU part help the founders get better

661
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
Had helped him to me but

662
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Go to help them recruit

663
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Somehow Define

664
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
Jon Hamm Define partners

665
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
Try to help me find buyers

666
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
Along the way the more you

667
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,992
The time we spend helping with hunger

668
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
The more we learn about what to do or what

669
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Would you come help on the future

670
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
One thing I will suggest for both Campisi's 21st

671
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Mo state

672
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Too much money

673
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Do any car

674
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
You're much better off

675
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
From other people's mistakes

676
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Don't invest too much

677
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
But you spend a lot of time with a company to invest

678
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
Tecumseh

679
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
So that you

680
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Use other people's money

681
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
To learn

682
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
Butler Natalie

683
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Opportunity

684
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
So if it doesn't work out

685
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
The Lofts

686
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,504
To the farm or to The Punisher

687
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
It's not great

688
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
In the process

689
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
Without having done that

690
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Bessemer in

691
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Teeming

692
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Had my share of mistakes

693
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
But keep operating costs low

694
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
And make sure that you know the place at 2

695
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
We do put money in

696
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
End up making money

697
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Is the way

698
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
I survived

699
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
The amenity seamless business

700
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Who didn't have the

701
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
Right ventricular Leone

702
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,592
And over-committing in the new market

703
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
Or new area too soon

704
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
And they couldn't recover from them

705
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
But the mistakes

706
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,248
To learn how to survive on the battlefield

707
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
Is half of

708
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,672
As a follow-up question I think is Avicii there are two major types of mistakes you can make one is

709
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
Missing out on a deal the other one is

710
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Making investment

711
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,328
But the company is up as a failure so how do you prevent

712
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
Each and which one do you think is

713
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
More serious

714
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Different people have different School of thoughts

715
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
Missing on a deal

716
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Sounds like a terrible

717
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
The Army song

718
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
Facebook or I missed out on

719
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
Alibaba or Amazon pencil

720
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Json Baidu

721
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
It sounds terrible

722
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
But it actually

723
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Even if a species

724
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,552
Miss out on love

725
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Cuz there's no more.

726
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
So missing on deals

727
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Is not a Muslim

728
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Important

729
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,000
It is important to learn why you miss it

730
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
So that you cashed in

731
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304

I want to do but I couldn't

736

Sonographer

738
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
To do that

739
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
Get

740
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
You look at the stuff I did too

741
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
What is xiaomi you warm up a wall

742
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
Or you High Car Rental

743
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Why was I cheating

744
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Or when I meant

745
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
HGTV

746
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992

Musically you can you name any of them already

749
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,160
I end up doing better and not miss out

750
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
As much

751
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
After the first

752
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488

755
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Is not the end of the world

756
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
The key thing

757
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
Learn while you listen

758
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
How to capture next

759
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Second timer mistakes

760
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,312
That's what I was trying to press in my first question

761
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Which is

762
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:51,456
Learn the business by now over-committing each. Each of the five deals you do in a funeral prayer

763
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Don't put too much money in

764
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784

00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
I'll Be lyrics

767
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Profolio

768
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
The more you learn

769
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
About before they manage

770
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,256
The more you know what to avoid when you

771
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Make mistakes

772
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
A lot of people see.

773
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
ABC business hours

774
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Sourcing and making basket

775
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
That is wrong

776
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
Wait it's not as difficult

777
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Source deals

778
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,008
Vicks Medical Kit deal for all the time

779
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
Is much more to learn after making basket

780
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
How to help camp

781
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,664
To scale and overcome their issue

782
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Overtime

783
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
If you don't have a company Builder mentality

784
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Peking deals

785
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
I think it's very risky

786
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Long run

787
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
Hard to do to be a successful

788
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Safest way to become a

789
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Avicii

790
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
Is Hive a company Builder mentality

791
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
To be willing to help

792
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Profolio

793
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
Is Founders milk

794
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
Fungus want to pay people

795
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
Who care they don't want to be one of your portfolio

796
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,520
I'm asked if I'm a Founder this is everything is to me for my startup

797
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
I don't want to go to work BC

798
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
I'm just one of his 20 companies

799
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
And it doesn't matter which

800
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
20 works out well as he was she will win anyway

801
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
That is not a good feeling

802
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
Thomas

803
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
PCS were company builders

804
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,624
Hey Hugo

805
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Your tinsel

806
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,720
Success and attention being synced with a funders will be a lot higher

807
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,072
The next question is from Andrew Jang a product manager at Facebook

808
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,912
What are your thoughts on gen Z in the US versus gen Z in China

809
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
And how will this generation ship

810
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
Social retail entertainment Etc

811
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
How do you recommend

812
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,360
People to study TMZ users in China

813
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,408
To look at new house movie

814
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
Republic of Desire

815
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
That's not the fantastic movie

816
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,040
And that's alright I going to interview Hall

817
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Next week

818
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
The Chelsea users in China affect a lot of pressure

819
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
They each have parents

820
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
And grandparents

821
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Support

822
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,792
Yeah when I get married. Number * 2

823
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
So it is a lot of

824
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Pressure

825
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Overtime

826
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
Special living Tier 1 cities

827
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
So a lot of users look for it

828
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
Escape look for things that can kill time

829
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,360
To get the more hope and we needed help them to

830
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
You must figure out a way to

831
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,968
Adjust move out move out to cheer to three cities

832
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
So

833
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
The Chauncey choosers

834
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
A really

835
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
Short attention span

836
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:10,208
They are much more willing to share what they're doing everyday online

837
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,792
Mkconnections online djz users in

838
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,840
Us have some similarity

839
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,608
Half as much

840
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
Pressure button

841
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
Express himself

842
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
The need to get

843
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,240
Instant gratification the need to to

844
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Hopefully not work as hard

845
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
Able to enjoy Fame

846
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Good Fortune quickly

847
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
Very common in both societies

848
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
This was very funny to see those similarities

849
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,784
And overtime I think we'll be making Investments

850
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,112
That could do well in both China and us

851
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
With Millennial and gen Z years

852
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah she think increasingly

853
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Generational divide

854
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,608
Between different Generations is even greater than the geographical

855
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Divide

856
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,216
Between the people of the same age but live in different countries

857
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,336
I feel like a lot of their culture and consumption habits are starting to converge based on age

858
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
And we seen as a USB

859
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
But also across the board

860
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
Is as well a lot more similarity

861
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
4 people of this

862
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Same h

863
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Across this

864
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Emerging Markets

865
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,208
Big cities ever nice

866
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
So the next question is from Kason shoe

867
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,096
Who is the Strategic finance manager at adaro

868
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
Loves to GB

869
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,936
Both podcast 96 and found a real talk

870
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,056
The question is what are your thoughts on the enterprise software Market in China will there be equivalence of

871
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
Salesforce workday Nestle anytime soon

872
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
Usher I think the Condors real talk

873
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
It's a

874
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
TV podcast hosted by Glenn Solomon

875
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
It's an excellent Progress way to buy the interest

876
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
Enterprise space

877
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,624
Also is a 32b podcasts Troian a movie

878
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
For those who can understand

879
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
Chinese

880
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Fantastic job

881
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Talking about startup Inside Story

882
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
China I think for

883
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
China

884
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
As economic growth rate slows down

885
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
And ever since I moved back to China

886
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
In 2005

887
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Come across great as always

888
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
Speed slowing down

889
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
China needs to improve efficiency

890
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
I'm going to make up for the Lost

891
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Stone Golf Course

892
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
So

893
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
There will be more need for sauce

894
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
For software

895
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
The help Desiree efficiencies and Applegate

896
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
For many Enterprises

897
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
I'm to the cloud

898
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,952
So this is where the US have

899
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
A lot of best practice

900
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
Chinese classical music and share and learn

901
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
So I seen in a long run in China they will be something similar to a Salesforce or similar to a work day

902
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:33,824
But it'll probably take a bit more time and you have a surf more SMB customers

903
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Olympic Enterprises

904
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Enterprise

905
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Pain

906
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
I'm time

907
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
Accounts payable office get dropped out

908
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
So serving smbt

909
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
That you have to order

910
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
Therefore they would share their upside with you

911
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
It's a

912
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,976
Increase your chance of getting paid sooner and earlier

913
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
So we will always looking at

914
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
Chaoyang beijing China

915
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Conserva SMB Tech

916
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
SMB customers and Enterprises better

917
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
I think the consensus is that what

918
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,520
That's slowing down GDP growth and

919
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
Rising labor cost

920
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
South will definitely

921
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
Develop but it's just a matter of

922
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Time when

923
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
OHV

924
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Takeoff

925
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
So the next question is from

926
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,320
Michael cahoe who is from One Piece work

927
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
What do you think will be China's

928
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
Internet ecosystems next International

929
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,024
Is Michael Douglas the many Chinese companies are already in Southeast Asia

930
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Alibaba

931
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
And inferential

932
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
Is affiliate I investors

933
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,680
Asia like tokopedia Pokemon pack

934
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Acquired

935
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Lazada

936
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
Tencent investor in C

937
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
I was just Karina and shopee

938
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Insult

939
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,432
Many of the TDS investor in grab

940
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
And so

941
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,248
Chinese companies already in Southeast Asia

942
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
And you look at a top

943
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
100 apps

944
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
India

945
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Especially the top 20

946
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
Many of them almost

947
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
The 3rd

948
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
If not more are

949
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
Somehow China

950
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
So more more times, we are definitely

951
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
Looking at India

952
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
As the next big Market with

953
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
Similar population size

954
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,984
Lord gdp per capita in

955
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,056
Having come through experiences with different Chinese models

956
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128

So that's something.

1064
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
Most foreigners don't realize

1065
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:38,464
Someone like a Starbucks or a KFC or McDonald having China long enough

1066

1076
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
About to succeed

1077
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,944
I think go to market in China requires a lot more

1078
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Working with the channels

1079
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Then in the US

1080
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040

00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,536
Platforms you have to work closely with them

1086
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,120
And I feel a lot of the new brands in China as met

1087
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,216
Have like dedicated teams that work on tmall just to make sure

1088

Customers well on that specific Channel

1090
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
I think for most player

1091
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
That is a good place to get started

1092
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
But the best player

1093
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Kannada

1094
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Is depend on

1095
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
Tmall

1096
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528

1098
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344

00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
Speak up for you

1106
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Is not easy

1107
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
I remember 4

1108
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
In the case of xiaomi

1109
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,496
Xiaomi how to show Chico

1110
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Some experts

1111
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
Can paint. They launched

1112
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Before they announce the first phone

1113
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
And I'm not campaign

1114
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
Beijing

1115
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
Shut off is 56 phone

1116
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
That he has ever owned in his entire life

1117
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
I talked about this

1118
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
Plus I minus

1119
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
In many

1120
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
UI user

1121
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
They're about a hundred thousand of them

1122
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Also participated in

1123
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Share their knowledge

1124
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,072
Which in turn attracted about 460000 people

1125
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
To participate

1126
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,376
So when I see it

1127
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,216
About half a million users talk about what I like about the folks that had

1128
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Not like no okay

1129
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
You can figure out a way to

1130
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Being

1131
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,664
Pop it to attract people without spending a lot of money on something that I care about

1132
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
So once you have the

1133
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,528
You build a community that's willing to give yours first home

1134
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
A chance

1135
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,160
So how do you get users on on your own in the future is important

1136
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,488

00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
People do out with a WeChat want to be fingered

1141
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
So

1142
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
How do you leverage the papa

1143
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,728

1144
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776

1145
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056

1146
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824

1147
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
In overtime

1148
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,640
It would depend on your own ability

1149
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
And your brand value depreciation

1150
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,016
Do PLL something as unique as a body language

1151
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Immunity is like theater seats

1152
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088

1153
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,160
The next question is from Tiger Fang

Similar to what tribe of Indonesia

1157
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,168
There's a lot of talk recently about chuhai entrepreneurs in startups

1158
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
Copy models from China to emerging market

1159
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:36,128
What are the advantages of Chinese entrepreneurs and Chinese models in places like Indonesia India Latin America versus

1160
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,944
Local entrepreneurs and big heavyweights from the US

1161
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
Call First Wok on Glass Tiger

1162
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
I think it's a startup

1163
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
What's this happening well

1164
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
Yeah that makes a lot of sense

1165
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
For Indonesia

1166
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
I think that

1167
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
The biggest lessons I learned

1168
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Back in 2013 what side

1169
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,024
China in the span of

1170
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
Only

1171
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584

00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
Rudy leverage Internet to play

1173
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680

National Business

1175
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
Does it cost money

1176
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Suckers for

1184
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
Leverage internet

1185
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Change itself

1186

2B 2B 2C

1189
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
So many different layers are being a

1190
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Affected become more

1191
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
Efficient because of Internet

1192
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
They are about 300 BC backcountry

1193
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,328
Movies from China That's listed

1195
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
Another on yourself

1196
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
How come

1197
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
All are interrelated

1198
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
And then the Emoji unicorn

1199
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
113

1200
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,848
Yeah in the pipeline that's all internet-related as well

1201
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,152
So we have all these things to happen

1202
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,504
The address Tiffany's from tier one city to cheer for five cities

1203
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,088
So all that Biz models of these 500

1204
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Many Emerging Markets

1205
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
I found this, this from Latin America

1206
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
From Southeast Asia from India

1207
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,792
Whatever Publix finally solved their own country

1208
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
The almost always

1209
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
Find at least one company in China

1210
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
New companies West

1211
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Something someone

1212
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
Sure they going to be different

1213
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
But at the same time

1214
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
Emerging markets going through a fascist organization

1215
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
Fast a rising middle class

1216
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
A lot of problems that people need to solve

1217
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
Afega Samoa

1218
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:18,272
So it's almost like all those 500 companies in China you can always find something

1219
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,832
That will be useful in a local emerging market

1220
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
And for what tigers doing with a water bottle

1221
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Logistics is inefficient

1222
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
The many drivers

1223
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Who are not getting the

1224
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Enough

1225
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Strike jobs

1226
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
How to match them

1227
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
With the right orders

1228
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,192
To make them efficient so they can make more money

1229
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Beijing time

1230
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
Pitkin what jobs done

1231
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,360
Is a matter of both algorithm in as well as

1232
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,688
Anderson local market in order to make a matching possum

1233
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
The models that China has gone through

1234
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
UK South Orchard

1235
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Becomes quite useful for him

1236
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,928
Next question is from Eduardo vasconcelos

1237
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,768
Weather Brazilian Stanford grad living in the US and where can a family office

1238
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,608
Emerging Market country

1239
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,448
Outside of China looks at the Chinese internet ecosystem for inspiration

1240
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,264
He or she always has to take China site into

1241
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,824
Consideration so that I can adjust expectations

1242
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,128
It's about things such as Market size potential

1243
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
Is upscale etcetera

1244
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:24,320
The question is what are some other unique elements about this Market that you think do not exist in most Emerging Markets

1245
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,416
And that I was going to hear from these countries for consider when deciding

1246
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,000
Whether Chinese business model platform could work in their country or not

1247
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
Yes

1248
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
I don't know I was asked questions

1249
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Think

1250
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
What we always take for granted

1251
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
And people from outside.

1252
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Chinatown garden design inside

1253
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
The Chinese government historical

1254
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
I've been quite efficient

1255
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
How do you say overlap

1256
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
Last 20 years

1257
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,408
To build up an infrastructure

1258
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
With High-Speed Rail

1259
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Subway systems

1260
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
An internet infrastructure

1261
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
What makes a possible

1262
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
For internet business from

1263
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
PC dust I'll be around

1264
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
To happen

1265
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,232
If the structure is poor it doesn't allow

1266
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
Fastest rotation of goods

1267
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
Some people is will be much harder

1268
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,120
To build a e-commerce business

1269
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:13,728
In order for Alibaba what is TT maor chitti delivery product

1270
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
3 hours

1271
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
In his major cities

1272
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
With all modern infrastructure of

1273
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
Transportation is it physically possible

1274
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
So

1275
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,480
I think having a efficient government.

1276
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
Lie down

1277
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
Efficient infrastructure

1278
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
Is extremely critical

1279
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
And to allow different subnet

1280
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
The try things with not alot of Regulation

1281
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
Call me later

1282
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
It's in second.

1283
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,304
It's very easy to shut down

1284
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
For local government

1285
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
But you don't allow innovation

1286
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,448
Happened what is Spike sharing with scooter sharing and other things

1287
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
People to try stuff

1288
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,288
It's not likely you brought some

1289
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
In the US

1290
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
Uber apps did not start

1291
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
Until 7

1292
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,967
Cisco uberX to experiment

1293
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
And I was 4 years after Uber got started

1294
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
So

1295
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
In China

1296
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:04,159
Despite the population the people think that China's government has

1297
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
RTD and

1298
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
The quieter you were still allowed

1299
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
To try sex

1300
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
So Without Rain

1301
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
People make fun of

1302
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,351
Example mobile

1303
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Pandolfo

1304
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
Data Mountain

1305
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
Is of assorted bikes

1306
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
And so forth

1307
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
Aziz making fun of that

1308
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,543
But at the same time without these

1309
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Experience the happen

1310
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
It's very difficult

1311
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
To come with something something new

1312
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
So having a government that can lay down infrastructure

1313
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,015
I'd be willing to not startups

1314
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,831
Experiment are critical for similar models

1315
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,623
Was to happen and take off your other

1316
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:42,047
The next question is from Daniel Chen the co-founder of fish up a start of the aims to help people establish and maintain healthy

1317
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Hobbit

1318
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,167
How do you deal with information overload in the world that's properly

1319
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Change it

1320
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,799
I love you ask me what's the right sector what

1321
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
What's a right track

1322
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,687
Or tackle issues like how do I adjust to a new country how do I be useful when I go back

1323
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,991
All these are very practical tok

1324
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
Tcole questions

1325
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
In the vices

1326
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Nights before I ask

1327
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,647
How do you think how you make

1328
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,023
And what a notice is everybody has a different kind of body clock

1329
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
You need to make a decision after

1330
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
Imperfect data

1331
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Difference for

1332
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
I think the

1333
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Best

1334
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,519
If I delete local sports as example

1335
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
The best

1336
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,823
Football player the best stock

1337
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,127
2-player the best basketball player baseball player

1338
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,407
Baking mix split

1339
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
The second decision

1340
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
Extremely quick

1341
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,271
You value the value of a quarterback

1342
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:38,879
Because once he has a ball within two seconds you can make Split Decision with for reeds

1343
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Who discovered about you

1344
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,975
And the build you make decision quickly is

1345
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
To me almost everything

1346
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,327
I noticed all the people take more time to make decisions

1347
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
And

1348
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
Usually the qualities

1349
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Doesn't improve

1350
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,447
With more time pekin

1351
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
So how do you make

1352
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,799
Decision was imperfect about your short. Of time

1353
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,359
To me is almost the single most efficient

1354
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
I'll call you when

1355
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
Cuz it's summer

1356
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,223
For you to succeed from 0 to 100

1357
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
No matter how smart you are

1358
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,319
You might might have maximum number of mistakes

1359
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,879
Cuz everybody has any know enough IQ to succeed

1360
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
Emma Dixon

1361
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
Martin

1362
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
Happy WQ

1363
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
To succeed

1364
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
As well but at the same time

1365
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
How do you

1366
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,863
Feel comfortable decisions quickly and learn from that

1367
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,727
And be able to lift through some of the mistakes that you never broke up before you get the right answer

1368
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
If you don't make enough mistakes

1369
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:32,639
You cannot get the right answer because if the hypothesis need to be tested before you perfect it

1370
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,943
Baby is super smart

1371
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
Give me something up how to make Christmas

1372
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,343
So how do you make decision very quickly I'd love to do them practice

1373
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Over 10000 hours

1374
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
To train yourself to make

1375
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
Simple decisions officially

1376
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,743
So the overtime

1377
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,047
If you follow the intuition of how to make

1378
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,375
So that overtime dude you're so used to doing that

1379
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
What pressure comes

1380
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
You don't get scared

1381
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,727
Did you practice for y already

1382
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
You said with a simple decision first

1383
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
What opportunity cost is low

1384
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Delta. Overtime

1385
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,151
It's about time you have to make a big decision

1386
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
To me I thrive on

1387
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
I love having

1388
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
The challenge of bacon

1389
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Keep up positions

1390
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
And I love

1391
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Go to bed early

1392
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Think about it while sleep

1393
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,159
Wake up in the morning when there's no one bother me

1394
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
I'm sick about those choices again

1395
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
And when you think hard

1396
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
What's the point of meditating

1397
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,095
For those stuff for 5 hours

1398
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Intuitive

1399
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
It becomes very clear what to do

1400
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,031
And this is one aspect of East Asian culture especially Japanese Zen culture

1401
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
That I like to study

1402
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,103
How do you be so calm

1403
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,895
And so focused

1404
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
And block out everything else

1405
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,247
To be able to make that split-second decision

1406
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
And this is why I love watching

1407
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Sports

1408
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
Seahawks key players

1409
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
When championship

1410
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:50,207
In the most critical man that I'm with him the socks no second left on the clock

1411
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
How do you so calmly

1412
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,047
And nail. Shot to win the game

1413
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
What hits a baseball hit

1414
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
To get the Scorpion

1415
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,935
Those are the most fun things in life

1416
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
And if you train yourself

1417
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
Since College

1418
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
How to do that well

1419
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,335
But I'm usually the certain age

1420
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,151
You're naturally know what to do because it becomes second nature

1421
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,223
A practical level what are some life

1422
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:17,599
Hacks you used to make sure you consume a vast amount of

1423
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,415
Give me the give very

1424
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:28,095
Doctor is as well because you were consumed a lot of information every day and

1425
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:32,191
There's a lot of news out there with how to decide what's worth your time and what's not

1426
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,007
For me is I have a develop a sense

1427
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,799
Of what is important when

1428
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,847
So that I can say hey

1429
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
2 high back in 2013 what's the train

1430
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
Remember debating with people

1431
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,503
He was at why doesn't make sense

1432
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,879
So you asked me how do I know to height is it back in 2013

1433
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
Just ate entire Chinese bacon

1434
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,279
Because either you have that sense

1435
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
Or you don't

1436
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
Only if you keep on trying it

1437
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,167
You get a write more off of that.

1438
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
Beautiful but intuitive feel

1439
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,055
So I am not good at giving very practical advice

1440
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:14,175
Is based on principles and Eufaula

1441
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
You pick cotton

1442
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
Better at

1443
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,319
I figured out what it is and is very personal far for everyone

1444
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:25,695
When I first came back to you as soon as we see but if people say you have that work in the US for over 10 years

1445
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
You're not a woman shop

1446
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
You don't even know all the Bratz

1447
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,351
How do you know you picking the right company

1448
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,423
For me it's just if you start the

1449
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,703
Societal trends

1450
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
You know

1451
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
What should happen

1452
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
When I first came by

1453
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,895
Falafel think that beat Amazon you had to be in a highly differentiated

1454
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
High margin

1455
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
Hybrid value

1456
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,735
Be got to be loved by you

1457
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Broadway

1458
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,063
San Francisco LA and so forth

1459
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,367
And I disagree I said

1460
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Describe the mass markets

1461
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,439
I know in China that work

1462
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
Galaxy users in the us as well

1463
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
Janus contrarian point of view if you ask me how do I know

1464
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,399
It's a matter of understanding what is the landscape

1465
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,703
Figure out with a competition is weak

1466
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,775
We're figure out where there is underserved Amman

1467
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,591
And be able to capitalize up quickly fashion out a people do

1468
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,687
So the ability to make decision quickly is play something real

1469
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
What's going on

1470
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
Who's winning who's losing who's strong who's not

1471
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:26,111
Where's the opportunity where is the pain pill that starts off yet

1472
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Nfocus on it

1473
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
With the waste to

1474
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Make it

1475
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,487
More easily accessible

1476
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
For people who are underserved

1477
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,351
So you apply that principle you can find Opportunities anywhere

1478
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,215
The next question is from Lawrence clock a business development leader at NBA

1479
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:45,055
Are there instances of new tech entrepreneurs that don't know how to code

1480
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
Becoming successful in China

1481
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Wow

1482
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407
If you're not a p.m.

1483
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,199
The most successful

1484
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:55,039
Founding China who's not a colder is obviously Jack Ma

1485
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,599
Can you please tell me a joke about today

1486
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
Becky says alright if someone has an uncanny ability

1487
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,767
To build a brand

1488
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,327
As a Superuser is super consumer

1489
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,911
As someone who is just like love near retail and therefore knows

1490
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
What is still missing

1491
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
A lot of Chinese go to Japan Dubai

1492
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
You know tortoises

1493
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
He's the one you're behind

1494
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
Yeah that's amazing

1495
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,223
Buy the toothbrush from Japan these brushes are better than American brush to stay

1496
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Stop your teeth

We rush

1498
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
That song is this

1499
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,343
Stop products out there

1500
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
Who just defy the odds

1501
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,719
Bacon consumer happy

1502
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
You don't need ability

1503
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
To the cold and you just

1504
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,351
Not have a sense of what users still want

1505
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
Add people to

1506
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Book with designers

1507
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,423
Decide acronym product

1508
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
They can still be successful

1509
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,519
There's still a chance to be the next OC job

1510
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
In the consumer

1511
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Consumption

1512
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,151
Yeah I would say that your fear want to be in the entire sector like

1513
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
You don't have to know how to code but you need to be able to attract

And no matter how tough it is they always find a way to make it work

1558
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,151
Is so part of me feel that

1559
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,943
I am very fortunate

1560
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,063
Reliving your aware number of the neighbors are screwed from a billion 2.5 billion for being on a smartphone

1561
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
And yet

1562
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,903
When I go to Emerging Markets or other places

1563
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
You mean the US

1564
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
There places where Tech has to make as much

1565
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,511
Positive impact

1566
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535

Chinese feces are

1571
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
And I just feel that

1572
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
If we can show

1573
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,567

1574
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359

1582

I don't like those kind of contrast in those kind of

1583

Darryl Dawkins

1584
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:19,071

1585
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,375
Way to make impact

1586
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
