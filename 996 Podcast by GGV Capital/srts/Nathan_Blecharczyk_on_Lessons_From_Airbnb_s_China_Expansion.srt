By graduating from Harvard

32
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
We have no Nate

33
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
Https apartment only for a long time

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
Since I think I sodi as early as 2010

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
We didn't end up being a master then

36
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,368
But fortunately for years later we became one has been quite interesting Journey

37
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Working with

38
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
Now we on their baby itself but also on the

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
China

40
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
So you have recently been appointed

41
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
As a chairman of a Airbnb China

42
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
But he had been involved with China on all four for a while

43
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Numbers from the very beginning

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,288
Take us through. Journey how did you guys start thinking about

45
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
China and what the process engineer you took to get to where you are today

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
Yeah well as a founder

47
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,296
Been thinking about China since we first got involved in the story goes that

48
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm going to go way back so we made our first real International push outside of the US in 2011 and 2012

49
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,792
And the focus then was on Europe that's what we're facing lot of competition at the time

50
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,424
But by 2013 European really settle down and we're looking towards Asia

51
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
And in 2014 we basically one of our four strategic initiatives for 2014 was what we called when

52
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Asia

53
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,968
And very quickly going into that we had a realization that

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,576
That China was going to drive a lot of the network effects in Asia

55
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
That's all the Travelers are coming from China around the world but also in Asia has a huge huge percentage of the in

56
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
About travel at these other countries

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
We actually at the time

58
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,704
Had an otherwise contemplated really focusing on China we have heard all the stories about how challenging is

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Enter the market

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,056
How what western companies tech companies are often not successful

61
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
It's a we were actually focused on places like Japan

62
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Korea

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,760
But it was to that realization that all the inbound Travelers may be coming from China that we realized that

64
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Okay China

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
A critical part of this equation

66
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
And

67
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Then the question became

68
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
How do we do this in a way that we think we can beat

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Successful because my

70
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,047
Our starting assumption was after hearing all these stories

71
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
That the default is to be unsuccessful

72
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:26,495
Do we have to have a pretty strong rationale for 4/4 kind of how we're going to approach this in

73
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
You have to be

74
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Choiceful

75
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
And so

76
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
R R Us

77
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,943
We realize our unfair Advantage is there

78
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Global Network

79
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
That we have the fact that we have today

80
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,575
4 1/2 million homes in 191 different country

81
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
And we thought okay

82
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,951
We're really the only company in the world that can provide an outbound travel solution to Chinese

83
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Travelers

84
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Let's just focus on that

85
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
In other words we're not focused on the domestic

86
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
China

87
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
And we're very explicit about

88
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
That really shaped

89
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
The first

90
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
Probably two or three years of our China story

91
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,823
Starting in basically mid-2014

92
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
Initially the focus was all on

93
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Really product

94
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
Actually there's a lot of product and simply didn't work in China

95
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
I do too

96
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
Restrictions we had a lot of dependencies on

97
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
On Facebook on Google

98
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
Question Alaska for load

99
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,047
It said we had to basically pull out those dependencies

100
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
How to find other Solutions

101
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
In a lot of stuff just wasn't relevant to in terms of like social network integration so we had to

102
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
Connected to local app stores local social networks

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Local payments

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
So this is actually

105
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
You know if they're not at work.

106
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
It is still ongoing but I say the first

107
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Year

108
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
You're in a half was really dominated by just fixing the Prada

109
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
The basic

110
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
Make it work

111
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
Which of course made

112
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Remarkable difference

113
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
What's the products aren't working

114
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
Growth really did start to take off

115
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
I would say

116
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
Parallel to that we were exploring setting up a local

117
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
And that took a lot of time I think

118
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Going into the market

119
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,495
Yeah we had heard all the stories and then people ask you all these questions that are

120
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,799
A little bit daunting like you know how do you think about

121
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Data privacy in corporate structure in

122
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,431
Yeah there's all these things that as a newcomer

123
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
You know you don't really have a strong perspective on or any instincts

124
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
And so

125
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
And I think at the time we definitely

126
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,183
Basically asked every company that experience why did China ask them

127
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
How they approach these things

128
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
He's really learning

129
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
A lot

130
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
It took a while to get through that

131
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,911
Yeah it wasn't really until probably two years and that we really had a

132
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
Look like to be up and running

133
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
That was properly licensed and everything like that and that's when we started to hiring

134
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
The team

135
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Sew-in not basically

136
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Mid-2015

137
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
We started building the team

138
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,247
It was quite small for a while will pass worth it today

139
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
We have a hundred fifty people in Beijing

140
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
It's going pretty quickly

141
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
Started 2017 with around 30

142
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
And

143
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
And we saw a big

144
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Transition about a year-and-a-half ago which is

145
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,887
Although the initial Focus was on outbound travel

146
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,703
What happened in China what just happened elsewhere to is

147
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,519
Travel Store Broad and they have a good experience on Airbnb

148
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Then they come home

149
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
PlayStation hey maybe I can do it at home

150
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,991
And so organically a lot of people are signing up to host who had previously been Travelers

151
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
In China

152
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
And so today we have about a hundred seventy-five thousand

153
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
Homes in China

154
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,975
That have largely materialized organically over the last 2 years

155
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,047
And we spent actually very little money

156
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
To create this domestic business

157
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:38,239
Eisenhower domestic is actually a very important part of the strategy to but I think we'll get more into that later

158
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
I remember in one of our first meeting with you

159
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
You ask a Glen

160
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Fishing

161
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
And myself

162
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
A question that I asked you

163
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
Which is should you have the server in China

164
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Or outside

165
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
Do you have HIV or not

166
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,439
Investor from killing bats in the parent company

167
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
What supplements every Chinese

168
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
How do you guys work

169
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Through

170
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Those issues

171
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
What were the summer

172
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Useful advice you got

173
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
During the process

174
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Stop learning

175
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,007
Heading is a lot of started looking at China from us

176
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
And they're going through

177
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
Stop this in public

178
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
So you went through

179
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Quicken 2014

180
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Summertime

181
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
But you just need to ask a lot of questions

182
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
And so we

183
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
Would make us to China and we would go visit

184
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,903
All the companies we could both Chinese companies and Western companies in China

185
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
And sit-down with management

186
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,023
Really get their perspective get their advice I mean I think you

187
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Going into any country but especially China you have to be

188
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Student of the mark

189
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
And I think you have to go into it assuming

190
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
You know not

191
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
So having that blank slate is important

192
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
You get you hear a lot of things

193
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,943
Appetite has conflicting

194
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
If I Stay

195
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Xiamen

196
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
We Are One

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Tubidy

198
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
The classic one is United

199
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
You need a JV partner to enter the market

200
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
I'm in here

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Christelle

202
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,071
Which in our business is really hard to break apart One Market from another again because of the global Network effects common

203
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
Tech platform

204
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Yeah it really isn't a

205
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Separate business

206
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Uber

207
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
That's right

208
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
That's right so we were

209
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Resistant that idea

210
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
But yeah so many people tell you even today

211
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
That it without a local partner

212
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Who has a

213
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
Majority share

214
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
You're that that's kind of a recipe for not being

215
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Successful

216
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
JV or

217
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
How to stay together

218
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
And at the end

219
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
We give it all by Sia

220
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
I'd say also that you don't have to make all these

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
At once

222
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
And so are we. Like parallel process

223
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
The products work

224
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Could Happen immediately

225
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Setting up the local ID

226
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
A lot of time

227
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Getting lice

228
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Took a lot of time hiring to lot of time

229
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Yeah in the meantime you could still

230
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Visit China talking too many members

231
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
Meanwhile your business is growing and you're just learning

232
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
They tell me that's also

233
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
I think Q2 informative it's just

234
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Look what's happening organically

235
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Aside from what you are manually

236
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
And you can learn so much

237
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
So you're recently it be

238
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
China

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
I wonder what has been like four

240
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
How often do you go to church

241
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
It's very exciting for me because

242
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
I've been a part of it

243
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
Kind of decision-making on the bigger things from the beginning I was a huge

244
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
Advocate of taking asleep

245
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
Focusing on China

246
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Incel

247
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
Yeah it is great to be able to see the story through

248
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,327
The difference now is that I'm in a more operational capacity

249
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,143
So I get to try to keep that about every decision

250
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
I n

251
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Understand more of the contacts

252
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
And I think that's really fascinating because China is such a different Market

253
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
That

254
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
You need to do a lot of learning

255
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,895
And we are what you

256
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
What you read about is it just so different than here

257
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
That

258
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Yeah it

259
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
It would be less interesting ever

260
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Easy

261
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
So the fact that it's hard

262
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Make it really interest

263
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Teen challenge for me

264
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,303
How often do I go there I would say basically monthly right now I'll be going there on Sunday

265
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
Are you learning Chinese at all

266
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
And I learning Chinese

267
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,775
About a year-and-a-half ago I started

268
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
Doing a podcast series to learn Chinese

269
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,735
After about a month after I had to stop

270
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
The tones are just

271
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
Too much it just doesn't stick in my head

272
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
I guess

273
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Also people have proven that it's not

274
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Extremely nice

275
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
Language but it really high

276
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,679
Sounds like a challenge

277
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,799
So I wonder what is airbnb's trying to team working on now you mentioned there over a hundred people there

278
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
I say we have a 154 times at the moment

279
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
About

280
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
From a functional perspective

281
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
60a say about of those people

282
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
60 are working on the product

283
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
And we intend to grow that never quite a lot

284
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
How we think product is

285
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,719
Probably the biggest sleeper in general for the business

286
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
And it is very measurable and

287
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
The second largest

288
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
Yeah contention would be able to host Community operations

289
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Really

290
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,519
Enmarket on the ground feet on the street type thing

291
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Where where

292
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
Hosting meetups

293
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
Inspecting property

294
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Things of that nature

295
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
There's probably easily

296
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
40 people in that group

297
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
And then I say every function has at least

298
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
That 10 to 25 people

299
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
It's a complex business

300
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
And so you know we have a

301
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Very build-out marketing team

302
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
That

303
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Yeah

304
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,399
I will be putting out a variety of home-grown campaigns throughout the year

305
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,775
In other words not leveraging Global assets but everything kind of original from the ground up

306
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Even the concept

307
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
Public policy horse has a big deal for us

308
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
And so that varies

309
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
Save-A-Lot municipality by municipality and so

310
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
That also requires a lot of people

311
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
So

312
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
There's quite a lot going on

313
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
I will say that part of our precious

314
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
China has been to build up

315
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
I'm at autonomous a team as possible which

316
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,095
Largely comes down to making sure that

317
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
All the resources needed to ask

318
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
You are actually in China

319
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
And we've really tried to cut all the execution

320
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
From San Francisco

321
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Possible

322
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,895
John the early days a lot of product working and other work is getting done here or out of the Singapore

323
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
And we've really gotten quite strict about that

324
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
I mean despite the fact that there are others in the company you want to help out we've really

325
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Push all the EX

326
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Sakura shocked that China

327
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
It's all happening in the same office

328
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Badaling Beijing

329
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
But if we take

330
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Separate

331
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
Cannabis antutu

332
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
And talk about album

333
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
First

334
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
That's where the

335
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Linkable Network

336
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Artifact is the strongest

337
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,727
He has said repeatedly in many conferences

338
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,311
China's largest outbound tourism marketing

339
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
And grab the largest was a busy

340
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
44u

341
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
How do you plan a skill that business

342
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Does it require a separate team to manage

343
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
All the inventory worldwide

344
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Cater to the Chinese

345
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Tuscaloosa

346
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
It does not really require that much of a separate approach

347
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
Especially on the supply home side

348
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:33,471
The homes that Chinese Travelers are booking are no different than anyone else around the world

349
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Thus far

350
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
And

351
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
That doesn't seem to have slowed us down

352
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
I do think there's a question on my mind which is as we

353
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,247
Become more mainstream and we move Beyond Tier 1

354
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
Tr2 tr3

355
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
You know what

356
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
How did the requirements change

357
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
I'd say a lot of our travels right now

358
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Have some comfort level of English

359
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
And of course that's not representative of the market

360
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
And so

361
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
Yeah we have experiment thought about you know how can we better match Chinese Travelers with Chinese hosts abroad but

362
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
How can we

363
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Help translate user-generated content

364
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
I think of that nature but by and large dust by we having

365
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Gone that way yet

366
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
I'd say

367
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
On the domestic front

368
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
You know we've got a lot of things

369
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Totally naked China

370
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Free sample

371
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
We have a much bigger emphasis on quality

372
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
Making sure that

373
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Philosophical

374
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Philosophically want to make sure that

375
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
We don't have what we call a two-tier system

376
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,823
We want to shut that the quality of the product in China is of equal quality to that

377
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Globally

378
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,431
And it's a little bit challenging at different prices

379
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,247
What's peanuts drastically there's just a far lower price point

380
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,343
And there's also an abundance of

381
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Home Inventory

382
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Make it home

383
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
In China

384
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
You get a lot of inbound homes.

385
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Are kind of empty shells

386
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
Yeah that doesn't doesn't happen that aren't actually lived in

387
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
And so

388
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
We have actually prioritize quality over growth

389
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
And we actually

390
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
I routinely taking down properties in China

391
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
That we feel don't best represent the brand

392
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
I'd say if we let the business grow completely organically in China

393
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
It might tend towards

394
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Kind of service department

395
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
A little bit more professional

396
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
And

397
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
Yeah we have is this brand image

398
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
All about

399
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,815
Unique local authentic travel on its very aspirational brand want to make sure we preserve that

400
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Hi in China and so

401
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
Some of the operational things to do

402
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Support that

403
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
On the ground photography

404
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
Brassy doing in person

405
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Inspections on homes in certain cases

406
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,895
Everything that gets posted on a cyclist reviewed at least online

407
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,735
And often results in a phone call where we coach and we talked about how to

408
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
Make this host even more successful

409
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
It's all just a lot more Hands-On in China

410
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
Then we've done anywhere else

411
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
Speaking of the brand in the lower-tier cities

412
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,559
Are they white issued a lot of Western companies face when they expand into China

413
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,935
Is that their brand is perceived to be very Western and it's hard for them to connect with the grassroot users

414
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Many of the Miranda lower-tier cities

415
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,079
So is perceived to be podc or not connected with

416
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Energy of the land

417
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
I wonder if that is that something behind

418
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,247
The decision to name Airbnb I being in Chinese

419
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
Which means welcome each other with love in Chinese

420
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,879
What efforts have been made to make sure the brand is

421
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
Perceived as more grass

422
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,071
Absolutely. That's one star Chinese

423
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
Brand name

424
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Ciara go now

425
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,727
And so they're actually a few years that we eat when we had Airbnb

426
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
And that

427
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Yeah I don't

428
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
There's no evidence that that was slowing us down

429
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
That being said as we thought about becoming more mainstream

430
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
Yeah there is a hypothesis

431
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Just that we needed a local

432
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Name

433
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
I would say 1 year in

434
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
I think we are correct about that

435
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Sada latest kind of marker

436
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Getting surveys

437
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
I wish definitely showed that I'd being is

438
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,303
Resonating a lot more and more memorable than Airbnb

439
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,631
Did I'm sure it's very difficult for a local person to

440
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Just to say I remember since

441
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
Has nothing to do with the language

442
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
So I think

443
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,383
I think that was a good choice for us but if you look at our history at starting about that it wasn't really necessary on day one

444
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
I think it's more nicer now everything about growing the domestic business

445
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
And branching out

446
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Her2 Q3 study

447
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:36,415
So when you enter China than the market was in a blank slate like there were quite a few

448
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,511
Other company domestic companies that were doing home rental or Home Sharing

449
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
How confident were you that you were going

450
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,375
To be able to carve out a meaningful Market

451
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
How do you perceive Local Company

452
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Well

453
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
I was always very confident about the outbound p

454
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,919
It's because I knew that something that we could do uniquely well it'll be a long time before local companies

455
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Build an outbound business

456
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
And so that part I think was always

457
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
Pretty clear in and honestly that was our only aspiration

458
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Begin with

459
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
Maybe there was an assumption that the mess

460
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Business

461
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
What's likely going to be too hard

462
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
And so

463
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
We explicitly did not focus on that for

464
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Two to three years

465
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
It was until we saw that organic growth that we started getting a little bit more ambitious

466
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Looking at

467
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,495
The competition which there's been a lot I think at one point there was about a dozen companies

468
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
In the earlier days now.

469
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Just a few

470
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,615
There's been a lot of consolidation in the meantime

471
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
We've kind of seen some of the story in other countries

472
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
As well I mean it certainly has been a lot of Airbnb

473
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Clowns in Europe

474
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
And I'll swear

475
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
And

476
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah I think there's a few learnings that we

477
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Seen elsewhere which is that

478
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
Airbnb is a Marketplace

479
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,303
Airbnb's of C2C Marketplace consumer-to-consumer

480
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
It's a community

481
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
And it's built on

482
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Trust

483
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
And often through use a referral

484
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
And that

485
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
Growing that kind of business takes

486
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Time

487
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
And what we seen with

488
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Competition

489
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
Around the world

490
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Is that

491
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
They look at us and they say that's a successful model

492
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
I'm going to raise a bunch of money

493
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
I try to speak

494
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Quickly

495
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,391
I think that is a common mistake

496
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Because

497
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
To build

498
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
The kind of business we built we purposely have kind of gone slow

499
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
And it's been built through word-of-mouth

500
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
And use our testimony and Trust

501
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
Building

502
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
And not through direct sales

503
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
And so what we've seen in other countries

504
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,799
Not specifically, but other countries is

505
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
People raise a hundred million dollars

506
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
Hirevue sales team

507
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
And it really becomes hard like a Beetle seat

508
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
Model almost right off the bat

509
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,087
And if it starts out that way it's really hard to then back into a C2C model

510
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
The minute

511
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
All your homes feel like the professionals

512
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
Suddenly the average person doesn't feel like they belong

513
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
In that commit

514
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
And so

515
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
Oh that's one generalization I would make

516
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
You know the other thing is that

517
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
We've been nothing

518
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
Very honest with ourselves which is to recognize that

519
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
We will never move as fast as it truly local come

520
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
We will try to

521
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
But I think

522
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,687
I think you have to be honest about you know what your strengths and weaknesses are

523
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,015
And so you know the weaknesses that

524
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
We will

525
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,623
Never move as fast as local company and will probably never have the appetite

526
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
To spend as much

527
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
Money as a local company would be wild

528
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
I mean it is truly

529
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Eye-opening

530
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,328
How much are oil companies willing to spend spend spend

531
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
With very little Revenue

532
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,192
But based on the idea that you know it's kind of winner-take-all

533
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
And

534
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
And I think that works

535
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,544
Floor companies

536
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,360
As an outside I can do that just something that

537
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
It's not going to work for us

538
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,456
Why did that would work as the outbound

539
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
So that has been kind of our focus and I think what has

540
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Say that despite the other 200

541
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:50,208
So just leave is also investor into. Which some people have called the Airbnb of China

542
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,280
High School to explain what Twitter is and how

543
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
Maybe it's different from Airbnb

544
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
Picture

545
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
To tok a starter

546
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
With the help of a c trip

547
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
Partial these days are HomeAway

548
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
Growing in the US and also Airbnb

549
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,592
So the idea was to give them quite a bit of money

550
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Seedling grow fast

551
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,456
And inside humidity getting to

552
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
Going out to look more professional

553
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
Managed serviced apartments type

554
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
So you have some more of a Beat

555
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Because he filled ncdc for sure

556
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Anna

557
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,232
If captures. Segment of the population in China which

558
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Definition need for

559
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,840
And we also saw in the market that there is a shout out to

560
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,448
Nothing more but much more quiet my price point than the both Airbnb into jaw

561
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,776
And that one's phone to buy lot of local money varby money

562
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,872
And it's going after the more value consumers as young students

563
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,688
At like 10 bucks 15 bucks a night

564
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
Type of accommodation

565
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
And so

566
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
China Hustle

567
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
4 tier cities and at least in this Eichmann

568
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
3tier competitors

569
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
Ichiban house, 424

570
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,280
But obviously we think that the market is big enough you can come in multiple 1

571
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,560
Did the way I was

572
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
Describe the difference between say aramid touche

573
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,424
And it goes back to what I said earlier about how they

574
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
How to bootstrap your business

575
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:10,080
Immediately went after at Sunset apartment buildings that had 20 vacant units at a time

576
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
Yeah sometimes even hotels

577
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Network service

578
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
Apartments

579
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
And so they brought on a lot of

580
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Inventory lot of homes

581
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
Apartments very quickly

582
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
But they're all fairly generic

583
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
And they didn't have the same above character

584
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
That are individually owned

585
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Homer Park

586
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
At what

587
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,840
And so there is a large quantity of inventory but it didn't necessarily stand out as being

588
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
I think

589
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
That much

590
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,704
More unique or cool relative to a hotel

591
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,032
And so I think it was hard to build a

592
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
Interesting consumer brand around that

593
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
I think they've done a very good job and having a lot of supply

594
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
I think they've had a much harder job

595
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
Building Supply

596
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Consumers I think part of that is

597
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
Because there isn't as much of a brand

598
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,160
I'm around 2

599
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
Respect in China

600
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
I've grown

601
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Expendable

602
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
And so

603
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
Unlike in the US where

604
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Go to one of the

605
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
Big hotel chains in the US

606
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
Most of that building

607
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
All rooms haven't been

608
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
Refurnish

609
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
Where

610
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
Upgraded in the last 10 years

611
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
Internal audit new hotels coming

612
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,200
So to be to win against the hotel business

613
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,504
You need to have something that could differentiate

614
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Are BBQ to do it through

615
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Community Building

616
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
And

617
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
Pooja choose to do with her professionally managed

618
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Stop

619
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
That's why they make that

620
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Love you seem more places than

621
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Hotels Canby

622
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
So it's it's a it's a different way stock market for sure

623
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,168
Jerry yang founder of Yahoo has said on her show that

624
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,216
China is not a place for transaction

625
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
Training supplies for relationship

626
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
I wonder what has your experience

627
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Spinlife Beauty relationships

628
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
Especially as someone else

629
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Didn't grow up there

630
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
I totally agree with that

631
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,808
Again I going into the market I mindset has always been to be the student

632
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,856
Don't assume anything and

633
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Ask all the questions

634
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
There's no dumb question

635
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,208
I'm really thankful.

636
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
You know when I go to China people are been very generous

637
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
To take meeting

638
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
Very generous with their time and very generous with their advice

639
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,168
And I just say I like those casual interaction

640
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
Open all the doors

641
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,520
And expose you to a lot of warnings that that make you more

642
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Successful

643
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,640
I would also say that you know it's very easy to not know what's going on as an outsider

644
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
Like when you don't understand the language of the customs

645
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
I think it's very easy to get the wrong impression

646
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,112
So when you hiccup more transactional approach you think you're on the same page about self

647
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
You think something went well

648
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
Because you had some quick Exchange

649
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,536
And you thought you took away the right message

650
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Do you have to get it

651
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
And so I think it's only when you

652
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Spend

653
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Atlanta

654
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
Hours with somebody

655
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,472
That you really kind of

656
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Truly get honest

657
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,800
Same page and I kind of have an understanding

658
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
United exhaust

659
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Did a culture

660
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
And this is from an outsider's perspective

661
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Buy it

662
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,296
It just values relationship the fact that you everyone always has a gift for you

663
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
When when they come to visit or are you visit them even

664
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
I think

665
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
Is a sign of valuing

666
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Relationships

667
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
And putting an emphasis on that

668
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,328
Forza run efficiently so we have gifts

669
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
Forney

670
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
How to do want to share your experience on that

671
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
You also didn't grab email in China

672
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,616
I think China's open the market has very merry tok

673
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Oxycodone

674
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,944
If you go into the market with the attitude that

675
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
You going to learn a lot

676
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,504
Contribute

677
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Sometimes

678
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
Contribute before you get anything back

679
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,416
It's it's a country where a lot of people of were willing to

680
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
I'm work with you

681
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,256
Because of your willingness to

682
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
To do something good and positive

683
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
Earlier this evening

684
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
We had another talk

685
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
In which an Enterprise from Singapore

686
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
It's trying to sell

687
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,264
Their service pin to both us and China

688
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,568
And now she found out China more welcoming

689
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Yeah I sold the product worked

690
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,712
The the customers like Alibaba intention willing to fast-track them

691
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,272
Giving more resources to help him to build a product

692
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Roanoke

693
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Quickest sooner

694
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,416
Because they know the customers know that they can use the solution and help him win

695
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
And that woman was not openness

696
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
I also work tonight 6 to get stuff done

697
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
Is almost very difficult to find anywhere in the world

698
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
Even with

699
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Government relations I think it's

700
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
The super elevator

701
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,984
Which is to say going to the conferences

702
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Talking about the topics

703
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
That are important

704
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
2

705
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
The officials

706
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,688
Get out grabbing the meetings telling the story

707
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
Signing the memorandum of understanding

708
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
You all these

709
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,856
Things go a long way and I'd say are you a fairly unique

710
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
The China some of its Asian more Broadway

711
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
But I say in China

712
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
These

713
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
Things have really open doors

714
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Brusque

715
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,120
Where you guys we have taken care of the western approach

716
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
I think we would be kind of

717
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Shut up

718
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
And so

719
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
And I think

720
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
I wouldn't have known any of this

721
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Without having a local tea

722
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,592
And I think that's another part of like our approach

723
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Has been to

724
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Build a local team in Beijing

725
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
Really Empower them

726
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Make sure that

727
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
All the execution happen to that

728
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
They basically guide me

729
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
How to trade these walk-in clinic

730
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
Destructive relationships

731
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
Versus taking

732
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
What would otherwise be probably can I eat with thrush

733
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Randall you have

734
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
About Honda 50

735
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
People in China

736
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
In August is a huge Market

737
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
You can easily see

738
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
10x if not hundreds

739
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Nice ice

740
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
How do you plan to

741
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
Rollatini China over

742
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,688
Well in general with our model it is relatively operationally light

743
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
I will say one of the unique things about China is

744
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,368
The cost of Labor can be laughing so enables a lot more operational model

745
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
How did you see us a lot of the Shanghai to make

746
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,488
NY China economy so successful in China

747
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
The fact that

748
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,376
There's so much labor available to assist in making the transaction goes smooth

749
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
That being

750
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Said

751
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
And I think

752
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,008
We're still going to take a relatively disciplined approach

753
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Tuacahn

754
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
How we grow

755
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
Bad can't have a growth class like I said earlier

756
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,944
I acknowledge that we probably will never be willing to spend as much

757
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
At the competitors

758
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:14,112
But we will definitely spend more than we do another country is in fridge that but we're doing a China

759
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
Having under 50 people on the ground we've done nowhere else

760
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
And it is our only product

761
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
Team outside of the US

762
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
And so

763
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
We're definitely willing to think different

764
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
I do think

765
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Look at that

766
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
The discipline can also be good

767
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,496
How much does a reflection of how we approach the market

768
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
There's a fine balance between

769
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
High conviction and paranoia

770
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
And I think you need both

771
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
I think we went to the market

772
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,320
Having done a lot of reflection on her strategy but we've also could have stuck to a gun to that strategy

773
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
At the same time

774
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
I'm constantly paranoid about

775
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
What are we missing

776
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
How are we doing

777
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,536
Are we falling behind we're getting ahead

778
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
And I think

779
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,888
It's a fine balance between conviction and paranoid because when you're paranoid

780
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
You can easily question your conviction and change direction

781
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,032
Which if you do that too many times this big problem

782
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,592
At the same time if you have so much conviction

783
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
That

784
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
You know you're kind of have a

785
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
You got your kind of overly confident

786
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
That's a big problem

787
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
So I think that's

788
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
Been critical as we think about

789
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,904
Yeah do we do things like we do here do we do things like

790
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,696
We see others doing in China

791
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
It's definitely a both

792
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
And

793
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,584
I think finding that middle ground and sticking with it

794
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
While also being very reflective is critical

795
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,472
Travels inherently a very Network driven business

796
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,032
That the bigger you are the more dependents you have

797
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
The network is that it's going to be worth more

798
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
One of the simple math we did

799
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,432
Before investing you guys in 2014

800
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
2015

801
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,808
Was that the Priceline of that point in time whiskey billion dollars and they didn't crack China

802
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
Fast forward 3 or 4 years later

803
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,648
Their bodies and no 90 billion

804
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
Infantino grow

805
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,000
But you have something that's harder for them to replicate

806
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,328
In China the taking a more indirect approach that you know

807
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
Lately investing super early on

808
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,448
And most recently they invest in meituan

809
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,752
Is this daily activity encourage

810
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:12,384
Agoda and other assets they have to go to China to partner with a lot of people in China go out for the Alabama Market

811
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,968
After using the indirect approach

812
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Is a

813
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
Feasible approach

814
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,112
I do think that by strategically investing other companies in China

815
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
That it is a productive work out for them

816
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
Mary Scully after the album Market

817
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,280
I think it's certainly is it's a safe approach

818
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
And

819
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
It's

820
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
Somewhat of an incremental

821
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
I think

822
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
That can be a very smart way to

823
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Start

824
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
And based on what they weren't that experiences

825
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
They might decide to lean into it more

826
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Which I think they have over

827
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
4 time

828
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
And it's not unlike us

829
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Right where we started off making

830
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,784
Basically a product decision to invest and resources and fix

831
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Tena products

832
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
Then we decide to set up a local entity but really still

833
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
Limit our involvement out battles

834
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
A lightweight and Deborah

835
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
The now it's a full-fledged

836
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Fully

837
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Staffed

838
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
For each function

839
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
Team focusing on domestic

840
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
In addition to outbound

841
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
And so there's been a progression there as we've learned

842
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
And I think

843
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
The decisions they've made in

844
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
Play doubt

845
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
It's basically

846
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Allowing them to work as they go

847
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
So you don't basically

848
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
Jump

849
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,992
Too far to something you don't understand

850
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
And an n

851
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
For them

852
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,904
Domestic otm marketing channels very different

853
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Gazelle

854
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
Etsy Tramadol authority of Versailles

855
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,280
Oxygen Bar

856
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Buffalo China

857
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
You Got Served

858
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
You going to China

859
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,192
Yeah she can compete against local players in the in the

860
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
In the long run

861
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,616
How do you want to grow the Potomac business in what segment of the

862
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
The populist do on the focus on

863
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
I should have mentioned this

864
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
The earlier one of the questions but you're the reason why we

865
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
We

866
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,600
How to expand it in bishan

867
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,184
To include domestic wasn't simply because it was organically taking off

868
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
I mean that was

869
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,744
That gave us confidence

870
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
I think from a strategic perspective lights

871
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,096
Actually really critical that were successful

872
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
What's a domestic

873
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Is that

874
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Domestic is more frequent

875
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,264
And it's relevant to a larger part of the population

876
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,848
And so we have a concern that if we're not successful at domestic

877
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,664
Then somebody else would I find what Home Sharing is

878
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
China and it won't be Airbnb

879
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
And so as

880
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,576
As outbound travel becomes more common

881
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,904
Those outbound Travelers will already be customer

882
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
Hours of The Local Company

883
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
And end

884
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,024
It will not be natural for them to now come to Airbnb

885
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
Until I actually think our success domestically is

886
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Is a little bit of a race

887
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
To educate the market and build a relationship

888
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
That will hopefully blossom into an outbound

889
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Travel

890
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
The other kind of

891
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,872
Codependency between domestic and outbound is that

892
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
There's a very different

893
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,712
Adra dr's average daily rate

894
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
Especially the price people are willing to pay per night

895
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,320
This one Chinese Travelers go brought they pay

896
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
Going

897
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
International rate

898
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
Which is your more on the order of

899
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
90 hundred bucks tonight

900
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
Domestic travel

901
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,328
Is that a much lower APR because there are a lot of inexpensive hotels

902
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
And say yeah you're talking more in the $40

903
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Somewhere in there

904
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
And so

905
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
What that means though is it

906
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,568
Is very different economics what is your class structure isn't really that different

907
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,360
In other words

908
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
We justify a lot of our expenses

909
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
Based off of outbound wrapping

910
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
A lot of those Investments actually benefit our domestic

911
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Big business

912
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
Where is the local companies they only have domestic Revenue

913
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
So they actually have a

914
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,720
Much smaller Revenue pool which to justify

915
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Their cost that are willing

916
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
Burn a lot more money than we are

917
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
And so

918
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
They still spend

919
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
A lot even if they have less Revenue

920
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,472
Shuffle my business model perspective we can sustain

921
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Our business

922
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
In a much more healthy terms

923
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Because of this

924
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Duel Dino

925
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
They're coming back to you like

926
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
The importance of domestic and how we compete

927
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
You know I think it's really about

928
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
Continuing to draft off are outbound business

929
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
The Graduate domestic

930
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,160
Focus on quality because that's something that requires extra

931
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
For effort and work doing things in China we dumped

932
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Do elsewhere

933
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
But

934
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Don't

935
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
Spend money against just a domestic

936
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
Everything we spend money on

937
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Also

938
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Especially from me

939
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Consumer demand perspective

940
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Has relevancy for the outbound business

941
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
As well

942
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
And so the air like you just vibe

943
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,408
Troy on the outbound and it just so happens that it also grows

944
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
To know this point

945
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
13 years ago Jack ma made a decision

946
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
2 * 14

947
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Tok Mommy

948
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Listen to StarTalk

949
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,464
If he was worried that the Alibaba. Compass

950
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
Which is the outbound

951
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Tree business for Chinese

952
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
Supplies was hung

953
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
Stuff worldwide

954
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
Maybe under attack

955
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
EBay Crocs de Messi

956
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,216
E-commerce business in China

957
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
So you have to start elbow

958
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,848
Do nothing else is defensive measure to make sure that people who could

959
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Start selling the

960
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,152
If I'm the one

961
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
Will be selling on the top of the master bathroom

962
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
40 Celtics

963
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Customers overseas

964
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,088
And the second one that is over important for listen to know is that

965
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
In China we really value

966
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Frequency music

967
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,232
In the US a lot in this us we've been MBA textbook

968
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,792
You spell awesome learning about having high margin

969
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,400
Evens low-frequency it's okay but make sure you next time is good every order

970
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
You do is high-margin as is Great Britain

971
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,776
Those pens most likely end up being Manish

972
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
And so in in China we learn how you have hive

973
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
Highest frequency of usage look at WeChat

974
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,504
Look at table out you have high frequency of usage

975
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,064
The chance are you can spell that into

976
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Other business overtime

977
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
Without a high frequency of usage

978
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Having a user

979
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
You don't have any Leverage

980
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Start other business

981
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
That's why I'm a tendon pain which started off as

982
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
Groupon food ordering now it's

983
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Expanding into

984
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Ride-hailing movie tickets

985
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Travel and everything

986
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,032
I think also with different China it is is the mobile option

987
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Extremely high

988
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,896
You see all the activity on mobile in in with different mobile is

989
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
People only work with so many apps

990
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
We only have so many accents

991
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
And so I think there's kind of natural 10

992
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:17,184
To gravitate towards those same trusted providers that have your payment information on file that are already installed on your phone

993
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488
Versus venturing out and in trying something

994
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
New endeavor

995
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:25,120
Could you walk us through how Airbnb approaches localization how is your

996
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Chinese

997
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,448
Customer-facing product different from

998
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,568
That the one we used to and I heard that half of the booking in China

999
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
Through alipay now

1000
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
So what what what are other examples of

1001
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,968
Changes you've made to the product to suit

1002
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
The tastes and habits of Chinese

1003
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Consumers

1004
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
So there's the front end and the backend

1005
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
The backend exec

1006
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,136
She's quite expensive and I'll get that

1007
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
On the front end

1008
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
There's the obvious stuff

1009
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
You know in terms of

1010
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
The maps in The Social Network Integrations and

1011
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
Mobile app store in the alley.

1012
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
And by the way

1013
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
Something like alipay when he added that

1014
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
Is like a business

1015
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
Increase 15% overnight

1016
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,360
As you said it's now more than half the transactions by far

1017
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:12,736
You have a hotspot feature and had the business jump

1018
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,040
Double-digit percentage overnight so I was

1019
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Pretty cool

1020
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,416
So that was very packable other things we do that

1021
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Less noticeable

1022
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
The homepage is slightly different

1023
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
In China

1024
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,304
So I called the product

1025
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
White Pages

1026
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,632
Set up the pages to profile pages that display the homes

1027
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
It's different

1028
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,984
They basically lay out the information differently prioritize different things

1029
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
A funny enough

1030
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,872
The changes that the China team came up with they then tested globally and actually work

1031
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Well Global Excel

1032
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
Iced Out

1033
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,456
We took some lessons out of China in

1034
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Next part of the

1035
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
I would say a lot though is

1036
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,344
Similar in other words we made a decision

1037
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,160
From the start not to Forfeit codebase

1038
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
Not to create a separate app

1039
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
And so

1040
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,024
The byproduct of that is

1041
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
80%

1042
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
85%

1043
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Pretty similar

1044
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
On the back end

1045
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
There is a lot of

1046
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Complexity

1047
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
That can easily go under-appreciated

1048
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
And that complexity is

1049
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
To deal with

1050
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
The kind of data storage laws

1051
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
To deal with

1052
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
Site performance

1053
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
214 Compton

1054
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,040
We know we're not at social networks so that's not

1055
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,368
Not as big a hurdle for us of course

1056
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
There's that

1057
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
I would say fraud

1058
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,280
In China is quite sophisticated and the fraud we see coming out in China

1059
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,888
Oh yes it is very different than fried we see elsewhere until we actually have a

1060
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
Chinese Tech fraud Justice

1061
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:49,248
I said yeah and it's at least another thing is there's a lot of like

1062
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,344
Credit scoring Innovations coming out in session

1063
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
And these are good input

1064
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Into our trust

1065
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Tasty

1066
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,024
Answer these other things that we've invested a lot in the back and that you don't answer

1067
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
It is very important lesson

1068
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Volodymyr

1069
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
To realize

1070
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,728
Yes I did in just a moment on that I'll say that you can look at your numbers I feel really good

1071
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
But I think you really have to stand a check your numbers

1072
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Sendai

1073
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,616
Not get too excited too fast

1074
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,176
Because so often you realize that you know

1075
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,504
5 15% of whatever you're saying

1076
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
Might not be for real

1077
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
But and so

1078
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,344
I think that's another lesson

1079
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
From China is that

1080
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
You have to have a dedicated team

1081
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
He just like that you can't Take Your Eye Off the Ball

1082
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,816
And you can easily find yourself in a place where you thought your business was doing really great

1083
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
But it was actually

1084
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
All artificial activity

1085
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,752
So in China Millennials now account for over half of the travel Market

1086
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,592
And they're known for their taste for adventure and there are more open-minded

1087
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
I think Milano's now account for over 80% of Airbnb trying to Airbnb China Market which is a high proportion.

1088
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
The other countries

1089
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,368
Do you make any special efforts to appeal to Chinese millennials

1090
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,024
I think it's a little bit less of what we do and it's more about what we don't do that has caused this and in other words

1091
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
Chinese Millennials are materially different than their

1092
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Parents

1093
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,656
Which of course it's

1094
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,728
Does every country by an in China it's it's very start

1095
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
You have a different

1096
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
Comfort with language with

1097
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
International travel

1098
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,896
Especially around organized tours

1099
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Versus

1100
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
The free independent Tech planning

1101
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
With technology

1102
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,552
And so you know we just see young Travelers

1103
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,368
Having the ability and appetite

1104
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
To embrace Airbnb

1105
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
In a way that older Travelers

1106
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
Are prepared to take that leap

1107
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,304
We've also like not invested in

1108
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Working with tour operators

1109
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
So we haven't netsilik gone after the

1110
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
The order

1111
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
Market

1112
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
And

1113
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,288
Contrast that with other countries

1114
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
You know in China is 80%

1115
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,175
Millennial on the traveler side another countries that would be 50

1116
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
2%

1117
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
By comparison

1118
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,039
I think on the host side there's also a difference

1119
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
I don't know the official number but certainly

1120
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
From my anecdotal experience

1121
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
First month's rent

1122
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,207
He'll definitely see

1123
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,767
A lot of the house being younger typically

1124
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,863
They've come at it because they they traveled on Airbnb for

1125
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,911
Cesar from that angle where as in

1126
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Other countries

1127
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,519
Typically the hosts are older property owners

1128
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
Empty nesters

1129
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,359
I want to listen to what you said on this podcast

1130
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,407
If there's a way for you to

1131
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
Dumor China

1132
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,039
Album business with Millennials who may not be as fluent in English

1133
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
And there should be more of them than those who are

1134
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
English

1135
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
Even when you can crack that

1136
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
That should be a huge right before your domestic business overtime

1137
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
As well

1138
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Absolutely

1139
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
Absolutely I think your dad's

1140
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
That's going to be hot

1141
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
Maybe the next big challenge for us

1142
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
In terms of

1143
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Yeah we've accomplished a lot

1144
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,519
I think you're one cities

1145
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,359
Where networks are ubiquitous and extremely song

1146
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
Your presence here too but

1147
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
Yeah that's

1148
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
That's

1149
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
The really big part of the market

1150
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,503
M&M can weed

1151
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
Do as well there I think that will be interesting on the next year

1152
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,879
In preparation for this podcast was look at something

1153
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,183
Basic Chinese authorization stats

1154
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
They are

1155
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
I can cover like as Europe in US

1156
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,071
There are 14 cities in the US

1157
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
That has over a million

1158
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,631
Resume

1159
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,983
Heather 3 in the California here to San Diego San Jose and LA

1160
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
The three alone in Texas

1161
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
San Antonio Houston and Dallas

1162
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
There are

1163
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Just under 40

1164
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,455
Of such cities with over a million people each in

1165
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,735
Europe

1166
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Including turkey

1167
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,319
Putting China number is 160

1168
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
The number is going to double

1169
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
The next 10 to 15 years

1170
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,975
So when we look at 162 360

1171
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,559
With all these a million people each that's a huge Market

1172
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
For Airbnb to tok

1173
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,143
Yeah and I think I may have much rather

1174
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
Be popular with millennials

1175
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
Because yeah they're going to

1176
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:59,615
Grow older and and and you're going to try to go with them but I also think

1177
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
As millennials

1178
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,199
Go off at families they want to afford

1179
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Larger homes

1180
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,783
In urban areas which they have an affinity for

1181
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,575
I think we can be apart

1182
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,111
Of that Journey meaning I think

1183
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
We can help them

1184
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,023
To buy a bigger home to ever hire lifestyle and be that. That's what we seen elsewhere

1185
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
And so I think you know

1186
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
This is this

1187
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,655
In China this move towards urbanization

1188
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,775
And when you look at these Urban centers are growing so quickly but also becoming so expensive

1189
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,591
The affordability is actually becoming quite low

1190
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,663
Especially in the new development which I think a lot of the

1191
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Young Millennials aspire

1192
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
To live in

1193
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
I think we can actually be a part of the

1194
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
Dissolution that they're already familiar with

1195
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
And help them to afford

1196
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
A big arrest

1197
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
Valentina's precise astrology

1198
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
Government

1199
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
Is that a top 26

1200
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,999
B2xpress of 11

1201
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
So the other

1202
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
140 cities

1203
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
Are organized enough

1204
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,911
That connect the high-speed rail and then more Subway

1205
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
Do bees eat

1206
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
For Millennials to move to

1207
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
So you can see that

1208
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
You guys are moving along

1209
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
Calculator

1210
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,175
I think partly because of urbanization others

1211
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,479
Also a booming share economy there

1212
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:13,343
There's so many startups that describe themselves as Airbnb for this or Airbnb for that

1213
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
So there are startups

1214
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
That allow you to share bicycles

1215
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,975
Clothing basketball phone chargers

1216
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
Umbrellas luxury handbags

1217
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
I'm in the Chinese government actually

1218
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,399
Expects to grow the transaction of the Sherry County by forty percent

1219
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,191
Percent year-on-year over an ex

1220
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Skewers

1221
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:33,567
And by 2020 is expected to account for over 10% of China's GDP

1222
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
Why doesn't the sharing economy has

1223
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Take a note

1224
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,967
In China is your thing this Grill this sustainable going forward

1225
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,783
But I think the the urban density

1226
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
And share scale the market

1227
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
Helps a lot

1228
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
Detroit liquidity between

1229
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
Spider-Man

1230
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
I also think that the

1231
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
Low labor costs

1232
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Allow

1233
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
4

1234
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,327
A bit of hand-holding in terms of making

1235
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Can transactions

1236
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Workwell

1237
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
In other words

1238
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,703
Aladdin Marketplace in China are not

1239
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,519
QRC to see there's usually a component

1240
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Of hand-holding

1241
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,103
To facilitate the transaction at 11 that you wouldn't

1242
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
The elsewhere

1243
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,431
Usually as offline kind of runners

1244
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,479
Will help with the deliver AR

1245
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,783
Quality control taking inventory

1246
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
Stuff that we're Franklin

1247
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,599
Not cost effective in

1248
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
San Francisco

1249
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
By arguing and in alot of pain

1250
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Other countries

1251
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,559
So I think that's why we're seeing so much Innovation I'd also say like the government as

1252
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
Made a pretty strong message that like

1253
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
Innovation is welcome

1254
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:33,983
And for me it's such a different conversation when I go to China and

1255
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,543
The general Outlook of policy-makers are

1256
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,079
What's the new models

1257
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,871
To them are opportunist

1258
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,247
And there should be rules around his opportunities but they generally say new models are a good thing

1259
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
Let's do that

1260
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,343
But like left we're on our way into it and take steps together

1261
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Other countries

1262
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,951
Basically policymaker say

1263
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,511
Wow that sounds really cool

1264
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,351
But I have all my existing constituents running on old model

1265
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
And so we really need to

1266
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,167
Be cautious

1267
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,239
And basically do optimize for the incumbent

1268
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
In the industry

1269
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
And

1270
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
Kind of star from that mindset

1271
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
As opposed to seeing

1272
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,407
Everything new as a big opportunity

1273
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
It's so you know I think

1274
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
That helped some of these ideas

1275
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,319
To thrive Ematic bike sharing is a great example to

1276
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,159
Where are you bike sharing in China has been a little bit of a free-for-all

1277
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,743
And that's generally been accepted in a way that in the US at least

1278
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Then I think other

1279
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
Western world countries

1280
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,655
People said no you like you just going to be a lot of ground rules about where you can discard your bike

1281
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,447
And frankly needing to be

1282
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
License

1283
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
Before you can even

1284
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
Try this idea

1285
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,335
Has do you want to come in John

1286
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,735
I think a runny semen our show is quite unexpected is China actually has less regulations or

1287
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
People face

1288
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,807
Less regular tree

1289
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
Push pop when they

1290
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
Start new things in China that allowed to go find some

1291
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,719
People don't know that you know 10 years ago the most

1292
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,743
Valuable

1293
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
Probably try to come

1294
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,047
What is in China or China

1295
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
Mobile tunnel

1296
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
Control of petroleum

1297
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
And

1298
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
ICBC largest bank

1299
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,983
And 10 years later the most valuable

1300
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
Highest market cap companies

1301
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
All of china's tencent Alibaba

1302
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
2vz Bike Company

1303
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
With US dollar funds

1304
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,919
And this is also

1305
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
So for a

1306
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Country

1307
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
Run by Chinese

1308
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,783
Comes party

1309
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
That. Just something that you

1310
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
You cannot imagine

1311
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Was even possible

1312
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Bullfighting music

1313
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,999
In the same time you look at the speed of adoption

1314
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
Take picture example

1315
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,839
It doesn't come so fast so soon

1316
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
Partially because the government knows that

1317
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Dry sherry in Visalia

1318
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,983
Part of the solution to deal with traffic problem

1319
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
So is needed

1320
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
And Annie speed sort of

1321
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
Hard to figure out

1322
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
How helpful you can be when I pee

1323
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,687
And regulate accordingly after

1324
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,271
And so what happens is that you see new Dollar Tree in news

1325
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,575
Susan being try more quickly in China

1326
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
That you just met you are

1327
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,463
TV on top of that you think of China as a country that has 4.7 million

1328
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
Stem graduates

1329
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Every year

1330
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
Verses only less than 700 thousand

1331
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
In the US

1332
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,215
Ensure more people going to be more equipped

1333
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
Try and

1334
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,031
Design and enrolled on new product

1335
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
Faster pace

1336
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
Almost anywhere else in the world

1337
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,687
If politically stable and continue for the next 10 years

1338
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,991
It's an is hard imagine

1339
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,551
Airbnb not have a much bigger market share

1340
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,087
Norcross

1341
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
That it is today

1342
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,927
So it is imperative for American Stout

1343
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Figure out

1344
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
How to crack China

1345
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
Deception Point Market

1346
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Ignoring me

1347
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,887
And I say this is coming back to the topic of relationships with

1348
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,167
Came up earlier

1349
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,239
Yeah this is where I think the mindset in China is

1350
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
Yes you can do this

1351
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
But

1352
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,359
In the butt is we're going to kind of code about the regulation

1353
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Together

1354
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
It's very much based on the relationship

1355
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,015
I think you need to establish dialogue early

1356
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,831
And kind of give the heads-up about your intentions

1357
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:04,415
And there can be a lot of back-channel conversation and collaboration

1358
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
That you just don't see elsewhere

1359
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,255
Yeah that's where things can I come to a head

1360
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,071
Unfortunately and then there's a lack of progress

1361
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,863
In China I think is a lot of conversation

1362
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
On the back end

1363
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,679
About your how we going to navigate this

1364
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
And doing that a Cooperative manner

1365
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,031
Not too late or MVB on the spot bed

1366
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,591
We went to in this investment

1367
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
Thinking that everybody's popular most likely

1368
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
US Cellular

1369
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
Text out of a 6 seat

1370
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,015
In China the best

1371
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,575
I want people look at Uber as

1372
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Example that

1373
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Failte chine

1374
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
We actually just

1375
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,975
State chemical burn 2 billion dollars in town if you can 2014

1376
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
2016

1377
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
Butt. Tube in dollars. They clinical burned

1378
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
Ends up being a steak

1379
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
In

1380
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
DD

1381
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,703
Which is 2 years later is now Worth close to and I'm doing.

1382
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,775
For any mistakes I could be

1383
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
4X in 2 years

1384
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
Have you asked very good

1385
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,735
Obviously how they've done that earlier in 2013 when I broke the first meeting could have the same state Foley 20 min.

1386
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,271
But that was a true story

1387
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,367
But I think I think that we really think that

1388
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,927
Glennys teaching myself we all think.

1389
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,463
Did you do that

1390
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,743
Are babies unique people

1391
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,047
Prabhas Global Network

1392
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
You are running a

1393
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
That are big

1394
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Be quite different

1395
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
In China

1396
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Versus what other

1397
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
There's Donuts in the US

1398
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
So if we were

1399
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
We want to make sure that

1400
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:27,871
Thought I really appreciated your support. Thank you hun

1401
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,479
We're going to move to the last part of the show witches around a rapid fire questions

1402
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,063
The first one is what is the most memorable Airbnb home that you

1403
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,855
Either in China or

1404
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Around the world

1405
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,535
Nicest home was one and in Maui recently it's actually I got to be part of our new luxury products are launching

1406
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:50,143
But most memorable I would say it was a treehouse in Bali

1407
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:56,799
Which was all made of bamboo in the jungle it was like three stories three bathrooms but it again

1408
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Treehouse

1409
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:02,431
So that was pretty cool

1410
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:08,575
Two hundred bucks tonight oh my God

1411
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,415
Yeah I was probably $18 a night and in tilapia

1412
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:18,047
I put out three different stories to say that like you know

1413
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
Many different price points and many different

1414
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:24,703
Types of experiences all good you can have but also very different that's the beauty of Airbnb

1415
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,775
Who is an entrepreneur you admire the most and why

1416
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,823
How is it right now Elon Musk

1417
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,383
Simply because he's just taking on like these

1418
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,479
Amazon mega ball challenge Mission Impossible over

1419
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
At the same time you just like

1420
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,087
How is it possible that you can just

1421
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
Take such a bully

1422
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
So confidently and actually

1423
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Bring results

1424
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,791
Sure y'all feel the same

1425
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
What do you do for fun

1426
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,375
If you have simplified

1427
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
Haworth one right

1428
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:03,103
It is honestly but that aside I have a family so I have two kids so they can be quite busy and

1429
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
Pure joy

1430
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,175
Aside from family

1431
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
Go to the gym

1432
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,575

1433
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,159
Buy Peloton to get do it from the comfort of your home

Digital portfolio

1435
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,023
But I actually I I think I think

1436
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,607
Staying healthy is really important when you're working hard

1437
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,143
Especially even just

1438
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
Yeah distressing it

1439
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,727
Working out whatever that van that takes

1440
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
Has enough throughout all my endeavors

1441
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
Starting at

1442
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
How much younger age

1443
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,639
Has helped me a lot

1444
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
To kind of stay focused and get

1445
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
Get stuff done and be productive

1446
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503

Travel course

1448

Bicycling skiing

1449
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,999
What's something you read recently that you recommend or that cost you a lot

1450
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,071
