Welcome to the show doors

59

Hi everyone

60
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
So you chose a very different

61
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Career path

62
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
The vast majority of New Shanghai Chinese students

63
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Study abroad

64
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Most of my friends who won

65
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
College in the US

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Phone jobs

67
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Finance Consulting or engineering after

68
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
For graduation

69
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,160
But you went into fmcg and marketing

70
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Why

71
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
A to be honest

72
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
One of the reason why it's

73
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,608
Akshay couldn't get

74
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:49,472
You know it's part, it's not like a big university like Harvard you know yell

75
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
So I wasn't really

76
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,896
Jessica School Bus you know famous for our and all of my friends are like really into philosophy

77
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:02,784
I don't want to be an artist when they graduate so we are not like one of those Target schools

78
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
That's actually the real reason and then the second reason is

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,488
You know when I was doing internship when I was in college I didn't even

80
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
Bother to go to one of those banking jobs

81
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Because I just

82
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Spell like that was rude

83
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
Boring to me

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
Because I asked you when to when

85
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,056
Consulting firms Rosenberg during my junior year and I

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
I did it with you know Julian Coco

87
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Paperwork

88
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
Research on a glass industry

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
LOL another next year I was doing Coca-Cola internship and I compare the differences is really big

90
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
One is you know

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,024
Doing number and your crunchy number and you try to analyze industry

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,632
On the other hand when I was at Coca-Cola I do consumer research and I changed

93
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
The marketing campaigns

94
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Achoo Iris

95
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Peephole song

96
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
I feel like I really want to do some job apps

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
You know making a real

98
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Vs2

99
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
Continue my personal Kenya

100
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
So that's why I

101
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
I chose to do my king

102
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
And I went Unilever

103
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Indiana

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
So when you went to UNI lover you got to turn down a

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Write how to do

106
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Decision making

107
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,703
Yes when I decided to go to marketing the street I kind of did a research on what are the

108
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
Best companies to go to

109
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Procter Gamble

110
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Daphne

111
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Cubase

112
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Companies that like

113
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Martin

114
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
School

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,015
So I apply for POC Again by China and the Unilever us

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Because

117
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,367
Procter Gamble us couldn't sponsor

118
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
H1B for me but you don't leave her

119
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
At that time has this Innovative program

120
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Call Shanghai management trainee program in which state

121
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Chinese

122
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
People

123
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
2 years in us and another year they sent you to China to become a manager vs. inguinal

124
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
Tupac again will they just sent you back directly to Guangzhou

125
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
And inside debated rehab because

126
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,047
Papageno is my dream company at Unilever in US

127
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
That's really attractive

128
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
And then I taught you well enough to Unilever director and he gave me this point of view which is really helpful.

129
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Jimmy

130
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Even so now is that

131
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
He told me that you know practice Campbell hire like 30 marketers every year so till now they probably already have

132
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
500

133
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783

Do you want to be when I would have

137
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183

138
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,023
Your uniqueness is going to Define how valuable you are

139
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
So that's why I was like oh yeah that sounds right

140
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,215
Turn down talk again

141
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Heartbroken to turn

142
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
I went to

143
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591

Oh my God I should have left earlier

Sorry to be honest my path is a little bit you know I went you Unilever and then I

178
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,415
And then I went to the Chinese culture

179
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
That's when I came back to Beijing

180
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
2 years ago

00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303

00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
And I want to come to Y closet

193
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Sorry

194
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
What is budget

195
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,175
Use your mind

196
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
So

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
I think that's the future friends so I really appreciate my

198
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Experience

199
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
Us because I got to be

200
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
3D structural and as you know plant

201
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Strategic

202
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
First in China you just need to be

203
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
A flexible and a unit you

204
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,655
Navigate around the resources to get things done so that's very different

205
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
So in 2015 you made the move from

206
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
New York to the Bay Area

207
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
To become the head of Market

208
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Operations alipay us

209
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,479
I recently read the book I beat you to it which means

210
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
It's a book about the B2B

211
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
ESL team

212
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Alibaba

213
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Forest

214
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Training

215
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Message

216
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
An army life

217
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
Culture so

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
6 take away from the book is that this culture will probably be very difficult for

219
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Internationally minded millennials

220
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,799
Because the company puts a lot of emphasis on culture and has a lot of practices are almost military in nature

221
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
And doesn't really promote

222
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Sub Express

223
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,407
So what was your impression on the Alley

224
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Culture after

225
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Where were the most

226
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
Unexpected things as someone who just moved from

227
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Khaleesi world of New York marketing

228
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,647
Yeah I think that was really memorable.

229
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
I'll never forget about that

230
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
I think it's great

231
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
It's great because the execution of

232
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,191
You know Alibaba is all doing so fast and smooth it's all because. Culture.

233
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
Cultivated but it's

234
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,103
It's really hard for me who has no hat the US education

235
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,175
Who has you know I have been trying really hard to

236
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
Try to express myself when I went to us

237
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,599
Add on to Alibaba it's like

238
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
Reverting back to us

239
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
IHOP

240
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
A couple of

241
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Really

242
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,583
Memories like a really interesting memories when I was young

243
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
First thing is

244
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,983
When I was in New York you know the lifestyle high heels you're like

245
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,383
Head to toe dressed up and then you're like meeting celebrities that was my New York Life

246
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:31,295
Okay first thing is I went to Silicon Valley you know Silicon Valley New York that's already a big difference

247
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Penske America

248
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
So I was like oh my God

249
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Hangzhou

250
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,287
That was another hotel shot so basically have mountain in his teeth

251
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
Last second I was in high heels in York and next second I was doing double 12 campaign for hourly pay

252
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,783
And I was told that we were putting

253
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Ribbons on my forehead

254
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
And then drinking alcohol and smashed the cups you don't Underground

255
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Lots of drawers

256
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
A wall of math

257
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
Global map

258
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,359
Find my blood

259
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,455
Yeah and then we will bring the

260
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
Lionel slogan t-shirt

261
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Yeah

262
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
Some other experiences.

263
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
To leave the closer

264
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
The market

265
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
New York

266
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Too much on Ali

267
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
In the cut

268
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,503
Yeah because I think Alibaba is the future

269
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,087
And I'm still come value is also the future when I was saying Michael Kors

270
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
I think motor

271
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
Traditional marketing

272
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,999
Where is no you get a contact with a celebrity you make a

273
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,327
A fancy video with Palazzo budget behind it and then you

274
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Have lots of

275
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Stores opening

276
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
Where is you know I was reading like

277
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,031
From zero to one or growth hacker something like that

278
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,639
And I was seeing you know California are there are so many companies they just

279
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
Grow from zero to like

280
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
A million

281
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
Without any budget and all because

282
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
Growth hacking

283
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
I was like wow that's

284
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
So much difference in a name

285
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
And also seeing Alibaba yunnan China there are lots of

286
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,791
Crazy things happening like taobao alipay

287
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,119
So I feel like I shouldn't just you know

288
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,983
Throw myself into this fashion well which everything looks fancy but

289
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
I already

290
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
I don't eat

291
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
Steeda Business Point behind irocs

292
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Sustainable

293
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
So I want to learn new things that's why

294
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,015
I went to Ali Baba in California so half the time I can learn growth hacking

295
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
From the USA and I have time I can learn the military style

296
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
A perfect fit

297
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
What was their biggest

298
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Take away four

299
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
There are so many takeaways

300
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,423
The first foal I think the culture which you just mention Alibaba is

301
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Really

302
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,543
Interesting like everyone in Alibaba is always super pumped

303
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
The Never

304
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Slakoth

305
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,431
Something I never seen before I said I was always

306
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Find you

307
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Seagal how they did that

308
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,343
What's the HR System that you can motivate people like this

309
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
I literally remember one of my

310
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Coworker

311
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
She just like you

312
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,351
First like a second ago the next I guess you don't think this is like something

313
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Wow what kind of

314
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,263
You know it's hard to come support size

315
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Opso

316
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
There's a saying in China

317
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
I don't know if

318
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
Still works right now it's bite

319
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Pek

320
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
When was our marching it's more about

321
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:23,487
Spending money and how to create the brand awareness and an impression but

322
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
It's really about all right

323
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,887
How you make the most impact out of this budget so that's what I learned

324
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Very good

325
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Someone who is

326
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Houston wasp

327
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Welcome to

328
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
To go back

329
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Come back to town

330
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Internist

331
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Yeah

332
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,063
I always wanted to go back since the day wasn't right so I made me stay in u.s.

333
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Is because

334
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
I feel like us

335
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Angels brand management and marketing

336
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,511
Is way ahead of timeout back then so I wanted to learn

337
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
The logistics of marketing

338
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
And an Oscar

339
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
Couple years on I feel like I already absorbed most

340
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
What part of the US

341
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Marketing

342
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
On culture and lessons

343
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
I really want you

344
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Do something.

345
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
You know

346
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
Like what I built

347
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Industrial design Michael Kors the brain is already there and all y'all that's already there what I did is that I baste

348
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
The take

349
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Make that bread and make it

350
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
A little bit better

351
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Maybe

352
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,535
The white closet it's a fresh new idea and Brad nobody knows about it

353
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
And I kind of want to prove

354
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Weather I really

355
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,447
You know Irene no marking or Not by

356
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,543

357
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
Show my muscle and

358

Like Unilever or Michael Kors or Alibaba

361
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,647
But in a platform that nobody knows about without any budget and see what I can achieve

362
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Before you join y classes

363
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
So you hadn't been doing

380
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
I'm very real like I'm not even sure if I can do

381
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Title marketing but

382
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,815
She trusts I can do that. Meyer the founder of my closet

383
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,887
Stella she read my blog I mean my WeChat

384
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,959
Account I was writing a lot about marketing and

385
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,799
Differences between China us how I did marketing

386
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
And all that

387
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
SUV has distracting me that she's

388
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
He's my potential

389
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Hershey's like

390
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
Why don't you be mice

391
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
CMO and I trust you and she didn't even interview me.

392
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
She just say

393
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
Yeah come join me

394
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
So

395
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
I feel like she gave me the trust maybe I can do so

396
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Something

397
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
You know big

398
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
Together so that's why I join

399
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
WeChat account unique

400
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
What word is

401
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Things that you

402
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
You wrote that

403
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Your followers

404
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Respond to the most

405
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
I didn't chew things

406
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,943
A real experience how a Chinese working us

407
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Looks like

408
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
The first post that made me popular is

409
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
When I rode

410
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
My job at my

411
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,999
Michael Kors and being a social Communications manager in New York City fashion wall and being Chinese

412
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
So that was like

413
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
How I experienced all the culture shock and how I

414
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Struggle and I went past that

415
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
So that's really pop

416
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,055
I'm in a second thing is really comparing difference between China us so I wrote about

417
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
The difference

418
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Machine

419
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Bloggers

420
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Beijing China us

421
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
How did

422
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
And how

423
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
I finished the first from China in yuan

424
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,135
And all that and right now I'm writing how Beauty bloggers differ from China and us

425
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
So I think when I was riding my articles all I was thinking is that what is minus points

426
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,143
People know Judy Place in u.s. on people no Big Lots in China but they don't know the difference

427
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,447
Trend on and how they

428
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Different juices in different worlds I think being someone who is depressed of us and China

429
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
What I should bring to the table is sweetie

430
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
You'll see the difference and then you know inspired different worlds

431
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,575
How other people are doing the same business

432
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
So that's really popular on my

433
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,767
The Chinese world is all about finding what

434
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
What's the unique perspective

435
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
That you have

436
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
They're probably you're not the only Chinese

437
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,239
New York you're the only one who bother to write about it so

438
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Writing

439
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Great response just

440
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Because other people resume

441
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,247
The most people just don't bother to write

442
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Take me to make the effort in

443
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Be disciplined

444
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Keep writing

445
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
How to really reward

446
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Yes yes

447
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
And then I was actually

448
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
When I was doing Michael Kors that was actually the rise of

449
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
The year of WeChat

450
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
Official plaque

451
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
2014

452
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
So I really see

453
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
The Bennett

454
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,239
The benefit of writing a WeChat and how it got to my

455
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Of course so I was thinking

456
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
If I write a blog

457
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,407
Under my name in about my Contin I could also benefit

458
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
So that's why it sweetie

459
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Got me motivated to ride

460
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
I want one of those

461
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
Went when I want to put it out that against all right

462
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Cursive

463
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Do dinosaurs

464
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Ocean shore Hip Hop

465
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
And I think

466
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Like you said

467
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
If you were willing to

468
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Something or

469
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Do something

470
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,655
And it runs with all the people

471
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Took advantage of

472
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
A New Path

473
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Jessie merch

474
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
First Student

475
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Also

476
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
You are where you are

477
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
Open jobs you Mickey

478
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
Take

479
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
To us

480
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
A lot of people don't

481
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Do that they

482
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
10212

483
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
Events in their career

484
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
And

485
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
Get better doing something

486
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
That he started

487
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
It doesn't want to

488
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Track because that's how you get

489
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Rimowa

490
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
But having different jobs different

491
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Human require restarting

492
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
And we are just

493
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
In the long run

494
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Much better Bridge

495
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Right

496
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Easy bread

497
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
I don't think so at all

498
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
You have to have enough

499
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
To be able to

500
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Acrobatics

501
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
Redis

502
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Albuquerque

503
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Information is less in

504
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Crate & Barrel

505
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Right

506
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
I totally agree

507
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
What was the

508
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Things that surprised you the most

509
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
There were things that was

510
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Satisfied

511
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Bob

512
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Are you able to make

513
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,639
Well I was really surprised

514
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
So I didn't really know how

515
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
That's my first job

516
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
China

517
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
Dewey Martin

518
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
And also first time

519
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
In a startup

520
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
From anal

521
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
All before that it was read

522
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,256
So there were many shots so I'm not sure if it's

523
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
Is China or the starter

524
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,872
Everytime too many variables so I was shocked that

525
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176
Lots of cistern are not build

526
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm so we don't even have a

527
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
No solid

528
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
Data Tracking System

529
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
So

530
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
BCM

531
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,440
Close but they don't know where it comes from

532
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
And then

533
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
There's not a planning

534
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
So they're lost things like that but I really that I found its really, in China and small startups

535
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,752
Well what I really wanted to bill is really feeling

536
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
That you're bringing the

537
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
The maturity

538
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,176
Just coming from USB at the same time being flexible in China so not you

539
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,760
B2 american-style you still need to be Chinese style so

540
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
That was my shock and then

541
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
I was reap how because

542
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,720
As a someone who just came from America I was real

543
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:28,096
I managed to build my own team

544
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
And then also I grow the user base

545
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
10 *

546
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
Amope number user

547
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
And iiii

548
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
Actually built lots of

549
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
Successful campaigns that drive thru

550
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
Ross and also brought in the idea of

551
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Growth hacking from the US

552
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
Combined with the Chinese style

553
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Which is also called

554
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Which is

555
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
Sufficient I don't have the Americans understand.

556
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
The witch has to stencil

557
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,864
I was really being able to combine the Western and the used

558
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
It turns out that sounds really something I

559
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
I think growth

560
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
China is

561
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
Usually

562
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Heavier than the US

563
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
In the US people

564
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
Wait for people.

565
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
Come where is in China

566
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:21,344
Yeah I should have some really heavy meal or operation

567
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
So

568
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Data in

569
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Contact Improv

570
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
Where is in China is like human druid

571
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
So

572
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Did you do a lot of

573
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Dad

574
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
What do you think

575
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Takeaways

576
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
You know the best

577
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
Operation standpoint

578
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,712
Frisch's employee I was doing lots of WeChat group management

579
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
That's like

580
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,320
Community-based and that's something we'd eat Chinese style is that

581
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
Yourbasin YouTube makeup

582
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,512
Poster and then putting the group so that people can make it viral and and inviting more people to

583
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Join the group

584
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
Something like that

585
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
That's not

586
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
Existing in the US

587
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
But we also did

588
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704
Like lots of pockets

589
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,776
In white closet where you refer friend about

590
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
50 Yuan or something like that

591
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
Or we just invented lots of

592
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
The incentive

593
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Would like that you

594
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Motivate

595
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
People to share

596
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Where to

597
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Use more

598
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
I don't think.

599
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,976
That's very common in us and us you just you don't you have to Rent the Runway you have lots of

600
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
Press on the platform and if you

601
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
China weihai

602
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
Something called Jack

603
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
It's like basically address

604
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Coupon

605
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,776
If you have it you can rent one more dress

606
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
In your bag

607
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
And that's something that we created for Chinese

608
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
No budget

609
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
How do you say

610
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Deal with that

611
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
How do you

612
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Be Scrappy

613
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Creative

614
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Do things without

615
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Oh yeah that's a good question so when I say

616
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,512
I don't have budget I actually me I have limited but it's not like I don't have any

617
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
So it's basically

618
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
How do you get the

619
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
Best Roi out of

620
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,168
So first thing is beauty how you

621
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:18,336
Get free traffic and then also make the most out of your traffic so for example I will talk to you

622
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
Crossword

623
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
Fry's employee pay

624
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
And then I know they have lots

625
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
Traffic and what they need and then

626
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
I just talked

627
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,344
To them about a collaboration between black

628
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
That's how we got.

629
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Traffic to be honest

630
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,584
And the second thing is when you get the traffic you need to increase conversion rate so with a lot of a b testing

631
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
That's also, UF

632
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,448
To see how you really increase conversion rate

633
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,056
To not to waste at the other traffic and then the third thing is that

634
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
When people become a user we try

635
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
Heart to make them sure

636
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
What you refer

637
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
So you get the

638
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
What is fission

639
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Go viral goes out of

640
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:04,672
Basic idea saying but just in Chinese system you need to

641
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
Use different tools

642
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Incentive

643
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
And apply for MS2

644
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
I make.

645
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
Yeah I know so we made a very

646
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Controversial

647
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:18,240
Video

648
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Out of ordinary

649
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
What was it

650
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
How to workout

651
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
What's a lesson

652
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
Yes or the reason why we I did that is

653
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
So I did all the growth hacking

654
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,528
Feels like like I told you

655
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
But

656
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,600
Conversion rate is still very

657
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
Like limited because

658
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
Couple reasons

659
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
First of all

660
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
People don't want to

661
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
You know

662
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
Where to go to other people have already

663
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
They want it don't want to share

664
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
The first thing the second thing is

665
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
Nobody knows about

666
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,008
What is it like even icy

667
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,568
I can wear so many clothes in a mall

668
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,152
But I don't trust this platform solo brand awareness and Trust

669
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
Is there a thing is that

670
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,016
They just couldn't figure out how to run a call.

671
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,320
It's a lot of Education

672
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
Cost there

673
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
Seoul.

674
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
These zhuhai

675
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
No customer acquisition

676
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,000
So basically I figure out

677
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
The

678
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
The problem is, is marking issue

679
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
You to make people

680
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
Trust you be aware of

681
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Yuan anole

682
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
What the hell you are

683
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
So that's why I

684
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,408
I really insist on making a video or a marketing campaign to make people be aware of

685
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
What causes and what benefits

686
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,760
It can actually bring to you so that's going to lower

687
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
The CAC later on

688
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,464
Right but then I want us to convince to see you like we need to make a video

689
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
Usually like when you say that

690
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,816
I need money to make videos

691
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,216
Theo's going to be very insecure like how much do you need and then what impact am I going to get out

692
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
This video

693
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
So I couldn't ask for a lot but I need you to make this video go viral and also at the same time

694
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
Really clearly communicate what the value of a

695
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
Positive

696
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
So

697
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
I thought about doing something.

698
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,416
Sweetie you know controversial to

699
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Traeger

700
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,792
The bus and talk online no matter online

701
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
I just I want to make people talk about this

702
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
Concept sew-in needs to be something inside at

703
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Sweety Sharp

704
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
I'm sorry

705
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
I did lots of

706
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,104
Oyster Bay on you know why closet and users and what Cajun they're using

707
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Play Seether

708
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,456
So is that they all use y+ for what

709
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,784
Because an Insight behind at work

710
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
They feel

711
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Really needed to

712
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Dress

713
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Desperately everyday

714
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Otherwise

715
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:53,120
Especially in a city like Shanghai before going to laugh at you like oh my God you didn't change clothes again

716
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
So that's why they need a lot of

717
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,264
Draft and I took lots obligation hour can I see that

718
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,616
This is like the other deep motivation so that's why I made a video

719
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,712
About women at work and how they dress properly can

720
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,808
Yo

721
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
Eventually a force

722
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
Some I made a really dramatic and also.

723
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,464
Sweetie similar to one of the show TV show that

724
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
Population China

725
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
Just caught wind of song

726
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
Ghost Rider

727
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
So

728
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,496
That video eventually became so popular and viral in China there two sides

729
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
The people

730
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
Talking about once I was like oh my God this video is so

731
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Funny

732
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,688
Three interesting animals such as you know Prada exist

733
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
Yellowstone

734
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,272
Oh my God you're talking about appearance

735
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
Career advancement

736
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:50,208
Do you even go to us okay that's not what I meant

737
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
Gucci Mane in China there's lots

738
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
Caucasian people don't trust

739
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
When you meet client

740
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,632
It's your like in gym clothes

741
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,960
But someone else were probably just can't actually get lots of

742
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,824
You know notice from clients so I made a really dramatic and I'll eat you lots of

743
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,104
Controversial

744
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
No matter which side they're on the all done with why call Dennis into the years are

745
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
But yeah I got lots

746
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
That.

747
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Controversial video

748
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
How does it feel when you yourself

749
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Popular car

750
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Commercial

751
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,072
Of things that you know that's not

752
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
You are but

753
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
How to deal with

754
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,192
Yeah I had a

755
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
Huge struggle inside I was like

756
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,872
Hillgrove and your belief that's like oh my God which side right

757
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
Twilight kpi and Amaya

758
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,160
Make my job successful without budget I can make success happen and then the other sounds like

759
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:59,072
Yeah that's a little bit controversial that's not what I believe in PSI when I wanted to do the marketing I want

760
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,912
How to build a brand that's you know you know positive and make people feel

761
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,496
Feel better and now I'm making video that make people feel worse

762
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:11,104
So that was the first thing that's like a super shot to myself

763
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,712
Yeah so even to know I'm still thinking about it

764
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
Blog post

765
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784

Why I'm making this video and

769
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
What I would message I wanted

770
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,888
But I didn't write about struggling dilemma after that

771
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Yes

772
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,704
What would you have done the same thing

773
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Do it again

774
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,848
I would do that video but then I'm going to create a second video after that

775
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,408
Yes so that video was going to create alderman

776
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:50,528
The controversy and Buzz and mystery and a secular is like revealing why she

777
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
She actually got the career

778
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
It's like an addiction to. Appearances order

779
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,976
Athlete resting she also worked very hard

780
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,560
So that's going to be, you know a serious video and then we can ask

781
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
She continued

782
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400

I'll go out

920
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
In terms of marketing

921
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
Go through the whole gamut

922
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Fursuit

923
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,664
You marketed an American product to a Chinese

924
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Set Michael Kors

925
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
And then

926
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Chinese products

927
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
To an American Audio

928
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,064
And that your Market a Chinese product

929
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Go to a Chinese audience

930
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
So why called

931
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
So out of these which one did you find the most

932
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Most challenging and why

933
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
I didn't definitely white closet

934
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
I didn't you just want to smile

935
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,632
Michael Kors because it's such a big brown and it's fashion and

936
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,008
You're my king an American brand to Chinese is a bit easier because

937
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:11,104
In the past are nominee fashion the brands available in China

938
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,200
And then are you always such a big platform so although lots of

939
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,296
No us companies don't know about it I can just show them videos and

940
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
Press release and they're going to be

941
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
React like

942
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
Amazon

943
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
But why closet nobody knows about it

944
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
And then

945
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
People don't

946
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,632
Don't get that it's like a new brand new Prada and you concept and you pass

947
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,168
So I think that's the most

948
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Pat and Jen

949
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
Part and also

950
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Being the first

951
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
The job I got in China

952
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
Definitely the most challenge

953
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Soaked

954
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Maybe you can talk about your car in

955
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
What is a duet

956
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
What's your vision

957
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Yasso

958
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,832
When I look at my past I feel like

959
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,208
All my interests are the products I was interesting are all forced female

960
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
You know cuz you're my pot as fast

961
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Prada store

962
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,864
Like father that's no still apparel but in a tech company buyer

963
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
So

964
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
I always

965
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
I was

966
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
Vitas baidu

967
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Women in China

968
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
Be more independent

969
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,408
Being just a friend and their needs are going to change

970
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
Vastly this year

971
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,760
Especially after that Viral

972
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
Controversial campaign

973
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,136
At Whitehall that which I made is that I realized

974
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,184
You know women are a different lady

975
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
Embarrassing

976
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,560
Thinking about the thing about different things so that's why I really want to focus on

977
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,864
No hurry calling me and then

978
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
Do research on it and how

979
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
You in a western world

980
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
How their GI protein

981
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
Economy Inn Holland China people are

982
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Gene.

983
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,640
And what are the new products or

984
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
What are the new business

985
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,736
That we can get from this

986
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Change

987
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,296
Somehow women think they're

988
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
So I'm doing this

989
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,880
Combination of marketing and media

990
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,464
On the media site I still write boss about

991
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,512
Different companies for example

992
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,072
Mary Docker with witches a top

993
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
Chinese cosmetics

994
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:14,496
Company how they did realtor marketing and then I compared Beauty blotters between China and us

995
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
Etsy what are the

996
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,592
Potential business idea that you could have have

997
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
And then

998
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
When

999
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Unilock

1000
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:26,016
Startup start doing that probably the most of the intrapreneurs are female there

1001
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,040
You're not sure what

1002
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
How to build a startup how to

1003
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
And they're going to ask me

1004
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
To help with them

1005
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,952
So then I can use my

1006
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
Growth hacking field in order

1007
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,048
Experience to help with them so it's basically

1008
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
I think it's going to be the future of

1009
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
Chinese style

1010
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
Consulting or media from is

1011
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,728
You know you have a Content media platforms

1012
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,520
To gain traffic to Gail the trust

1013
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:53,663
Credibility and then people going to come to you for helper service

1014
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,967
And even for FHA or

1015
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
Consulting ideas or

1016
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
Community groups and then

1017
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Study group

1018
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
So I'm going to feel all that

1019
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
To support

1020
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
Huracan

1021
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
NSU

1022
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
Spend even Christy Moore

1023
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
Do you find a

1024
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Woman exactly

1025
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Or

1026
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Founders

1027
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
Have a chance to

1028
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,727
Be themselves more or make

1029
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Speaker impact

1030
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Or less

1031
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Then there comes

1032
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
I think Beverly in China

1033
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
I think

1034
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
Maya Moore in China

1035
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,575
I definitely think the female leadership is going to

1036
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
You know

1037
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
China

1038
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Because of several reasons

1039
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
First thing is

1040
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,535
Biggest cemotap how I see lots of girls are raised

1041
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Like I

1042
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,351
Likewise for myself

1043
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,399
My parents never thought of me as a

1044
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
They always

1045
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,239
Treat me like I'm a boy I used to pay play basketball

1046
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
What stores are all that

1047
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,335
So I don't think I in any weaker than

1048
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
The guys

1049
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,407
Did I file a Spears like me

1050
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,967
And the second thing is diet

1051
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,551
The Chinese education system doesn't

1052
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,831
Supports so much

1053
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,367
Masculinity

1054
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
10TV

1055
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
Better I mean they can actually

1056
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,839
Perform better than Western well you need to the guy

1057
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
They need you

1058
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
Do Sports and all that

1059
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Sakura

1060
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,007
Intitle you just need to have a good school

1061
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
And then

1062
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Auchan grocery

1063
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Akademiks

1064
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Academics rice or

1065
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
That's why there's so many

1066
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
You know

1067
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,503
Axilla women out there right now

1068
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Rising

1069
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,855
Starting is back in the history of

1070
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
China history

1071
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,951
Because of cultural revolution I think that's

1072
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
It's called don't you right

1073
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Back in the days

1074
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,351
And you don't

1075
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,631
Say it's a female

1076
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,215
Everyone

1077
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Equals

1078
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
So I think

1079
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,079
Women get you half more

1080
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,383
Equality actually in China future

1081
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,967
I definitely see that happening and I saw lots of female enter

1082
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
Nurse already rising up

1083
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,575
What other for example and then also the luck

1084
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
Of a box

1085
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
Lots of

1086
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Cosmetic

1087
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
Companies already rise

1088
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
So you are very dizzy

1089
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,863
Connected to the

1090
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
The land as well

1091
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
Out of all the

1092
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447

1093
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215

How to adapt

China quick

1097
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Will return from

1098
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
The US

1099
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
Cut down the number of

1100
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,503
Time you use English

1101
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,111
Thunder remix

1105
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:06,175
Investor trust you more

Teriyaki

1112
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
I actually think people who never went abroad

There's so many of them are so much smarter than people who went to you as and then

1130
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,983
What does that mean and how would you apply what you learned to your private

1131
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Personal life

1132
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
Reitzel

1133
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:09,151
I always like to think about things and see whether there is some serious in common

1134
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,711
Behind so when I was thinking about

1135
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
Growth hacking in a Prada

1136
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,295
You busy you find an MVP

1137
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
P&i you do a b

1138
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,671
We passed and then you find the first Narrows to test it and improve it

1139
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,719
Until you find the PMI

1140
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
I almost got married

1141
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
Boyfriend

1142
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,311
I should mention all this

1143
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:46,271
I feel like oh my God what if I regret it later or is he going to be the best one

1144
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:51,135
It's like is it is it PMS like that you don't even know it like

1145
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,183
I just feel like I need to do some

1146
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
51

1147
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,935
How about we take a break and she's like I broke up with him

1148
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
That's when I went to New York and I have

1149
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,567
Some days with different style actually make notes like this

1150
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,639
No western-style this is Chinese style

1151
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,735
Ben-Hur style dispatch

1152
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:23,135
I went out with them and see how I fell and I definitely know which are the types of guys I definitely

1153
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,719
Don't like nope Automotive

1154
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Never

1155
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
If they're still proud of

1156
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Open self

1157
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,119
And then later I found out a car Velma Target

1158
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,727
Audience look like Persona is like

1159
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
Mick easterby

1160
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,055
Not bad looking

1161
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,359
Give me to be smart and then

1162
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,711
She needs to like start up so we can talk a lot about that and I like

1163
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:51,295
Good-looking guy to be honest that's very bad and then

1164
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,831
He needs to be honest

1165
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Not like

1166
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Like like

1167
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
So trust

1168
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
So all of

1169
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,791
These characteristic I found out that's probably a guy instead of combating doing tok

1170
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Patchogue

1171
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
And then

1172
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
I like what kind of companies

1173
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,447
So that's a coincidence I went to Uber to

1174
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:13,311
To do collaboration between IEP and Order Uber has all the tech

1175
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:18,431

Tie dye

1184
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:38,143
Interview with filtered already by Uber

1185
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
Very talkative

1186
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:46,335
I don't even think about that but when I went to Uber and I was doing this recap with them and meeting and then

1187
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,431
My husband walked in fact that he was not my husband that he's like

1188
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:56,831
Rihanna's and point out other mistakes he may wish information he should had and he's good-looking

1189
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:03,231
I was like oh my god. The guy so that's how I knew my boyfriend and

1190
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,535
Later I set up a

1193
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:14,751
I arranged like setting us up and he didn't actually know that

1194
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
I said stop and then

1195
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,359
B I got to know each other and then later we got married

1196
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,455
That's my story and looking back I just made fun of it I was like that

1197
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
That's just

1198
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,039
Like growth hacker in a growth mindset

1199
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063

1201
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,511

Just be happy with the guy

1207
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
So that's

1208
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:53,151
