35
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,592
A few months ago we had Brad Bell the other co-founder on the show

36
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Back when the company was still call limebike

37
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,224
About time limes operation was still pedal bikes only

38
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
A lot has changed since then in a short span of a

39
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
A few months

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,672

00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,688
Lime is currently working with Uber to co-branded scooters and make them available in the Uber app

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,528
So we thought we would have lime on the show again and this time with Toby

Journey

55
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Since you start this process at the end of 2016

56
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
Actually technically early

57
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
17

58
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
We

59
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
Incorporated the company in January 3rd 2000

60
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
17

61
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
I think about in qvar

62
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
Am I seriously in this

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Yardley f2017

64
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:41,184

00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
Dockless Bike Share

66
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
In what pump you guys can make this change

67
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
Or a starter evolution

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
I am in the shepherd pivot into

69
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
Scooters

70
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Yelp

71
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:00,384
It's actually interesting if you look at our original plan from day one

72
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,712
We never position

73
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
The company as a bike showing

74
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
O'melveny

75
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Rice always starting

76
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
With spikes

77
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
Can we name the company as limebike just to be more focused

78
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Starting from day one if you

79
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,791
Talk to some of our friends and even our investors

80
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
We have bigger vision

81
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Text my cell

82
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,959
Yeah I would believe slime is

83
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
In the long run a brand that same power

84
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
It does empowering the urban living

85
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
Starting from Pike

86
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
And I will adding new product and services

87
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
You know along the way

88
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
To fulfill a different user needs

89
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
So

90
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,927
I would rather call I'm a user Center company rather than the bike Shield

91
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Chair Company

92
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
With that sad

93
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
You know

94
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
Because we have a bigger Vision to create

95
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Michael McCarthy platform

96
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
To serve people move people from 8

97
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
Bikers the starting point

98
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,615
And we're also constantly no evaluating innovating different products but like ebike

99
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Scooter

Super sharing

105
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Myself

106
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
What matters to us is sweetie finding

107
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207

108
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255

E Bike and scooter

113
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
The next product you should be offering in

114
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Audi 2018

115
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,847
So electric product is

00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Research

119
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
End user feedback that we collected from the field

120
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
The electric product has been in the world map

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,255
Starting from day one so we actually started our innovation

122
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
Auntie bikes in Q2 2017

123
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679

To enter a different Market

128
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
Palace of USA

129
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Myself

130
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,063
You know it's still ongoing discussion internally while so what we proud of

131
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Because we

132
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Ambition to create

133
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
The platform that we can constantly

134
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Innovative Hardware products

135
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Makes it enable us

136
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
You know in Nevada

137
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Either way

138
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
So in your from your perspective and it did you see

139
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
What are the common

140
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
Usage case for bike

141
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
E-bike

142
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
And the scooter

143
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
And what sort of penne unique nomics will pay back

144
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Period 4

145
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
For this

146
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Yeah

147
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
So

148
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
Did this replies have

149
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
Braid different out use case

150
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,047
For scooter sharing we've seen very very strong use usage

151
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
In high-density area

152
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
And people use that

153
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
You know

154
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,055
To get from 8 to be much faster and also the fun factors you know

155
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Catana

156
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Is the one you write in

157
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,175
Two people smiling weather while when they were riding scooters

158
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,759
And if you'd like we've seen people using. For longer this is

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,879
So for example for scooter the average distance is Rob the amount for

160
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
Device is actually 1.5 pack

161
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
What's 1 * 2

162
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
What's the distance

163
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
August

164
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
Scooter

165
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,631
And we see people taking device notches

166
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,495
You no longer this is but also climbing the hill I solve for example in Seattle

167
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
People are choosing e-bikes

168
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
For getting around a lot of the hilly Terrain

169
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
You know a lot often.

170
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
The other you don't modality

171
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Enforce the pedal bike

172
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
A lot of cities like that and also a lot of communities like that because it's more affordable

173
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
All the people who want to get a little more exercise

174
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
This deal pek to August you choose to use pedal bike so

175
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
I would say you know three product

176
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
Actually serves

177
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:15,615
So it goes very interesting some people write it for really long because I use that

178
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
That's what

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,223
And some people use that for short-distance have a mile or you know one point

180
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,319
Play so anywhere between. I was kind of similar to

181
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
Scooter so I'll never about them all

182
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
So I would say you know

183
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Pedal bike video service

184
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
Kind of deer mom

185
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
The equity

186
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Dental program that would provide a lot of

187
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
Yes it is and also allowed

188
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Uses want to Dua Lipa mwah

189
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
Jenna economic wise

190
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,543
Of course you know all the you Paula is a lot better

191
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,359
Because people are willing to pay side a more

192
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Dodge to have that better products.

193
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
ISell

194
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,551
But the costs associated with that is also slightly higher

195
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Because we need to

196
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Change the battery will charge

197
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Scooters

198
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
You know

199
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Maintaining

200
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
So what's a slightly higher banal

201
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
You know I don't f*** with Adidas

202
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
I remember when scooters first take over San Francisco everyone started talking about it it became like

203
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Is Oliver news all the time

204
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
And I'm every time at the Caltrain station

205
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
You'll see the scooters

206
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
Why do things scooters work so well in the

207
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
And do you think it can be replicated in other markets like China

208
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
Yeah so funny enough we

209
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
Will also see a lot of kind of quick

210
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Turn around you know using scooters

211
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,495
I'll sometimes you know our operational team can't even

212
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Scooters

213
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Touch the grass

214
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
So before I touch the ground people are driving

215
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,271
Amazing you know what you guys Asian and then the passion that we see from the users

216
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Stop

217
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
And we're passing about

218
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
What we've seen so far

219
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,231
Because we see in a scooter could be ever interesting way

220
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
2

221
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Commode

222
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Excite

223
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
To embrace

224
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
Autonomous alternative

225
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
Mobility right other than

226
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Just driving around

227
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
That pie thing is going and also

228
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Back to a question I think is

229
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
A very

230
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Interesting culture

231
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
All related products

232
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,711
Riesel a lot of people going going out in the US

233
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Riding your razor scooters

234
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
Push scooters white outdoor sectional

235
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
Culture and as fun as fact

236
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,231
Rise and people are doing that from a circuit

237
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
That's great and also speaking about International

238
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
We've seen

239
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
Some of the European Marcus house very strong

240
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Has similar

241
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Have you scared

242
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
I got

243
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,687
We're not just in us we just launched Paris about 3 weeks ago about to Launch

244
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
You know if your mark Marcus soon in Europe

245
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
Are we seeing equally Goods you know you know usage

246
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
Do you think it will ever work in China at all given the

247
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
Cultural differences in how

248
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
Just a condition

249
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
China is

250
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
China is a wild card that was a special for a scooter I'm not sure but if I were to gas

251
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
I would say it will be

252
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
Utilize too well but would that be

253
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
God of a few Acts

254
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
Better than bike

255
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
Right so I think bike is already to win

256
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
Bodega job already

257
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Play So High.

258
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
In general culture wisest

259
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
You know a good thing for bike sharing

260
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,303
So I think in order to get that marginal Improvement

261
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Anton euthanization

262
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
And economics

263
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Scooter

264
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
By investing

265
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Alarm World operational

266
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
Charging maintenance

267
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Not sure if.

268
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
A wise

269
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Go to market

270
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Prada

271
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,479
But I think it will be also you guys while he's just a bikers

272
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
Bissell popular already and there's

273
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Lots of vaginal reason

274
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Forever people

275
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
To the extent that you can share code

276
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Talk about the Unicorn almox

277
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Scooters

278
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
Send the payback period and as compared to bikes

279
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Sunday Bikes

280
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
So unfortunately we can't stress too much

281
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
I would say you know in some of the markets

282
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
We are with profitable in many markets

283
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
And the companies are financially

284
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Wonder Bible

285
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
You know we are

286
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,207
Expanding too many markets and then we're seeing

287
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
On the part of the market become profitable

288
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
With our again

289
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Operation

290
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Deficiency

291
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Burberry

292
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
Obviously when it comes about

293
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
Woman talks about scooter sharing in the US

294
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
Another name that pops up is a bird

295
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
From your perspective

296
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
How well do you think they're doing and

297
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
What differentiates the two services

298
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
And ultimately using this

299
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,879
Uber vs. Lyft situation or

300
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
What what time do something quite that differ

301
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
I think the race was around

302
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
$400 in

303
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
Lesson in less than 6 months

304
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Are supposed to batteries in about 2 billion

305
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
So it's a fast-rising

306
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,031
Respectful

307
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Competitive

308
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Why so I think

309
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,943
From our perspective we welcome competition

310
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
I think that's something.

311
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,807
The only get us better push-ups to improve in

312
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,207
It also helped educate a market that we can boast you know grow

313
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Ultimate goal

314
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Samurai

315
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
Just to bring more people off the car

316
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
And I embrace the

317
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Lime green

318
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
Transportation

319
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Thank you

320
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
Everything you know

321
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Anybody who is doing this is

322
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Disrespected

323
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
And how this Market will be

324
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,783
I'm kind of payout in differentially I don't have an answer I think

325
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,135
Two companies competing could be an option

326
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Palazzo

327
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
A market

328
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
And space that require loto

329
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Different

330
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
USA

331
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Skillstat

332
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Capabilities

333
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
For example

334
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,311
Supply chain Hardware

335
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
Depression caused from

336
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:44,223
Out of those one supply chain Hardware been able to

337
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Scalar product

338
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
With low cost in a high quality

339
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Restless Heart

340
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Ioc

341
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
Many teams out there

342
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
That's why I meant to see the relationship

343
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
Right so we take this pain very seriously

344
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
Starting from day one

345
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,727
You know we set the alarm

346
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
What kind of strategy to Reedy what was the city

347
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,615
Now we're in over 70 markets already

348
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Across four countries

349
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
Airport Primary in the US for now

350
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
But everything go market that we go into

351
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
And we operating now we have

352
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Either agreement

353
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,927
Or SLA or you no mo you so

354
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
We really going to whoop

355
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Closer with the city

356
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
To develop something that we can

357
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Localizing customized

358
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
I'm not just going rogue

359
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Rock the Boat

360
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
I think it's super important for us

361
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Established

362
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Relationship I think

363
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
Consideration should be in the long run

364
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Well

365
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
Apus

366
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
When you know

367
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Bigger

368
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,247
And the third thing is sweetie operational efficient

369
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
We

370
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
We have two interesting tomatoes to operate one is

371
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,695
Dr Joseph Hogan

372
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Which we

373
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
Call Celesta people to

374
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Mansion cards

375
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,399
And also we have our own operational team right

376
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
And.

377
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,007
But you don't report them for us to maintain our

378
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Higher level of

456
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Uber

457
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Especially for the short distance is

458
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Always better

459
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807

460
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575

461
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
Or use a bike or scooter

462
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Try to get around

463
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Is more affordable

464
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,255
All right so I think we're uniquely positioned to do something

465
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
That's

466
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Serving a lot of

467
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
The user's we both have

468
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703

And also

473
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,639
The other thing we're super excited about

474
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
About hubris punishable

475
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967

476
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247

477
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783

478
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
Open and we look forward to

479
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Expanding quickly

480
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
International

481
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
Super Ivar's concept people connected

482
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
To WeChat

483
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
But what I don't know is that

484
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
Give me channel was inspired by

485
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Facebook

486
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
Facebook connect

487
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
It's a super website

488
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
Back in 2008 or 2009

489
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
And then now you can see Wilbur

490
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
Barring the superyacht concept from

491
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
WeChat at work

492
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
What's in China

493
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
And to lesser degree DD

494
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Supercut

495
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
The Eagles know about us and China Market

496
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Extremely Wild

497
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
In What scenario can you imagine

498
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Mine be a super app

499
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
Yeah that's it

500
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,567
A very interesting idea and we've seen

501
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
You know it

502
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
Especially the Chinese company's what Chinese app has done

503
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
A lot of things.

504
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Way faster

505
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,551
Tactical really really sorry

506
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
And that there is a space

507
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
That's something that we

508
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
I always

509
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Inspired

510
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,487
As we're going our live

511
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,143
I think for the new term with you want to make sure that we are completing and I owning this

512
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
Michael Mobility

513
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Hospice

514
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
And

515
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Moving forward

516
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
I think what matters to us is sweetie

517
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
What user really

518
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
And what user

519
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Can naturally use our app

520
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
I think

521
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
We'll leave that for users and I got us

522
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
To move to in immortality

523
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:19,232
I mean we have seen coming home again used to come up with ideas for the additional body Well Services

524
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
Respond quickly

525
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,352
That will break out at BB&T new things

526
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:30,240
What are your thoughts on other verticals you could expand into such as delivering

527
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,640
We don't know yet so I think a lot of areas are very very

528
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,968
Exciting and then big markets and then also

529
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,528
Highly correlated to people still alive

530
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
Very close to

531
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
You know

532
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
The way that people are using hours

533
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
Definitely you would want to carefully

534
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
Annalise was

535
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,840
What's needed out there what's not being software wall

536
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
And then what we can do better

537
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,336
I'm personally very excited for food delivery on bikes cuz how that's how it works in China and is 12 fast

538
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Because

539
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
Cars got stuck

540
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
In traffic all the time

541
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Yeah and plus we have a big basket

542
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
Solana by Cindy bikes

543
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
If it's

544
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
2

545
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
A grocery bag

546
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
So

547
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
I could be a good fit

548
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
But what are your thoughts in terms of how

549
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
The movie destroy the future for Last Mile

550
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Transportation

551
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Imagine what

552
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Like 5 years

553
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Converse driving

554
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
BMO problems

555
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Society

556
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
What kind of a last mile transportation

557
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Solution could it be album

558
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Multimodal

559
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Cut it cut it.

560
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,968
I would say for Michael Mobility shorter sense

561
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
Will be either bikes or Scooters or something else

562
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,904
Who will be more personalized

563
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
I can fit one or two people write mostly one

564
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
And then I'm very flexible

565
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,096
I saw you can Busy Bee hop-on hop-off

566
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
Opossum

567
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
Yeah or yah

568
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
And it should be very

569
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
Affordable by yourself

570
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
If you don't want to pay

571
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
More than $5

572
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
$4

573
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
Anything that fits depth

574
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Criteria

575
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
I think could have a very very good

576
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
That's one and then for longer-distance

577
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Thanks

578
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Steal cars

579
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Will be around for a long time

580
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
The current

581
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,560
Current has given by people or a Thomas driving range I think for the longer this is

582
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,144
The car will be will be around for a long time but

583
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
What we care about is you know

584
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
Other than car

585
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
And what we can do

586
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
What can we do

587
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Bikes

588
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
Scooters are what we are

589
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Starting now

590
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
Also you know if there's other

591
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Foremost

592
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,784
Transportation that's also solving this more efficiently and more affordable

593
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
Made with local

594
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
The local space

595
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,280
What does you guys or like OfferUp

596
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Local Commerce

597
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
It just seems a lot of things that can be done

598
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,912
Overtime having stuff

599
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,496
Deliver to you locally have

600
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Pay for

601
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
And in a mobile home

602
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Escort service

603
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,200
Make a lot of sense

604
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
So

605
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
I think you guys are at a cusp

606
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
Doing something

607
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Quite interesting

608
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
Starting with the transportation space for this lawn mower roof

609
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,536
Of course yeah we see the value and also we're open for partnership

610
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
So I think

611
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
Having Punisher of not just like

612
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
Independent variable other

613
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,240
Local LDS today's service

614
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
Now that you've been running

615
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
The business for awhile now

616
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,248
Has your vision of what the company could be evolve

617
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,368
How has it beaten or Master expectations when you started out as a surprise

618
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
Yeah is a good question I would say

619
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
Surprising but also expect

620
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,584
When we first started

621
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
We know that

622
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
This area is

623
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
This is

624
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,520
Nadja spend all industry but also potentially trillion-dollar

625
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
Because we're touching people

626
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
You know most

627
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Frequent

628
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,432
Highest frequency in Wales

629
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Getting around

630
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,760
If you think about

631
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,856
The way that you get around everyday right counting all of the walking

632
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Acid

633
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,488
I mean the territory that we are tapping into is

634
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
Possibly 80%

635
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Your daddy

636
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
Tips including walking

637
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,680
That's exciting we know it's going to be big

638
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
And we know

639
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
The solution that we provide

640
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Is

641
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Something

642
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,872
The current alternatives or not

643
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
It works

644
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
You know

645
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Providing as your motivation

646
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Way to two

647
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
That's what people to get around so we're pretty

648
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
Confident about our products

649
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
In the market

650
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
And also we're proud of the team

651
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,536
Also putting all this together I would say things I expected

652
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
Going badly

653
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
Fast

654
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Somewhat surprising to me.

655
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
The cities

656
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
Are also embracing this a lot fast

657
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,872
Some of the Technology Innovation

658
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Hit the market

659
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Let me talk to the cities

660
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,808
All cities little respect are skeptical

661
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,368
But primarily around

662
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
How does a 3D carousel

663
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,976
Our problem right

664
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,560
So we act differently

665
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
Bike-sharing versus

666
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Scooter sharing bikes

667
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
Yeah it's definitely part 2

668
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
Different so bike sure is

669
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,264
A familiar area

670
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
Mercedes they know how it's working

671
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,872
Just we just need you to educate educate them

672
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
How dockless bikes

673
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,016
Ogden that how is it working how can we do today

674
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,064
Does some of the other players

675
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
In this industry

676
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,416
What scooter is brand new

677
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,000
So it requires little more education but I think

678
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,072
Reputation of managing this while it's important

679
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,632
That's why that we we spent a lot of time and effort

680
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
What was the city's making sure the operation sensing

681
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Cachet

682
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
So that we can

683
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
You don't surf

684
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
When was it is

685
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,360
Joshua Project thank you notes

686
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Have the

687
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
The ravenous in the data.

688
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Bump city is

689
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
A lot better

690
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,064
And we thought I think they're welcoming

691
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
Anything does reducing congest

692
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Dancing Dan

693
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
Reducing Diablo

694
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
That's surprisingly

695
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,024
Timeout

696
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Here in San Francisco we've seen a lot of

697
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Changes

698
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
With regards to

699
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Policies

700
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
What do you think

701
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
Wait weekend

702
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Expect golang

703
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm bored

704
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Especially with regards

705
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Two scooters

706
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,456
Some Cisco is working on

707
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
A permitting program

708
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
We are we're closing with

709
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
Looking West

710
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
At the city

711
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,648
We don't know the exact time what we've heard so far as

712
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Anytime

713
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
August

714
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
We are

715
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Australians

716
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
2

717
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
Continuously work with the city to make that happen

718
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
ASAP because

719
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,168
San Cisco al-taweel launch

720
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
About three or four months ago right so it's

721
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
Very rapidly

722
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Became

723
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
One of the very best

724
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Big Market

725
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,968
All we've seen huge adoption is people love it and then

726
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
Also

727
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
The behavior

728
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
UR parking

729
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,392
Right OS generally very positive

730
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
We we've seen weight loss

731
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
You know vandalism and Dad

732
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
Car parking issue

733
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,632
I'm liking some Cisco we've done almost a hundred

734
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,448
We've had almost a hundred

735
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Thousand users

736
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
Within just

737
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Llcu

738
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:05,920
Weak spot amazing given only has

739
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
200000 people

740
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
Fs17 salt

741
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
Population

742
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
You will Rick and Morty but we really working hard

743
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
To get back to some

744
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,512
Summer in the city seems to be more open

745
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,656
San Diego San Diego

746
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,728
What are some of the general pattern

747
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
That exists

748
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
With the cities. How much

749
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
More open

750
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
It's hard to generalize

751
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,432
I would say it so it's really city-by-city

752
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,224
And sometimes this time

753
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
From time to time

754
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Appraisal

755
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
Portfolio sample Seattle when we talk to it

756
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
The city

757
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,392
Initial reaction was

758
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
To push back

759
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
Hey

760
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
We like this program we think this

761
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
Husband can be really powerful.

762
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,912
Best way to little bit because we just had the

763
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,936
Get off a lot

764
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
Dog base program

765
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
Want to figure out what's that

766
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
And now we wait for about

767
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,640
2 months and then continue to work with the city charge

768
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
How to convince time

769
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
You know how we can do things

770
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
And all of a sudden

771
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
Open it up I think the city also are

772
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,880
They have the incentive

773
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
To look for better options

774
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
To solve the problem

775
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
So that's one

776
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
1

777
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
Extreme case Raise Hell push back

778
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,632
Making us feel like always going to take forever but event

779
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Turn turn out to be

780
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
Goodbye quickly

781
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
Some of the markets are generally very openly

782
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
Like Dallas and San Diego

783
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
They don't have

784
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
A cap

785
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
And also the one I chose

786
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
You know that's it now and I'll see how it goes

787
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:47,808
Without signing a lot of limitation I think if I if there's one thing that we can

788
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Generalize

789
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
This pattern I think

790
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
They all come from.

791
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
Southern part of the country

792
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,304
Is Walnut a lot of tourist

793
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,400
Baltimore traffic traffic and then they just eager to find a way

794
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:12,128
On a personal level what is it like to build an American company in the rug relatively regulated sector

795
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
As a first generation

796
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
10 pennies

797
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
Interesting question

798
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,832
It's definitely not easy but

799
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
But also

800
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,976
I think to me is finding that

801
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
Sweet spot right so I think

802
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Not many things.

803
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,656
That's good for me or fit as a good fit for me

804
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,128
One thing I really like what hands has measured

805
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:49,504
House is about 12

806
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
Stay behind the scenes

807
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
Particular industry

808
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm so proud that I

809
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,096
Can serve as a bridge between us and China

810
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Empower to

811
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
Technology in Prada West

812
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,312
Supply chain Hardware capabilities are we have in China and also you know

813
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,616
Couple by the knowledge

814
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
The iPad

815
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
You know by leaving in the u.s. work in the US in the past

816
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Many years

817
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
How to customize a program

818
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
From operational perspective

819
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Chiapas bag

820
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
To make that work

821
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
So having that place Boulder

822
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Perspective

823
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Fidelity

824
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,352
I think that's something I can offer for this business

825
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
And I think that's also a 1

826
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
Key differentiation

827
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
What's wind nausea for short eyebrows

828
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,592
So that's something as a founder

829
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
And first-generation Chinese founder dies

830
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,968
We have said repeatedly on the show

831
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Alice podcast

832
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
Politics are local

833
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:02,208
The fusion technology Biz model idea Talon capitals very gloomy

834
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,280
So you are

835
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,864
Your knowledge of what's happening in china's bike-sharing definitely

836
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,192
I'll give you a call in analyzing potential the US market

837
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
And they're quite a big difference

838
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Come to Market

839
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
As it turns out that

840
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,360
You know it is screen sharing is more popular in the US in an e-bike

841
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
Brother in the original pedal bike sharing

842
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
But

843
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,504
You guys made a lot of changes

844
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,064
In localization to make that work in US

845
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,368
As you expand to Europe and

846
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,440
Other regions Beyond us

847
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,488
What are the things you look out for

848
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,560
And how do you make sure that you can continue to localize

849
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,376
2 needs of local consumers inevitable

850
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:46,752
There two things I think Matt has a lot but we're thinking about International

851
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
1 is

852
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
The market

853
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
Right is it

854
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,408
Kind of similar to

855
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
The US market

856
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
All intensive the

857
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,784
Social economics

858
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
And then the waiting list

859
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Hey and then

860
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Enchanted

861
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
Costco open

862
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
Open minded

863
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,768
Bob adoption around by Sharon Den

864
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
If there is a room I think

865
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,144
That's a good fit for us that's why we're thinking about Europe

866
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
And some of the

867
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,264
Which we can add more value

868
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,848
Yo by leveraging what we've learned in US

869
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
Around Market

870
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
And then the other thing is really about

871
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
The chi Trice out

872
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
One thing that we

873
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Things that we do right

874
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,648
Or I think we position relatively well

875
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
It. Will you set up a local team

876
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,512
In the US and also in any Market

877
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
And we trust

878
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,144
The local team we give them a lot of autonomy by

879
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Dual

880
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
Enabling dumb

881
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
Our Essential Knowledge

882
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,408
Enable with the local

883
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
P.m.

884
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
And local hires

885
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
How to make the right decision

886
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
Was cuz we just

887
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
We can't understand everything

888
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
I think you know

889
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,928
Making sure that we mobilize the team

890
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,744
I'll remote remotely with the right incentive

891
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
With the right Focus

892
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
Do you envision or City

893
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Change

894
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
As

895
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
How we get around

896
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,752
Changes so like maybe scooters an device requires only infer

897
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Do you think

898
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
Cities watch

899
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
Adapt our environment

900
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
How we're getting it

901
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
I do believe in that

902
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
And we have seen that

903
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Nowadays

904
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
We've seen cities

905
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,648
Using hours

906
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Show data

907
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,512
To identify where people are writing more scooters and bikes

908
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,072
And they are using that

909
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,168
To make their own infrastructure

910
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
Decision

911
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
The past is really a

912
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
Unknown area

913
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
I'll for them to

914
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,128
Design a bike rack

915
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
Now they have the data in that I like

916
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Seattle we know they're working

917
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
Also for bike and scooter park

918
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
In the past

919
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
Is Regions around bike rack

920
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392

The one provides

925
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
Flexibility

926
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144

For our bikes and scooters we seen that in

940
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:54,656
South Bend Indiana Lucy night in Austin and then also Seattle

941
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
And we also spreading all this

1146
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,943
Great works

1147
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
Around the globe right especially in China

1148
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
You know they pioneered industry

1149
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
Something that inspired us

1150
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
Start a business

And

1153
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:57,119
Also the way it ended the speed that they're executing is really fast

1154
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,191
A few things I think it's being

1155
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,007
Quite challenging put down also we try to avoid

1156
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
Some of the

1157
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055

1161
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Aetna provider support

1162
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
For the local market tool

1163
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
Either way

1164
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
It's that simple

1165
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
What's the number one thing

1166
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,951

1167
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
Or expanding globally

1168
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279

1169
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
Is that all

1170
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,095

1171
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
Everything will work

But we took

1184
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
Of course once we'd

1185
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,535
