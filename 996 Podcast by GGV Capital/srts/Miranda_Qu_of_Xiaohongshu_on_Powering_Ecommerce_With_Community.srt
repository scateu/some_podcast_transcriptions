Kind of bag for over 10 years

70
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
4 years ago when we wanted

71
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
To do something

72
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Internet

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
We found that

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
They're interesting that Chinese people are traveling overseas

75
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
For shopping

76
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
This is something that we didn't expect

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Earlier

78
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,904
There isn't any

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Application that tackled this Market

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
For Chinese shopping overseas

81
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
But this is an opportunity we see and it will quickly

82
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,424
Gather some information abdominal platform to

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Teach people how to shop overseas

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Then

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Quickly trying to a social platform

86
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
People can share information about

87
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,480
On what they buy and how they make the decision and the where to buy

88
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Travel company

89
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Or was it a

90
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Social networking company

91
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904

Shopping tips

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
It's very interesting when we first launched in our store app store travel category 4

94
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
A long time

95
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
Why you are you how old are you are kind of like a shopping

96
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,591
Return to shopping category and you know the other apps

Ask ask

98
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Kind of liking trouble

99
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
I would say it's a combination

100
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
Actually tackle the problem the shopping problem

101
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599

Shopping while they shooting join you know the Beautiful Things overseas

105
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
It's because it's

106
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Veritiv

107
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Fordham to baidu

108
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Saint to get those information

109
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
That's why

110
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
We think that they need a social community

111
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,663
To share the information to get more knowledge about what you buy

112
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
Where to buy that's why you're called Little Red Book

113
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,575
You're like a guidebook for people to know where to find things

114
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
The comedy

115
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,207
Yes and do no wrong in China is a very Chinese color

116
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
It's very easy to remember and

117
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
Bookcase not only a travel book that it's also the rich between something you know when something

118
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
Thing you didn't know

119
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,519
We will always consider ourselves that's kind of like

120
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Was something that you don't know

121
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
You can discover more last out there

122
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
Remember when I first met you guys

123
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
About the startup

124
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
It was

125
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
24

126
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
You got started

127
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
4

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Or just over you

129
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
At all

130
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
Yes

131
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Damaged a lot of

132
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Incontinent

133
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Regenerated

134
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
How did you guys think about

135
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Focusing on contouring

136
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Versus Commerce

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Early on

138
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Why did you start

139
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
Come first and not touch Commerce

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
We started was very light

141
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Countenance

142
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,087
Because that with incontinence important is because we think that it's the first.

143
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,903
For people to discover the neulasta

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,999
You should gather information and then come up with the problem that how to get things

145
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
So it's

146
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
It's very

147
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
Natural

148
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
For users

149
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,727
They have to discover that things they would like

150
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
And then they would think that how to get

151
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
So that's why we start this accountant platform

152
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
Truly based on kind of

153
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
To solve users problem to take OST

154
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
It's not that kind of something that we want

155
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
At the end of 2014

156
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
I do not receive a lot of complaining about it you know we see a lot of beautiful things everyday baby

157
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Where to buy them

158
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Exactly

159
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
Look at this despite rain for those overseas items is there it's hard to buy them in China

160
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
They're either too expensive in a shopping War

161
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Something's dead

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
The lost things that are not in China yet

163
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
And the other things do you know

164
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,647
Take out them you don't know whether it's fake or what is to expenses

167
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
So

168
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
What's a wow that's a child

169
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:32,095
And the end of that year does so kind of new policy issued by Chinese government

170
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
It's called the cross-border

171
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
E-commerce

172
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
And there comes out of town

173
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543

190
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Ghana maybe time

191
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
For import

192
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
So I met

193
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
About 10 other companies

194
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Aldi quadsport

195
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
Commerce in Oconto

196
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,855
You were the only one that comes out before

197
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
And you're the one

198
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
Your tuna with the least amount of Commerce experience

199
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
We start investing you

200
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
Sears bikes

201
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Thinking that

202
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
So hard you could come to

203
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Serbia stronk

204
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Competitive advantage

205
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,615
Worried at any point in time that people will come to your place

206
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Read the content

207
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Discover tips

208
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Then go somewhere else

209
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Toy shop

210
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
And not come

211
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Conduction

212
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
And how do you overcome that fear

213
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
What concern

214
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,487
Yes I think we will Vera work as first but you know

215
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Taurus

216
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Not something that we do

217
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
Also they are very

218
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
List file

219
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,751
I do remember that when we first launched one product

220
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
In our at our path warm is

221
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
It was so loud like in 10 seconds

222
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,711
Identify my damn we launched kind of like 10 products

223
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
It's kind of like very step-by-step thing

224
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
I still remember Ella at a January of 2016 are mostly gianvi is around 1

225
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Chameleon

226
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
We

227
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Kind of like 100 million

228
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,167
That was only half a year so I think all confidence

229
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
For PewDiePie users

230
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,079
People are pay more and more all platforms because they really wanted

231
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Yes

232
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
So

233
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,063
I think Lori bed to worry it makes no sense so what would

234
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
What does pry

235
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Do you think that

236
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
People will only pay

237
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
The higher price

238
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Toy shop you're on your platform

239
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
When you face

240
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Spending our looks

241
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Forty malt

242
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
I think

243
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,471
Generally I think we're very reasonable price

244
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,847
Because I want all the team was very difficult to identify whether

245
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
This products

246
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
Is Frank City Pops hours

247
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
They can be lazy

248
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
And I think to help our uses

249
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,647
You offer convenience

250
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,327
So I think that's why they started shabab platform

251
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
And another thing that we think it's really important

252
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Is the coffee

253
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Because we started

254
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,615
It's a community and they don't already know I said we can take no ass

255
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Every continent

256
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Yahushua

257
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
True

258
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,855
It's kind of like written by all users with no kind of like benefits

259
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
So they really process platform

260
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
That's the trastes transfer from Community to e-commerce

261
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
So did you

262
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
We also something did you start a fire

263
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
I think so very long period of time

264
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,239
90% of all items are sold out

265
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
Within 24 hours

266
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,639
Sulphur V have review we would just try to just look for more items

267
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
So

268
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
That was the first stage of are you

269
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
Building process data

270
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
We asked you to place

271
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Remember to

272
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Conversion

273
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
Was as high as

274
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,023
2% which I'm never seen anywhere else

275
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
So it's you

276
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Build out the app

277
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Create account

278
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
And I share a lot of good

279
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
4

280
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Free

281
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
You don't pay them any

282
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
How do you get them

283
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
I think just so you know

284
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,759
Especially for women to share what to buy

285
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Is a neat

286
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
Previously they made a shirt on waist

287
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,511
And then people will say okay kind of election food that people will say some negative words

288
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
It's about it

289
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,607
So they actually need somewhere to show their lifestyle

290
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
And to find

291
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,983
Yes exactly so I think to create a

292
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Friendly

293
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,103
I'm mister and greater kind of like a very friendly

294
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Environment is

295
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
There is a report

296
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
I would take another example you know

297
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Everyday we will you kind of like

298
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,391
Took a lot of pictures and the place them all all moment

299
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
In this case there's a trend

300
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
I'm people

301
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,607
Every national holiday people are kind of sharing their power packs

302
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
WeChat moments

303
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Don't pay them anything and

304
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
There's not an activity called

305
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Place your

306
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Hubble pics

307
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Kind of like environment

308
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
I'm always doing that

309
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Horseshoe way always

310
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Put a lot of kind of

311
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Product average

312
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Shaquille environment

313
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
Do chip.

314
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
People 2 still Luton

315
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
To share more

316
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
So I think that's what we

317
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,863
For those who may not be as familiar with the product itself

318
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,215
I'm actually a very seamless integration between the social and the

319
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,799
Community in the Commerce so you can follow influencers and then

320
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
See the pictures they share and that you can see

321
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,479
The clothes are wearing tack by brand and then you can click into those brand origin

322
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,319
EBay Quake on The Closer where I can buy them

323
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
From the app

324
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
So I think is a very powerful

325
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Way to

326
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
Convert social traffic into actually Commerce

327
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Transaction

328
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
Amanda tomorrow that we seen

329
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,447
Which Sandlot in China and it's only starting out in the US

330
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,335
So I guess we can shift the topic to talk the more about your personal background so

331
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
What made you want to start this Venture with your co-founder shower and how did you meet him

332
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
Sorry I actually

333
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Boston

334
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:21,695
Brass and we actually met at the mall called maze it's okay

335
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
It's a true story that

336
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
You are just shopping there

337
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
Yes exactly at a shopping place and that's a Time both of us were universities

338
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Woodward

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007

You know I do

342
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
Met him before because

343
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
There was so many in Chinese

344
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
And I are both from I heard someone saying the local dialect

345
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Kind of calling.

346
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,999
Power and son is saying something about shopping and that's

347
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
My first impression was very appropriate that you met in the mall yeah I've been and never imagined than one

348
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
Do something about overseas shopping

349
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,591
We first started the we started with some kind of like shopping guys you know

350
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151

How to shop in USA

352
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
And that was for our very first

353
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
Very interesting

354
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Fuel

355
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,391
Life is always come around

356

357
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Idea in the first place

358
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
We actually didn't come up with this idea

359
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583

00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Crazy

00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,471
Are you a big fan of shopping yourself and how much shopping do you do

378
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031

You can see that we met at a shopping place

381
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
I think it's

382
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,039
It's really something that we both lost and weed everyday I

383
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599

386
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
So I chop up really a lot

387
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Harvard

388
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583

389
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935

Towing

395
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,511
We were born the same year that the towing is when

396
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Year

397
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,119
Yes

398
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,263
OTB of course he said he did at Yalta when the granite is Stanford GSB

399

So he's very very Talent

400
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895

401
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,991
My parents wanted me to start earlier you know you ain't in Chinese

402
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,879

Can you use study journalism you school do you think that helped you at all with word entrepreneurship Journey

404
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:15,935
Please write the first draft of the blind

405
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,543
Say that a generalist is someone that collected information and distributor

406
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
I think that's

407
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Kind of like what's your horseshoe doing

408
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,223

409
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,319

Also it helps people to get information kind of like

411
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,815
Awesome journalism has to kind of like the same logic behind

412
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,911
So where it where the top countries that you Source your products from

413
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Nowadays

414
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
Japan to Korea apples Ferry

415
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Pop's right you know

416
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Taqueria

417
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,711
The Korean pop Star has a very popular in China the movies the TV series

418
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,759
I think the current temperature

419
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
Is very popular in China that gives an olive

420
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Laws of tuna to 2

421
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,951
Have more exposure about their friends and

422
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
And the second reason for that is suno

423
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,863
When people in the Chinese people are more

424
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
They look alike

425
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Explorer

426
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983

427
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
If worse the trash

428
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,591
Is there a different sizes and the very different sets

429
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615

430
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,967
Korean most popular and another one is Japan

431
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
No dependas

432
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Famous boys quality

433
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
And they has a lot of

434
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,159
Smaller brains with kind of like a thousand years of History

435
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
But I think that's

436
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
What people are buying right now for the college

437
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,119
I know you mentioned recently that the proportion of overseas products on sale home she was actually at the

438
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,679
Declining and people are willing to buy

439
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
The message Chinese brand

440
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,407
For the last 2 or 3 years why did crossword, sista populist

441
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Because that mean China

442
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
Interesting new brands

443
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,623
I don't think

444
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
They just want to buy two items

445
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:19,327
In China

446
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
Before but they just one

447
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Quality Prada

448
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Yes exactly

449
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:28,287
I think it right now there is a lot of new emerging brands in China that people love

450
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,431
CVS photo cards

451
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,575
So it's a shoe brand that also has its own Cafe where you can

452
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
Have afternoon tea and shop for high heels at the same time

453
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Yes

454
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
So

455
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
I do think it's because the right of both the consumer

456
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
Any more receptive to local Brands and also

457
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Domestic brands

458
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Rising

459
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
At the same time

460
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,031
I think I'm actually the younger generation

461
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Have no buyers

462
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,175
About whether this brand zizo vs always domestic

463
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,039
Suck their domestic friends now

464
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
Put more focus on brand building

465
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
Rather than owning the kind of

466
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,464
I think previously they put

467
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
Are too much emphasis on

468
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,864
Two on the production butter than the brand Beauty

469
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
All right now

470
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
They know how to do it

471
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
How to tell the story

472
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
And it helps a lot

473
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Jeffers

490
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Other half I think they're

491
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
The field area they still look for

492
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:22,976

500
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
3 2 1

501
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Let me give an example

502
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
This year

503
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:48,576

I think it's very difficult to say

512
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Especially for us

513
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
First of all we're sociopaths for

514
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,760

There was kind of light on

00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
425 * 7

588
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
40 *

589

Yes

590
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
But I've seen

591
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360

Yes.

602
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:51,264
So I think you guys have made a conscious decision not to use advertising as you remain

603
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,872
Source of Revenue could you talk about that decision because I think in the US a lot of

604
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,016
Internet companies especially those that have community and content still rely on Advertising as their main

605
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Meditation mode

606
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344

607
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
A friend

608
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
My friend has a very interesting conclusion that

609
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
Because they think that

610
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
You can be very lazy you know

611
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,912
You don't have to do all that you know how they say

612
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Logistics name

613
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
Exactly because everyone

We think it's the best

624
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
For the company to grow

625
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240

635
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
The entry barrier

636
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Because people

637
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
They make the shopping decisions here

638
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
And they can directly by here to don't have to jump to

639
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,424
Either he comes pass from 2 to look for things

Find a place to make the shop decision become more and more important and there I believe there are a lot of them

654

657
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
The one of the first thing I noticed

658

Virtual items

672
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
This is why when we

673
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
We might

674
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160

677
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,376

We do you, spend we warlike eCommerce platform

682
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,344
Because we have so much content and users

683
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,416
So they lost new brands they want to sell hair

684
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,304
So they can't open the kind of shop themselves rather than that we have to do a lot of heavy things

685
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
I think that's going to be the future

686
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
But still kind of like

687
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704

We do think that sounds the place to discover

744
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
You think so but over time

745
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656

755
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,352
Do they still search for things like in a targeted way

756
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,424

757
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,824

Call Cole

761
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
We're kind of a platform that has a lock

762
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
Reviews reviews in the comments

763
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
Which are generated by users

764
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
And there

765
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Very trustworthy

766
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
That's why uses words eventually come to the platform and to discover more information and actually

767
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:19,008
Most of them I made the most of the Mets shop decisions here that's what

768
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
I think that's what matters most

769
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:28,736
What do you use the Technologies in algorithms to recommend in personalized content

770
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
For users

771
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Based on their interest

772
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
Yeah I'm definitely

773
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
I think that's

774
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
Main focus

775
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
For last year

776
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
Because you know

777
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,816
Wait user kind of like Adam although you can only cater for

778
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
One kind of

779
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Users

780
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,960
When we use Ai and they use the machine to start

781
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
Chualar about users

782
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
Not everybody see things different

783
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
So that's all

784
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,432
E-commerce

785
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Launch this a strategy

786
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296

Recent

790
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Recommendation

791
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488

792
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
How do you balance

793

Put some summer young user

794
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,608
Based on what

795
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
She buys

796
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
You can tell that she's a

797
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,472
And you can get a sense of her budget

798
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
How much is spent on

799
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
Don't you order so how do you balance between

800
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Pushing other stuff that she

801
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
Ford Pharmacy

802
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
Bring something that she would

803
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
Aspire to one of

804
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Inspired by

805
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
How do you pronounce

806
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
Switch

807
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Products you

808
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Leprosy first

809
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Okay

810
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
The first of all

811
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:49,120
Interesting thing about our data is cemented we use it's not coming from the purchase Behavior

812
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
From the content

813
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:55,008
What they see and what they like

814
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,152
I may can only invite kind of like 40 R&B lipstick but I want to see the 301

815
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
So

816
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
The data source is kind of like the French

817
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,832
And another thing is the mother has exchanging everyday which is

818
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
Simple Alive new kind of like

819
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
You waste

820
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
Cubase you sour Cafe

821
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
So

822
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
Right now

823
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:23,424
We don't have a kind of. The best model is improving everyday

824
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,984
The one question we asked every one of our guests

825
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
Sister working schedule

826
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
This podcast is caught 96 as we are recording this at 10 p.m. on a Friday

827
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,552
Just wanted to ask typical hours I shall Horseshoe Inn

828
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
As a startup and how has

829
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Has it changed

830
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
Florida Gators

831
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,720
At first we walked

832
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Kind of like

833
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
6 days now what artist

834
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
5 working days

835
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
We started

836
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:59,776
Add a the company's that at the Town clock in the morning and I think

837
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
Nowadays

838
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
A lot of teams around

839
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,272
Near the end of year do you still have to work very hard to about 10 or 9 to 10

840
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
Best for something

841
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,392
I think they they can't get up earlier

842
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,232
Is busier During certain Seasons like double 11

843
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Yeah shopping

844
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:27,936
We're still very kind of like a very startup company

845
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
I wish

846
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
People that

847
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
Crazy for

848
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
The things they wanted

849
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
So they would

850
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Care about

851
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
Related to working hours

852
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Accomplish

853
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,112
Recently in the US we have Black Friday

854
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,928
Michelle Hunter also has red Friday

855
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
Kohl's

856
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
Could you talk about this year's

857
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
Red Friday

858
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,864
What are some how did it go

859
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Is he

860
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
It went very well of course

861
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,032
Red Friday is kind of the festival that we

862
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
Crave for

863
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
Those who love

864
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
Tissot vs

865
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
Products

866
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
I think this year is a bit different because this year we are venturing to ww11 for the first time

867
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Time

868
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
Souldoll uses

869
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,976
Have dislike to festivals

870
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
November

871
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
So

872
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,656
Did you know that we saw a lot of reviews ads on that very haphazard

873
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
2

874
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,496
Enjoy like a whole month celebration

875
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
By purchasing a lot of things

876
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,736
As a esposa e, Dennis social

877
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Platform

878
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,160
What would you think how do you define success for a child tropical success can mean different things

879
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
I asked for

880
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,072
Social platform is usually usually measured by engagement and number of Mau

881
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:04,192
E-commerce is usually measured by gmv so how would you balance those

882
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,776
I think we'll just stage main focus

883
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
I'm a sociopath

884
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
Define this.

885
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
Arwen

886
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,528
The Chinese the young people they won't discover more lifestyle

887
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,832
The first brand jumping Utah has it

888
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
Deseret Book

889
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
I think that's the kind of a

890
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
Fasting

891
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
We watch it

892
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,744
Because I always

893
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,328
Think of yourself online Disneyland

894
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,632
You know just and then represent

895
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
Loving

896
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
And a lot of traffic

897
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,776
That you don't from the very you know

898
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,848
The richest in China we caught by fumi

899
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,432
To some somebody who's had to travel to

900
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
Who is traveling to Shanghai for the Space Place

901
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,528
Go to Disneyland

902
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
Offline

903
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,112
Bed actually at the ticket

904
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,512
It's not the Memphis model you know what they have restaurants that have shops that have long things inside

905
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,632
Exactly I think I'll community-based at Disneyland

906
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:11,008
So our main Focus ST YouTube

907
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,848
I think I will keep you the restaurants or shops you know

908
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
Right now with what you have

909
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,688
Not that many shops and restaurant and

910
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:24,832
There's not many things you can do all of you can consume

911
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
Sweating

912
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:31,232
Doing that but that's all main focus is stupid a larger than

913
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,072
So that more people can go here and they related

914
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Discovered

915
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
As you can you expand your

916
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Goddess Alexa

917
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
So fast

918
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
That's all

919
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
A couple years ago

920
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
And then

921
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Not sure

922
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Start a business

923
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
A cheaper version of

924
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
How do you guys think about your

925
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
How do you plant

926
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
And

927
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,912
I think this about their

928
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,240
Scalable business time

929
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,336
I still sing weathergard different we're social

930
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
Nightstand

931
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
Really not

932
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,688
Kind of a purely eCommerce platform

933
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,248
For private label I would think that's

934
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Every company has very different strategy

935
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,112
Because she'll chew is the label itself

936
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:34,720
When you think of cell phone through you think of quality live using useful life itself

937
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,840
Talking to this Market we want to do something about Brandon

938
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,144
Something about the sign something about Google

939
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Call of Duty

940
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
Rhododendron is kind of like

941
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:49,568
Cheaper version or it's kind of like hot China custom job

942
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Within

943
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
Bring it to some friends

944
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
Some friends that

945
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
Reasonable price

946
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Betty on people love

947
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,295
So it's going to the final part of

948
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
The podcast with Chase quick fire around

949
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,439
The first question is what motivates you to wake up each morning at work

950
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
Keeps you up at night

951
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,839
While I was say to really make the world a better place through

952
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,191
Social and yes now we're around

953
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:21,823
When you feel very heavy responsibility

954
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
What was the most

955
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Inspiring

956
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
Story

957
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
I still remember that

958
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
Very early days

959
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
When they did

960
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,367
We received some

961
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
Hometown for Harvard

962
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,999
And you know one of our user has written

963
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
So long the letter

964
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,607
Send his I remember most at

965
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
You made a sea otter

966
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
I really want to send you that is because you made us

967
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,287
See more possibilities

968
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,895
$10

969
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
So that

970
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,503
She wants to kind of like a b or better herself

971
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,319
I think that's very touching you know you have

972
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,391
Change someone's life

973
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,183
This kind of story songs Yahoo

974
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,535
And that really gives us a lot of motivation to work harder

975
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
Help women

976
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Exactly

977
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,679
To find a confidence and the gradually build model

978
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
And what keeps you up at night

979
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
What would you worry about

980
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
I think

981
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,639
There's sometimes I don't know whether I'm growing fast

982
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
2

983
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
Keep up with the path of the company

984
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
That's

985
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
I think first of all personally

986
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,879
If I stop growing

987
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,743
That might be the chance that the company will grow slower

988
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,815
I always wanted to know

989
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,607
To know what I don't know

990
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,703
I think that really helped the company to go

991
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
What do you do for

992
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,335
To ensure that your growing constantly personally

993
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
Reading and talking with a lot of

994
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Bee pollen

995
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,503
Yes at 2

996
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
Jingdong is kind of like

997
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,391
Community created by tens and it's like 50 startup CEOs

998
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:15,999
That we went a lot of classes and a trip together

999
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,815
Really helped a lot that made a lot of friends and

1000
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,191
Another thing is that read books

1001
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
I think I've

1002
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,799
Over 20 books last year

1003
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Yeah

1004
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
I think when I have a question you know now that sells lot of ways to learn to you can read a book you can listen

1005
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
Since you pull test

1006
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
There's a lot of ways to Elara

1007
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,135
Once you have the problem you always have to

1008
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,951
Can talk to a person then you can love me by yourself

1009
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,767
So out of those books which one was your favorite

1010
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,095
Very interesting

1011
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,679
I realized recently I read two books

1012
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:02,591
Leadership

1013
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
Management

1014
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,943
You know this year the team is going very fast

1015
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
The anxiety of

1016
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
Not mention

1017
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,183
After reading this to can I have more

1018
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
About the management

1019
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
So I think that's

1020
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,327
I like

1021
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,911
And another book is very interesting

1022
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,959

Shoe wrap up

1032
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,231

1033
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,351
I remember Sherry Road that's on

1034
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
