00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,911
What are two things you mentioned I definitely agree

191
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
I think the first thing is that he he

192
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Presents

193
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
One of the sexes

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Aldi's Factor

195
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
With scale

196
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
With explosive growth

197
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
And also was

198
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Almost

199
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
Certainty that the changes going to happen

200
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,575
So that that's something I agree with your sister

201
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Second

202
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
When I think we were just asking this

203
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
It's also a competitor

204
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
You know you mentioned are hundreds new startup

205
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Joining this

206
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
House of movement

207
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,351
I know I think of you know they all cops you not responding startup

208
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Spectabilis tow companies

209
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
Existio yams

210
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Trying to do

211
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Alexa vehicle

212
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
However I think of what

213
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Cell phone or Exxon doing definitely is a

214
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
We're not just focused on making electric vehicle

215
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
You know a lot of the Stardust actually

216
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
Are people who came from the original OEM

217
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
And their vision

218
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Aldi Roanoke

219
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
But ideas just to make Maybe

220
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Cheaper or better electric vehicle from a gas engine

221
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,767
I'm because of the unique DNA that she'll pull himself trained to the business

222
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
As well as

223
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Type in a unique starting point

224
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
In off the venture

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
Excel Motors actually set out to

226
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Scenic Design

227
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
And built not CD but I smart intelligent

228
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Thomas driving

229
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
We are one of the very few I would say

230
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
Are the startups a she does I'll Hardware

231
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Software

232
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
Autonomous driving oil

233
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
Are we can leave in a integrated capability

234
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
We believe that in order to

235
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
To provide the best product

236
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Experience

237
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
To deprive ourselves

238
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Customers

239
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
You need to own all these three pieces

240
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
Gbreb Manufacturing

241
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Supplies for the software

242
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Thomas Drive

243
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,031
And also we do differently from some of the other startups is that

244
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Started

245
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Focusing on Balaji

246
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Sacramento

247
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Auto market

248
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Which is Middle C

249
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
Al Price Point

250
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Is actually

251
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
Is pubg targeting us the largest

252
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Selling price point segment

253
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Chinese

254
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Passenger.

255
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
So you know in like a some of the penis

256
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
I think we want our technology to be used and enjoyed by

257
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
The mass Market

258
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
And I think

259
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Our technology differentiation

260
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
In this segment will be

261
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
I sleep very bright

262
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
A standout

263
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Apache off

264
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,847
Soex phone calls itself an internet car company

265
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Set up a

266
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
Evo electric car

267
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,503
Yeah so what is the difference between in my car any electric car

268
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
And how does Shopkins background

269
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
As an intern executive for a long time

270
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Become a differentiation

271
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
Yeah so this is actually a very

272
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Interesting question

273
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,047
So when we launched our these three which is the

274
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,607
.... Car in December

275
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Delivery

276
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
For a number of opinion leaders

277
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
In Industry to

278
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Here there definition what

279
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
I ain't in that car or small car intelligent

280
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Looks like

281
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Everybody

282
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
So that means that there's no

283
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
Absolute definition with a smart car

284
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
It's

285
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
But what we plead that make

286
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
I'll call carsmart

287
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
Can I just be in a someone with a big screen and you can

288
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
And also the past some sort of a application features

289
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,095
You really need to get up so early design a vehicle that

290
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
And Ashley learn

291
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Respond

292
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
And provide you with

293
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Experience

294
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,335
So I think my mind has three elements of a vehicle

295
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Ontology

296
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
They need to have in order to

297
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Qualify

298
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
To be called

299
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Smart car

300
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
What I think you know that

301
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
The car self should have a deep learning capability

302
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Suidae in traction

303
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Exchange with driver

304
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
Example in our current vehicle that was telling

305
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
How we can use voice

306
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
To come in the car

307
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
The cock and learn your preferences

308
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Your route

309
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
Listening to type of songs you like

310
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
Are you actually and I have some driving

311
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
Patterns inside

312
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Sold car can I sleep

313
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,919
Become smarter and understand you better by spider services in

314
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
Ximena productivity

315
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
So that's a first degree

316
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Inside of you

317
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,855
The second people reacting to qualify car to be smarter I think

318
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
Is the ability to do OTA

319
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
I think a lot of cars now claimed that he have

320
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
Over-the-air upgrade kit ability

321
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,887
But if you look at them some of those capabilities mainly just to upgrade their

322
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Screen application

323
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
But I think I'll be more

324
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,031
To make a call Trudy smart you have to be in much deeper than that

325
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Right now I was saying them with your teeth

326
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
ECU electronic control unit

327
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Can be upgraded over the year

328
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
And our next model

329
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Even billing

330
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,599
In April we actually anticipate you have 100% of our ecu's to

331
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
OT aide

332
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
So that's a second thought

333
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,975
And I think the sopot obviously is your Thomas driving kit

334
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
So in order to make a Car Smart

335
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
He has to be able to

336
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
How to learn how to fly the South

337
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Are we actually a very proud

338
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,215
To say that our current selling model G3

339
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
Is probably the only domestic

340
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
Manufactured volume produced model in corporate self develop

341
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Selale Thomas Drive

342
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
And that's something I can

343
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
I think I won't make her

344
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
Also smartsilk

345
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,343
All those three capabilities I can I think a car

346
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
Can be truly called a small intestine bigger

347
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,743
So I wanted to talk about your personal background where did you grow up in

348
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
Why did you go to the US for Middle

349
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Clapping sound

350
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
I actually I always tell my

351
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Friends

352
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
I'm probably the

353
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,799
Il Vicino the lot of shinies that she came from different cities

354
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,919
But my grandfather my father and I are growing same Hospital in Shanghai

355
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,503
So is that

356
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,855
So you mentioned I actually left Shanghai very early my rolling

357
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,719
A year's time I went to the US when I was 12 years old I actually

358
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
Spent two years in us for Middle School

359
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
And then

360
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
I came back to

361
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
To China High School

362
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Because I Fall to my mother who's a business daughter the time

363
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
So she could have time to China

364
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
App to see your sister

365
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
After High School I decided to go to the US to college again

366
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,503
So I went back to Oregon to cut my undergrad degrees

367
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
And then

368
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
Washington to for my PhD

369
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
So my

370
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,975
First phase in my Curry always want to be a scientist by study biochemistry

371
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
I was fascinated by signs

372
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
Obviously because my family

373
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Are all scientists

374
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
My mom was Ashley

375
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Camas

376
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
So when funny story is that

377
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
When I started in Oregon

378
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Before I walked into my first class

379
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,663
They already had me and she said your major is chemistry

380
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
Who asked if the kids is for me so I actually

381
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,783
Because my mom's back law so she thought that was the

382
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
The best subject to study

383
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,671
So I studied biochemistry and then attack on my PC

384
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,255
I decided that I want to do something different I

385
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
Felt that you know the scientific training was

386
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
Thanks tithing but I feel like I want to do something that is more

387
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,543
People eating people and Thomas

388
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
But I do know what I want to do so I went to

389
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Steuben School

390
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Portraits

391
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
70 gal

392
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
I got my MBA Palmdale school management

393
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
And at Yale like

394
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
Got to learn about

395
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
I know the finance side of the business

396
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
It is east coast.

397
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Not a people focus something came in and asked

398
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Naturally Iceland

399
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Ended up

400
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Joining

401
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Out of business

402
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
So

403
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
In a few years actually I was

404
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
What's in New York

405
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
I was at Lemans

406
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
My focus has given my background about chemistry

407
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
I thought I would definitely make a cookie

408
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Housekeeping

409
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,479
How much I spent probably five-six years focused on Healthcare

410
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
UST global companies

411
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Decided to

412
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Return to Asia

413
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
+ 2

414
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Really

415
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
I saw the opportunity

416
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
China

417
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
Booming and also I think banking sectors

418
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
Transformation

419
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
So I decided to

420
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
And Joint Chief Morgan

421
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
So in China

422
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
We started seeing a tradition

423
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Developing

424
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
Populace educated

425
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151

426
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919

00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Such a smart allow tencent

430
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
Or just high of Alibaba

431
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Horchata

432
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Child of Athena

433
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
You join Xbox Auto

434
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
It's also could be another example

435
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,095
Obviously in case of Martin and Joe and

436
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Charles

437
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Welcome to Bo

What do you see

441
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
That's your role

442
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
And contribution at the expense to be like

443
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Golang for

444
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
And now that you've been there for a year

445
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
What are the some of the

446
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Interesting surprises

447
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Or adjustments. You have made

448
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
So far

449
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
Well I think Martin and Joe and Charles actually they're good friends mine and I really respect what they had

450
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Have accomplished

451
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,351
Thank God they took different type of risks

452
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Awesome

453
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
Went into the industry by earlier

454
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
Young

455
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Stage Sand Company

456
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Diamond State

457
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
Somebody joined Aphrodite on the

458
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
But along the way they have

459
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Made

460
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Medicine practice

461
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Hyundai respective businesses

462
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,575
I think that this is definitely something that I would love to do a text to Motors

463
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,391
I believe that Evie is a global

464
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Industry

465
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
And then

466
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,767
It's also a cross-section of malt

467
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,839
Disciplines that can patch make it work

468
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Put sample

469
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
It's not merely Auto

470
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
It's not merely

471
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Technology company

472
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
It's not merely operating

473
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Service

474
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Company

475
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
It could also have

476
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Financial element

477
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Tu sonrisa

478
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
I see it's a very interesting about complexity

479
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
And I feel like my background

480
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
Being in the banking sector for

481
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
70 years

482
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
Seeing the development of many different success

483
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Companies

484
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,415
And also understanding the global

485
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Nature of

486
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Dealing with

487
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Partners

488
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Investors

489
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
And in the company's active

490
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
I believe I can bring

491
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
A sense of global

492
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Tooth business

493
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
The same time I think

494
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Expand

495
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031

496
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Stage of growth

497
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
Needs to connect by closely with

498
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
Capital markets

499
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
And that's an area

500
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Tremendous

501
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Experience

502
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,575
So I think we both in the near-term and the mountain

503
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,903
I would love to contribute to the vast

504
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927

505
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Antebellum

506
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Call the company

507
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,303
And also similar to those friends of mine who actually has done success

508
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,631
Spleen in tencent Ali Baba in Encino

509
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,983
I hope one day you know in my contribution kinster

510
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
Expand to be one of the global Giants

511
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,359
If I push the point this point little bit further

512
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
Operation side

513
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
What kind of things would you want

514
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
Swimwear Thailand

515
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
It's at the international

516
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Partnership

517
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
If so what can a partnership is

518
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Is possible

519
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,695
BM. What are the other areas of Interest

520
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
You to spend timer

521
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
Well I think the first order of business for us is to make sure we are firmly established as one

522
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
One of the global

523
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
China leaders in the moment

524
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
In the EB space all the intelligence

525
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
Maybe space we want to have that

526
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
In the mind of

527
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Global Investors

528
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
The club

529
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
I would say

530
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Soul Eaters

531
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
And global

532
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
Strategic

533
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
So that's an area I would love

534
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
To spend more time

535
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Cultivate

536
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Establish

537
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,927
Also I think young company which I think I have

538
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
Haven't asked you a question

539
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
What I see in the young companies

540
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Amanda

541
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Tremendously

542
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Interesting

543
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
And a how a young company evolve

544
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
You won't know that until you're inside the car

545
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,895
I think there's a tremendous learning power of the executives around me alot of those

546
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Puppy have not

547
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
Come through

548
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Large companies before

549
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
But they have lot of innovative ideas

550
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Pistos

551
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Good ideas

552
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,463
In a structured manner I think it also takes experience

553
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
An organization

554
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,047
And I think that's also an area that I would like to

555
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
Make sure we I contribute

556
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
Because my background experience in logic

557
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Two companies

558
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,495
I think I also in terms of two

559
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Provide the

560
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,871
The global I was a prospective a lot of things we do

561
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,199
Also can influence the direction of company's business

562
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
IOS development

563
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
As well as business model us elections

564
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
So these are as I think I hope to also

565
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
Shape with my involvement

566
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
I'm sure that's why I

567
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
BB saara

568
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
Choose to join him home early on

569
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
So now that you've been there for a year

570
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
What has a price

571
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
Like I said I think

572
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
What surprised me most is

573
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
How talented and how

574
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
You know I would say

575
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,151
How large the potential to learn in a for the young soccer

576
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Does Rami

577
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Because you actually

578
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,271
And you can't unlock company you always felt that

579
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
Okay we have seen a lot we know a lot and

580
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
We actually

581
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,415
Rakitic them you know how to do things

582
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
But you know China I think I specially was

583
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,535
At the talent surrounding us

584
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
But they have

585
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Real good

586
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Common sense in business judge

587
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
The Ashley has very innovative ideas

588
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
And actually you know there

589
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Ability to learn

590
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Also

591
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Tremendously powerful

592
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
So I think

593
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,735
What's the price of me most is actually I realize that

594
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
You know a lot of time.

595
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,087
Me and I love showing them how to do things

596
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
The proper Aldis of the global

597
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Are the

598
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,720
Biscay way in the electric company

599
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Actually I'm learning from

600
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Call Ashley

601
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
We can't do more Innovative things

602
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
And how we Act

603
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Boys fishing

604
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
So I was best

605
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
Surprised by my own learning

606
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Example

607
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
Noches user is 1.

608
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
In a traditional company innovation

609
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
You know you look at the ashes

610
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Selling a product

611
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
I think I heard there's a lot of the analysis

612
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
We have to go through

613
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Inl so that

614
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Standard channels

615
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
She actually

616
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
APUSH and understand in the market

617
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
Almost at Playbook

618
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,536
But I think I know there's a lot of innovative

619
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Measures to react

620
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Put into our business

621
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
WhatsApp not in sync

622
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Example

623
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Nobody in the past

624
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Other than

625
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Tesla

626
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
Enough people doesn't click and buy automobile

627
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,848
Right and it because it's something

628
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
It's a larger purchase item

629
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
People want to test

630
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Feel it

631
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
Aprotic we actually try to break down

632
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Processed into

633
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
To Tupac

634
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
We want yesterday

635
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Efficiently levity

636
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,904
Online and internet

637
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
So the the traffic

638
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
And the peel

639
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
And defend based approach

640
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
To generate excitement

641
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
The same time

642
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
We actually are directing that and funneling.

643
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Physical

644
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
What should we do it ourselves

645
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Enlarged City

646
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
Which is not a thing before

647
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Ian Ashley China

648
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
When we actually sell

649
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Automobile

650
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,944
A lot of times I think that you bring and you have exactly who come from

651
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
La Jolla company

652
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,552
BMW all from other automatic makers

653
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Ashley

654
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
And I was saying

655
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Blown Away by

656
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,976
How Innovative some some of the things that we're doing here

657
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,304
And I think we have results to show for it because if we actually look at

658
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Foot traffic

659
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,376
Coming to our showroom

660
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Tattoo by hour

661
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
A product

662
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,496
What is 50% of despotic acid

663
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Convert online

664
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
So which is actually a lot more efficient way than rely on

665
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
Just regular traffic inside a shopping mall

666
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
All the

667
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Physical stores

668
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
So I think these are things that we're doing

669
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Hopefully in differential cell

670
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,624
That you have all your own stores

671
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
Not

672
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
Dealers or channels

673
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,024
Right so I think I for a young company with a product that is

674
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Spell different

675
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,400
And also we want to have a direct connection with our

676
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
Customers

677
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,984
Direct stores is on The Rifleman

678
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
However if we

679
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,616
Scale-up and if we ask you one penetrate into

680
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
TS3 cure for other cities

681
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
I think that you cannot be old enough of your cell phone store so we will also explore Partnership if we decide to scale up

682
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,880
So I think we will always be

683
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Looking for the fast

684
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Model maybe it's a

685
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Hybrid

686
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,536
You're too but right now we are focused on building

687
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
I spent stores in the large city

688
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,912
I definitely some similarities between your approach and how

689
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Xiaomi

690
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
Start selling phones online

691
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
And I'm open xiaomi stores

692
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
Offline

693
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,336
So it is definitely a In-N-Out

694
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Inspired

695
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Model

696
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
Yeah well you know

697
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,272
Shuffle himself

698
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Isometry ISO

699
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,856
Innovating The Truman Show me used

700
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
To be Ashley

701
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,416
The chairman of UC

702
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Who sell

703
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
You know I can shop on

704
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:35,584
You snitching has one of the mentors so

705
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Are we if we want to

706
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
Received from

707
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,496
A successful model I shall meet which also very Innovative in the way they do business

708
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
However I think

709
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
As a car

710
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
The products by different from a smartphone

711
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
Also we need to

712
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Chica model

713
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
To make sure that you actually addresses some of the

714
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Pain points for Auto

715
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Assertive

716
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
Customers

717
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
So that's why we actually a compliment

718
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Nude protest

719
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
From my perspective

720
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Seeing call

721
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,976
Bank of China sell clothes online

722
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,304
But they weren't able to open up the stores offline

723
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Can you sell it

724
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
And then few years later

725
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,376
Legion

726
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
Waco with their selling phones online

727
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
And the tribe

728
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
Stores offline

729
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,080
And then another few hours later you guys want to do that in auto

730
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
Each time

731
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
Talents being taken

732
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Hard

733
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432

00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
Show me something. Even Google fail

735
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,296
And then before you got to do that not many others

736
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
Baby besides of Tesla

737
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Each time Chinese founder

738
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
Breaking new grounds

739
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Super exciting

740
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Absolutely

741
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,144
Social problems G3 car was released in December 2018 could you talk about what's special about this car and

742
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
Husband attraction

743
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,032
Volvo SUV

744

5 seater beautifully designed

745
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
How can show some pictures actually

00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
It's a very sporty look sickly Target

747
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Active

748
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
Drivers in large cities

749
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
And also

750
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
The car is packed with

751
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Technology

752
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
This is

753
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,184
Car has the level 2 + autonomous driving features

754
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,024
Which means that they have full has plus some of level three

755
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
Teachers in Lusby Samara example

756
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,168
We actually have a full scenario Auto parking.

757
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,752
Betta Fin City compared to everything that's out there on the market

758
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,336
Our car can parking More than 70%

759
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Different type of Parkinson's

760
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
In the parking lot and parking areas

761
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
Where is that compared to

762
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,016
Even Tesla

763
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,344
I will say poverty is one of the smarter cars

764
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,184
The only can identify probably less than 20%.

765
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
So we actually

766
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Provide

767
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
A very unique

768
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
And targeted

769
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Solution

770
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
2 hour driver

771
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
Are the car also has the ranch

772
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
Procharger

773
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
365 km

774
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
Which is already I was a sufficient for City use

775
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
The car has

776
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,896
Panoramic glass roof

777
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:02,016
To the model experience it also has one of the larger screens inside

778
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
That has a full control

779
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
Of the vehicle

780
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
Does not have

781
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
The traditional vehicles

782
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
Futuristic

783
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
And also was

784
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,352
Unique about cars that I actually drive our vehicle to work everyday

785
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
I don't even touch

786
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,496
I know the screen will control the window I use my in a voice command

787
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
So actually

788
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
The Voice Change is something that

789
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
Sweetie you know how is he different shading

790
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
Because we can actually

791
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
Select your music

792
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,736
Your lower your window turn on your

793
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Offense or

794
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Just your own

795
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:41,184
Seats for you and also yet will have also official recognition features was a AI camera

796
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Dashie can monitor your

797
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
Whether you are

798
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Distracted

799
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,608
Whether you're tired and you can monitor you

800
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
No heartbeat

801
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
So there's a lot of these cool intelligent features

802
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Enough

803
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,544
Poor me know the price point that we actually are

804
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,848
Hitting as I mentioned earlier is

805
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Very different

806
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Compared to

807
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
Tesla other premium mod

808
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,784
Our cars price between 150000 to 200000

809
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Which is less than half the price

810
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Model sleep most basic model

811
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Anytime around

812
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
22

813
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
2000 230

814
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
$3,000

815
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
Right so I think

816
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
We want to provide

817
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
A very different shade of younique

818
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Product

819
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Technology

820
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
To a segment

821
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,728
Is largest and a fast-growing

822
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,800
What what is the experience of driving

823
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
That car

824
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Guanciale

825
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Do you think China is equipped

826
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
You have

827
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Like a lot of

828
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
People driving

829
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
In terms of

830
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
For example charge

831
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,392
Driving an EV I think it's

832
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Baggies

833
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
Easier then

834
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,512
Other vehicles

835
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,560
No quiere

836
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,448
Go I think I was just three also is very easy to try and it's not

837
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
I despise someone

838
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
So we don't have the

839
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
Super fast acceleration

840
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,360
You know you asked me

841
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,016
Especially in the sodas 0 to 60 km

842
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,368
The reason I think people hesitate

843
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
To buy EV

844
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
I think the top reason is

845
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
I didn't know that

846
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
The distant anxiety

847
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
Is something that people always site

848
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Which probiotic

849
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Holistic

850
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Charging solution 2 hours

851
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Chivers

852
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
Chris Paul

853
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Privai home charging

854
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,824
To whoever that has a bit capability to install home Chargers

855
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,640
I have dedicated parking space so they have to run

856
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
She will get them

857
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Freon charge

858
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Second thing is actually have

859
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,296
Our own proprietary supercharging Network

860
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Best built in

861
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
Large cities that was selling a vehicle

862
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,976
No supercharging network only provide supercharged which is fast charger that

863
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
We designed Without Partners

864
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
And Spice

865
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,144
80% above charging for less than 40 minutes

866
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
So it's a very fast

867
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Charging time

868
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
Likely to

869
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
In a pasta

870
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
That time in English

871
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
How many of those are there

872
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
So we have built

873
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,432
Close to 2000 of these charging stations already

874
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
We have to have been opposed to 200 by this

875
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
End of the year

876
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,368
Solution we have is our vehicle can

877
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Be charged

878
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,256
Any of the third-party charging stations are charging companies or Papi charging.

879
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
China's you know is actually

880
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
Probably the most advanced systems building all the charging port

881
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
The government has already mandated

882
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,776
By 2020 to have close to finally charging piles

883
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
The wrong time

884
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,872
So means that you know it is going to have more charges

885
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Pyle Center

886
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
The rest of the world combined

887
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
So the Chinese government has been closed

888
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Billion dollars

889
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Subsidy

890
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
What you said

891
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
Support for buildings

892
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Charging station

893
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,928
In the build-out of a new energy vehicle industry

894
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
Between inelastic

895
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,536
But recently has been rolling back

896
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
Unsub

897
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
In some areas

898
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
How has this

899
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
The growth of

900
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Spending money

901
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
Built this industry

902
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
Help to support this

903
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
And house

904
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
The comeback

905
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Subsidies

906
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
Have any invite negative impact at all

907
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
On the sector

908
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,296
Yeah I think the Chinese government has been very very instrumental

909
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
Facilitating the development

910
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Eating

911
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
So the subsidy mansion

912
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
The infrastructure investment or part of the effort

913
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,328
To really push China to be one of the global leaders

914
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
North Dakota

915
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Easy

916
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,008
I think the Chinese dumpling is also thinking about what are the best way to

917
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Supporting this

918
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
I need subsidy has been

919
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
Puppies

920
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Last five years

921
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,992
Obviously GIF lot of the financial system to

922
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Eevee maker

923
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
But the same time I think

924
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,136
Yet I created some Dynamic that encouraged

925
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Lauren

926
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
Producers

927
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
Design and build products

928
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
That's not

929
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
The best product

930
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,072
The end of collecting subsidies

931
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
Which is not the right thing I need

932
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,008
And try to change the way these appointments be into boy fishing

933
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Me

934
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,592
Example they are a lot of policies that not

935
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,640
Be implemented around Chinese large city

936
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
So

937
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Eevee

938
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Can receive

939
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
Place much easier than

940
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
That's one of them

941
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
I would say tribe

942
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Easily

943
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
The cost of driving license

944
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
Secondly I think they actually

945
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,864
Are pushing the emissions standards

946
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
40 yams in

947
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
The cast in the world

948
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
So the emission standard become almost engine

949
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Ashley

950
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
I will say bye

951
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
Some measures China's actual already ahead of Euro

952
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
Affording Mission standard

953
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Require similar cities

954
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,992
I like YouTube and gas engine cost all together

955
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
So that is also some movement.

956
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
Pusheen

957
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
And also I think the continued investment into infrastructure is something

958
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
How to watch Leah

959
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Foster development

960
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
So I think that they overall

961
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
Tall is lhasa Oprah

962
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
Support on the common

963
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Contingency Bastrop

964
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
For ED

965
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Young Beauty companies like

966
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
Exomotive

967
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,432
Want to make sure we take advantage of these

968
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
Support

969
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,528
I got the skill pack of subsidy

970
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,552
It's Sunday felt

971
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
By all the players

972
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
And we believe that

973
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
Ashley favors

974
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,744
Companies like explain why she focused on product design

975
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
A unique experience

976
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Technology

977
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
Security

978
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
So the more

979
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
Customers are consumers focused on

980
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,448
The product itself

981
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
I think we actually

982
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Getting out

983
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Better

984
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Advantageous

985
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
So an alarm

986
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,896
It's good for the industry

987
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Should be one of the

988
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
The way that way

989
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Define

990
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
G3 SUV

991
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
How many orders have been received and how

992
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Delivery

993
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,304
So we started delivering she's three

994
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
In December.

995
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,656
I'm in the delivery obviously is a slow ramp-up

996
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Process

997
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
If you look at me or another

998
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
Companies all went through the same thing

999
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
Pixie takes time to

1000
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
The fact sheets to

1001
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Perfect

1002
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,688
Supply chain saw

1003
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,712
Spaghetti sauce

1004
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
Specially at low volume

1005
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,368
And I think we are going to start a volume delivery by

1006
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
Later this month

1007
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
Which is March 2019

1008
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,488
We asked him to do

1009
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Delivery

1010
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
Thousands multiple thousands

1011
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Arrange the next

1012
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
A few months

1013
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
I have daughters we actually have been

1014
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
You sitting very exciting moments

1015
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Downloaders

1016
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
We have more than

1017
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
10000p Motors

1018
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,616
Our in order

1019
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,152
He's already stretched

1020
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
Volume two

1021
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
The second half of

1022
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,600
And as you mentioned the Expo car is priced very

1023
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,648
Competitively

1024
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
23 - $30,000

1025
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,024
Could you talk about why you're targeting this

1026
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Younger

1027
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Consumer group

1028
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
Will first look at the Democrats

1029
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
The Young

1030
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Define yam

1031
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
Between 25 to 35

1032
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
I think is actually the fastest

1033
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
Growing

1034
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Driving route

1035
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
And also we believe that age

1036
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
These fibers

1037
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
Immortan to

1038
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
Try new technology new features

1039
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,112
Naza maybe the first car

1040
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
Some of those

1041
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
I may have

1042
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
The all the first time

1043
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,048
So lot of times I think these people

1044
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
Can truly enjoy and being bought

1045
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Without a clue

1046
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
I think that's

1047
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
Why isn't targeting those

1048
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
Core user

1049
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Is OCD

1050
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
First

1051
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Strategy

1052
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
But again I think I'll once we actually

1053
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,616
Can really

1054
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,992
Put that precise positioning of a vehicle into the minds of these individuals

1055
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
What customers that we can expand

1056
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,856
The one interesting data point for you is that

1057
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,880
If you look at the

1058
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
The orders

1059
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
That we have on hand

1060
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
Given we have three trim levels

1061
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
The basic form level

1062
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
Which is without our autonomous driving features

1063
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Are we have to

1064
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
Intelligent ring

1065
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
Pudding.

1066
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
And then the cops

1067
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,288
Pop and

1068
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,104
A 97% of all this Ashley indeed

1069
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Intelligent and

1070
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
The top and

1071
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Which means that it's

1072
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,248
You know our positioning and I will in a

1073
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
People come to buy

1074
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Shop home cars

1075
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Is actually

1076
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
Coming to us because

1077
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
Halogen

1078
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Technology

1079
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
So recently Tesla is also

1080
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Cut the price of its vehicles

1081
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
In China significance

1082
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Do you think that will happen

1083
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,752
First Tesla

1084
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:03,104
Will bring model 3 and model y but I think it will take a little longer

1085
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
Language is a similar size of our

1086
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
A few years ago

1087
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
And also I think

1088
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
At the current stage

1089
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
I think the

1090
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,648
Are they going to bring to Market still going to be viewed as a

1091
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
Premium segment vehicles

1092
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,488
Even with local production

1093
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
Play chicken nuggets

1094
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Baby Goku

1095
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Yet

1096
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
I think they will be

1097
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
Additional

1098
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
So I think it's a vehicle well

1099
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,984
Come down in turn price but still I think we're

1100
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Above

1101
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Pause placement

1102
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,128
So I think of that competition yourself we will not feel to correctly

1103
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Because we got a second

1104
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,248
But I think it's actually a good thing that you have a

1105
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
Cook Pata, Chinese market that stimulates Chinese

1106
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
Consumer demand

1107
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
And anxious love

1108
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,464
And sometimes we need high-quality supply chain

1109
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
To the Chinese

1110
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,304
Good for the development

1111
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
We actually

1112
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,936
Sing this is actually a positive

1113
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,544
And I think it also given years another saying to the 3 or 4 years

1114
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,848
We actually are confident that our technology

1115
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
You know the user base

1116
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,712
The vehicle on Street

1117
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
We can accomplish

1118
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
Better Futures more localized

1119
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Experiences

1120
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
Anna, striving

1121
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,648
Then Tesla so I think we're very confident that

1122
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
You Belong With Me

1123
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Cheap welders

1124
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
My last questions around

1125
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
A different topic around town

1126
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Expo Motors

1127
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
Carly has about 3000

1128
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Employees

1129
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Yeah this number

1130
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
As you know in 2018 the company

1131
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
Alone when you're added

1132
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
Mm

1133
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Employees

1134
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
74 Summit Rd

1135
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,664
Shubble has said recently in Hold Us.

1136
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
Plants to add

1137
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Dada 5000

1138
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
New employees

1139
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
I've been able to try to vibrate

1140
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,368
Dover High Caliber

1141
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Yourself

1142
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
So can you talk about a child poems

1143
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
Calastrology

1144
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
And water differ

1145
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
Compelling profiles

1146
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
That you guys are looking forward to add

1147
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
Tubidy

1148
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
As you know how many Apple listeners

1149
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
Listen to our interview of a Chinese company

1150
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
So hopefully

1151
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128

Over 200 different companies

1158
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
So

1159
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,256
It is great diversity we also have employees coming from over

00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,816

1162
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888

Part-time employees

1168
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,760
But still I think it will be a depressive

1169
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
Animation

1170
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,368

The relevant podcast

1177
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704

00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
I would love to

1179
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288

1183
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
In the powertrain

1184
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,480
In

1185
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,784
Number of these specific product

1186
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,856
The same time we also like to track

1187
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
Individuals come from

1188
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
More

1189
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,464
Traditional now

1190
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,024
Because I think what we are trying to do something

1191
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Spotify

1192
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
So we want

1193
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
How to bring

1194
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Individuals that has

1195
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
Was New Era tomatoes

1196
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
Network development disabilities

1197
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
We want to also

1198
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
Executive Inn

1199
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
The functional areas

1200
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Legal in finance

1201
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
And the strategy

1202
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
I think we should looking for talent across the board

1203
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Andis company

1204
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
Has a berry I was strong

1205
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
Play Focus culture

1206
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,744
Are we we have actually advice pump emphasis

1207
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Human cat

1208
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
One of the key

1209
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,840
I would say Ariel

1210
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Shuffle

1211
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Overseas directly

1212
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Is thf

1213
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,728
Because he feels like

1214
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,776
Having the right infrastructure

1215
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Right

1216
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,848
Organization structure invite

1217
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,944
Is important for a company to grow into much larger scale

1218
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
So I think that that is something

1219
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,296
Are we probably are different from

1220
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,600
Other fast-growing Chinese companies

1221
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,160
Because our emphasis on human capital

1222
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
And over this

1223
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
Construction

1224
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:38,304
I also wanted to ask you a career related question I do have a lot of friends

1225
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
Investment Bank

1226
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144
To join a tech company

1227
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,496
But it doesn't come naturally to allow them do you have any advice for

1228
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,056
Aspiring our car and finance professionals

1229
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Or trying to

1230
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
Transition

1231
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
2 questions

1232
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:57,503
Well they actually quite a few you mustn't Bankers in our company

1233
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,831
Myself included obviously now Stratus

1234
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,391
We have senior bankers and also

1235
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Junior Banker

1236
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
Well

1237
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Will have Finance professional

1238
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Who has been

1239
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Successful

1240
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
Investment

1241
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,095
Professionals for over 20 years

1242
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
Largest Wall Street firm

1243
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
So I think we have a very

1244
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
I was saying unique

1245
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Balance

1246
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
Companies from

1247
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
I think it's

1248
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,223
That the transition Family Medicine time to fast-growing entrepreneurial company

1249
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
It's always going to be

1250
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
Challenging

1251
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,319
Because I said different

1252
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,343
Maltase

1253
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
Culture

1254
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,927
It's also a focus on different

1255
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Priorities

1256
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
But I think if you are willing to learn

1257
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
If you actually are

1258
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
Flexible about

1259
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
The work schedule intensity

1260
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
I think

1261
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Sorry babe

1262
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
For y'all

1263
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Bankers

1264
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
I always say

1265
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
Till the interestings

1266
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,199
If I accidentally in the earlier part of my career have experience

1267
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,783
Inside a company and see the operation I think I was saved

1268
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
I make me a much better

1269
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,623
Well-rounded

1270
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
Banker so I think

1271
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,719
You know that experience is very valuable

1272
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,815
I can give you another story actually and I have breakfast with Josiah

1273
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Example

1274
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
When I joined the

1275
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
Expungement

1276
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,983
Ask him I said well you know you took a lot of risk you joined

1277
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,287
Alibaba when it first founded

1278
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,823
White Oak Terrace

1279
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
And she looked at me

1280
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
You said

1281
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,527
I don't think this out of risk enough for me years in Alibaba

1282
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:40,415
Compared to a state ID

1283
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,255
So what's a roscato

1284
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,863
So at what I'm saying is that for young and old professionals who starting their Bank

1285
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,471
Don't be afraid and I'll try the inside of The Inferno company

1286
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:58,335
Experience will be very valuable and used to have time to decide what you want to do later

1287
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
The only risk

1288
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
It's not taking any

1289
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
Brian Madigan

1290
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
Which is on

1291
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
I don't think I will be at

1292
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
Let's go to BC if I didn't have

1293
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
Start experience

1294
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
Self

1295
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
I see a hottie encourage everyone

1296
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Follows

1297
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
If you're in banking or Consulting

1298
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,607
Spent three years in a

1299
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Text Art of barter companies

1300
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
You just get more experience

1301
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
Not be afraid to try.

1302
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
You would be much better

1303
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Volume eight

1304
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,151
So now it's jumping to Roundup quick fire questions

1305
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
So you can just say the first thing that comes to your mind

1306
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,015
The first one is who is an entrepreneur you admire the most

1307
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Post NY

1308
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,087
Jeff Bezos and Jack Ma

1309
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
Because I think that they not only feel

1310
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Bee Company

1311
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
The weather

1312
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
The up-and-down of a company then

1313
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,791
Always come up with new

1314
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,863
Better ideas in better directions for the

1315
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
I feel like that

1316
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,495
Truant preneurship and it's consistent not just one hit wonders

1317
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,823
What's a book you read recently that you recommend

1318
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,639
I should have read something I recommend to our

1319
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,199
Management team is Founders mentality which is a

1320
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,551
Book written by pcti thing I think of one of the Consulting companies

1321
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,391
It took some analysis on the companies they looked at and

1322
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Concluded a number of traits

1323
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Dial

1324
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,279
Company better which included lot of the

1325
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
Company

1326
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,583
Jose characteristics

1327
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,887
He's back to the founders the way up to

1328
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
What is a habit you have

1329
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
That you think has changed your life

1330
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,823
I think a lot the best thing I learned is not

1331
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
React too quickly

1332
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
I think that that's something I learned as a scientist

1333
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,735
And then as a banker

1334
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
I think

1335
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
LA Times

1336
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,367
First reaction may not be the right one always take a pause

1337
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
And you will

1338
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Benefit founded

1339

Ucweb is the mobile browser company founded by Hotel Punk

1355
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:34,495
That was acquired by Alibaba for over a 3.8 billion dollars in 2014

1356
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
In the largest m&a

1357
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Video ever

1358
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
In tennis history back then

1359
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
So Justin could you talk about

1360
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
How you first met shopping and

1361
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Persuaded him

1362
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
To * his next

1363
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Adventure Expo Motors

1364
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,879
Well actually the history we shall pass on 4th of August

1365
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
Dates back to

1366
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,975
When I first met that out late June

1367
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,535
So Legion was

1368
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,327
Enjoyed investor in ucweb

1369
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,911
And he started to tell me the story about this

1370
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,959
That was back in 06

1371
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,287
The story about a mobile

1372
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Browser

1373
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,407
And I was thinking you know feature phone mobile browser

1374
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
What is that

1375
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:21,087
And I need that made the introduction to one of the CEO of co-founder of the company

1376
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,647
You don't fool with so young for at that time

1377
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,927
I was brought in

1378
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,487
And you know cold out the team and

1379
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
We shall Paul and he became the CEO of the company

1380
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
And

1381
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,631
Ixd first

1382
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,191
Not going full and then later Machop

1383
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,751
Shopping with space in Guangzhou

1384
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,543
He was really the guy

1385
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,103
Delta product for ucweb

1386
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,919
So this is kind of interesting cuz

1387
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:51,807
Jenny and I actually got to know Legion and you know that were few deals at that time that leaves you in

1388
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
Soto

1389
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Angel as

1390
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,463
The most promising do and he cut off when you don't have power

1391
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,839
Setup remote app the deals to Oz and get us to look at it or one of them is why why

1392
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,655
Which is spend a lot of time and the other ones you see

1393
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:11,775
So we done subsequently I think that quite a bit of work and

1394
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,591
And in 08 we made the investment

1395
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Weight 09

1396
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,407
Are we made a investment UC

1397
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,759
To be fair we are a relatively small while we set up

1398
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,807
A cold at the wrong with

1399
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
It's called the

1400
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,111
No clouds Grove venture

1401
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
At that time

1402
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,207
So it WhatsApp all and and his team

1403
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
And we did

1404
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,511
What's a week old at the round

1405
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,095
At about $150 valuation at that time

1406
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
And

1407
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
So it was an interesting start and

1408
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,031
The thing that with you CEO always been that with a feature phone market

1409
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
How is that

1410
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,359
Value is going to evolve by agust D

1411
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,431
They made a huge impact in terms of

1412
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,271
Going. Not just with China as a browser but he also had

1413
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,807
Still outside of China

1414
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
Anyway the long story short is

1415
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
That was a time

1416
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,231
06 was a time because of you see that's why I met chapeau

1417
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,303
As the founder and the key pada person

1418
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Bioc

1419
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,399
Along the way obviously we stay in touch by

1420
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,727
I spend a lot more time with your own food that I spend with him

1421
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,383
Having said that I think after the company got acquired by Alibaba I was talking about Jenny and I was

1422
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
A little involved in

1423
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:27,039
In trying to navigate the the acquisition as well Mojo because

1424
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,111
They'll few parties. Just Alibaba involved it was so so by you

1425
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,207
Dan Post acquisition Chapel State on a tally

1426
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
And

1427
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,023
That and that was this time that

1428
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
He called upon Jenny

1429
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,911
And say that he know I built this car and incubate at this car

1430
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,959
You know I want you guys to come and take a look

1431
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:50,591
So I did so Jenny off me and ran along with rent Guangzhou every saw this whole Market

1432
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,151
Stripped out car EV

1433
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,247
So he put together a incubator team

1434
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,783
All that by Henry

1435
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,855
Today's the president of the company Henry hsia

1436
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
So I was

1437
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,719
It was interesting but I didn't I didn't have a lot of

1438
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,279
Like driving to hit you up when are you doing this

1439
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,095
What time is it no no I'm still at Alibaba

1440
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,399
Oh and that didn't

1441
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,727
Really gave me a lot of you no conviction or confidence

1442
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,799
And how he would want to build this is kind of like

1443
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,591
Alpha Project at art

1444
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Check for him

1445
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
That was

1446
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,199
Yunnan 2013-2014 by 2016

1447
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
I start to see

1448
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
The momentum

1449
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,087
Behind the whole momentum behind TVs and

1450
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,439
I see that's been a lot more talk about autonomous Drive

1451
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
And I think that

1452
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
Smart car

1453
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Is a

1454
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
Is a big future

1455
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
That's a big potential because

1456
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
All the

1457
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:51,519
Potential infrastructure Investments that is made by the Chinese government subsidy that's launched by the Chinese government as a juror

1458
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:57,407
I start to think. And I spent a bit of time looking into category matter with Neo and

1459
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,711
Way my nephew other players

1460
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,319
And I felt like a Child poem If he wants to do this and he go on full-time

1461
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:09,951
You'll be interesting so I spent quite a bit of time talking to him I revisit that his team

1462
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
If I died right

1463
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
This time now I drag Jenny along to

1464
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
To spend a day

1465
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,631
Guangzhou meeting of esteem and and so on

1466
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,447
I spent probably I will save a few months

1467
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,239
Talking to Shopko and say

1468
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,799
Are you ready to go full-time are you ready to go food

1469
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,847
Because if you are I'm going to

1470
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
Back injury

1471
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
And it was this day

1472
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,943
That I called him

1473
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,575
It was just right after Chinese New Year I'll just around Chinese New Year in February

1474
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,367
Fall 2017

1475
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,671
I said you'd really need to do this

1476
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
And so that's

1477
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
The point in time where

1478
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,583
Somehow he's dropped in I'm not sure why because he wants

1479
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,423
Yo newborn a second kiss a boy

1480
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,263
I got time and you was holding the baby I didn't realize that when I make that call to him

1481
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,639
And then I was just grabbing all telling him I was a congratulating him because I do realize that Justice

1482
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,175
The bike and

1483
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
I said you know what you should do that

1484
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:08,831
And that's really turning on and die after he made a decision

1485
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,951
Officially jumped in in August 2017

1486
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
And when

1487
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Futon shop

1488
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,071
What about chapeau made you have such

1489
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
Conviction

1490
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,887
That if you don't say you're going to bed

1491
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,191
You know I think this is the

1492
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,751
Tie-dye always give this analogy

1493
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,823
Between a feature phone vs smartphone I think

1494
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Disa

1495
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,663
Fundamental change where you go forum

1496
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,223
Just a functional pot out to It's My Party

1497
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,759
That that's a lot more

1498
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,599
Ideas that has to go into the hole

1499
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:46,463
User environment and the car is not adjust a utility

1500
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
Anymore

1501
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:52,351
So I thought that somebody like she'll pole with an internet product background

1502
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Could be very very powerful

1503
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
And I know many of such

1504
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
So call entrepreneur if you will

1505
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Web.

1506
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
To do this

1507
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
You need a c rock

1508
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,127
If you look at me off example

1509
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,943
Didn't the founder is a c round trip

1510
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,247
So without that she wrote

1511
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,295
Entrepreneurship without a bit of Halo

1512
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
Behind you

1513
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,367
It's hard to draw the kind of capital

1514
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
How to build a cockapoo

1515
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,183
You need to elong Musk

1516
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Aesir entrepreneur

1517
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487

1518
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,303
She think you need a bit of a serial entrepreneurship to do this

1519
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
And I'm not many players are all

1520
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863
Number two

1521
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143

1522
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,215
I mean he has an interest that's why he incubated this

1523
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239

He loved cars

1525
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,823

Inter intra so he's not just off the street at Pooh any guy and Sue entrepreneurial and say Hey you go do this

This is a business giving the Powell capital-intensive it is

1530
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,743
You need to be able to put your money where your mouth

1531
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,839
So investors not only will follow you they will also follow your money

That's that's

1540
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:16,319
So I need a few reasons I think that's the market Factor that's the

1541
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,343
Thank God

00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,103
For a second third 4 players

1566
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
Do a smart car

1567
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
That experience

1568
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
It's just remind you of

1569
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
Different ships that you saw earlier

1570
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,943
Both of the investor

1571

Bicycles

1572
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,271
And if everything around us going to the cloud

1573
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
Washing the car where we spend some time on it

1574

Leaving leaving work

1575
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
Be smarter as well

1576
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,743
An alarm has already showed that as possible

1577
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,023
In other countries

1578
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Do that

1579
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
Country is Beijing China

1580
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
In a second

1581
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,447
Tikka masala is a Seer entrepreneur

1582
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
About time to the first time

1583
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
Maybe a creator

1584
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
EBay Prada

1585
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,359
But he may not be ready when she may not be ready to be a CEO

1586
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,919
The company is building a product and

1587
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,015
And being a CEO with boobies personal background are two different things

1588
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Got exit

1589
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,599
It was never the CEO

1590
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,879
And you have a

1591
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,695
The new baby in your hand everything like what is my legacy

1592
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
Already have the money

1593
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,535
But what am I going to be numbness to my kids

1594
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:06,911
Is someone who cannot follow and get something or someone and I

1595
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,471
Myself and it took all the way to the end

1596
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,007
Leave a legacy

1597
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,335
It's a lot of time to see entrepreneur is driven not my money anymore

1598
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Bye-bye

1599
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,175
That's extremely powerful motivating factor

1600
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
What's

1601
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,015
I think that's absolutely right I think for

1602
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
What's y'all Paul's it all he's

1603
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:29,183
Is definitely not about money cuz he's near a well-to-do on its own after you see

1604
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
So he's driven by

1605
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
I'm more important mission

1606
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,583
Underline Mission and passion for something

1607
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
For himself

1608
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
So I think.

1609
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,959
Dries for legacy I think that's a good

1610
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,519
Way to describe it is really what Propel him

1611
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
And

1612
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,359
You know I had to bought meeting with him recently

1613
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,895
And it all ends

1614
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,199
Proud of all we have this lunch and you say

1615
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
You know what I

1616
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
I woke

1617
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,039
I work as hard as I was

1618
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,855
They thought harder I was when I wasn't using

1619
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,671
So I mean this guy is already

1620
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Y'all made it

1621
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
But yet he's working so hard

1622
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,071
And he might be working more than I-96

1623
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
I'm not I won't be surprised

1624
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,191
So Brian join the

1625
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
Around a year ago

1626
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,543
How did you first meet Brian and what do you think

1627
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,567

1628
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
That he has sprouts

1629
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:24,479
So I met Brian I got the known Brian while he was you know

1630
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503

Investment banking

1632
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
And his loss

1633
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
Position was terminated

1634
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671

Hat puns with Hume on and off

1639
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,143
But why really bring a different set of skill sets

1640
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
To the organisation

1641
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Given his background

1642
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
His knowledge

1643
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,823
Kiss perspective is macro and his ability to communicate

1644
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,359

To join him

1653
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
And

1654
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,607
And Brian joining him is a testimony for

1655
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,191
And it's not just Brian he has many other people

1656
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215

To various investors in the community this is a capital-intensive

1667

00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,871
To be willing to cut off

1701
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,431
Step down and said this is what I'll do

1702
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,479
Coming to a company and

1703
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,783
Having the desire and Trust

1704
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,855
To follow shopping in and do this

1705
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,183
I totally thick means a lot and suddenly takes a lot

1706
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,767
Not just for himself emotionally bio so you know

1707
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,815
Family and everything

1708
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,351
I mean he lives

1709
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
Write this in Hong Kong

1710
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
Why he walks in Guangzhou

1711
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,983
So literally he's fly

1712
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,079
I stayed in the hotel where he stayed with his just next to the company like

1713
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
It is a budget hotel

1714
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,199
So it's a sign of commitment and conviction

1715
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,479
To the exponent vision

1716
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,343
So do you think China's TV or Smart Card Market

1717
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:46,719
Or do you think that you VR smartphone market is inherently localized is it possible for

1718
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Nan Chinese

1719
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
Players to be six

1720
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Or do you think

1721
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,839
The local players will

1722
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
In the long run

1723
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,911
Well I think

1724
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,495
Did this is auto market is not a winner-take-all market

1725
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,823
Always say that you know you have Mercedes and Europeans

1726
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,639
You have Toyota or Honda

1727
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:10,527
Yeah you are local player so it's a big enough market 26-minute new cars being sold every year

1728
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:16,671
Granted I think the whole Grove Mentor behind new car sales has come down a 17 to 2018

1729
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,463
But that's still a lot of

1730
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,743
That is a big Market

1731
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,839
It's probably the single biggest Market in the world in terms of numbers of car sales

1732
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,887
So that's a Pacini D2

1733
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,679
To grow their Market share

1734
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,519
Today the penetration of Eevee's today's by 3%

1735
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
And so that's do

1736
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
Room for

1737
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Smart

1738
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,943
Smart cars to actually extend itself

1739
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,247
I'm less worried about competition

1740
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:45,343
Per say I mean that is definitely the competitive element

1741
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,695
But foreign or local the the chances actually fairly equal

1742
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,279
And I think China is increasingly trying to open up

1743
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,863
It's not limiting foreign players for say so

1744
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,655
The market is open to all

1745
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,959
And I do think that

1746
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,519
Having said that I think that it's important

1747
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,311
4 oz

1748
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,871
Appreciate the local environment in the local market

1749
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,175
I just give you one example

1750
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,991
Which is end this I use quite a bit this

1751
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,527
Ability to Auto Park

1752
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
Expo right

1753
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:20,159
The most people when you talk about Auto parking as a feature

1754
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
The reality is that

1755
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,487
Many of the car

1756
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,583
Only recognize 10 to 20% of the parking scenarios here in China

1757
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
So

1758
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:32,191
Out of 10 times that you try to auto part when he wants a two times

1759
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
You you got

1760
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
You got the

1761
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
Auto parking

1762
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
That that feature is quite useless

1763
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
So I think Tesla

1764
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:45,503
For wine in a coming to the market and others while trying to come to Market if they want to support that feature

1765
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
Do you have to localize

1766
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
2000 aerio.

1767
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
Cure in China

1768
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,135
I was shopping for

1769
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
For 1

1770
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,487
Disable that dress 72 80% off the parking scenario

1771
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,815
The Cure till out of 10 times 728 times you could

1772
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
Easley Auto Parts

1773
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
Your car that becomes

1774
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:06,239
The true valuable feature versus just a feature that you put on the brochure

1775
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
So that's it

1776
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
Localizing to the marketplace

1777
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:15,967
All that you see because China is a very very different driving environments just alright house you guys are where the sister you are

1778
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
Echo

1779
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,831
Pigeon Point Beaufort

1780
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
We get a call the question

1781
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,391
Snus.

1782
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,975
It alternates difference in which regulation government rest blah blah blah

1783
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,767
And the number one reason

1784
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
Used company don't do well

1785
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,839
It does reality is at

1786
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,631
Is it fishing this category

1787
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,679
A test that will be welcomed in China

1788
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,703
So that's not an issue

1789
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,727
At least not

1790
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,543
Any more bigger issue than any any Chinese company

1791
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
But what is different is that

1792
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,431
Chinese company to know

1793
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,247
And double of Peterbilt he's so strong so good

1794
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,551
Extremely fast

1795
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
To subside Annies

1796
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,855
I'm local consumers

1797
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,903
12 questions from Richwood

1798
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,927
What use your product

1799
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,231
And if the profits. Look like for China

1800
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,767
Millions of

1801
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
Tens of hundred many users

1802
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,143
Even though you have amazing Grandpa

1803
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
From from outside

1804
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,983
Rigging companies fail to realize why they

1805
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,287
You change an Ann Taylor solution

1806
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
The specific for the Chinese market

1807
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,639
And and that's why most reason why

1808
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,663
Us companies don't do it

1809
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,015
Sew-in for Chinese players there are a lot of

1810
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
Space as well

1811
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
What

1812
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,599
Made you

1813
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,159
Have such strong conviction that X phone

1814
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
It's the one

1815
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,327
First of all I think that each of these companies have

1816
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
Demerits

1817
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
The purisolve

1818
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,447
The shop only have got married so it's hard for me to

1819
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,983
Common but

1820
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,287
Baidu fundamentally believe that

1821
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
This is

1822
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
A product

1823
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,615
Soca kahrizak

1824
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
Product

1825
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,151
It is not

1826
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
A service business

1827
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
So

1828
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,807
Intensity and skills and knowledge needed to build

1829
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
Great product is imported

1830
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
And I think shop home is a

1831
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
Type of person

1832
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
He's a product

1833
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,975
He's not here to

1834
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,023
You know market and

1835
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Peach sales and

1836
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,095
It all he he is

1837
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,631
Pretty focused on

1838
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,167
Giving the right product

1839
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
Experience to the annual

1840
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
That's why

1841
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
So

1842
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,311
Adding underline yet is

1843
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
What does it take to

1844
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,639
How to build a great car company and I think

1845
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,175
Cell phone has what it takes

1846
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,967
And that's why I chose to

1847
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Factor

1848
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,551
