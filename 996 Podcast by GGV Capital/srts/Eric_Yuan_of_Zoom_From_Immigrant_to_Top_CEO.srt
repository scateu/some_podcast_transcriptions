00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
China however I bet Casino

190
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Certified looking baggage

191
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
To practice my perseverance I think okay if I

192
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
I know Lisa I will try again

193
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
Add and that's attached

194
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
I think

195
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
I'm a successful but it took me

196
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
More than Wine Javier's

197
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
Is already 1997

198
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
Angela Kim here and I realized

199
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Wow

200
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Is a frontal wig

201
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Offer internet

202
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Revolution

203
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
I don't think I want to

204
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Mrs.

205
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
So that's why I said it.

206
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
BuyBacks

207
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
To start writing

208
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
I cannot do any

209
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Duckweb Sur small

210
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
And I even

211
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,247
Daughter speak language what should I do

212
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
I think a lot of people back then in China heard about the internal Revolution but not everyone like house to pack up and leave

213
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
Enjoy. So take a lot of grit to do that

214
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Actually

215
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Even if I

216
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Came here to be honest

217
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
The ice at the time I thought about

218
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,263
Sister call me here take me to yours and then go back

219
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Zaxby

220
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
My thoughts

221
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,943
And whoever you know when you start getting off something from worst more and

222
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
A lot of emotional connection

223
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
The pornographer BuyBacks

224
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Is grated cheating

225
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
And the alarm always sort of

226
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
To go back home

227
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Faded away

228
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
Anime near many Engineers from China I came here

229
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,095
And I've done pretty well inside the body

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
The minimum

231
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
Don't have the management experience

232
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
Or develop their leadership

233
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Style

234
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
How did you do that

235
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,895
Engineering engineering had at the WebEx

236
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
I think we're seeing I think

237
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,503
I like a sitting a male

238
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271

239
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Pretty open culture

240
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Here so and the lotto

241
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Over 6000 people

242
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
They would like to do

243
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
How are you

244
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
So you might really have assumed any mentors

245
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Even

246
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
You know many many years ago

247
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Rue21

248
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Now that's why I also

249
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Promoter step learning here

250
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191

Cuz I wanted to learn in also that's why I have so many mentors

252
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Each of them I think they give me a lot of

253
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
What do I say

254
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,479
Hey what's your career aspiration what you should do next

255
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,551
I think a lot of them those were successful

256
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
All the entrepreneurs are leaders

257
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
You know that's why

258
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
Ice not only in old wife

259
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,511

DeWalt

264
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751

00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Cell phone

273
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135

I want

275
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
How to do something

276
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
Yeah that's pretty much the shuffle TV

277
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
We sometimes hear of the term bamboo ceiling here in Silicon Valley where it's hard for engineers from mainland China

278
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
How to move up the ranks and the tech companies

279
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,639
Especially because of culture and language barriers so how did you overcome those

280
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
I do not send the language

281
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Barbara is a factor

282
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
I was born send mmmforeign

283
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
China Wok

284
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
Exodus unirise swimming spots

285
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Let me know Justin

286
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
You know a little bit

287
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
You know the culture you going to learn

288
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Baidu by example

289
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
You know quite often for

290
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
You know many Chinese engineers

291
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
And the

292
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,759
You know giving their back on education you know quite often you have a new project

293
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Need to know

294
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,231
I do not have this idea I just started

295
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,095
Why should I let my manager let other people know that

296
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
But he is very different and always Garden next we have open transparent

297
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,775
Communication

298
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:07,967
But wide open as long as all this is language various meaning I will see that

299
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
That is cute

300
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,319
And I was thinking about it why

301
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
In a few dollars would it cost

302
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,511
You achieve a lot of things and then you know

303
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,839
The others you know I will see you little bit promote

304
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Some people say that asked

305
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,519
Why we sample the engineers have risen faster

306
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,151
In many of the tuxedos intra-matic today are of Indian descent

307
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
They also speak with heavy accent

308
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
How come there are not as many Chinese engineers

309
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,319
Risen to a level

310
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
The way you have

311
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,439
I think a community Beach NC like Chinese veteran engineers and engineers

312
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Immediately

313
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,279
And also they are very smart

314
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Biggest difference is dosa

315
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
You know a genius from India they have

316
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Yes

317
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,031
Before I do anything I have a grade

318
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
No. It's like a PowerPoint service you in a why I wanted

319
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Please have Arabic

320
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,903
So the idea for Zoom first came to you when you are a freshman in college in China right

321
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
Could you tell us that story

322
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Yes or yeah I

323
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
That's a long story but anyways so

324
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,911
And I was fresh mine might my girlfriend

326
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031

327
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
You know she lives here

328
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
Another city I was born in

329
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247

Beachin.

333
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
Sioux City versus city of sand in the city where I live is very far away

334
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
And every time

335
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,791
I want you to visit her

336
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
It would take

337
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
More than 10 hours

338
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
New Dragon Chinese

339

I forgot it

341
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
What's a problem that lost time

342
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,943
I took the train and there and then probably.

343
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735

344
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135

349
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351

353
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
And everyday I thought about that

354
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
But unless that resume

355
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199

00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
How to connect

357
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
Your technology is already but the idea or is there

358
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647

00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:03,583
Cisco WebEx and you were there for 14 years what made you realize

361
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,423
That it was the right time to leave and start your own company

362
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215

Is a starter

370
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
You better join a startup company

371
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Do something

372
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063

00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
Why bags

379
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Emotional

380
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
How to go to that.

381
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
The bladder penis

382
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
What's the Galaxy

383
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Is Rita Hart

384
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
Quite often sister Mickey lights

385
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
Stay for another year or not to year

386
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
I'm the woman that you like

387
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
210

388
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
I thought about leaving how it works

389
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
And it's doing all the food ready

390
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
But once you realize

391
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
Bags and everyday every morning when I woke up

392
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
I was not happy

393
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Because I visited a website

394
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Customer every time

395
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
I put some of the

396
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
I felt very embarrassed

397
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Cuz I did not see a single

398
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Happy rabbit

399
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Why is that

400
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
Because you know one way beauty by bag

401
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
You know we wouldn't be folks the online usage

402
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Values

403
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Was that at

404
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Happy you

405
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
Share the PowerPoint to share the best

406
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Counting to be you and I in Oregon

407
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,599
440 or 40 years later lyrics some brand-new Pro

408
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
Like every business the god of

409
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
How to use multiple Solutions

410
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
They want to enable classroom

411
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,327
Devon How We Do conferencing and there have what unify the solution

412
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,215
The water table to have a club is to come from a solution he wanted to make sure no matter where that didn't you call me for

413
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
You also can't guarantee the good

414
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,871
You know a voice over IP polity

415
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,711
Yeah exactly

416
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
You gotta to realize

417
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
Cisco WhatsApp video to change

418
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
Shredded

419
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
I had no choice but to leave

420
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Fix all those

421
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
Rebus problems

422
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
No that's why I finally see

423
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
Finally I decided I'm going to leave

424
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
I cannot stop

425
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
So that's enough

426
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,007
And when the 40 Engineers follow you how did Cisco react

427
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,663
First of all I managed more than 800 people

428
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,735
Small very small Pakistan

429
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
What's the weather

430
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Meiosis

431
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
Siedah probably also saw

432
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
You know I have

433
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
No choice you know I'm so sorry I meaning

434
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
I have no way

435
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,375
In order to build a better solution

436
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Is

437
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Is the leader here I think it's a

438
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
You know is not meaning is nothing.

439
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
To do what you want to do

440
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
And I was yes

441
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
Nobody

442
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
Paid attention to what we were doing

443
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,183
So when you started Zoom the video conferencing Market was already pretty crowded so there were a lot of other Solutions

444
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Like Skype Google Hangout

445
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,279
X FaceTime is that Aurora

446
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
What made you think that you can still come out and Market I think you said before that the biggest differentiation

447
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:25,055
Jefferson from the other Solutions it is that is it just works which I agree

448
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
So why does it work

449
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
Former

450
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
Customer from any user

451
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Prospective cuz I

452
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
Chicago businessman costume

453
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Literally

454
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
I did not see a single

455
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Happy customer

456
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Who

457
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Would tell me hey

458
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
Really enjoyed you not answer

459
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Show me all the solution or their back

460
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
I would have stayed

461
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,167
And you know nobody

462
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
Cosmo

463
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
What beautiful

464
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
None of them

465
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,079
The word beautiful in British

466
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Cloud Beast

467
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Video clip

468
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
So that's why I saw the opportunity

469
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
You know our philosophy was that

470
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
African beauty shops

471
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
Leather costumes

472
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Enjoy

473
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Using

474
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
I would say that the chance

475
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,927
You know that's a reason

476
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,999
Because quite often you know if you sing the market is

477
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Stroopwafel

478
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
If you do not really understand

479
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Appendicostomy

480
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:24,191
You sing if that's a game is over and you do not jump on that I would see

481
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
As you are going to Miss Dig

482
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
I just want so easy to use that you don't have to download the software

483
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
And remember login

484
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
Quick LinkedIn justworks

485
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
If it.

486
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
I make it so much easier

487
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Add multiple level

488
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Start using a product

489
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
Yes usability is reading important

490
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
I think a quarter to make

491
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Easier

492
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
I know some

493
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
The qualities of rain

494
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
It is God

495
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,607
It works even when the service is not great

496
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,703
That's why we have

497
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
But focusing on optimizing

498
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,335
Our technology and reliable

499
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Networks in China

500
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
Is awesome

501
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Well versed

502
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
FaceTime audio

503
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
Works out quite well

504
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
But obviously we FaceTime video does not

505
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,768
How do you balance making sure that both audio and the video don't work well

506
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,144
So first of all a beauty in video and audio is orders to more important than lady

507
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,544
Like even if I can see you but if you're always hoping nobody is going to use that so easily

508
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,872
Innovate prioritize in audio traffic

509
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Over a video

510
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
IND

511
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,552
You know given very very unreliable verlo banners

512
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
Hanover Foods on audio I know so we

513
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
Street light

514
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
45

515
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
55%

516
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Which two country

517
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
So a lot of

518
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
I will see the

519
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Flatware Hardware

520
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,544
Warrior first feel customers and how did you go about onboarding them

521
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,128
Oh we were very lucky our first to pay the customer

522
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Was the Stanford

523
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
Continuing studies group

524
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,808
Oh okay yeah I was Solutions even not ready yet

525
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Anna Diop

526
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,952
Yeah I said, remember that's a November or December in Tucson at 12

527
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
They were looking for us

528
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Russian for the online

529
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
Learn on a teaching platform

530
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,120
University offer

Cast of all the solution

533
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
Phantasm

534
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
Inequalities is better

535
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Peter Costa

536
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
I really

537
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
What state is our confidence

538
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
And that's was our

539
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,600
Remember you also did a program in Stanford

540
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Yeah that's the law like

541
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
I would like to see

542
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Break

543
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Guadalajara's

Cannabis

549
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
The whole summer

550
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
You have to stop brake but it didn't learn.

551
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
2012 supporting your cuz I was

552
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
That was when

553
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,248
The Mooks the online Edge basketball notification programs are starting to

00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016

And therefore now you look at it

563
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
200 Nationwide

564
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,496
Universities that is

94%

566
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
That's a lot of benefit

567
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Focusing on

568
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712

573
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Consumer marketing

574
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
That is very different

575
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752

576
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520

I'm not looking for a new solution

589
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
That's why I think

590
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
From business model

591
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Perspective

592
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
The penis song

00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Centuries

594
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Will you ever have a consumer version

609
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,392

00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
Different

611
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Strategy

612
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,232
You don't sow meaning

613
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
