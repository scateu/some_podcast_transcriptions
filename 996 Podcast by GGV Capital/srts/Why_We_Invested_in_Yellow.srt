23
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,224
On today's episode we're going to talk about why we invested in yellow

24
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
So we at GTB recently announced the major investment and yellow a leading micro Mobility platform based in Brazil

25
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,000

There is yellow pee platform

33
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,504
So it might be sinking why are we talkin about

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088
A Brazilian startup on 96 a show about tech in China

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,976
Because our decision to invest and yellow is very much informed by our experience of investment in China

36
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,840
Soe hunts could you share more about this linkage and why you make this decision

Category

62
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
We are

63
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Chuck realize that

00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
Urban Mobility

65
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
He is a global phone

66
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
That given organization

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
In traffic

68
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Congestion

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Pollution

70
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
It just itches more solution needed

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Subwoofer

72
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
Problems in Excel problems.

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Not just in Beijing now

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
Prison sentence but also in

75
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,976
Mumbai in in Bangalore

76
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
In Jakarta

77
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
In

78
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
KL Singapore

79
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,936
Also in New York San Francisco Highway that's why I was in some Paulo and

80
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
We look at

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Apollo it's the 4th

82
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
Congested

83
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
Most congested city in the world

84
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
He has a

85
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Subway system

86
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Take care of

87
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
8 million

88
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Riders a day

89
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Convertible to Tokyo

90
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,344
Just under 9 a.m. for 4 Beijing

91
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
Yeah traffic

92
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Congestion still a major problem

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Suburbanization

94
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
So it is a problem that we

95
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Nodejs global

96
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Solution will be

97
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Global

98
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Secondly

99
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
When we look at this team this team

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Very impressive

101
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
The CEO

102
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
Musa

103
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Edward Olmos

104
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Has Manufacturing

105
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
He built up a largest bike manufacturing company

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
In

107
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Brazil

108
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
Is familiar with supply chain in China

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
And he sold his company successfully

110
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
To a Canadian player

111
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
A couple years

112
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
And then that that is to other co-founders

113
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
The head of product

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Head of

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Both came from 99

116
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
For those who have Tri quad

117
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
DD has done

118
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Worldwide

119
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Didi invest in 99

120
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Largest at local

121
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Rice & Company

122
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
Brazil

123
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
AutoZone Palo about two years ago and then acquired it

124
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
End of last year beginning of the this year

125
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
And so

126
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,295
Are people who decide to leave 99 due to their own thing

127
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
And thanks to Carlo from

128
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Monashees

129
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
One of the top

130
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
Maturity stage winter fun in Brazil

131
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Is co-founder Ariel

132
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Android auto

133
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
So it was

134
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Different timing

135
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
China looking at how

136
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Mobike

137
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Lenovo Mahalo bike

138
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
I start to

139
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Take over China with a bike sharing

140
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
And so

141
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,479
It it's it's not on the Visas are having global dances

142
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
You got the founders themselves are increasingly more gullible

143
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,159
Looking for ideas and inspiration the solution nachos from the us anymore

144
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
But also from increasingly from China as well

145
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
So having the duopoly of datapoint

146
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Please lot easier

147
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Avicii in the founders

148
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Dubus III

149
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Dupaco

150
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Next

151
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
So a lot of problems that people are facing today are

152
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
Global in nature

153
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Then you can find solution in

154
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Racing

155
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Thoroughly

156
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,639
We we like this

157
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Yellow because nausea

158
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
This is interesting for me

159
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Micro Mobility standpoint they have bikes

160
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Scooters and bikes

161
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
And other things

162
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
But in addition

163
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Because

164
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
Over 80% of a population

165
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
In Latin America

166
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Heartland Bank

167
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Meaning that they don't have a pension with a

168
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Deposit you don't have

169
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Saving or checking account

170
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
So a lot of people carry cash

171
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
Witham

172
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
And how do you get

173
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
People who only have cash

174
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
To participate

175
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
T-Mobile payment

176
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Participate

177
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
E-commerce

178
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
To pay for a service

179
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
Coming up with a QR code face

180
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Solution

181
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Alipay

182
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Which has some simple

183
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Was to a WeChat pay makes a ton of

184
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
If the

185
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
If I'm the 919

186
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
IDE not working

187
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
King Dedede

188
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
After that

189
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
The acquisition

190
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
I'm not seeing what was happening in China

191
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
It probably will have taken

192
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
A longer time

193
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
You coming with us

194
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
So the fact that

195
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
Did the

196
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,495
Almost two companies into one makes it and with experience team now they have a successful

197
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Subway

198
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Made a lot of easier

199
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
Would make a bat in the new reach

200
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Bus

201
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
Why is it so significant that

202
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,527
Founder and CEO Eduardo Musa has a background in manufacture

203
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
2 question

204
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
I think for lawsuit

205
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,671
Who's we are corrupt or worked in or invested in

206
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
China

207
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
China has a unique Advantage because either the manufacturing center or factual the world

208
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
So it's very easy to get there any hardware product

209
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Prototype curated

210
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
And manufacture a maskil

211
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Extremely quickly

212
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Pitea

213
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,823
To do that from us 44 you're from Europe

214
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Is Reykjavik

215
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
This is why you

216
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
You see in a dream space TGI

217
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
Is the PopularMMOs

218
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Competitive

219
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Most aggressive

220
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
At launching new products

221
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Quickly overcome

222
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
A lot of competitors worldwide

223
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
In this market

224
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
And so

225
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
For bike sharing scooter sharing

226
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
We also thought that given the tariffs

227
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
That exists barriers

228
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
Is this not America

229
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
Imports will always cost more

230
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
You'll take more time unless you are there

231
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
WeChat

232
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Which increase

233
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
Cost and if you can manufacture locally

234
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Then near the spare parts

235
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,175
Scuba cycle and is more environmentally friendly and also cost

236
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
Sufficient so for variety of reason

237
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Hobby and more

238
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Vertically integrated approach

239
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
In America

240
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Special on America

241
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
And Siri

242
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Makes a lot of sense

243
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
The challenge

244
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
Is a find a team

245
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
That has

246
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
Starting to disciplinary

247
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,327
Mean that they're people who understand offline World Manufacturing

248
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Production

249
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
As well as understand internet

250
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,423
Product iteration

251
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Entomology a pack in skillet

252
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
So this team

253
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
Having have the best possible worlds was very rare

254
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Exciting Force

255
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
What's really exciting for me as well as I'm

256
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
Zhangjiajie becoming more and more global

257
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
Everyday and

258
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,439
I should we just went on a trip to Southeast Asia a month ago where we went to a Singapore in Jakarta and met with

259
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
Local entrepreneurs and VCS

260
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,351
I'm and really saw the energy of the entrepreneurial landscape there

261
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,423
So how do you think Latin America as a region

262
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
Going forward cuz a lot of people still have

263
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
Reservations about like the boys abilities or macro factors

264
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Are you at all worried about these issues in

265
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
How do you think about

266
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
The future of the region

267
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
I live through the Asian financial crisis

268
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
In the

269
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Late night

270
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
I was working in Singapore

271
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
Sowa. It's about happening in the

272
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
In the region

273
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
Even some who lived

274
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
In the US for almost 20 years

275
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
America over the last

276
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
20-30 years

277
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
You see that functions rates have show

278
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Economic welfare also

279
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
The key lesson that we learned

280
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Omnibus in China

281
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,015
Is that when you have enough of a internet penetration

282
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Weather is

283
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
Through PC desktop

284
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Or

285
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
ABC order

286
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
Throughout

287
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Smartphone

288
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
You have a chance to have a foundation

289
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Technology

290
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Make changes

291
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
In society and bring about if you can

292
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
Ambassador in Alabama since 2003

293
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
Did Ubisoft pforzheim

294
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Call Jack ma brought about a hole

295
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
E-commerce era

296
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Into China out of nothingness

297
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Because of he

298
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
PetSmart Culebra

299
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
That's that's

300
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Bicicleta beneficios

301
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Internet penetration

302
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
And use.

303
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
How to build a table out

304
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
And then.

305
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
TiVo

306
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,695
When you see when we see in there enough of

307
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
A swamp in fishing

308
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Livermore internet

309
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Coupled with urbanization

310
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Trends

311
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
You started

312
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
See a middle-class forming

313
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
You spell see you then

314
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
They operate in a more efficient manner because

315
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Is the benefit of Technology

316
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
Tax benefit of The Proven business models

317
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
T-Mobile

318
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,407
So when that happens will feel the a new economy while you merch

319
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
And in it will grow at a faster

320
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Toothpaste that economy

321
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
So

322
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
The society

323
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Become more stable

324
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Overtime

325
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
More fungus will be able to make impact

326
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
With

327
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
I think the learn

328
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
From both us and China

329
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
So that's how

330
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Hypothesis

331
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
That was seeing somebody some of the happening

332
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Indonesia

333
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
Southeast Asia and North America ready

334
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
The telephone number of unicorns

335
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
Indonesia now you have tokopedia

336
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
Pokemon pack

337
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Traveloka

338
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
As well as Go Jack

339
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
And grab

340
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
So they are five or six

341
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
Y******

342
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
In Indonesia already

343
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
A country that has almost 300 million people

344
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,647
And it's cheaper Capital roughly around $3,000 us

345
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
In a similar to watch Hannah Wes

346
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
About that

347
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
10 years ago

348
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:18,143
And you look at. America also see a number of unicorn snot what is the 99 soul

349
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Or is it

350
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Mobile

351
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Hosparus

352
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
Or whether it's a rocky

353
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,639
And we have a puppy tray to mercadolibre

354
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
So you have you have number of public and private unicorns

355
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
For me in love my car ready

356
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
Because smoke penetration rate

357
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
In Brazil's now 50%

358
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
In Mexico is a 1/3

359
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
So

360
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
You start to see

361
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Early indicators

362
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
America even notice a

363
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Quite a bit disparity between

364
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,167
Overall GDP per capita is roughly around $10,000

365
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
You asking some of the major countries

366
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
So you still seeing that in both regions were

367
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Go to Southeast Asia or South America

368
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,407
Birthing side that fathers can learn

369
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
From us and China

370
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
And this where

371
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
In those selected areas were quitting or existing investors mobile

372
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Could be helpful

373
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,903
To them we're willing to consider

374
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
What mix is best when

375
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
And help them to

376
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
I found a really interesting that these days entrepreneurs in Emerging Markets are not just learning from Silicon Valley but

377
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
Also learning from China a lot

378
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
They they call themselves like the mate one of

379
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,847
Southeast Asia artist of Latin America or whatever so

380
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Silicon Valley is no longer

381
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
The only place where they can take inspiration

382
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Yeah you know back when

383
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Jesus found 18 years ago

384
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
The world had

385
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Roughly less than

386
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
A few hundred million internet users

387
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
And most of them were in the in the US

388
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
So

389
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
It's very easy

390
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
Before whatever works is it

391
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Also works at everywhere else

392
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,423
I'm over last 18 years you see China emerging now

393
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Almost

394
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Just admitting unicorns

395
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
As IUS.

396
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
In China as a developing country

397
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
As450

398
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Frontier City

399
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
And in this 450R cities

400
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Each one has different

401
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Macabre

402
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
So you look at that

403
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Argue

404
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
If you discount the language barrier

405
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,927
China has seen any kind of issue at least most of the issue

406
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Emerging Markets

407
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Country has to go through

408
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
In one of those

409
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
New York cities

410
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
So

411
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Whatever problems you are trying to solve your own

412
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Home Country developing

413
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Market

414
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Somebody in China has

415
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Uncomfort

416
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Something similar

417
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
And it has

418
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Figure out some way to deal with it

419
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
So are the minimum earning what channel

420
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Has done is

421
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Is a

422
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Higher starting point

423
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
To make it easier to figure out

424
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,063
What is what kind of localization and they will be a lot of position

425
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
That's still to be needed

426
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
In your home country

427
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
But at a minimum

428
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Having both us

429
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
A place to learn makes a lot of

430
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Easier to try

431
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Skip

432
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Thinks that that may not work

433
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
And be able to resume stopped after this

434
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
It could work

435
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
Massive lot of time in

436
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,287
And one of the areas we investing is called too high or a Chinese founders

437
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Is targeting

438
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Are there a merge

439
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Markets around the world

440
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
I wonder how do you think about

441
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
How do you think the Chinese entrepreneurs

442
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
Compare with Loco on

443
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Foreigners when it comes to

444
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
These new markets are they

445
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,647
Because of their experience of scaling companies in China are they

446
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,511
Advantageous when it comes to going to these markets or with a Locos

447
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
When the day is the end

448
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,119
That's the one. Dog question

449
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
I think that you would like like to ask

450
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Cuz we're both of us in China

451
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
Were there more Chinese company come to the US

452
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Working US starts ever crack

453
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,175
China I think that's a common question the media and other folks like to ask this

454
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
But what we actually are seeing

455
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Over last several years

456
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Is that

457
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
The US companies

458
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Startups

459
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,367
Do better in the a.m.

460
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
America

461
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Especially North America in

462
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Parts

463
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Of Western northern Europe

464
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
And then

465
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Traditional Australian music

466
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Some of the larger

467
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
Casinos companies

468
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
From the US

469
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Art

470
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Expanding into

471
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
India

472
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,775
Leveraging the high quality of Indian executives

473
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
It's already working this

474
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Do something else

475
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
In the home country

476
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
As well so that's where the US companies

477
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Extendo table spend time

478
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
And Welton

479
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
And for the Chinese company

480
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,647
Call me after greater China and then sausage

481
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Maybe India maybe not

482
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
But the Middle East

483
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Eastern Europe

484
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
Even Africa

485
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Art

486
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Very nice

487
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,167
Adidas popular view exception are in Brazil

488
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
In xiaomi if I were you

489
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
Some of the new entrance

490
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
Star in Mexico

491
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
So you do see each other's company

492
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
Compete better in the developing world

493
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
And leveraging what they have

494
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Tested in De

495
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,295
So the question is will the local startup

496
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
In developed

497
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Countries do a good job of

498
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
Meeting The Challenge from Chinese company

499
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
What do they collaborate

500
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
Or would they learn very quickly

501
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
And be able to leverage their lesson

502
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
From us in China

503
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,655
And therefore apply localization as needed by quickly

504
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Indigo country

505
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
Weeks to see Daddy Chinese food

506
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
What is Alibaba

507
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Or it what u d

508
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Xiaomi

509
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Becoming more open

510
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
2

511
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
These local country

512
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
And follow my tedium by dance and others as well

513
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
I think that you will see a lot more

514
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Investment from China

515
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
With the the fast racing

516
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
Local startups

517
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,743
So that there's a way to work together and for the local Starbucks

518
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Livermore

519
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
The Chinese partners

520
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
I think that's probably the most common

521
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
Cooperation

522
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
Also season comes that shopee

523
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
That took money from tencent

524
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
And then are building their own company

525
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Home businesses

526
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
In Southeast Asia

527
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Many of their

528
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Executive

529
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
Bob spent a portion of their life

530
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
In in the Southeast Asia

531
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
Does this kind of high protein

532
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
They could be some

533
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
But may not be a majority

534
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
Overtime they could be more of them

535
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
But with weave

536
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,047
We think that it cloudy should be some Chinese companies

537
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
And look.

538
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
What happened more

539
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,775
The Archimedes like everybody else that have Bob Lazar exam station they are

540
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Off reading

541
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
People sent from

542
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Dd7

543
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Consuming people from Beijing

544
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
To a lot America

545
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
You meant to be seen that the

546
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
The team from

547
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
China with all much Yuan exact experience

548
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
Stop to local market

549
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,463
And that's something that will closely closely monitor

550
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:41,631
All the founders with Matt in both Latin America and Indonesia are very fluent in English

551
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
Yeah that's what that's one thing that even caught our attention

552
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
Where in post office takes a lot of America

553
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
I think the

554
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
It's very interesting for us

555
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
CDs founders.

556
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
Arlen quickly on what's happening in US

557
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
But increasing willing to learn from

558
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
Looks like ourselves but what's happened

559
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
In China and even those with China on their own

560
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Through their alumni work

561
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
So as long there more Chinese people

562
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
Start studying southeast Asia and not America

563
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
It makes it easier to Foster

564
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Collaboration

565
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
Between startups in those regions

566
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,447
With with China this makes it easier for the local founder

567
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
How to go to China

568
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Through the

569
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
People to learn what else

570
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Week we think.

571
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
The world be a much safer

572
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Better place

573
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
Willis and want knowledge sharing

574
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Understanding each other and benefit from

575
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Trump's knowledge

576
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,159
Yeah in like 96 itself has a very low body

577
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
Actually have a pretty sizable audience in

578
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,839
Police is like southeast Asia and Latin America lie we were kind of surprised how it caught on quickly

579
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,143
With this Global Market

580
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
I think that's because

581
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,311
People around the world are increasingly realizing the importance of learning from China no matter

582
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Where they are

583
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,687
I also wanted to touch on the topic of payment because part of yellows

584
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,503
Product they not only do

585
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,807
Transportation Mobility but they're also

586
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,671
Launching yellow pay platform which is similar to a leap in WeChat pay in China

587
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
It's QR code-based so

588
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,071
Allows user to transform cash into digital credit for a yellow services

589
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
So through a network of certified

590
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,703
For sale such as convenience stores New Stand and bakeries

591
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,287
Users can buy yellow credits in cash by scanning a QR code

592
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
And then apply those credits to yellow rice

593
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
And we've seen the power of QR code

594
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Face

595
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Mobile

596
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
In China where are the mobile payment Market is

597
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
10 times larger than that of the US

598
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
And just like how Alibaba incubated alipay

599
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Groton Connecticut

600
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
We believe that yellow pee also presents

601
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
Agree opportunity in the region

602
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
So

603
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
Missing payment is such a huge effort

604
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
Why does a yellow has a chance to make that happen

605
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
In China

606
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Alipay

607
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Unpopular

608
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Partial because

609
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Creek Apartments

610
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
A lot of merchants

611
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
Don't want to spend money

612
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Took to have a terminal

613
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
Process credit cards

614
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
And then one smartphone

615
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Become

616
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,319
Quite popular becoming popular

617
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
In China

618
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
WeChat pay was born

619
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
It made a lot easier

620
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
To tip the merchants

621
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
Or buy stuff on Merchants or

622
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Pay your friends

623
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
For money you owe them

624
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Or just say

625
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Lobster Chinese New Year

626
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Morning cursive

627
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
People to

628
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Answer to a pulse

629
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Triplebyte information knowledge

630
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,151
So you chop a really took off in China and now

631
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm everywhere you go there they are a lot of interested or even want to

632
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015

00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
Accept WeChat pay

634
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
And it's so

635
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
How fast is Rose

636
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
A Mesa

637
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
No looking at

638
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
Post office in

639
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
America

640
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
Where the person

641
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,303
High prison population

642
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
I don't give a

643
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
My bank

644
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631

645
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
In China with

646
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Wechat WeChat pay

647
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
You can link your

648
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
WeChat pay were already paid

649
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
To a debit card

650
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
If some of these

651
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Countries

652
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Emerging Markets

653
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Most people don't even have it

654
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
So

655
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Baby frog

656
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
I'm from a casket Society

657
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
To a cure

658
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Code based

659
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
Screamin we sing there's a

660
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
High chance that could happen

661
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
If those Country RV have

662
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Tight enough

663
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Of smartphone penetration

664
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
So that's our hypothesis

665
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
This is how about that came up with

666
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
That we think will be very popular

667
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
And we'll see on the neck

668
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400
Next five years what does our bare bear fruit or not

669
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,192
But it definitely makes so exciting

670
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
Experiment

671
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
And financial is worth more than Goldman Sachs

672
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
It's party imagine

673
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
We have a lot of respect for Goldman Sachs

674
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
What Investment Bank

675
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,224
But it's impressive that last over a decade or so

676
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
So you what you took a trip to Brazil

677
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
Couple weeks ago yourself

678
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
What was your impression

679
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
What did you see

680
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,024
What is going to Jakarta or to some Paulo

681
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
It is impressive

682
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
See the face

683
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
Pace of urbanization

684
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Have you seen markets

685
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936

686
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
You see that there's just a lot of

687
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
Activity Auto founder

688
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
Who are

689
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Impressive

690
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
And well as

691
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Educated in softball

692
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
And want to do something

693
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
For their country

694
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Weather is the founders we met in

695
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Jakarta or

696
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,064
Looks like yellow in some Paulo

697
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Every one of them

698
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
Trying to figure out how can you Leverage

699
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
Archaeology

700
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
Elsewhere

701
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
To help their country

702
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
Become more prosperous

703
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Safer

704
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
And

705
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
Facilitate the growth of new economy

706
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
That would be more efficient

707
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Secret society

708
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
Benefits to more

709
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
The mask

710
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
Market the unbanked population

711
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
And I think that is

712
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Extremely synonym

713
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,896
And for something to be big

714
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Alibaba

715
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
How to get big in China

716
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
For WeChat and

717
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
Peking Beijing China

718
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
They haven't we something

719
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
That's useful to society

720
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
To bring analogy

721
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Democratizing

722
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Inbreeding benefits

723
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
To the mass Market

724
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
You don't do that

725
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,304
Then the Piston will have more niche

726
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
And doctors

727
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
It's not going to BSB

728
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
So

729
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
Seymour Thunder

730
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,984
What will you do that makes it our job

731
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Exciting

732
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,824
And interesting every single day and makes our life

733
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Some meaning

734
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
So my last question is I think

735
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
All of this is true and

736
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Saying it is easy but having a gut

737
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,344

738
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624

739
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
That is pretty new to us

740
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Takes a lot of

741
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Courage

742
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
So what was

743
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,816
The Tipping Point for you and you realize this is something I really want to

744
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,632
