Why is the show called 96

17
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:56,576
96 is the work schedule that many Chinese Founders have organically adopted

Many of which are moving faster

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800

28
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,848

She comes from China

30
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
Hi everyone this is Zara from gdb Castle

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
What you just heard is an app called also known as lingojam that's changing how millions of

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
Chinese people learn English today

33
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,000
Using speech recognition and artificial intelligence technology

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,072
I first heard of a Daily Show from my mom actually

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,912
Like many Chinese people she learn English in school when she was young

36
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,008
But when she was preparing for her first trip to the US to attend my graduation

37
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,848
She still panicked about her ability to communicate with actual Americans

38
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,456
So she told me she now uses an app called Duty short everyday

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,808
Where she speaks English sentences into her phone and is scored on her pronunciation

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
The app works like a game where you must

41
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,464
Pass a certain score before proceeding to the next level just like Angry Birds

42
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:12,352
Glitter addicted to the app now and sometimes even with my help was just stuck at a certain level

43
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
And her spoken English actually improved a lot and she was able to make some conversations with Americans when she came to visit

44
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,128
Is LG TV is actually one of the earliest investors in goalie schwa

00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
A year it cost about $150

76
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
IC

77
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
Take how many years does it take to get

00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Register users

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,736
Let's see what the app was first launched I got in time table 2013

2013 Ford F150

82
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,368
So now Jenny first talk to me about this investor

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
You just started

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
That's right that's why we were actually literally I think

85
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Ggbs

86
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
Earliest investment as of

87
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,143
Maybe May of 2013 took Jenny was

88
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,239
Was saying hey you should take $1000000 at least from us that's

89
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Are the smallest

90
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Well we can put in

91
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
You know I'm thinking about even last year that was a funny Act

92
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Yeah

93
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
Black first two months since you launched you you roast her number one in the Apple App Store

94
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Free paid apps

95
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
In China right it's also very interesting kind of a historical events because

96
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
The time in April of

97
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
13 earthquake

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Inkster trying ain't got nevermind

99
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,239
Yeah before then we were a free app

100
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
That we said okay what time you get paid

101
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
And we going to donate all the revenue

102
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
How much

103
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
It was going to be but all the revenue

104
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
To Charlie to 2in

105
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Go to the

106
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
People who are in the earthquake zone

107
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,391
So we did that and quickly

108
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Rose

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,719
To the top 10 of the

110
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
China Market

111
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
And then you know

112
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
I stayed there for three weeks at the peak was number to across-the-board it just right

113
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,311
What was it Temple Run

114
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,687
Then we were near the top of the leaderboard for for a while then

115
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
August

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
Top 2013 when we launched the Android version we decide to

117
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
And make everything

118
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Free so

119
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
To sort of spiritual growth

120
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
We went from there

121
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,511
So I think that's incredible because learning English is

122
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
Many people considered to be a boring task

123
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,959
Learning takes a lot of effort and for Education app to rolls to the top of the App Store is quite incredible

124
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
What do you think about Louis show that makes it so

125
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591
Appealing to people and it literally addictive

126
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
Yeah but that's one of the questions that we thought

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
A lot about when we were starting out because

128
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Traditional learning is kind of boring

129
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,903
And especially English many people hate it sometimes because they run into a really bad

130
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
LCD display

131
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
My whole life

132
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
But you know what we're starting out we saw the need

133
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
That's something you know you reading didn't

134
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Think up whale

135
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,871
When you're in the US right now so so that's something you know highest

136
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
Got got off the plane and the started you know

137
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,527
Really deserving the local market will result in need without okay

138
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
Mobile surgeon

139
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Time chart of time travel

140
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Tell you are in 20

141
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:57,279
Funny 12.12 ain't tryna you saw this karaoke app named Tombaugh

142
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Deputies searching

143
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
The first I thought

144
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
Stupid right who would be saying to yourself

145
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
People that age group remember you know this this built-in microphone thing

146
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
It's really unique

147
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
It could change people's behavior so we're okay

148
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,247
You are so interesting into that cell phones maybe the class B practice English

149
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
How can we make them stick

150
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
Rice always thought okay now you know Angry Birds

151
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
You know

152
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
Very popular at the time

153
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Can we give advice

154
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,023
But you know what would be the key element of gamification can use

155
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,655
Okay so maybe some feedback on their pronunciation

156
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Raikou

157
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,007
Indication of how good their pronunciation is

158
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
That at that time I I caught my

159
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,199
College buddy linkway who was a research scientist at Google in Mountain View back then these rationalizing speech

160

00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Yeah course

163
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Okay so why don't we

164
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:59,231
So that was really very International without okay that's build a very simple

165
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Utility

166
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Push something you content

167
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095

171
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,335
Sweetie at the first day she will think about the hey you know can we make it you know simple but easy to use

Accumulate the uses and keep growing right

174
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,063
So just like you know

175
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,671
The founder of iuc hush up and was talking about on stage at the first station

176

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
Then we realized

181
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
That within a few hours people are sending us

182
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751

00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,871
Apple's App Store in mainland China Hong Kong company in Japan

185
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
So that sucks whatever

186
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Our first big wave of uses

187
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Because apples

188
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,599
So I think you are at your company became profitable this February

189
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Do you have any tips on

190
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,255
Entrepreneurs with regards to monetization and how you started thinking about it

191
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Early on

192
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,863
Yeah I mean you no looking back I think we did

193
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
I can share.

194
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
More about our sort of

195
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Guelph history and

196
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Key decisions we made it on the way

197
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Of reading

198
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,383
Before we decided to enter this Market we ask few questions

199
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
We thought okay we going to do something

200
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Customer-facing

201
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
And we saw

202
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Big needle Chinese

203
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Even with

204
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Very ineffective

205
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Conventional methods

206
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
People are partying like

207
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
$5,000 or more a year

208
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
Into the Traditional brick-and-mortar School Supply

209
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
So we like okay

210
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,119
This is clearly they're not getting much in return

211
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
Statistics

212
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Shows

213
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
That you know half of the people

214
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Who paid that much money

215
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Never go back again to the school after 2 months

216
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
I said remember they pay like 24 at 12:20 to 24 months

217
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
And altogether

218
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,599
I just stopped going even though they still have money man I was talking to one of them

219
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,183
You know owners of a very big branch

220
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
The supermodel

221
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
You said yes

222
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
They're probably I'm like okay so

223
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
I see a big gap in

224
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,007
The data exchange how much people are paying and how much they're getting

225
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Return

226
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
So

227
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
ICP Market

228
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
IC

229
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Huge

230
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Efficiency in a system

231
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Then we got excited

232
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Because

233
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
You should just pick up in about exchange on the

234
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
It deficiency

235
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
Technology can come in and

236
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,303
Healthy food that's very gracious to us we are all three co-founders

237
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,423
I'm just company we were engineers by training so we with this will figure something we can do is

238
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
We can use technology and products

239
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
To improve efficiency

240
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Some cysts

241
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
And we can get Daddy out of

242
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
So what role does air play Spa

243
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Specifically

244
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
And what can what kind of dish no service

245
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Can you provide

246
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Exactly

247
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
So

248
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,135
I'm going to talk about AI into Xbox One S Automotive user value expect

249
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
The other is solid business

250
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Model S

251
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
From the use of an expectorant we realize

252
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
There are two major Tran

253
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
I think

254
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Like the

255
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
The theme of the

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Lights out

257
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Introduced

258
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
You know if they're popular

259
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Terminology

260
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Talk about lot in recent years called

261
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Salvation

262
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
We see

263
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
2 keywords in consumption

264
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
What is

265
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575
That the quality of

266
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Backup. Which

267
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
Oftentimes translate into more personalized service

268
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,023
The other is for the time or efficiency aspect

269
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Teapot Chinese

270
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,191
Pay money to get to save the time so that we have wasted our time on the things they love right so these are the two

271
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
And these two Trends are

272
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
Nowhere to be seen

273
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
It's very expensive

274
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,175
What's what makes it more expensive is the only

275
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
Amount but doesn't leave this thing you spend time together results pre-season get this right

276
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
So we thought what if

277
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
We can reduce

278
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
The price they pay

279
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,743
And make them reach their learning goals

280
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Faster

281
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
So that will be a

282
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
They're comparing

283
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
So we thought

284
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
What's the future of learning

285
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Look like

286
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,823
We literally close our eyes we would dream about it for quite a while

287
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
We thought

288
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Towards

289
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Personalization

290
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
And high

291
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
So we thought

292
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
What can make it possible

293
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Now we realize

294
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
You can only go so far

295
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
By throwing

296
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Human teachers

297
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
And weeping

298
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Default

299
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
What time is it

300
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,911
We see a lot of one of my models both online off

301
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,751
But that they can go so only go so far and they by the way they do

302
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
They have really bad that you cannot

303
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
So we thought okay what was that

304
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Without okay

305
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
It should be something like

306
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
The that the Baymax

307
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
The Disney movie paintings

308
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,807
You have some intelligence

309
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Virtual

310
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Understands you really well

311
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
I understand you you're learning better than yourself let any human teacher possible because of the interaction

312
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Does product knowledge more

313
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Exactly

314
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Hundreds of thousands and millions of users

315
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
By the way

316
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,015
This is I'm going to throw this out at 2 to review to get your input. I think this is

317
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
Higher level

318
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Of shared economy

319
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
We talked on share economy with

320
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,511
Talk about the show me about physical

321
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,911
We are able to hire the best of the educator

322
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,031
AI scientist did that designers

323
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,175
Across-the-board and they do whenever go to Kasam to teach because they thought that's going to be a waste of their time but

324
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
Now they're dumping took the knowledge X

325
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
What is into this engine right and that the

326
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
It's negligible

327
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
This is a whole new model of really

328
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Pushing the boundary of human learning

329
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,351
Forward so we can learn from

330
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
The engine room

331
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,567
Radio we think as time goes by

332
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
The brain

333
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
Is AI teacher

334
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,711
Going to be more powerful in a really surpassed most

335
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
And we've already demonstrated that

336
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,391
Even before we launched this AIX teacher in July of 2016 with you tattoo Matt experiment

337
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
Wzts

338
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
Took which test as a benchmark because

339
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,327
Ticketmaster the comedy paint framework which is a conical level system of

340
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Proficiency

341
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
The result can be very interesting late in the users using a learning from Rai teacher on their cell phone

342
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
We're able to get up one level

343
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
And there's

344
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
System

345
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,455
With only about 36.5 hours of study within two months.

346
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
And recommended at least 100 hours of study to

347
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
To get up.

348
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
That level so we

349
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
Chipotle learning

350
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Efficiency

351
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
So we think this is just

352
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Stony Point

353
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
3D owl

354
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
We know are probably has a lot of

355
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Eres Tu in

356
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Direction

357
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
So ask someone from China was studying overseas a lot of my friends went to English schools like sheen on Fallon and others

358
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Do you think that with

359
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
Absolutely Shore

360
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,063
Do you think you guys can replace those schools and replace actual teachers or do you think they still have a roll

361
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
Play in this new world of AI

362
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
Yeah I got that question a lot I think we've shown in the past year or so

363
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Who is that

364
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
For adults

365
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Definitely we think

366
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
Can't do most of the word if

367
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,263
Today we are uses on average do they spend over 5 hours a week

368
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,895
And I've been getting very noticeable Improvement

369
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
How are you this way

370
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
3D

371
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
Exceed their expectations We Didn't Start you know

372
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
You know with

373
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
$15 a month

374
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,647
Monthly subscription model they can't get this kind of improvement

375
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,231
But you know and if you go down there the age group

376
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
If you're talking about teenagers leaving kids

377
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,655
I think human interaction is still needed but the AI

378
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Can really help a lot

379
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
Let me give you another

380
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
Cervix during example

381
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,943
We did a social responsibility project in the highlands Chiang Rai Highlands in rural China of a Tibetan Avenue School

382
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Last year

383
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
They don't have

384
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
And so we donate

385
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,927
Smartphones and we made our paid a t-shirt a product for free for them

386
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
At 9 months

387
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Using this product

388
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Two to three times

389
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
A week

390
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Each time for 45 minutes

391
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
There are how many students did this

392
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:17,567
They are about a hundred a hundred and

393
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Not 9th grade

394
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:25,247
Their average score score improved for in English

395
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
By almost 20 points

396
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
On a hundred point scale

397
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
Improvement

398
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,207
Yes it's it's pretty remarkable.

399
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
Should be told that their starting point starting over isn't that high but still very impressed

400
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
So that's extreme

401
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,007
I I don't Envision that our teenagers with ob only

402
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
Starting studying for tomorrow

403
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
But still

404
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:56,223
We actually have a lot of things teachers as an app as our users

405
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
On my time you know is a sign you know

406
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Assignments

407
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
For my students to do to practice listening speaking

408
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
And so so I think

409
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
It really is not about

410
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
Replacing the teachers Robitussin actually

411
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
Alleviating some of them and help them

412
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Pandora

413
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Precious time

414
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,615
The other more sort of the motivation the purple character and the

415
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
The other aspect

416
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Education

417
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
Redeemer well-rounded

418
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Human being

419
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
I think that that's a very valuable aspect of Education as well as that I think that's going to take a longer time for AI

420
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
How to play a significant role

421
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Start an email

422
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,583
Maybe you some of the that us audience didn't I know this but think some of the

423
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,191
China Celeste about heroes by Queen on Providence a 70% of the

424
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
Primary schools and the secondary schools

425
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Latin

426
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
The number is 50

427
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
That's really huge deficit

428
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,455
1.3 billion people in China find German people live in the city

429
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
So it's not an 800 million people

430
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Mosam don't have ass

431
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
English teacher

432
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
Or just in general quality you know teacher

433
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Espresso

434
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Yeah it's a huge problem we think

435
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
In English

436
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
You can also teach other subjects or Chinese

437
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Later as well

438
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,631
But I think so yes so I think the general argument

439
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Hose farewell you know

440
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
Across-the-board we think

441
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,287
Artificial intelligence in body

442
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,895
User-friendly Services can really go a long way there

443
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
They can't help equalize

444
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
The fields pretzel

445
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
People with different socioeconomic

446
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,391
Quite education on and they can really bring down the car

447
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
And improve the efficiency

448
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Think about that you know a lot of the

449
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Sixth-grade students

450
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
They go to bed at

451
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
11 p.m.

452
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Too much homework

453
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
Do a lot of them go into waste

454
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
People know that

455
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
So a lot of the problems

456
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
Tempe salt

457
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,175
Improve efficiency green. The cost and also equal access I think

458
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
We didn't think about AI this term

459
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
Particularly we thought about technology

460
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Prada getting people's

461
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Mass

462
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Some experts

463
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Norwich ND

464
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,215
Bacon to the product and that it can't evolve evolve

465
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
Shy one level you have English

466
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Chinese and others

467
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Academic stop

468
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
That people would

469
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
You can teach in school

470
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
Another way of looking at

471
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Another level

472
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Is that

473
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
They could be more professional usage

474
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Tweening

475
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
For the set episode

476
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
Can you share more about that

477
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Access

478
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,047
What can learn new things that could be done with this report

479
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
Yes let me give you a couple examples we work with

480
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,007
They're well-known education Sports name that last night was he lives in San Francisco open in the past

481
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,567
To oppress US GDP spending almost half

482
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Time in Shanghai

483
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
He's learning theory which we use

484
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Extensively in a product called rhr

485
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Recursive hurricane

486
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,807
It's just one of many many see what you can find

487
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Right but it's very unique one

488
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
He told me one

489
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
Football

490
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
Club Soccer Club

491
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Belgium

492
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Was using his

493
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Tony Siri

494
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
2 train

495
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
The players

496
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
And

497
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
And I'm more of a human-centered way

498
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Breaking down the movements

499
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
The players

500
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
Get better faster

501
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
We were talking about

502
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
You can definitely imagine

503
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Some kind of product

504
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
You know what you maybe even with

505
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
Yao Yai

506
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
To read help

507
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Professional sports team

508
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
With replacing

509
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
The human coaching at

510
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Give me five

511
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Product

512
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
And another aspect

513
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
One of my friends who was doing

514
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
The training of car mechanic

515
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
She actually

516
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Coddington

517
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
In-depth chat with me the other day

518
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Asking me

519
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,992
Hey can I use AI to really revamp

520
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Michael

521
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Now it's very

522
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Labor intensive

523
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:22,720
Takes a long time and depending on that the trainer's quality did the outcome of that the cost

524
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
There is

525
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
Parliament

526
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
So

527
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
Now if we started talking about

528
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
The huge Market

529
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,168
Professional training China and also

530
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Call r e d a i

531
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
And other Technologies

532
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
Reedy

533
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
Soda Princeton

534
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Why complicate

535
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
How how do you use AI

536
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
Universal teacher

537
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
To guide them through

538
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
All the questions

539
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,696
I think you can start from something relatively simple

540
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,560
We were talking about for some check up procedures or some something that you would

541
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,096
Normally required

542
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,168
Memorizing a pretty thick manual or something

543
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,240
You can't actually make them some kind of game

544
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
And

545
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,432
Cup and remember

546
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Small bites

547
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,320
Okay and it can really use your of your appointment time and you know you can just

548
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
If you have 5 minutes you can't fire which one took challenges and you remember something and that time you just pick up from there

549
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
Breaking down

550
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Monolithic

551
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:37,216
Horse and Rider small pieces and use them to sort of Stitch the elements together

552
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Individualized

553
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,872
Also obviously across different domains and subjects we need that Doma export

554
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Commander

555
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,296
That's why you know we are increasingly more and more you know content-heavy company as well you know

556
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
A lot of pictures he professional

557
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
Generator exactly we have we have we had a community that seem more ugc than we had PGC so that's

558
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
Topic is there and I talked about in relief

559
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
Epicenter company

560
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Build up

561
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
The curtain designs

562
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
It's really about

563
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Looking at

564
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056

Leprechaun PGC

571
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
That's why I wasn't very volleyball

572

You don't get that bad individual

579
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
That's a very unique

580
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
OK Google

581
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,456
But I really had told me earlier that

582
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,296
You can learn English for a while but if you need to use English

583
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,624
To get a job in a job interview situation

584
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
Is a different kind of application English skills

585
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
And of course more practice in

586
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,072
Your fine amount of time to Ace an interview

587
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608

Yes we have that kind of Rogers and we literally have examples of a security guard at an office building

591
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
Training are out for half a year and got a office job

It really recorded huge pay raise like we have

593
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
Lot of different samples like that

594
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
And we have funeral

595
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,064
Grandpa's are retired

596
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
Deeply worried about not being able to talk to his grandson leaving San Francisco starting user app and

597
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
Finally be able to communicate

599
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,912
English be self-sufficient and just go round

600
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Everything so

601
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,032
Yeah so when you when users first open the app date

602
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
Debrief survey

603
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
22 indicator interest

Why do you want to learn English by its weather if you want to study abroad shop abroad

606
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
212 Warwick Ave

That's right that's right we tried Reedy to personalize the content for them and I'll also they can explore but yeah we WeChat

608
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
To make it relevant

609
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,144
EDC that exciting things you can do after you hit you

610
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Have you one of the most powerful motivation

611
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
I want to switch

612
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Papik tumor

613
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,664
Or personal let's talk about your background and Hangzhou City

614
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
East York College interest

615
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,928
Right and then you went to a Chihuahua and then you went to Princeton for graduate school

616
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:42,560
So you speak perfect English now but I remember you said before that when you first came to the US for Princeton

617
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,632
Your first news at McDonald's and you had difficulty

618
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Communicating with

619
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
The counter help at McDonald's

620
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,032
I wish it was very simple English and that made you think about

621
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Why diets

622
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,408
The case so can you share more about that experience and white why do you think

623
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,736
Even though you got top scores in English test in China

624
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,808
It was still difficult for you to come in and see where the actual American

625
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Yeah so it's quite sciatica

626
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,208
Going to be in my life life like memory now that was

627
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
September 1st

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
2005

629
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,864
And I was at Anna McDonald's near the Newark Airport

630
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
I was trying to just pick out a few items but

631
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,264
Not that way I didn't understand I finally

632
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
You know I said okay number 2

633
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Picked up stepmill

634
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
No remember that I

635
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
I got almost perfect score in my TOEFL exam

636
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,760
Missing 10 points

637
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
677

638
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Mexican scale

639
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
But I think

640
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
At a time

641
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
I was

642
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,280
Mostly doing draws on my grandma you know maybe

643
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
Riding

644
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
My Melissa peking

645
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
Didn't get that much

646
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Exposure effect

647
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
So when I met

648
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,800
My late advisor at Princeton I was

649
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
Most worried about

650
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Speak speak

651
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
Can I really

652
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,760
You'll follow and have a beautiful conversation and discussion about me recent copy

653
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
But then I I

654
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
Maybe spend an entire year

655
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Watching the news talking to my America

656
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,232
In a fellow students and sauce was getting

657
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,792
All the practices that I could

658
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Verity health

659
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
So I

660
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
It's really about

661
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,680
Not just getting your your language at

662
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,008
Education from the books and from the unit doing drills

663
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
3D

664
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,360
Use it in practice and practice makes perfect ID

665
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Price bear Wild

666
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
A scale

667
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
Type subject

668
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
I like language

669
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,320
Unfortunately even today that the whole

670
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,720
Education system and the setup of Tanks running course and in China is more like a luxury

671
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
The teeth the teachers take the center

672
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Stagehand

673
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Preaching way Mariah

674
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
Said that that's that's really I think concentrate

675
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
If so when we started out

676
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
A building to stop

677
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
I have many of my

678
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
Fellow classmates in my mind on my

679
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
Is it would travel back in time and they use my app what

680
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
What they need what would I need

681
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
The most

682
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,368
So we really think a lot of Allison speaker

683
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Practices

684
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Imports and

685
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Annapolis

686
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,512
And also really help them get access to authentic

687
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
Lime juice

688
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Dialogues

689
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
Spicer we we we hired

690
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
Very talented writers to write authentic.

691
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
We have

692
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
Top tier voice actor

693
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Actresses house

694
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Report

695
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
The

696
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Recordings

697
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Yeah we we try to give people

698
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
As authentic

699
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Yeah it's alright

700
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
Transporting native English speakers

701
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,088
2 people who may not otherwise have access

702
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Living in

703
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Exactly exactly

704
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
You had that... We think both

705
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,560
Helps in the learning setting and also

706
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
Also I found my motivation

707
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
So you were here before

708
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,800
That's right I remember for most of the last decade

709
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,384
And Stucky being a returnee a sea turtle

710
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Coming back to China

711
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
2

712
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Internet start

713
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Is nice

714
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Muggsy Bogues

715
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
Grassroot

716
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Enough

717
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Hello Kitty cheat

718
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
That's right you know what's going on

719
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,696
But that seems like with what you're doing now

720
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
You'll return the background Ashley is a huge

721
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,888
Plus for you yeah I think I did a couple things right looking back

722
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
The first thing is I took my time

723
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,544
Before coming back to China and even after coming back to China

724
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
To really observe

725
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Allure

726
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:45,248
And I saw a lot of examples of techies Chinese Takkies with some kind of Technology coming back really use

727
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,600
Use that as a dog looking for the nails to get off price

728
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
The results weren't good

729
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,184
I do think the Ops

730
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
I had a

731
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
US Patent no

732
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:01,888
Virtual Router migration in space you know I could have raised a huge amount back then

733
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
Studer House of rats

734
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:09,056
Sephora software-defined networking could just do a startup

735
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,408
I didn't do that I thought okay

736
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:18,528
Recondition myself and the final unimarket find out what Missouri where am I

737
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
PM hat on and build a solution

738
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
The Haven at p.m. background is Ashley

739
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,488
Yes I think so yes now I think.

740
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Startups in this

741
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Related field

742
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,144
It starts before my startup and did they didn't

743
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
So that while because

744
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Have only single founder

745
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
Tech background

746
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,616
Virginia

747
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,688
And they come back with us going to hammer starting to build privacy

748
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
To see if they can stay

749
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
So I think yes having great co-founders is great process and also having a product respect Andre

750
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Reading you know

751
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
If I weren't doing this startup

752
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
With this approach

753
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
I was not going to be place

754
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
Co-founder and he would probably other successful

755
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,680
Research scientist I call you something else

756
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
App identify the user need

757
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:15,360
And probably first and then as you build the solution you use

758
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,968
And also if you look at a spectrum are approaches pretty Silicon Valley

759
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
Yes okay we use a very

760
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
Approach

761
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,184
So I think really you know find the right problem to solve and find the right

762
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,256
People and 2 is reading important

763
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
If I were to do the moron

764
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:40,704
I don't think I'm going to be the best counter for like bikes

765
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,104
Right so just find the right right problem right space and you pick the right approach

766
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
I think you are

767
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
Experis

768
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,224
Including your overseas experience can be reduced by

769
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,576
Would you say the other Shore as more product driven or technology

770
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,904
Honestly I item make that distinction

771
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,952
I think people don't consume technology

772
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
The oldest of the only consumers

773
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
So good product

774
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,840
Technology will be embodied in a product

775
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Pink Tesla

776
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
As an example

777
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,800
Can you talk about some of the situations that you've been through with the product and

778
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,944
The major decisions you've made along the way and things you've learned

779
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
Utility app that people wanted

780
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
And then that's

781
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
A practice

782
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
Practice to revolves

783
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Into

784
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
As largest

785
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Nationalist community

786
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,328
We realize okay people have the needs

787
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
The used

788
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
App daily

789
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,984
It would be italicized I just paid 5000

790
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
Dollars to that.

791
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
High School

792
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Why don't we offer

793
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
A systematic solution

794
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
People don't pay

795
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Hateful this piecemeal

796
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
Corroncho toys

797
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
But they would pay for

798
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Somatic

799
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
So we we we we

800
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
We went out

801
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
Talking to the top publishers

802
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
Pearson's

803
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
First Cambridge of the world

804
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
And try to license

805
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
All the famous

806
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Text books

807
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,912
What design for the offline custom teaching environment they worth it

808
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,520
Someone lying there in their caucino studying in the solo mode on a cell phone

809
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,824
With okay why don't we go there from scratch

810
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,640
Did the perfect solution we envision it does exist today

811
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
So now we've assembled at work

812
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,784
Stephen not easy and we find out where us and China experts

813
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
It started doing that

814
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
So the stuff is really you know

815
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,184
Going from I just just a utility app and the community into

816
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
A full flash

817
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
Honey technology company

818
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
And with

819
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
Asystematic

820
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Leveled

821
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
You guys are not having a project manager experience was important

822
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,264

Hi Google

829
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
Especially in Silicon Valley

830
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
The shortest answer is really follow your heart

831
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:08,160
Back when I was doing my PhD in computer science at Princeton I remember I

832
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
Didn't even know

833
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720

You know I wasn't

842
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
Got an offer at McKinsey

843
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,912
That's right you know about appropriation War preparation for my

844
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
The interview

845
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,752
I actually read 18 month Wall Street Journal

846
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
And I died I literally

847
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944

Drove down the busy Central to to Stanford campus interview practice with my photo studio

852
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
No friends at Stanford

Yes we did that for the whole summer always knew that you were

854
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,504
You didn't just want to be an engineer you wanted to be in the business

855
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,392
This what I think I think I see a lot of

856
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Country House

857
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
Beautiful Technologies right but I also see you

858
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
Anal fistula

859
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,240
The weather

860
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Great businesses

861
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:06,688
They could be even better.

862
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,248
You know how to use it

863
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Lack of

864
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Bridge spa temperature

865
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,952

866
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
McKenzie

867
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
As a consultant

868
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,288
But that is now and I got the offer from Google

00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
Yeah

00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
You know if I could

871
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Learn how to

872
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Build up rocks on Google

873
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
That's probably the best of

874
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
You can get it if you want to become Mexico

875
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
That's why I went

876
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
We see a lot of Engineers

877
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,112
Obvious including Chinese

878
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
That don't have that business.

879
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
So there corn Cole

880
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Stuck

881
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
Doing just acknowledging

882
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
Refining algorithms

883
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
And it's harder over Pier time of 5-10 years

884
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
To then become an entrepreneur

885
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
You don't have the

886
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
That a comprehensive in a background

887
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
I'm a business to the complement of Technology

888
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,640
Yeah I can totally relate to what you said

889
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:15,040
Examples of inspiration

890
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,904
Hdb to figure out how to help

891
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
Engineers want to have in Abyss.

892
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
Yeah practice so you at your expense

893
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,352
Yeah but you know honestly I see a lot of

894
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,192
Ingenious whether they are Chinese or other background

895
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,288
If you just give them the right exposure

896
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
Doraemon a date they can grow in

897
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,616
When two or more well-rounded

898
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
Uno founder

899
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,432
Yeah that's

900
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
Did you always know that you were going to

901
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
Return to China or did you also consider staying

902
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,136
Honestly I always know

903
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:57,536
But I'm still remember very clearly you know when we bought that little condo in Sunnyvale with my wife and we were talking about

904
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,096
Who is such a great company we work

905
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
At least want that flight for 5 years

906
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
That I left everything

907
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,872
Alabama center for 5 years

908
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:17,248
I didn't I didn't know

909
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Sweetie I think

910
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:24,416
I kind of sensed the growth my personal growth is started to a plateau

911
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
A little bit

912
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
And also when I visit Becca

913
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,280
Back to China I see

914
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,424
Just Energy

915
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,472
Okay you can see it but you feel it too

916
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,752
Okay so that

917
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:44,896
So the both factors are my

918
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
Interesting

919
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Wow how did your lifestyle change

920
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
When you first

921
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Return to China from

922
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Google

923
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,160
Do you think our podcast

924
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
I

925
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
I no longer own a car

926
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,792
I I took the very crowded Subway

We we share an apartment

930
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:21,504
Did I had a 1-hour emoni Subway commute right with two transfers at the beginning

00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,576
Laura where's obviously it was great

932
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
I was watching people

Using their cell phones

934
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Exactly you you would buy the same kind of breakfast by at

Convenience store

936
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
And you just just really live

937
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
The way they left

938
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
And watch

939
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
Honestly I didn't have the time to watch so much TV but I would talk with them over lunch and my my chair

940
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Tennessee

941
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Tell me about weather wash

942
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
I would just listen to your conversations

943
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
Actually

944
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
Did the first Spark

945
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,024
Came from my lunch conversation with my colleague I did in the starting my call me right away I joined at China which is one of the leading

946
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
My yellow card Eastwood

947
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
Should we be watching more American TV shows more movies

948
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,312
Poopy so much Soul into different language in school

949
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:27,296
If you pee so much and now you ask me any more TV shows movies

950
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
Then I started to look into smart

951
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
I see Houston man I see how

952
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,864
The current we wasn't your first product actually I thought about that

953
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
Thought about

954
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,424
Can we do something with better

955
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,824
Christian agradan to a funeral TV

956
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,711
Leave me alone movie Bittersweet stremio something or or Enterprise

957
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
Finalize resuming electroneum mobile

958
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,903
Because I see a huge Muse and eat and us that

959
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
IC

960
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
Clear growth

961
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,255
Mobile in general

962
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,631
So would you say you decided to start a company and then went out to identify to find

963
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,935
No problem in a market or was it

964
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
You saw the problem first

965
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
I

966
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:26,175
I clearly told myself you know it's the right time to leave Google and then do something

967
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
And I had

968
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Four choices

969
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
I cooked

970
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,295
What state in the Bay Area and I

971
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
I was getting a lot of you know LinkedIn

972
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:40,255
Private messages from recruiter sweat till you can't come join us a small start-up you could do it on your own in the Bay Area

973
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
Animated Hobbit episode

974
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,655
So I would just go back to China

975
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Brandon

976
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
I said okay

977
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Now you already back in China

978
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
There's actually

979
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Not that

980
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Big of a hurry

981
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
You should take your tie

982
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
Really learned

983
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:01,503
The Marquis that are really finding the right user need first

984
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,927
Google recently launched the new headset that can

985
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,767
Automatically translate everything you here in a few languages

986
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,863
What is the name of that product ends you think in this age

987
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,959
With these products will people still need to learn foreign languages in the future

988
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,263
I really want to try that

989
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,335
Something later this month when I visit us I'll try to get a pair of that

990
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:31,199
Yeah I think that if that works well I think it's going to

991
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
House off

992
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
Some of the problems

993
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,807
Like my parents when they travel abroad maybe you can

994
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
I hate you.

995
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,695
But I don't think that's going to be completely eliminated that I share in a market in fact I

996
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
Unimaginable with

997
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:48,095
Technology like that you know you would at the school system would eliminate English as a subject

998
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
3D I think that the natural way

999
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
4 people

1000
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Communicate

1001
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
It is through there

1002
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,287
Traditional conversation, Mather

1003
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
People that do that

1004
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,103
And also

1005
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,383
Process

1006
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,919
Learning a language

1007
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Is also a

1008
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
Process of

1009
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
Understanding that culture

1010
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,087
And also it's a process of

1011
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
Celcom

1012
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:17,279
We see that comment a lot warmer uses in a let me know the grammar and vocabulary don't have a conference

1013
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:22,399
Exactly when they actually are Beyond

1014
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
How to communicate to the people there entry

1015
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,519
I think it's it's it's

1016
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
It's alert

1017
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,847
It's a learning experience and that

1018
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Appoint

1019
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
You know you able to

1020
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,735
Do the things that you weren't able to do before so I think so

1021
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
I don't like that

1022
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Right wing

1023
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
When Jenny first told me about your team

1024
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,999
I was surprised that no one on your team had any teaching background

1025
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,495
Teaching English has been in ICU said done for over a decade

1026
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,079
There a lot of academic study on it and what's the best approach and so far

1027
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,407
Now those two different schools when I have the

1028
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
Ability to innovate

1029
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,759
But they understood some of the theory behind

1030
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Dot teaching English

1031
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
What teaching General

1032
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
So how did you initially develop.

1033
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Pro tyre products

1034
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,719
And handle this iteration send it shortly

1035
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,511
Not having that background

1036
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
2

1037
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
Get to some kind of product Market

1038
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
Dad the darkness answer is

1039
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
We just did what we feel is

1040
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
As users up

1041
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,311
Exactly as I could learn English

1042
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
The hard way

1043
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:39,199
Okay we thought okay and we weren't trying to build the Silver Bullet

1044
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
At the beginning

1045
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
I don't think

1046
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,807
I still don't think we have the Silver Bullet

1047
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,879
Voting process

1048
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
Okay at the park is never finished

1049
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
Let's just push baby 1 dialogue

1050
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,583
Office of higher level in interest per day

1051
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,167
And it's interesting to them they can practice Kathy back that's good enough

1052
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:07,103
That doesn't require that much of universal curriculum

1053
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
Go to research

1054
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:15,039
But now we believe that there was a design team at the at the end

1055
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
How big is a tuna

1056
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
About 40 people

1057
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,999
So I actually don't think you don't mess hat

1058
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
All the you know mechanics

1059
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,447
When he started out

1060
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:39,615
Riesel at you know you bring the right people at the right time if we were

1061
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
To get the best

1062
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
You know

1063
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
Kitchen design expert

1064
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,735
Back in 2013

1065
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,087
So I think it's just

1066
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
Soto the team along the way.

1067
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,695
Can you talk about the geographical spread of

1068
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:58,303
Louis R Us users and what kind of users they are they students were white collar workers West

1069
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Breakdown

1070
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:03,423
Yeah so we have one third of of uses being a K-12

1071
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
So they're underage

1072
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
And weep

1073
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
About

1074
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,079
Weather little bit less than 1/3

1075
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
Are you just being

1076
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
College students

1077
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
More than 1/3

1078
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
And you have students outside of China

1079
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,087
Yes we have

1080
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,903
Now I think we have less than 10%

1081
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,695
How about you just being a brat

1082
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Mosto

1083
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
In China

1084
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,815
Because you would need to be able to read Chinese

1085
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:35,167
The app is only in Chinese

1086
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,751
But yes I ain't tryna we we are

1087
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Buy Auto

1088
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,335
We have flour uses ain't

1089
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
First day of cities Balto II

1090
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Port Huron

1091
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Countryside

1092
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
And you mentioned that your

1093
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,295
Your company can serve as a force for equalizing

1094
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
Nation within China

1095
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
People ain't too bad may not have access

1096
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Was too good English

1097
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,023
That's correct. That's why we did we see huge potential there and

1098
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,327
This year we have set up

1099
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,887
A dedicated team working on social

1100
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,703
Working with ngos

1101
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Improving

1102
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
Access to

Quality Inn

1104
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
We are hoping

1105
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
Dodgers score

1106
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,759
Would you consider expanding two languages other than English

1107
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,575
It's always on a road map

1108
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
Weather for Lake.

1109
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,207
What are three new things that you Zurich

1110
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Expect in the neck

1113
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
They would definitely

1114
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Cm

1115
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
More

1116

1119
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
Number two they will see you some

1120
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,567
Very cool

1121
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
First

1122
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
In the world kind of Technology

1123
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
Ready to lunch and learn

1124
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,063
I think there will also see you some our new

1125
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
Exciting

1126
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Fox

1127
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
Yeah

1128
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
This this mean

1129
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,511
I think Alicia also has the world's largest database of

1130
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
Chinese people

1131
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Pronunciation

1132
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,375
In English what you do with all that

1133
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:14,495
We punch the data and the we keep improving our language assessment

1134
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,799
Today we have

1135
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
Other worlds

1136
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
What would you need

1137
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
The most

1138
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Accurate

1139
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
Speech

1140
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Ignition engine

1141
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
Thanks to that

1142
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Cutest

1143
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,879
And also we Beauty on top of that dataset

1144
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,671
Now our engine

1145
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
Was not only able to

1146
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
Actually gif

1147
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
If you back on

1148
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Peoples

1149
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,071
But also on

1150
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Grandma

1151
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Vocabulary

1152
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
Flynn Center

1153
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
Coherence hbase get all major asset

1154
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Backed up

1155
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
People speech

1156
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
We even also

1157
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
Develop

1158
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Assessment

1159
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Writing

1160
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,639
Yeah so so we we've been building up

1161
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
Full stack

1162
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
AI engine

1163
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
To help people

1164
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
How to learn Unity

1165
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
Yashow is easy to tell

1166
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
People when they're wrong

1167
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
I think it might

1168
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,671
Baby harder to teach them what is right

1169
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,303
XY so that's an area we being

1170
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,839
Making a lot of Investments

1171
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
We have

1172
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
Recently set up

1173
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Small office in San Mateo

1174
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,983
Oh okay

1175
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
Former CIA

1176
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Scientist

1177
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Stop on Facebook

1178
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,151
And the Weeping hiring event aggressively balding

1179
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
China and the US

1180
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,223
To read it got the best people

1181
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,039
Excited about what we do and if we can

1182
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,599
I also can't you build with that Talent

1183
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
To build

1184
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,695
The next generation of Technology Pro and cons

1185
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
I think both

1186
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,511
These are the three pillars

1187
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
To solve the problem

1188
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
You mentioned

1189
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
How big is your us

1190
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,191
I know it's a few people we we we hope to

1191
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:48,959
Got to

1192
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
10

1193
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
By the end of this year

1194
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
But we have very high SED how do you say

1195
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
That's really exciting

1196
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
So

1197
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
I wanted to talk a bit more about Monica

1198
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
Position has allowed

1199
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,879
Westers may have the impression that Chinese users are less willing

1200
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,927
Pay for knowledge

1201
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Incontinent

1202
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,743
I think that's been changing dress

1203
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,327
Tickling the past few years

1204
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,471
Projects like the dollar or smile at where people pay subscription fees to access knowledge

1205
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:26,591
I think Alicia is another reflection of that do you find a surprising that Chinese people are paying so much

1206
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Foreknowledge

1207
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,431
Yeah totally I think it's an unstoppable Chan

1208
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,759
In all thanks to the surge of easy access

1209
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
Quality content as well as

1210
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Mobile payments

1211
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,903
On top of what you smashing these are these are real examples but

1212
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
I would want

1213
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
One thing which is

1214
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,767
Education

1215
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:50,143
You know parents are so much exactly in Chinese

1216
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Education

1217
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
Morning

1218
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
Or anything else

1219
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,567
Prioritizing spending

1220
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
You know

1221
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,383
75

1222
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Percent of

1223
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
Total spending on

1224
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Freezing a

1225
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
Child Inc

1226
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
It also

1227
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
That's that's

1228
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
My bogging figure figure

1229
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Another education

1230
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
That's been making a lot of waves

1231
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
Vipkid

1232
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
Do you think they are

1233
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,399
Compare Dulce the Mystic

1234
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
Competitor

1235
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
How do you think

1236
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
Hair product compare

1237
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:31,871
View them as a competitor because number one day Focus mostly on kids

1238
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:37,503
And so far are paying customers are mostly adults all y'all young young

1239
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,527
Young adults

1240
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,343
Number to we take

1241
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
Different approach

1242
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,743
You know they are trying to bridge human teachers and students

1243
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
They're more like

1244
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,375
We think we are on a different

1245
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
Quote unquote Innovation curve

1246
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:59,775
We think we are trying to do what human teachers can do

1247
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,335
Oro do it much better than human teeth

1248
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,383
So are we build AI

1249
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
So I think

1250
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
The approaches are different

1251
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,063
And companies are also guard

1252
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,367
I think both have have

1253
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,647
Their sweet spot

1254
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,463
Will be our top advice for

1255
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,255
New Shanghai

1256
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Overseas returnees

1257
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,095
Chinese students who study abroad and 1/2

1258
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
Start new company in Troy

1259
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Call gdb

1260
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,239
Yes number one call ggv talk 2GB

1261
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,359
Honestly I think I we were very fortunate

1262
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,151
To have DTV hazard

1263
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
Their first semester

1264
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,247
And the bee our continuing supporter

1265
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,783
GBS

1266
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
The unique

1267
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
Perspective

1268
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,159
Both of you at Market in China and also

1269
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,743
It's understanding in both technology and

1270
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,071
Commerce I think it really is

1271
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Quite made mix

1272
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Veronique

1273
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:02,495
By the way it has really good reputation Cross of both markets are doing

1274
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,335
Secondly I think it's really

1275
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
About

1276
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
Finding your

1277
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:13,503
Calling you if you are a just hot core in all Technologies

1278
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,039
Oig Orban

1279
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Youku made

1280
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
Have a different

1281
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,647
A decision-making process that is someone who

1282
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
I'm just glad you

1283
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,071
Identify your Bureau and what you owe you

1284
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,471
Aspired to become and then but regardless I think really find if you think China

1285
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,263
Viator Greece

1286
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
Not really

1287
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
Take the time

1288
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,079
Understand the market

1289
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,639
Even if you your role

1290
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:44,479
Will still be the CTO but you still want to understand

1291
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
In the past

1292
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,551
18 Monticello

1293
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,391
You see a huge wave of new AI startups

1294
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:55,231
Technologist with their golden Hammer looking for problems they don't have a good

1295
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,815
End-user usage case

1296
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
Have a rita

1297
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,495
It'll get that did the order straight

1298
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,799
Identify the problem first

1299
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Stan Phillips

1300
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Solve it

1301
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,663
The other way can be

1302
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,295
As you go through this stinking and Analysis process

1303
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,367
It's also very good way to find the right people

1304
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
I would

1305
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,231
Strongly advise against to be a single founder

1306
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,791
I think having a good team is

1307
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
Half of 6

1308
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,119
Footings optimal mix initially

1309
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,399
Two or three people

1310
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
8202 i3

1311
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
I think

1312
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
And you didn't jump straight in

1313
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,615
I can buy you worked at a online advertising

1314
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
And that helped you

1315
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
2K activator

1316
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,927
Proud to have you leave for my McKenzie interview and you know it.

1317
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,255
Asia at Princeton

1318
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
I took only one class which way

1319
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
What's a high-tech

1320
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:09,215
Icy Hot by their experience veteran and that he used to teach at HBS brand we use it

1321
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
HBS case studies

1322
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
That really help

1323
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
Pet my

1324
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,127
But then

1325
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,431
I'm coming back to your question you know

1326
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,247
I joined at China not because of its technology

1327
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Because of its

1328
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
Reputation ink

1329
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,343
Marketing

1330
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Operation

1331
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,999
These are the things I know right

1332
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,071
To a Google and Valley and I know I would need

1333
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,631
If I'm going to be the CEO of a nuke

1334
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,679
That's so

1335
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,983
You are well prepared before you get this

1336
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,359
I tried jumping to the quick fire questions

1337
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,711
The first one is an entrepreneur that you admire the most and why

1338
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
Admire

1339
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
Quite a few people

1340
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,343
But if I had to pick one

1341
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
I would say Jeff Bezos

1342
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
I don't know him

1343
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Personal yet

1344
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
But I know he's a prince hello

1345
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
Which Beatle enter

1346
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
The key thing is I think

1347
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
She's better vision

1348
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,399
He started from building a lalala bookstore

1349
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
But I think she always had

1350
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
A very big

1351
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
Habesha skulduggery weather

1352
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
You don't you don't read a lot about

1353
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,871
Come come on this beach

1354
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
But you just

1355
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
Cheap

1356
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,527
Plugging away

1357
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
Once you sort of build a reputation track record

1358
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
Even

1359
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
Wall Street

1360
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,279
Kind of understand

1361
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
He swept

1362
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,679
You know the valuation of whatever it's just a sign

1363
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,239
People's confidence in Kiss approachable

1364
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
Thought that I read

1365
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,847
So I and also

1366
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
I will always

1367
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
It'll make this

1368
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:58,527
Analogy that most 99% education companies went offline

1369
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Today

1370
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
On the market

1371
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
The more of the Walmart

1372
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,487
Did the core competency is in operation efficiency

1373
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,559
Who try really hard to squeeze out maybe living profitability

1374
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
Ending

1375
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
The employee

1376
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
Large wolf

1377
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
If they throw morva

1378
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
People

1379
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
A problem

1380
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,311
But we are definitely more of an Amazon model

1381
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:26,175
In our core competency is technology part in data that's also a very end

1382
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,455
You know once we hit

1383
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
Prophet

1384
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:34,623
Trinity which we did back in this past February you have a much nice North Margin

1385
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,647
Justina

1386
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,183
The Unicorn

1387
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,975
That model

1388
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,071
Even the scale the size of the company

1389
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,607
Amazon is Stephanie

1390
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,631
Their nipples

1391
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
Traditional

1392
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,239
And then she was very hard even though they're very big already

1393
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:56,639
Exactly you know you know BB focus on the most impactful problem to solve

1394
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,711
Everything we do is we we got him out of the car that

1395
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,039
Share with us something you read recently

1396
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,831
That inspired you a lot

1397
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623

1399
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,927
Yes

1400
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,743
But if you think some of them are in Chinese people

1401
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:16,095
May not resonate and in the US but I will say you know I recently reread the

1402
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,631
Books from Ben Horowitz

1403
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167

Reading especially

1408
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,127
The first four chapters

1409
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
For me that's

1410
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
Very relaxing

1411
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
His problem

1412
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343

00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,743
At the same time yeah I'm kind of traveling and I'm putting myself in his shoes I'm traveling through time

01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,111
Tell this to my colleagues I'm like

1422
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
Look

1423
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,183
Things are never easy if you want

1424
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Make something

1425
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743

01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,895
What's a thing that you worry about

1431
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
But yes I think

1432
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
At this stage what

1433
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,295
Think about the most is

1434
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
Really

1435
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,343

01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
A reality

1443
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,583
Because I my partner tonight

Educational battle where is learning is

1446
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,775

1447
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,639
End of the first three industrial revolution steel industry

1448
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431

01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:53,951
Everything's starting

1501
01:02:54,463 --> 01:03:00,607
Really I think almost all the stars are aligned already

1502
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:05,471
That's really keeps me at all so I give as well

1503
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519

1505
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,359
One last question what is one thing you believe in

1506
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,383
And that other people

1507
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Maybe

1508
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
5 to 10 years

1509
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,807
Majority

1510
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,831

Can be augmented

1514
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,743
Buy artificial intelligence in a major way

1515
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,815
You know that the scope is definitely not limited

1516
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351

Brasa Pisco

1519
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:39,007
If that happens it could be the single most important factor to change the

1520
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,335
Inequality in access to good teachers

1521
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,639
Exactly I think technology

1522
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:50,015
Or more specifically artificial intelligence powered learning products

1523
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,831

1524
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,415
Android on very cheap smartphones

01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,975

1539
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:39,423
When I first met you almost four years ago this was when he first started

1540
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,239
The company formerly called lingojam

1541
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,335
At that time the company was busy Hangzhou just do three of them

1542
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,919
And you're still trying to encourage one of your co-founder from Google

1543
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,479
To come back and join them he's really the

1544

NLP expert

1545
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Behind The Voice

1546
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,111
I think what's really attractive about them

1547
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
Is the small door that time was

1548
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,743
You know why you was thinking about revamping or disrupting the whole Edge

1549
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,815
Sector by combining gamification

1550
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839

1551
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,399

The process and you know that's why I'm removing the ReliaCard

1556
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,615

Keisha English

1560
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,015
The mobile phone is excellent platform for the interaction

1561
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,319
And when I first took a look at the product

1562
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:32,159

01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,655

1567
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,287
That when I was talking about AI

1568
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,591

All he saw the co-founder abandon who you both have elements of

1583
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,799
I'm global

1584
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,359
You know education their pet

1585
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
Experience working overseas

1586
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,943
But being Chinese the understand

1587
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,223
You know the pin point

1588
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
That Chinese have

1589
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,295
When you're learning a new

1590
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,623
Nn

1591
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,951
And so the right complementary background Windows 10

1592
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,719
Technology

1593
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,743
Product sense

1594
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,535
Speciation

1595
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,559
4

1596
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,863
For the sudden eat and pinpointed English

1597
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,191
It is a very aggressive

1598
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,471
Yes you know

1599
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,751

1602
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
Investment

1603
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
And

1604
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
You can tell that you know why you believe

1605
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,735
He's one that

1606
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,551
Has his own views by the same time in areas where he's not

1607
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,831
Show all he doesn't mix

1608
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Experiencing

1609
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,135
100 ICP

1610
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:13,791
If it has a thousand guys to ask you out from getting input from people

1611
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
Experiencing himself

1612
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:21,471
He's not going to just say you know take what you give him but that he would

1613
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
Talk to another hundred guys

1614
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,823
And you know but when when he thinks you're right

1615
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,127
He will change very fast

1616
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,175
So I think the bed is as much

1617
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,991
I'm not just on the product on the sector but also

1618
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,295
Light Ivory vs

1619
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,391

1623
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
The investment

1624
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:48,607
Yes oh I think that over the last 4 years definitely has grown

1625
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:53,215
Pectin she was learning how to hire

1626
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,751
When to fire

1627
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:00,127
How to incentivize I think over the last four years a definitely is getting a lot more experienced having

1628
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,151
Sinemet so many

1629
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,455
A people so as a CEO I think

1630
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
This

1631
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:08,575
This critical right assessing a hiring the right management team my thing is done.

1632
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:12,927

1635
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,815
I'll most recent hire

1636
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,863
Is in our view a super CFO

1637
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,655
Always part of the GTA V ghost

1638
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,983
System that he managed to convince her

1639
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,287
To come out retirement to join him

1640
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,591
Together you know in this in this group

1641
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,151
Going forward so I think that's one

1642
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Learning

1643
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,199
Managing

1644
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Finding the right tile

1645
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,551
And then the second part that is really matured

1646
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,111
Really focusing saying no

1647
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:48,255
In this new category with Education Plus AI

1648
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,535

1649
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
Target key to 12

1650
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,167
You can also change the product from learning English to learning Chinese

1651
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,983
You can learn Japanese in Korean

1652
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Self-deception

1653
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,031
Very flexible

1654
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,335
But knowing when to do what I think

1655
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Important

1656
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,127
And so he has

1657
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,943
Oso buddy Years love to say no

1658
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
The Cara project

1659
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
To leave them for later

1660
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,063
To develop and and really focus on

1661
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,087
What's call

1662
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:17,183
On which right now is the China market for English learning for adults

1663
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,231
We may go up and down each group

1664
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,279
But I think that China by itself

1665
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
Extremely picky

1666
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
So we should take out

1667
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,679
You know we do have all the building blocks in the back end

1668
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,447
Technology

1669
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,983
260 engine to mod

1670
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
Multiple languages

1671
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,287
Even when they decide to

1672
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
I think on that front

1673
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:38,431
It so it's never easy for you to say no to things

1674
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Billy Merchant

1675
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
DC the product be able to

1676
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,599
Teach other subject matters besides languages down the road

1677
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:49,183
Well I think the way the engine is here for is

1678
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,975
Spec sheet for language right now

1679
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,279
Oh my thing to go from language to

1680
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,351
The teachings of physics and chemistry and math is a little hard

1681
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,399
Show up a little bit more far off

1682
