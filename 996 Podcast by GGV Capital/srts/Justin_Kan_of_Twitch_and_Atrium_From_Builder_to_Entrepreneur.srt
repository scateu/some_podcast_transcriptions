Welcome to the show Justin

93
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Thanks for having me guys

94
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
I am

95
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Excited

96
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
So I start with live streaming

97
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,688
I think your ears sort of the original livestream ru

98
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,272
What make holiday in 2007 you and your partner started

99
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,112
Justin. TV or 24/7 live video feed off your life

100
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
Broadcast via webcam attached to your head

101
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,024
And your lack housing lost about eight months in a trifle out of attention

102
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,400
So what inspired you to broadcast your live at a time when this concept didn't even exist

103
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
It was just a crazy idea

104
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
A random

105
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,616
Pretty bad idea actually at the time although I think we're onto a nugget of something popular

106
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,944
Yo Justin.tv was before Twitter or in

107
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,016
Instagram or Facebook being you know popular

108
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
That it was before

109
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
The Kardashians

110
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
Yeah there was before Instagram celebrity so

111
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
The result is a bachelor and that kind of show

112
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
Yeah there was a reality but there was no like

113
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
Real reality like

114
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
I'm taking you along on my life and we thought

115
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
That would be interesting

116
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
Tried taking someone Along on this

117
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Journey of your life

118
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Could be interesting and then

119
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
The attention could make somebody a celebrity

120
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Unfortunately

121
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
I am not very entertaining

122
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,736
Until I was a very poor Teske's right you know we should have gotten

123
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
Probably someone was more of an actor played some more attractive than me maybe someone

124
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
The musician

125
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,512
Some with some talents but instead when people came to Justin TV which was a 24/7

126
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Live show about

127
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Myself and my co-founders

128
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
They saw four guys sitting in apartment

129
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,727
Programming

130
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:32,127
Did you change my name to do more like entertainment stuff but it really fell back into like mostly trying to keep our website up

131
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
And so

132
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Literally

133
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
Programming is not interesting

134
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Watch it cuz

135
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Watching someone

136
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,463
Program it looks a lot like watching someone write an essay or watching someone

137
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Yeah like

138
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,863
Budget YouTube video play video game play Starcraft so it was entertaining right the video of the person itself

139
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Was not that into

140
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
We tried to run around the city

141
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,031
Unfortunately there's a lot of downtime technology wasn't quite there yet it was like right on the border

142
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
There's no iPhone

143
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
We tried to launch it so it was the end of it so fast

144
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
A mobile internet connection so actually

145
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,759
We headed Upstream together multiple modems

146
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
From a different providers

147
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Under one computer and then

148
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Sending the video

149
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
Multiplexing it over multiple

150
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Cell phone connect

151
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
And that's how we

152
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
I were able to create this life

153
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Extreme back in 2000

154
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
What was the phone

155
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
The first thing that

156
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
What was the first product Market fit.

157
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,799
Right so what happened was we launched the show and we thought we were like so cool

158
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Bunch of people came because of

159
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
They thought

160
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
This is like a real life

161
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
Truman Show at HEB

162
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
Udo now of course it would be so we're back that before like why do you want to put video on the internet tonight Cavalier life that is soup

163
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Super weird

164
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,671
So is this big media phenomenon and then we got interviewed by the

165
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Today Show on MTV

166
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,559
People, that you're on a computer like this boring

167
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
What are you doing

168
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,959
And then luckily they would come and they would ask us like how are you making a livestream on the internet presence is not

169
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Technology that existed

170
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,823
So we built a platform like YouTube for live video

171
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
And that

172
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Is one we would want that about

173
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
6 months later

174
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
You know we had a lot to show and then

175
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
That's when it really took off

176
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
That's the product I used

177
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,391
Right see how they use that TV back then right

178
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
A lot of people thought I was just

179
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
In TV live

180
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,351
But no is named after a guy found out that way

181
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
Yourself

182
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
It was going to go out and become so big

183
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
Launch a whole category or

184
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Did you just do it for

185
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
Okay so for the show itself

186
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
We thought

187
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,295
They could be a crazy idea maybe we'll be back who knows you have no idea how big it would be

188
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
But for the site

189
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
YouTube for live video

190
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,255
We thought that could be big I mean YouTube had already sold for in a 1.6 or 1.7 billion dollars you like that. So

191
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
There was an idea that video online could be valuable

192
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Rights

193
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
So it wasn't that

194
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
Sweet. It to be applied

195
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,751
Yeah couple years we were like 20 million Mau

196
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
All that popcorn

197
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,711
Can you tell us a story of how twitch became a spin-off of Justin. TV

198
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
Shirt so you don't fast for Leo

199
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
October 2007

200
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
You know her Ray and technically it was

201
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,463
A pretty big achievement for us because we had figured out how to you

202
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,583
Nothing worth back then the flash media server like tinworth like streaming was very much more difficult

203
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
Do I install plug-in stuff like that

204
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
As we watch this site

205
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Atlantic

206
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
Cut cigar for the next couple years between 2000

207
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
Ana 2007

208
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
Do the early 2008 all the way through

209
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Hot rod 2010

210
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
It done really well and

211
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,991
Celebrity started live streaming there is other content on your people like

212
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
Also different content Sports entertainment

213
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
Talk shows

214
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
And

215
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Then it just stopped growing

216
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Because it turns out

217
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,463
Actually not all content is

218
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,607
Good life only a very few kinds of content are good lighting most content you want is like a VOD rather video

219
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,215
So then we were like we need to figure something out because anything that's not growing on the Internet is

220
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Is about to fall off a cliff

221
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Breaks the internet

222
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
So we decided

223
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Okay let's

224
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
Go back to the drawing board and figure out something that we think we can invest in that could

225
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Potentially be

226
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Bigger than what we have right now

227
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,599
And so we looked at what we're doing and there were a couple ideas we had one was around mobile video

228
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
I like Periscope actually but

229
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
Several years earlier than her scope

230
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
4 years earlier

231
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
And then

232
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
The other was

233
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
The gaming channel there was like a small gaming

234
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
Section right on our site like

235
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
3% of the sideways people watching other people play video game

236
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
And we were like

237
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Why are people doing this

238
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
Actually be interesting thing was back when we had our own show

239
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
3 years earlier

240
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Maybe three and a half years earlier

241
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
We had plugged in at one point I remember I was

242
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Reminder to this

243
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
But my friend Steve Hopper

244
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
When is a co-founder Reddit

245
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Steve and I have been hanging out

246
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
You know the early days of the showing

247
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Plugged in the camera

248
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
We like an analog cameras we have to plug it into the Xbox

249
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
And we were like broadcasting ourselves playing Xbox

250
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Locksmith and people like that

251
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
Unfortunately we didn't figure it out until like way later

252
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
But you know back then mm

253
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
10 what happened with people start streaming

254
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Gaming content and we

255
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
Decided let's go with this

256
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
And try to make this a thing

257
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
We think this can be bigger than

258
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Existing site

259
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,271
Because it seemed like engagement was high one of my co-founders

260
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Emmett is the

261
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
See your Twitch today really thought

262
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
This could be something it was

263
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Is the temperature

264
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
If you liked

265
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
And so

266
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Weed

267
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
Decided to build stops him around it

268
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Focusing on the product

269
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
What's your address again that

270
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
And so

271
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Long story short after about

272
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,471
Six months of working on it we said hey is really working

273
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
It's called the Jets

274
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
TV gaming

275
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Channel 11 weather

276
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Change name in twitch

277
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
And then wash it as a

278
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
So excited that

279
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
I just start taking off

280
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
Put was the

281
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Rite soda

282
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
We were debating on the name

283
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
I remember I really like

284
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,439
Some like four letter acronym no smell like ESPN right hardwood pad like X

285
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Rge

286
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
TV or something like that

287
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
How do you remember what it was actually

288
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
And it would like

289
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
There's absolutely no way we're going to do that and then he had

290
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
This idea of calling it

291
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Zarf

292
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
What is X x a r t h

293
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
On the way

294
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
Your purchase of a lightning rod for like

295
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Couple thousand dollars

296
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
And then

297
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
That was the name of the place holder name

298
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,295
Without the process secret project name or whatever is Rita's on the signs up and sew

299
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
He's going to call it.

300
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
And then

301
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
A few days

302
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Before launch

303
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
He found

304
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
The site

305
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Twitch.tv

306
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,327
And he was like the twitch like I like fast twitch muscles you know twitch nip

307
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,887
Sounded like gaming like any other like we going with switch

308
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Dell at that point

309
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
Everyone had argued so much I think

310
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
You just like

311
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,871
Okay what am I whenever you want how are you making money for your

312
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Original live

313
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Streaming products

314
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
Yeah so the original Justin.tv was very advertising

315
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
Supported and it was all

316
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
Got pre-rolls the wheels had this cool thing that were like

317
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
Midrolls that the broadcaster could trigger

318
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
So if you were doing Up Your Life podcast

319
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
Something to take a bathroom break

320
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
The trigger advertisement

321
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
And I go to the bathroom

322
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Bryson tiller

323
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
We thought that was like

324
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
What is a huge innovation

325
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Which was at the time actually

326
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
And

327
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
Install thing today at twitch

328
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
But not true

329
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Which is more more kind of like the

330
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Eaton sites like the Chinese

331
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
User donations is

332
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Virtual Goods

333
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
You guys have for co-founders

334
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
That's right

335
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Oracle founder

336
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Ryan to how do you figure out how to make this a

337
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
That's a great question

338
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
We made decisions incredibly poorly

339
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,607
That sounds like a joke but it's not a joke that sounds like a joke but it

340
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
It's really not a joke

341
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
The funny thing is that you

342
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Probably lots of talk about an hour

343
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Affected

344
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,103
Mike subsequent companies or like Atrium today we had a lot of co-founders but

345
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
Back then we didn't know anything I mean you're talking about

346
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
These are for 22 year old guys

347
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
Who started the company when they let you know

348
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,111
We didn't we didn't know anything about me

349
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
Nobody had ever work at a real job.

350
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
Michael

351
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Who was the first

352
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
CEO had actually worked at a job but it was a political campaign and you can imagine that they don't have the

353
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
Best management structure or training right Sophia for guys and we got together and

354
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
We were just like okay what we made all the important Decisions by arguing

355
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Who is

356
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
It was a CTO Kyle was the VP engineering

357
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,783
Michael was the CEO and I was the like I had a product basically that she

358
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Product officer

359
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
But

360
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
We kind of made every important

361
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Decision together

362
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
That is

363
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Not a good way to do things you need to trust

364
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
I need to delegate

365
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
People have the right

366
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,143
But we didn't do that because I think we didn't really figure out how to

367
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
Do that until we really pivoted

368
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Twitch

369
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
And we also incubated this other project also can we couldn't even decide what to do. We don't want to put it on Friday we put it into two things

370
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Socialcam

371
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
And which eventually spun out we sold it

372
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
Do Autodesk

373
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
460 million dollars

374
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,671
But that is a defies All Odds for type of thing right through all the mistakes you made

375
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
I mean

376
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Two of them but

377
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
This is not a good way to run things everybody going off on their own in order to

378
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
Have their own domain right

379
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
Which is sad because I think we were right inside a lot of

380
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
Always great team but it's not sad because everybody is well and

381
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
Cobra Kai lined up starting a company with my brother yeah

382
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Cruise automation that

383
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
Is doing self-driving cars and

384
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
I met him before

385
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,327
Was a bit too early for like little cows interesting

386
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
But that they were too smart for her own good that's amazing

387
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
That's amazing

388
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Seoul Sausage

389
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
And then you don't I don't know if you saw that

390
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
2 billion dollars Airsoft

391
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
EXO incredible story

392
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,247
So truly there was a lot of talent and is one organization town

393
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
But

394
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
Took a little time to mature

395
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Right until like leadership I would

396
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,023
So why why did you still have so many co-founders before your current company if that didn't work out before

397
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
It did work out

398
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
It didn't work out but now I have there's a lot more

399
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Delegation and ownership of specific role soap

400
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Yeah we've co-founders

401
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
2ct oval hazard

402
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
I'd like to really in charge attack I'm not like

403
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Micromanagement

404
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Do this technical

405
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Decision of this product

406
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
We are co-founders in charge of the legal side

407
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Really in charge of the legal I'm not

408
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
I don't actually even know

409
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
Certain things about our legal like who our clients are not managing at that level

410
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
It's much more about

411
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Creating

412
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,815
Actual metrics of accountability and then say hey go get these metrics right and I'm going to trust and I'm going to give feedback on the resource to you

413
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
If you need feedback on your plan

414
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
But I'm going to trust

415
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
That you are handling this

416
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Domain

417
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
Same goes where are we have a co-founder of the operation side and then one

418
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Also out on the market

419
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Tell me more detail

420
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Still on Twitch I know immensely CEO

421
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
When you guys

422
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Decide to sell the comfy

423
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Looking Back in Time

424
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Is amazing

425
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Did you ever look back

426
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
And look at how

427
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,999
The sectors involving China and however Trident becomes

428
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
Great way to monetize

429
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
Did you ever think about how

430
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
The site could have been more

431
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
Then what it is today so I'll tell you two things

432
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Suicide obviously could

433
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Be more in as

434
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Become more ripe

435
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Because when we sold it we were 55 million Mau

436
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
And does a lot

437
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Mike's butt

438
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
At the same time

439
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
At that level it was very hard for us to raise capital

440
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Because you know most of the time

441
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Did not understand

442
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,879
If we had talked to more probably Chinese investors actually they would have understood it

443
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
And in fact we had money from

444
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
Chinese

445
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,815
But comparative Sandhill investors you know they did not understand

446
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,143
This industry one year later they they're all work investing

447
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Any sports or whatever

448
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
Nobody nobody understood it so we thought

449
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
970 million dollars

450
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Tremendous amount

451
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,663
Because earlier that you're actually about a month ago I tried to

452
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Sell some secondary for

453
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
At 200 million

454
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Got a lot of decline

455
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
So we thought it was

456
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Really good

457
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
And then afterwards obviously it's become a much

458
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
Greater success since that right so

459
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
In the year following

460
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
The acquisition all the metrics doubled

461
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,399
The company is like gone too and I never released I don't think very much recently answers are metrics

462
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
The company has gone to you

463
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Almost 1500

464
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
People I believe

465
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Now it's

466
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
San Francisco you know they're opening up there all night

467
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Story building

468
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
It's like a tremendous

469
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Success

470
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
And I was just looking at

471
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Alexa

472
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
The first time in years

473
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
Number 12 website in America

474
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
So

475
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,343
Obviously there was a lot of Headroom unfortunately I don't think we were able to

476
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Really convinced

477
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Capital sources

478
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
The funding isn't

479
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Independent company

480
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,303
But you know you can't be too sorry about that one interesting conversation we're having a remember during that process

481
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
Selling in 2014 over the summer

482
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
I'd like a conference call on all the board members

483
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,519
And everybody was like yes cell right now I think we should sell this is a great deal

484
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
And I remember

485
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,151
One of our board members Chris Pike formerly of driving now doing his own

486
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Rumors

487
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
He was like no don't sell

488
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
I remember

489
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
We were all silent

490
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,111
On the call and I was like

491
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Why

492
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
What do you think it could be worse

493
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,071
You don't because you think that this Market as like not that big of a market or maybe not

494
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
We don't know but you know it

495
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
How big could it be

496
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,215
And he was like I don't know 3/4 billion more

497
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
Everybody was just kind of like are you not Island they're just wanted to be like you were crazy

498
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
You are crazy but everyone was just

499
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,991
Everyone was just silent on the call and

500
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
And then we just start talking about something you know when you're out

501
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,303
I hope he listens to this I mean he was the only one who is right

502
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
Like oh we should be

503
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
It was fun though such an amazing adventure

504
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,895
Investor duties investor on my colleague was on the board of why

505
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Yesterday was a

506
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Game

507
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Commenting

508
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Site back in 2000

509
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Insects

510
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
And today is a 10 billion dollar

511
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Mobile video

512
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Site for gamers

513
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
And it's just a

514
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Fitness spinner

515
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Something that's live streaming

516
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
For gaming

517
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
Dollar

518
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
Martin cab company in Baltimore

519
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
It's hard imagine

520
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
In 2006 that

521
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
For 8

522
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
As a game commenting site

523
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
It's like $39

524
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Yeah and it's

525
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
I just so hard to believe by then.

526
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Could be a mainstream

527
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
You can see today that

528
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
You could be bigger than

529
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Most of the sports

530
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
Absolutely

531
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Because everyone's playing video games

532
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
Scott there everyone's playing video games

533
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Everyone is

534
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,071
My dog biting her daughter's on all the time she spent a lot more time on gaming then

535
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
I overdid on Sports when I was

536
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Courage

537
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
Don't you see the time spent it just

538
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Almost number one activity

539
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
For kids

540
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
Yeah that's probably not good but this could be a good programmer

541
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,479
Designer later

542
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,879
This is maybe there's something analytical writing to get gaming helps with the analytical reasoning and stuff like that so you know I definitely think it

543
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
For me when I was

544
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
The kid

545
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,767
Yeah teamwork there is a hardcore gamer

546
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,375
I was probably I was playing Counter-Strike and World of Warcraft when I went in Warcraft

547
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
3 when I was in college

548
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,983
Probably spent a little bit too much time playing

549
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639
We still going to yell so give me all about yeah that was once I got it so I can do whatever

550
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,503
Drywall I can play these games you don't like I'm just exactly

551
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
So it was a

552
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
I actually did lose a lot of time

553
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
Two-player games

554
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
Justin.tv actually went down a lot cuz

555
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
I don't know what you know

556
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
I'm sure you guys expresses like it's

557
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Business

558
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
End and start of

559
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
So interesting it's kind of like its own game

560
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,423
Yeah very stressful horrible game to play sometimes but but

561
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,287
What was they like to sell a company to Amazon

562
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
What was that process

563
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
Dislike for you

564
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
Well I didn't really do mosto

565
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
The work is that it by the time it's 2 Cor

566
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Just on the board

567
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
And

568
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
I think for them is very stressful for any acquisition process

569
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,879
Is very stressful but I think he's like one of that

570
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
Actually most dis

571
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Upland in Silicon Valley

572
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Yeah I think a lot of other

573
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Companies

574
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Bigot

575
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Caught up

576
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Hype you know they're like

577
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
They get really caught up in like

578
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
We need this for strategic reasons

579
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Getting Amazon out of all the

580
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Companies

581
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
I kind of seen or like

582
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Investments were sold whatever

583
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
He's like the most

584
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Discipline

585
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Mean that they won't overpay

586
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,512
Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp because it works out it's a lot bigger

587
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Yelp

588
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,632
Yeah absolutely I think that it doesn't matter how much you pay

589
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
There's two types of

590
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Companies that are like

591
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Good

592
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
And the ones that are like true least

593
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Strategic

594
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
A10 like

595
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,360
Nnn Visionary right there making his Visionary bats

596
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
Google Facebook

597
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,712
And then there's like the type that are more like

598
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Really

599
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:46,112
Disappointed

600
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
I think the people who'll really

601
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
Drug are the ones in the middle

602
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
Our kind of half and half

603
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Ana de Luz

604
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,376
Important deals because they were too tight or or they are

605
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Exactly

606
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,192
I forget that we're at

607
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
About 3 billion

608
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Internet users worldwide now

609
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
If something does work

610
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
You will be my

611
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
And if it doesn't

612
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
It doesn't matter how much you pay cuz you wasted already

613
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Mimosa glasses

614
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
Absolutely riding the world

615
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,600
Biggest wave. Right so

616
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:24,000
So report last year found that there is now a bigger audience for game video than audiences of HBO Netflix yes

617
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
ESPN Hulu combine

618
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Which is kind of

619
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Crazy to think about it

620
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
Did you imagine this will happen or were you surprised

621
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
Game streaming took off

622
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
I think we were so

623
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,800
Surprised how fast

624
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
Was growing the game streaming

625
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
In the early years

626
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
I doesn't surprise me though because I mean

627
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,968
Back in 2007 the gaming addict

628
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Mystery past

629
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
The movie industry

630
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
I don't know if you remember that but that was like a big thing

631
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
People like

632
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
All these like entertainment people

633
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
We're like what the f*** you didn't like nobody saw that coming

634
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,536
Okay well you know when you do MTV Cribs

635
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,424
You see like every athlete has an Xbox Aerosmith that makes sense to me and so

636
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:10,592
Exactly so so I just I think it was pretty obvious that gaming videos going to be a huge thing it is already the number to category on

637
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
On YouTube by the time I started to itch and then like

638
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,968
One or two years and it was like the number one category on YouTube

639
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
It was not a big surprise

640
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
It's actually wouldn't be surprised if it

641
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
You know that it wouldn't happen early

642
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
In China

643
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
Gaming was already the number one monetization

644
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
Method

645
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
Big Commerce

646
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,960
Shut down in that he's both of those turning out games and then pissing got into it

647
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
10 years later you see tencent everywhere

648
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
From riot games

649
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Still for that

650
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
Amazing

651
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
See how big a

652
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,368
So what was it like to have this whole start of Journey as an Asian-American ihoa where were you

653
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
You off your identity and did that

654
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
Change things for you anyway

655
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
That's a good question

656
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
Seattle

657
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Speak Chinese at home

658
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Bhai Most Wanted

659
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
School I want to price my private school

660
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
High School

661
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Mostly white white kid

662
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
University Preparatory Academy

663
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,456
So I didn't feel I never like really thought that much about like identity

664
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
And like it

665
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Ethnic identity

666
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
And then

667
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
In Silicon Valley

668
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,160
Adele uddo I will head that join the Chinese American students

669
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
Association are like the club

670
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
And

671
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Uibe school

672
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
But I think is a little bit different from like a lot of people grow up in

673
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
In California the Bay Area

674
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Something wear this like a lot

675
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,472
33% of something Asian-American

676
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Chinese

677
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
And so

678
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
I think is a little different

679
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,616
In the industry I didn't think that there were

680
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
It didn't feel like

681
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,480
You know with my YC Network or whatever that there were like not that many

682
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,296
Asian American Founders although I think actually if you look at assets

683
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
Statistically there was that message

684
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
Translate 10% to Wifey but it felt like it was like 30% of icma or something like that so

685
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
Whatever I did I didn't I didn't believe

686
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Feel like it

687
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Change things very much

688
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
Stop motion first reaction

689
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
When you went to China

690
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,728
Well so the for the last time I went to China

691
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
It was

692
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
2002

693
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
So when I went to China 2000

694
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
About to open the

695
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
The biggest damn right

696
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,784
The Three Gorges Dam and I was I was like did the cruise down the thing and it was like rule

697
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
I was like China is like

698
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
Best farming world

699
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
Super early and then I went back last

700
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,256
Year in December or not last year 2016

701
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
Oh my God oh my God this is crazy

702
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
This is different world altogether

703
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,544
And I feel that way a little bit because I'm not taking that many frequent trips to Asia

704
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,104
Probably going once a year but two different place you know so I'll go

705
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
To Jakarta or

706
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
Singapore

707
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Singapore

708
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
And

709
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,552
It's amazing how all these places are I'd like

710
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Garufa structure than America

711
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
Better

712
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
Play taller building Saigon more buildings like

713
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
It's crazy

714
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Worst traffic

715
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,792
But yeah they like world's changed so much

716
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
I think it's super interesting

717
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,888
What's the climate nature were better at removing

718
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
London when throwing knives

719
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,800
Tokyo went through 1960s it'll get better but it takes.

720
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
It's all blown away

721
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
And

722
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
Blown away also by the work ethic

723
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
Can an innovation that's happening in anyone

724
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
Yeah I think it's pretty obvious now I guess

725
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
2016 I think

726
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
People

727
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
There's a little bit of questions but like

728
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
If you came to America

729
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
14

730
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
And that's one like a lot of

731
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Chinese investors start investing in

732
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,352
In Silicon Valley

733
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,424
Like what what is this money coming from what's going on or whatever

734
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,264
But if you told you as an investors are founders like The Innovation design

735
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
Play coming in from China

736
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Feel so you got me

737
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Yeah exactly

738
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
You got to be kidding me now

739
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
You see obviously like the dockless

740
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
Transportation models

741
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Coming here

742
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,808
You don't like a lot of innovation is happening in in

743
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,344
In China is just so much

744
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Like I didn't

745
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Kind of balance of innovation to shift

746
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Pretty rapidly

747
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
Should be pretty scary if you are

748
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
An American

749
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,864
You know who is Patriot and you should be a little scared

750
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
At the same time you know we're making it

751
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
We will be taking a lot of things for Grant

752
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
I think we take like immigration of skilled

753
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
Labor rate for Grants

754
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
Like we should be trying to

755
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Get every single

756
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
Engineer from around the world

757
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,456
Want to live here to stay here

758
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,528
We should be giving taco

759
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Exactly

760
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,952
You know because we're talking about you just look at the numbers right the bell curves of the populations might look the same but China's 1.3 billion people Americas

761
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
339

762
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
It's just not competitive

763
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Numbers

764
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Stem glass

765
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
Sierra 4.7 billion for China

766
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,888
Mm

767
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
2004 us

768
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
Arby's quality matters

769
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
But over there

770
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
You people are

771
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Smart

772
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Twice as hard

773
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
And they're a lot more of them

774
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Yeah exactly

775
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
You don't have to be a math major to draw the

776
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
Rest of the Curves in like where they Henderson

777
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
And so

778
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
I don't know I just feel like

779
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Real people are going to be very surprised at how fast

780
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
It happens

781
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Especially like

782
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Kind of global balance

783
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
What's the power

784
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
Couple things one

785
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,352
Competition is good

786
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
When there is real competition

787
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
That's when did the true color comes out

788
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
Do you read one of them from computer and get better

789
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
What do you want to sit around and bitching try to keep him down

790
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Decision

791
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
We as a country

792
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
The US has

793
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Secondly is at

794
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
You look at

795
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
The way that chainsaw to start it it's very

796
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,856
They tried to turn it into a math problem when steering pump

797
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
What is angle

798
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Where we at

799
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,672
How to go from A to B

800
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
Took the time it takes to scale is actually faster in China

801
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Cody Vine

802
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
They'll probably got start with Justin

803
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
TV and twitch

804
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
Products made in China

805
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Got something

806
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
Is malama creative

807
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
Did anything could happen but takes bottle

808
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Absolutely

809
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
I think this

810
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Your merits about siding

811
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
And you probably want to figure out ways that you can go by and

812
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,856
I want to do this podcast review as the first

813
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
Chinese americans on the show

814
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,256
Is to share more of different ways to scale to come up with her

815
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
That problem

816
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Does 2 2 2 solve

817
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
How to get the right part of my

818
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Youfit

819
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
So that both sides can learn from each other

820
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
Equivalent faster

821
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Compost sites

822
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,360
Absolutely but I mean even if you think about

823
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,432
You can even say you know this I think a lot of the criticism

824
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
But I started

825
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
Insulting value back in 2006

826
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,320
Throwing up 2010 what's their mm

827
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
12 is like

828
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
What Chinese

829
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Just cloning every

830
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Nothing right

831
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,976
Even if you think and now I think people are clearly like oh that's not

832
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
That's not the only thing I like

833
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,192
But even if you think that Chinese people because culturally or whatever are less was taking with less innovative

834
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,544
They're still four times as many people so you could be 1/4 as in

835
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,944
Yeah like there to be like

836
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,064
American person right and then you would still be competitive

837
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
Yunnan people should think about

838
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
How do

839
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
Grow from someone who's very creative and

840
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,768
Corn like hacking culture in

841
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,840
Just trying to build things into a manager or

842
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
Someone who can run a t

843
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
You want to company

844
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
That's a really good question I mean

845
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
When I was young

846
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
I felt like

847
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Experience was like worth

848
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,456
And I ain't know I was like oh we can just rethink you know because Silicon Valley has his mrs. Legend of like

849
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:49,088
Are we just get a bunch of young people smarter than people smart young people locked in their sleeping in like a

850
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,488
10 in their living room and I just like make some immigrants

851
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
Exactly but

852
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
But the reality is

853
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:06,496
Like there's a lot of you look great example look at like the scaling on Twitter like you know this growth is massively stunted by like the down

854
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Downtime in life

855
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,312
You know what for years and years

856
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
And

857
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
What I realized overtime getting expenses hey

858
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
Expresscopy really value

859
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,992
Brightest restaurant management stuff we don't have to

860
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Insulted the thing that people

861
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,832
I think that I didn't realize when I was younger was

862
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,952
Silicon Valley I thought you had to rethink everything or like rebuild everything from Fresh Prince

863
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Even if

864
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
Elon Musk

865
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Mostly

866
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,936
You just need to innovate on one or two things really well and get a 10x on one or two axes for any of the rest of stuff you should just do

867
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:41,312
Do the best practice whatever whatever they did at Google or Facebook or whatever

868
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah you don't have to innovate

869
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,736
On your on your recruiting just need to do the bat like the top level or what

870
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
Right front, and so

871
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,880
I feel like that's something that I didn't really realize it's like you can hire

872
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
People who have it

873
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Experience

874
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
And bring them in to do

875
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,488
2 x 100

876
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
Nmd do that at which actually

877
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Years later eye twitch

878
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
You don't 6 years later I'm sorry

879
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
We brought in guys like

880
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
This is Jonathan

881
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Had built

882
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Eyes are Ciara like

883
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
And

884
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,664
He had built gaming ad sales teams before for IGN is a co-founder by genright

885
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
So he knew what to do and he just

886
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
Plug-and-play boom calorie high

887
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,040
Sales team and then Saran Wrap

888
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,368
We started learning how you can hire these like

889
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Leaders who have

890
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
Experience who could ask

891
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,976
Cute and I think that's a big thing to realize

892
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Just like

893
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
If you're young

894
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
You might have like really fresh

895
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Innovative ideas that changed culture

896
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424
But you can have other people have more experience help you exit

897
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
It's kind of figured that one out early and be able

898
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,080
I don't know

899
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
And if you figure out early that's how you be

900
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
Become super powerful right like that's how you become like

901
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
Evan from Snapchat

902
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Hours Aqua

903
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
Oh yeah that most people like

904
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
Think they struggle with it and then

905
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
They get like a middle out

906
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,488
You've seen and advised Hunters of startups

907
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:07,328
What's the most common mistake that you see in Founders and what do tell them

908
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
Most common mistake

909
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
ICN Founders I mean number one

910
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Is probably

911
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
The not focused enough

912
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,568
You know I think that companies always need to focus as much as possible

913
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
I think that's

914
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,944
Super hard to do I understand the Temptation I'm always tempted to like go as bright as possible

915
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
I think think Focus

916
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
This is really important

917
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Second thing is probably

918
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
Give up on him way too easily

919
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Yosemite now that starts I like

920
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
In fashion

921
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,976
A job you know that kind of a career

922
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
The people try it

923
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
Anime just give up after a year whatever

924
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
Go to something else

925
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Exactly

926
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
How you know I don't think that great companies are made that way

927
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
Does almost everybody there oportun

928
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Too high

929
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,432
Yes but in the Bay Area are insane to drop

930
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Maybe High

931
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Maybe actually High

932
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
Other mistakes that people make

933
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
It depends

934
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,880
Transamerica company you want and how much

935
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
Risk you're willing to take

936
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,720
But a lot of people want something is working

937
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
They go too slow

938
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,584
Yeah they don't hire the best exactly can you help

939
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,192
Open scale they don't even mention earlier to let go of things

940
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,008
They're scared to overspend you know which

941
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
Is reasonable in some ways

942
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,080
But it also can limit

943
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
Your growth

944
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,176
I notice a lot of Thunders underestimate

945
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
How important

946
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
What is to have

947
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,784
Their Drive their passion

948
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
To be like guiding

949
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
For some culture

950
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
In the front

951
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
That was moonrise a heart

952
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Experienced

953
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
Their PCS were replaced on

954
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
What's up

955
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Bike sprints

956
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
And what a lot

957
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
People see us Farmers don't know is a

958
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,888
Yocan Hive experienced hires but they would never have the vision

959
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
The passion YouTube

960
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
200 Expendables

961
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
So if you just focus on doing that well

962
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Pushing me

963
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,848
Circles you higher

964
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Absolute

965
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,992
Like you must learn to manage right and you must learn the scale because

966
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
You can't

967
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,576
Very quickly after your team is probably more than 5 feet

968
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
People the marginal effort of your work

969
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
York direct individual contributor work like

970
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,744
You programming you doing sales whatever it is

971
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Is very low-light is like

972
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,608
Now it's like 20% of the company or five people anything above that

973
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
If you're up you have a tick team of 25 people

974
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
Is 4%

975
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,752
And so you can spend your time on like

976
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,592
Like if it's all of your effort in the entire year is 4% of a

977
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
The company if you just spend

978
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Your time affect

979
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,248
Can people's work on if you only have to make people more than 4% more productive

980
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Superior management

981
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
In order to like

982
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Equal your

983
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,160
You don't know how much individual contributor work either you've needed doing lights

984
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
So your ability to manage people is your Leverage

985
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
And I think

986
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
People go into that mode

987
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Slowly

988
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
Repentance something works

989
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
Should we move on to talk about

990
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
Atrium which is your

991
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Current temperature

992
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
Italians more about what

993
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
The company does

994
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,080
Short story trim came from my problems mites

995
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
Experiences as a founder

996
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
Elwood Leo

997
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:07,296
And I was a power user why I should say as an involuntary power Reserve corporate Legal Services

998
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,392
It always spend money every time you want to do any major business transaction in America

999
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,768
You pay lawyers right and so for when you're raising funds if you're doing m&a and we did Big Amedeo

1000
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
Litigation

1001
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
All of this

1002
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
You need to hire lawyers and I loved

1003
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
The lawyers that I had who

1004
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Basically give me expert advice

1005
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
Based on their extra knowledge

1006
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,264
But there are a lot of experience

1007
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
This is where I felt like it

1008
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
Cookie cutters.

1009
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Turn it crank turning work

1010
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
And I was like why are they using more software to deliver certain automated

1011
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
But to automate things

1012
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
To streamline the flow of information

1013
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,600
I leave Law Firms out there they don't even in America you know they don't even use

1014
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,136
Project management soft

1015
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
You know they don't use

1016
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
Like Trello or Asana

1017
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
They don't use

1018
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,816
CRM software for their clients and I sat down with an attorney

1019
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
And I've been a client of their firm for

1020
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
6 years

1021
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
Which Wich

1022
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
She didn't even know who you are

1023
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,008
Yeah so that's weird because this is a 700 million dollar year business

1024
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,336
And you didn't even know that you know I was at client like that's

1025
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
That's weird

1026
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
Because the level of

1027
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Professionalism

1028
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,480
Enterprise sales organization is just not there but

1029
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,880
There's a bunch of reasons in that that the industry's like that I don't need to go into those reasons but our goal with atrium

1030
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Was to

1031
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
Archie's Island

1032
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
And we're making it better for founders

1033
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
We're making it better for

1034
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
Attorneys in Pearland

1035
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
By making it so that

1036
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
Basically we want to make

1037
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
Regal streamlined

1038
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
Effective is like we re

1039
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Are top-tier

1040
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
Technology-enabled Law Firm

1041
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,104
That delivers legal services to Founders

1042
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,664
And we make it streamlined make it faster

1043
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Making more transparent

1044
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Are we making

1045
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Pricing much more

1046
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,784
A front right so you can know what you're going to pay

1047
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,088
I left for our attorneys and paralegals

1048
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Our goal is to make things

1049
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,416
Easier for them

1050
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
To automate all the lights

1051
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
Low-level work so they can focus on the high-level advisor

1052
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,864
Which is what people want to do right you didn't go to law school

1053
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
To like crank out

1054
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Signature maker

1055
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,448
But bite or two like

1056
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
Put together the first version of like a boilerplate.

1057
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
And on top of that

1058
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
The Lord is Noah cappe

1059
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Every time you do a fundraiser

1060
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
You can wait

1061
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,224
For sure to be secure yes unit stuff

1062
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,528
But I need a Theodora snow

1063
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
Exactly what's going on

1064
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,088
Pilot superpower

1065
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,136
You can imagine other services

1066
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Rendered

1067
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
Absolutely absolutely so

1068
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
What we're doing is really think about that

1069
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,352
That we were building as a platform where we take

1070
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Legal

1071
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
Structured data

1072
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
And then we'd like me

1073
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
You know so we can for example

1074
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
Understand

1075
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,336
Who is the owners of your company and then

1076
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
There we can do things like

1077
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Reduce

1078
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Android

1079
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,736
I'm or we can make that accept data accessible in other ways back

1080
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
That's why I think that's this

1081
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Super valuable thing

1082
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
And

1083
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:53,184
Brickside about it now it's it's only been a year I was just saying it's a

1084
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,976
We launched in June of 2000

1085
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
17 North Bend

1086
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
Exactly a year

1087
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,840
And things are going pretty good so far

1088
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:06,240
So last year you guys raised $2000000 new series a from over 90 investors and Gigi bb1

1089
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:11,104
Why did you decide to do such a party around with so many Buster's

1090
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,224
Ever I just want to see the biggest party biggest party round

1091
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
It's a party round you know is it in Silicon Valley it's like kind of what happens now I think the same is true in China where someone will go and no

1092
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,440
Play over there raise money from the dozens of investors

1093
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
The OU's angels and maybe parts

1094
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
The funds for their class

1095
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Cbrown

1096
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
We chose to do that

1097
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
Because we wanted our

1098
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
Investors to funnel us

1099
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Portfolio company

1100
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Domino's Pizza

1101
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
S works pretty well so far

1102
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,288
So I'm pretty happy with the

1103
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
The results in

1104
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
And we also another thing is we wanted in vest

1105
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
This is not to say hey

1106
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,760
You don't legal is something that people don't actually want to take risk and right so we didn't want to invest

1107
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,552
How to say hey don't

1108
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Don't try this

1109
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,344
Service

1110
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,696
Yeah exactly or even if they just

1111
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
Familiarize

1112
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,816
So what has been the progress so far until

1113
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Terms of

1114
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
Providing the actual services

1115
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Yeah progress so far we going

1116
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,984
I don't work for over 240 clients so far

1117
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
I was out this client raised over four hundred million dollars

1118
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Last year

1119
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
That's pretty cool call you then

1120
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
So we do a couple things we can

1121
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Is he do the legal around

1122
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
Financing

1123
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
We also have

1124
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,808
Boot camp called hm scale where we teach people how to fundraise

1125
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,880
And I think the cool thing about that is

1126
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:31,232
A lot of found is only one thing we realized the course of of operating a trim is that

1127
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,256
A lot of founders

1128
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,048
Just come in and they want help with

1129
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
With the process

1130
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
VCU.

1131
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
Kind of

1132
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,728
You and I are very spiritual experience

1133
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
Guys are coming in and they just like don't know what to do you know you seem or more technology comes from outside the

1134
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
The cost of living is so higher

1135
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,504
But they don't have the connections they don't know what to do so we put together program

1136
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,064
That's out today long boot camp

1137
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,368
For Founders to teach them hate here's how you

1138
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
Raise money and then we help them work on there

1139
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Deck in the narrative and

1140
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
I welcome

1141
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,560
Are most of your clients first-time founders

1142
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:13,472
I know many of them are a multiple-time Founders or are we have clients or later Stage Company is your 200-person company and stuff like that

1143
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
But we do have a lot of

1144
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
Garceau there's an education component 2

1145
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,944
Yeah absolutely I think that really want one thing I learned from Vice

1146
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,784
Seawright is YC how to how do I see scale they built a lot around

1147
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
Education around

1148
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
Free content out there in the market events

1149
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Community right

1150
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,232
And I think that one of the things that we can do here

1151
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
For Adrian being a platform for

1152
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
Companies write how do we

1153
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,376
If I think about our missions Mission it's really the help

1154
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
Fastline com

1155
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,216
And I have to provide them with services and

1156
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
An application to help them grow

1157
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,288
Right and so

1158
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,824
How do we do that while I take

1159
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
Your education and

1160
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
Community and like teaching people how to run companies

1161
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Information that they need

1162
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Hazel weight

1163
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,527
Chucky

1164
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Was it get funded

1165
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Welcome to each ramp

1166
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Poison Netflix

1167
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
Face in their course

1168
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,183
Absolutely I would love to be able to help

1169
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
So I spent 10 years since you started Justin.tv is there

1170
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,447
Thousand sixteen You knew when you were just sort out

1171
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
Knowing what you know today

1172
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,823
Knowing what I know today I would have just sold it to Facebook in 2006

1173
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
Besides that

1174
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
I think that

1175
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,759
You know when you have something that is a market

1176
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:36,159
Category leader in a growing category any benefits as it don't sell it

1177
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,071
I think I think we could have been much more effective if we had implemented actual management

1178
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,655
In the early days of Justin TV and going through twitch

1179
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:52,799
And and done a couple like basic things may be hired senior leaders I know it sounds so cliche to be like oh just hired you know

1180
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,639
You got the gray hairs or whatever but you don't having some more senior leadership

1181
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,223
Structure in the company where there's more division of labor among the co-founders

1182
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,599
I wish we had more clear metrics-driven with gold rim and we never were like on okay ours or anything like that

1183
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Hunting putting in

1184
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
Would like somebody's management

1185
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
Tools to having workshops around that

1186
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
Yeah will be helpful for your

1187
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Founders

1188
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
I should do that for a rage and we should have an okay hours were

1189
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
Workshop because I think it's super important

1190
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
Understanding that management isn't

1191
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
It's not a job right it's not a

1192
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
It's not something that

1193
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,543
Supposed to make your life.

1194
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Fun store.

1195
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
A tool for you to be more

1196
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Successful

1197
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,015
It's a collection of tools that for you

1198
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:39,647
Right but I always thought that your management was kind of like a dirty word in

1199
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,207
Yelp

1200
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
Exactly we're supposed to like

1201
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
We were supposed to just

1202
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,071
Like hack on something until it was like Facebook

1203
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,351
Whatever you know but

1204
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
We didn't really realize I like

1205
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,727
The world working or worse and I think that's the benefit of actually having a job

1206
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
Before you start a company

1207
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
We never had

1208
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:02,175
I'm curious on your perspective on what Justin said about like if you are a category

1209
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:07,551
Earlier you should hold on to a do thing that applies in China too or is that a different story

1210
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,183
I think in China most people know that lesson from early on just so many sectors got disrupted

1211
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
So that

1212
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,511
If you have a cuddle leader they never never never saw

1213
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,839
What has changed in China is now you see industry consolidate

1214
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,399
So number one number two player fight for

1215
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,191
Three years as hard as they can

1216
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Racism much

1217
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
Money as they can they figure out who's Ash better

1218
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
I forgot we depart

1219
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,847
Yeah so that they can own more of the world end

1220
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,663
The one who sold out and some become great and investor

1221
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,015
Joe now you have Best of Both Worlds are more investors are more professional

1222
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,295
Experience come through that

1223
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
Does cutting Springs in also have a much bigger outcome

1224
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
In the original article

1225
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
So it's what

1226
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Absolute

1227
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
Originally Saul mobile

1228
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
Be acquired by

1229
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
Great one

1230
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
And sometimes

1231
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
I asked the business it's just hard to

1232
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,239
To be a standalone best depending on what you're doing it can be hard to be a stand-alone business

1233
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,567
Nvidia look at you after while you figure out that

1234
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
It's hard to be strong alone

1235
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
Then if that's the case then

1236
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,967
Finding the right comfortable be great we were messing musically

1237
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,295
Help me save to figure out a way to scale and then

1238
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Encourage them to

1239
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,623
When they want to merge into someone else

1240
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
Find a Graco mean by dance

1241
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
She move on to the

1242
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,815
Rapid fire questions

1243
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,375
Was it entrepreneur you admire the most and why

1244
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Who's the author

1245
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
Leader I admire the most

1246
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
And why don't my who's older

1247
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
That's all I was younger

1248
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,335
That's a good one older and younger

1249
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,735
Everybody probably says Elon Musk Elon Musk

1250
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
I think I admire because

1251
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
He's always look so

1252
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,463
Stressed out and he has so much pain right I'd like to keep doing it despite the pain.

1253
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
That is a guy who

1254
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,911
Is not enjoying his life

1255
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:05,311
I know exactly I respect that because he's doing it for the

1256
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,687
Humanity even at the sacrifice of the self in that is truly

1257
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,247
Do Psychopaths have seen how you think this ice cream

1258
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:17,343
Fun to eat ice cream

1259
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
Yep that's

1260
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
That's right I hope that's okay

1261
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,487
But maybe the other the person I would say actually then

1262
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,535
If I can't choose elong would be

1263
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Brian chesky

1264
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,863
Hi Brian. Someone I known

1265
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,935
Their entire long time journey through through Airbnb

1266
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,983
And they used to come by our office

1267
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,287
Across the street I remember in the early days.

1268
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,383
Cuz we were like one step ahead a lot along of course of then they rapidly

1269
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Eclipse

1270
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,711
But I just need to get in twitch

1271
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
But I like to I admire rhyme because he always

1272
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,831
Just learning he's only trying to level up

1273
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
From somebody who's

1274
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
A couple steps ahead

1275
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,231
And finding mentors gift and I think that is as inspired

1276
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,535
Me here at Atrium actually I'm always

1277
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,607
I'm trying to like how do I level myself up you know that's the last

1278
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Kind of

1279
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,447
The thing for me like the reason I start a trim is like I want to

1280
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,239
Bill the company bigger than twitch

1281
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,311
Which is a very high bar in order to do that I'm going to have to

1282
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
I continue to like

1283
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Be self-aware and level myself up and figure out what I

1284
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,455
I'm good at indranagar out and work on

1285
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,015
You know improving my strengths and maybe complimenting my

1286
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,807
But and so

1287
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Really a lot of that since bye bye bye

1288
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
I have a lot of respect for

1289
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
For what he's done

1296
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,471
He's acting like such a genuine good person

1297
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
I mean I

1298
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,055
You can't respect that right everybody's also very curious

1299
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
And as others

1300
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
You know I think his

1301
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
Is curiosity drives him to

1302
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,223
Really Blake Building Company that embodies I do know I can

Ticket with with stripes

1304
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
Feels like there's so much on the

1305
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
The technical axle inside and

1306
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
I'm really investigating the

1307
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
Technology side that

1308
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Eureka College

1309
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
It's like that

1310
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
In the Spear of the compass

1311
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,999
And obviously hot that has driven massive success

1312
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,047
Maybe the not obvious side

1313
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
It's my really admire is

1314
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351

Before

Years ago now I think

00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,799
And maybe is 545 years ago

1320
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
So he was very young when I met him you. Maybe

1321
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,151
18 years old or something like that

1322
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
And

1323
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687

That's a guy want to talk to you

1347
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487

1348
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767

That's amazing

1351
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,935
What's something you read recently that talk to you a lot

1352
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:16,287
Read recently that I think was really great his book called

1353
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,823
The elephant in the brain

1354
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
Bye

1355
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
Scott Robin Hanson

1356
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
The Economist

1357
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,479
And another I got to the guy from Silicon Valley a programmer

1358
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,807
And this book is all about the hidden with motivation

1359
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,623
Human behavior that we don't ask

1360
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Do you want to talk about

1361
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
I like

1362
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
One of the things

1363
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,767
I remember from the book I was discussing with Emmett Mike

1364
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
Got switch go powder

1365
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
How was that

1366
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
Yo advertising actually works

1367
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
I'm not just

1368
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,703
Because it is of the bright light brand advertising worth

1369
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,471
Because it

1370
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
Your brand advertising and

1371
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
And you see it so you have that exposure

1372
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
But it's also because

1373
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
When you know other

1374
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
People have seen it

1375
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,735
So so like BMW advertising as a luxury brand networks because not just

1376
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Because

1377
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,903
UCB wnec looks like cool that or whatever you like of a BMW cool but because you know other people have seen that

1378
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
So you know that like

1379
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,255
BMW has a luxury place in their mind

1380
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:13,375
And so that means that you can like basically if you buy BMW then you get that value of like

1381
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,167
Other people

1382
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,959
I think it's luxury right

1383
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,263
So I thought that was like an interesting jobs

1384
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Actually

1385
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:25,663
And you know I think I was coming at you you haven't thought about the book is filled with examples kind of that

1386
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
That was pretty fast

1387
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247

00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
