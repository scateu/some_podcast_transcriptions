104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,471
To figure out what do I want to do so

105
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
No I'm always a foodie

106
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,615

And also I really pretty

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,831
So at that time thing was that I kind of like the part of the first internet phone

109
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
But I think that will be a second coming so it's the internet and also the food so

110
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
The carnival spy by the

111
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679

Husker recruiting 2 hours to it I mean as a one-man show any kind of like a personal website

116
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
This is how it goes

117
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
Why did you still believe in the internet even after

118
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Truth about

119
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
First

120
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
So now we have this like the version of

121
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
First you have to hypogean come down and then

122
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,335
Masonic rosette sword

123
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615

124
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Phenomenal and

125
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319

126
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Largest breed

I use very often just can't believe

129
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
Doubt will not be bad he was coming out of it

130
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,351
And a time you had already lived and worked in the US for 10 years

131
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Did you feel like

132
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,519
You had challenges going back to China and the first thing you did was start a new company which is not easy

133
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
So did you have like any challenges adapting

134
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Tula Chinese

135
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Marquette and Lake

136
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
Getting to know what's happening on the ground

137
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
Yeah I mean

138
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,807
1 challenges you know at that time was

139
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Normally driven internet

140
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Beijing Shanghai

141
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Right and asensio

142
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,791
Play Avatar the internet was like other Crooks pricecharting

143
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
Turn off no more lazy and

144
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
Horizon

145
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
I was not popular and also as like I know return is Isaiah Thomas has to do a lot of prestige in China

146
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Something like

147
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
Having second of Contessa

148
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
How is eyeshadow pressure

149
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
So it's listening through this in Shanghai

150
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Child over there

151
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,519
Sagittarius and what I'm doing so is that some pressure on the ground

152
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
And I also I think you'll get back to use to the Chinese culture and into the

153
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Hiding people got the away for 10 years but recruiting people in Arabic

154
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671
We're friends right

155
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
So that would take some time

156
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,583
To get a p you get a team together

157
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
Yeah you

158
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399

I know you when you're trying to raise money in 2005-2006

160

A lot of people investors

161
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,591
For doubting that how big could a gimpy Market be

162
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Because the people who I should weep reviews

163
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,991
Live only in Beijing and Shanghai primarily

164
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
Maybe there's something something Center

165
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
But there were a lot of

166
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Doubt

167
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Or

168
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
A certainty

169
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
Involving heartbeat the Tempe Market will go

170
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
How did you overcome those are 17 still be able to raise money

171

Grow the business

172
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Over the next few years between 2000

173
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
For 5 to 2008

174
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
2009

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,287
Esl is a we did our first reading with

176
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Starting 2004

177
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
That time the Chinese remark is still very very small so-and-so visits here

178

Forest HBC

179
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,135
And if a project has started like to know the end of 2004

180

Bocinas

182
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
And that we actually one of the very first years

183
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,167

And I think that's the most if you have a knack of us model is that why you say okay in China

188
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,535
Believe they can take out later of course a very different right now in the cool way I think

189
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
But at that time that's just the Market Common

190
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,983
So end up with taking the money from supplier

191
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,127
China is rising primaries when's I knew I knew before that so he was in

192
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:25,759
Similarity to what we were doing

193
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
Consumer sector Lexia lifestyle thing in San Jose

194
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:38,559
So they understand so he understood his penis and I remember you telling me that

195
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,727
1 million something I 1.5 Millions just like 5 minutes. A lot of money

196
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
So I don't know who's going to grow up

197
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
You know gif

198
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,639
It's just not that much money but I think

199
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
How much it is to take for her

200
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
But after you receive money in the second round he was led by Google

201
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Was it.

202
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
And thereafter

203
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Tuna grow the business

204
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Before you started Groupon busy

205
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
In 2009

206
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,095
Between 2004 and 2009 for those five years

207
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
But just review best

208
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
How difficult was it

209
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Where how easy was it

210
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Grow that business

211
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
In China

212
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
Would most people agree with you so primarily in

213
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
So when do you start a business when the

214
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
Matty Woods

215
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Was downright

216
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,111
It's not a lot of Internet status says that's how was that treats

217
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
You'll have a lot of competition but you have competition

218
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Is not a strong break

219
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,303
So you can kind of take your time to really

220
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
Buta solid foundation

221
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
Closest hours that the big cities the People by a huge gradual spread into the second chance

222
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,591
So what you have is a very strong community

223
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
And it's a very devoted

224
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
So you have this

225
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Aquarius Foundation 2

226
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
I took a lot of things we are with you today.

227
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
So that was great

228
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
So

229
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
I was his particular

230
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
If equality was a

231
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Pretty

232
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Great time

233
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,023
Students ideas to do champions

234
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
By nature is a community

235
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
Anna and Elsa

236
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Exactly

237
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
It takes

238
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
If we if we

239
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
If you start to feel like now I think

240
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,431
What will be hot that YouTube you.

241
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Kissing Santa Claus by Monday already

242
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
And it's a local business it take longer

243
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,511
Even though

244
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,887
National Escobedo itself is hard but if you are local business you have the City by City

245
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,239
Which city probably takes about two 3DS to have a very mature community

246
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,335
So it does take seven years to

247
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
Website MPI know we are fortunate

248
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
I thought we don't have a lot of

249
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,575
You know Capital Tracy around a lot of like a unnecessary competition so we can do

250
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Our job in the

251
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Static away

252
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
So what went take away from that.

253
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Probably

254
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Avicii

255
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Or

256
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Big players

257
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
Don't think too much of your category

258
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
It's actually a blessing

259
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
Dude definition

260
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
So I think even today even though

261
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
You started emptying before y'all started

262
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
The easiest way to explain Dan. Still to say that it's like a Yelp equivalent of China but I still

263
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Don't think there are a lot of

264
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Differences

265
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
Find terms of the interface and functionalities

266
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
Could you explain to her audience like

267
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
What are the

268
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,743
Different functionality that dianping offers at Yelp doesn't have

269
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,655
We have no more things I think it's a besides reviews like we have the

270
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
The coupon so we do our own coupon

271
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
And we have the delivery

272
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
And also

273
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,151
We have that you can hook the movie tickets like at San Diego does

274
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
Supreme I think Yelp

275
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
We both started as a review and community

276
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
Panda

277
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
Damn he cut a branch into

278
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
Further into the future

279
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
No more transactions

280
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Related companies

281
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
And the we are engaged with Merchants Ardmore

282
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
So is that

283
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
Can a primary difference between the

284
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
Yelp

285
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Another difference I noticed

286
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
On my last trip to China was I think

287
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Content is featured a lot

288
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Better on dipping than on Yelp

289
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
So I can actually read like

290
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Top

291
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,063
Opaque bakeries in Shanghai what I've done a lot of like these influencer articles

292
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,671
That doesn't exist on Yelp and helped me a lot with discovering

293
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
New restaurant

294
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:56,095
Yeah I mean in terms of the actual features on the side

295
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
She difference

296
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
Besides the the ratings

297
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,079
Degenerate we also gave this

298
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
So will you tell you

299
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
How good the food

300
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Batik all the services

301
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
And also it would give you a better price

302
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
I need help give you only like the signs

303
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,183
Suzhou station to make a

304
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Beginning so it's

305
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
It's hot attitude

306
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,607
Add beginning to get users to give you a lawn mower information

307
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Right

308
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
But

309
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
But I just at that time decided

310
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
That sucks

311
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
It's a bad in the long run

312
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
2

313
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
Have more detailed ratings

314
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
Look in the morning when you found the Jews I'll be more helpful for whoever reading it. So I think that's a decision kind of food

315
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Made out of bikini

316
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
And I feel just need some

317
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
Especially in China I guess it's

318
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
Lawn mower use for to have

319
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,511
Multichoice

320
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,095
4-star restaurant is. Because of food or because of peacock

321
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,447
Look at y'all always have this always want to give me more details

322
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
And that's when the other things

323
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,103
I think that the local market difference-maker

324
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
One of the

325
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
Most useful features

326
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
A damn paint is about the recommended t-shirt

327
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
That's the very one I was going to say

328
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
Pictures coming from China side

329
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Always want ya

330
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,679
This right transfund 1/2 Stars water goodbye

331
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,055
Fighting

332
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,199
And also

333
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,271
Vallarta dishes you can cook

334
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,831
G45 dishes are really good

335
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,695
Sophia Lucia restaurant have a very hydrating but when the other roundish

336
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
You haven't had a bad experience so I think the recommendations in China particular

337
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
So so how was he that's a local local difference

338
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Important

339
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,591
So that's up to debate but I was too

340
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
The foot have more information

341
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,735
The more focus of particular style bigger things

342
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
So it's

343
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Did they have the menu is

344
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Bit more limited

345
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Beijing China

346
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
People think they can do every

347
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
So everything

348
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
You can think of

349
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
It's inside so even with a Chinese cuisine

350
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
You may find a decreasing gif

351
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Lights out

352
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
It's easier for someone just know that I hear the 3 4 5 dishes

353
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
Rights and other features like you know on the pictures

354
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,735
We are at you through a lawnmower at the feature functions

355
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
Solange that I can show videos

356
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,623
Okay so what kind of like a multimedia thing is going on

357
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Then what can't what you can see in the US

358
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
The second key milestone

359
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Innate orbis development

360
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Ford

361
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
Thai dipping was winning 2009-2010

362
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
Groupon become hottest phenomenon in the US

363
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Auntie China was already Groupon

364
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,359
Before but not in the same way

365
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
And I remember

366
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
As I was looking at what was happening in the US

367
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,807
And seen that in China there was set up trying to do

368
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
Groupon on their own from scratch

369
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Immediately

370
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
I thought.

371
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
You should be the most natural

372

What movie is part of a team we ask you this question

378
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,359
It was interesting to see how you have more nuanced answer

379
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
You were just in just not you're not about to

380
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735

Issues that could be conflicting

383
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
But you need to solve and what I could be.

384
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,231
Synergy that pushes you could exist but you need to walk hard to make that happen

385
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
Do it just doesn't happen automatically

386
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
Can you go through some of that

387
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
Good decision criteria

388
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
To enter a new business

389
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
And what kind of framework do you use

390
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
To help you identify operational challenges

391
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
You need to solve to do well in a second

392
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
Yeah I mean okay so

393
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151

What is a group of witches mentioned

397
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
And I know there's actually mobile

398
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647

According to Mobile in China

407
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,087
Because at that time we are more afraid

408
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Of the mobile not disrupt us

409
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647

But we don't know what mobile mobile going to do to us

417
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383

00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,199
Go to all the local businesses about

419
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223

422
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
I think it was a

423
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
Yeah means the most natural thing for us to do

424
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
And the total group points action all that easy you need a light.

425
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,983
But mobile can happen overnight some

426
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,639

436
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,031

I think

440

For us

441
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:54,399
Mysa why because we have this mind size always convey mobile so we tried out a Whizzer mobile app

442
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,751
Before iPhone which highlights of SMS

443
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
Toy wasn't challenged

444
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,431
Intense of the mindset of the scary thing is like you have something to my side no right

445
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Okay

446
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,807
So that's okay

447
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
Okay how to read it br

448
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Really focus on what

449
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
People want on the mobile.

450
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
Mobile

451
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
Kiki Trend kitchen

452
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
From the outside as investors or as consumers

453
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,752
Did this revolution you guys had from PC website

454
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
2 mobile seems very smooth

455
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,128
And people enjoy using your

456
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
My mobile products

457
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
So that's why from the outside it seems like the

458
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
Going whether to go into corporate business or not

459
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
Was a bigger challenge

460
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,416
Not talk about the group companies

461
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
No. We have to go to in

462
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Okay

463
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Why is

464
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
Groupon

465
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
Innocence it's just

466
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,656
It's it's a it's a

467
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Paid advertising

468
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
Consumer benefits and traffic

469
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:11,712
That's exactly what we were doing with our other

470
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
So we have these coupon

471
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,320
It just a different day

472
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
That's right

473
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
So

474
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
And

475
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Seoul

476
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,168
I need a Chinese visa that sounds we didn't realize at the time

477
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
It's up

479
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
Just strong

480
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,920
Novel perspective okay it's a natural thing for us to be that difficult

481
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,576
Okay we already have that uses and all these doing the advertising we had a relationship quiz

482
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
Merchants

483
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,696
Okay but the two things you did

484
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
The group home

485
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
The people who are

486
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Seattle Intergroup

487
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,632
About a different font of people who are selling the ass

488
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Okay

489
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:07,008
These are more typical add teams like yours

490
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,616
Seems like maybe salesforce.com Facebook or Google have

491
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,736
Concept kind of like a seahorse gives birth

492
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,088
Groupon 1002b it's actually not difficult to self

493
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:27,488
Okay it's more kind of like a speedy approach

494
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,888
Unity3d so you don't need a lot of people with like a better high CO skills you need somebody

495
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,472
And also intensive organization

496
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Put a D20 like

497
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:42,592
Strong sales people and it's a way to manage them is kind of bit

498
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,432
I'm so fly Jeeves and creativity and that blooms right

499
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,504
LOL you how are you I have these two culture

500
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
So they feel good about it okay

501
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,368
Between Grupo El Especial

502
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
With all these competitions at you just need a foot soldiers

503
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
You need a general career

504
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
Just saw

505
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:09,728
Push everything forward and we don't care how skillful the salespeople

506
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
She kind of DD

507
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
Later that she all like that

508
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:19,712
But at that time for the Groupon is the first

509
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
I haven't seen anything

510
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,976
Alabama.com only in China

511
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,328
Ella's only actually happened to be the perfect team to do that

512
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Is from Alibaba

513
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
Alibaba Wednesday at 7 in B2B

514
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,920
Looks like a specs.

515
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,736
Organization is not really at

516
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,832
How long how long did it take you to recognize that there's a pattern difference

517
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,904
I things that take longer than we would like

518
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,304
So we started a group on a 2010 right and I think

519
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
Start realize why

520
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
We seems to have our advantage

521
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
And we should have crushed competition already but we still have a couple strong come to a competitive and as he seems to be

522
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
Be doing better

523
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
Inspirational suicide

524
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
Sansa we oh we oh we did

525
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
So is that a yes

526
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
Saint that was a big challenge for us

527
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Okay that's all I'm saying

528
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Is also called a

529
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Geography of China

530
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Guess you have this like

531
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,144
Southern coastal cities

532
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,472
You have a lot of cities in England

533
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,800
So you are a genius

534
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Okay so then

535
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,152
The people in England

536
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,760
She actually like Groupon because it gives them discounts the people in

537
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,832
Shanghai Beijing feel like it but not to that degree no

538
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:06,464
So we are in this country as we are dealing with all these like coastal cities

539
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
So I think you understand

540
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,376
Needs

541
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,984
Is Leica CL really bad if Orlando is much higher

542
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Is that we were respected

543
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
From the interest

544
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:34,880
So that's another thing I think it's kind of the penis a different looks

545
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,976
The beginning

546
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,584
It says 2G difference are very different

547
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,680
But those are extremely important because that is what you think about

548
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
It seems like it's a natural extension of a business

549
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
Xqd realize that

550
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,568
Their fundamental differences

551
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,456
A really interesting that a lot of Chinese Tech History is often described in

552
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:06,112
War related terms

553
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:11,744
Allatoona rally II Army leaders are referred to as generals

554
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
And they have like wechat names

555
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
And you live through it

556
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
You live through the

557
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:22,752
Thousand Groupon war chant in the early 2010s

558
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:28,128
Back in 2011 trying to head over 5,000 Groupon like companies

559
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408

Can you companies being start everyday

561
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,272
And I thought I went Chinese consumer went out to like

562
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:40,160
Restaurants that will be bombarded with promotions and discounts from all of these companies trying to grab their attention

563
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
What was your biggest takeaway from this

564
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744

00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,376
Before the battle

567
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
The other video websites

568
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,496
In 2005 there was an egg went through a similar.

3000

574
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,552
Sites started doing Groupon within the first six

575
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,600
That this is Sergeant a coughing

576
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
So is something that none of us

577
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Ever

578
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
Sing how fast

579
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720

00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
So

581
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
Yoga Nest devices

582
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
We look at different angles

583
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
Play the first part was a

584
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,984
I mean towards the generals and people fighting

585
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,080
When is the chine

586
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,728
Mr. Jack ma Alibaba

593
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,056
You know it is a combination right

594
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
Different

595
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,808
I think it doesn't make a difference

596
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,160
It doesn't make a difference which kind of final

597
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,208
Kind of like for today

598
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Tessa

599
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,656
With that back row is that generally I think

600
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:33,056
And it's like no roots

601
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,896
Us regulations

602
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,552

603
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,392
Just a 3ft Oscar commissioner

604
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,792
So that's one thing I know I nothing is right you know people just said I don't have this side you know people just copy each other

605
00:29:54,048 --> 00:30:00,192
You don't have like a very strong intellectual property rights and

606
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Intellectually

607
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
IP rights and I also I think

608
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:14,016
Call Yesenia

609
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648

619
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,656
People copy you

620
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,496
The blood by Bastille

621
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
And

622
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
If you are

623
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,128
Happened to be good or bad

624
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,480
Ithaca Groupon

625
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:20,064
You could get a crepe in it

626
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,184
Okay that's good thing but the bad thing is unicorn face out of a competition

627
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,512
Ana in some ways as a lot of luck involved

628
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,352
Yes I did it become TD until we was good though so I think is lucky

629
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
I didn't send my thing with spikes you

630
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
So it's a lock

631
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:43,360
Meaning like you can Ride Captain Ride Captain somebody at the right time or if you get it right the people to report

632
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,688
So that's a lot of fighting how to work

633
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,480
Dedication

634
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
But also luck

635
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040

Going to Future satellite view

639
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
The things about

00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Nas is Like

641
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,560
No hundreds of companies fighting for the San Marcos actor

642
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Icing

643
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,376
You mean China going forward

644
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
I want we want to seize as much

645
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,288
Now as you fight this thousand Groupon War

646
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,640
And became involved in a food delivery battle later on which requires even more capital

647
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
The big boys

648
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
JT Sarika involved

649
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
You had tencent as in buster

00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,576
Alibaba becoming about certain Mate1

651
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,648
And Baidu started its own takeout business by Dua my

652
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
And some people these days say that

653
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
Chinese startups are like palms for these Giants

654
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
They don't control their own destiny

655
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,864
It is a reality that many

656
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,704
Small startups today need to choose a cam for a gen do I from day one

657
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
You're either in the tencent can wear the alley cat

658
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,824
But others argue that in the past

659
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
The Giants just used to copy everyone and Crush you

660
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,992
And at least now they're willing to invest and give resources to help you grow

661
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
So in your experience dealing with Giants

662
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,136
What are your takeaways and recommendations for entrepreneurs

663
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Sweden China zip

00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
True match light

665
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,536
Especially Alibaba and tencent

666
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
Become

667
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,888
The last line of capital

668
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168

00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
The podcast suicide

Give you the capital to go forward

675
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,368
So y'all can stay the same

676
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,696
The capital of Tennessee is a big consideration

677
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,304
And of course a WeChat is that thing will you consider my help

678
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,632

Alibaba tend not to give you a coffee

697
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536

Tencent

701
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
How do you say with WeChat these days

Inshot absolutely on the WeChat traffic

708

But

709
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
They are better than

710
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Pronto WeChat traffic

711
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680

Do you want to take it the money in front

00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,144
More for your petition dissolution

But you might still want to get money from them for other reasons

721
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
For example

722
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
Possum poison

723
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
If you are penis

00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:12,928
You still want to be independent because you want to have the option to choose

729
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Okay

But that's tricky

746
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
Choice

747
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712

00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,144
Still willing to song you so they can be

754
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,752

00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,016
Azar mobile as a dude really have to take the

They were trying to

760
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Figure out

761
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,928
How to work with a WeChat

762
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464

They did he did not

766
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
Start off with that

767
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
Without one of the co-founders

768
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
Not acknowledging Prada

769
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
So

770
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
Ivy walk with tencent and how to

771
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
Solve a lot of

772
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Peak traffic

773
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Pica's Jackson

774
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Givenchy shoes

775
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Do you have a scale

776
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
That was helpful for them

777
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
To learn her

778
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Ulta Beaverton

779
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
So I think beyond the capital Beyond suit

780
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
IFit

781
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
I'm just improving on

782
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
Internal operation what it is.

783
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Knology or

784
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Product

785
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
That there's some benefit

786
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
Types of learning

787
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
People have skills

788
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
So that's definitely would consider

789
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
But I agree with you

790
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
That

791
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
These guys are not going to give you money

792
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
Did they have

793
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
That they will give you money

794
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
If you fit what they

795
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Meet you too

796
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
M4u no right Syrian War

797
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,784
Both the Audi pay in the

798
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,832
WeChat pay need to have more user

799
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Who's there

800
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,928
And when you take a ride

801
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,464
You need to choose a payment service

802
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
Did he didn't have that

803
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Then

804
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
So whoever invested in them

805
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
I have a chance

806
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
Build-up the mobile payment

807
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
And that's why

808
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
DD

809
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Get money from pension

810
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Sports

811
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Want to grow

812
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
Derek Mobile payment customer list

813
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
Throw these two rights area

814
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
So tense I was an investor in

815
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
N. Why did you

816
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Decide that that was

817
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,464
So at that time was we still have hope for WeChat

818
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
Tubidy

819
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,888
I'm paper looks like there's a very good fit we should get out of traffic from WeChat

820
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
And so that was a big help

821
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
I think we just to help us a

822
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
I know a lot

823
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Just not to

824
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
The level we're changed again

825
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
And another thing I think it's

826
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
The cat toys that has a mansion

827
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,576
And 13 is also you kill compilation

828
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,464
Right because you miss someone

829
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
Makes sense

830
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
And when did you first learn that

831
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Nate y&r

832
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Sure was

833
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
I always say

834
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,568
But we we been talkin to me

835
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
So me and I want machine

836
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,712
So yeah

837
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Even

838
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Play Sirius channel music together I got to USB

839
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Before that much

840
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,928
So how is say

841
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
So in this

842
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
Cuddle business

843
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
If you have light to strip hair

844
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
Even to pay is there nobody going to make money

845
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,192
Okay so you will have to be like Monopoly players

846
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
Rosalina is hot

847
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,080
Otherwise

848
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,408
Right otherwise he just so you could not keep you quiet capital

849
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
And nobody can make

850
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
So I think

851
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
These kind of business

852
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,600
Is the only rational ways too much unless

853
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
You think you can kill the other guy

854
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
But

855
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,720
So I think that happened to Nike ID party later

856
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,304
I know it's hard for that was a robot and then she

857
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,912
I'll be last maybe because you're more kind of

858
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:17,312
Advertising and possession based

859
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,640
Easiest the best emojis better

860
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
It's okay

861
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
Autistic IDF

862
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,576

863
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Competitive

864
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
Citgo gas

865
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
Octopus controller

866
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
Show me ways mushed together

867
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
I think

868
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,816
Verizon Wireless phone companies

869
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Psychiatrist

870
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
All of you penises different

871
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Optical companies

872
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
So he's always I think

873
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,496
Mocedad looking at okay

874
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,800
Can we chill the other guy or three

875
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
Kind of like evenly matched

876
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
So it's always right looking at the timing and

877
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,759
So yeah you know anything of the boys season competitors

878
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
How did you choose the right time

879
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,719
It's the right time and I think I've off the cases

880
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Kind of catalyst

881
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279

Fly Seattle

891
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,319
Catalyst is that what made it happen

892
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
Were there a lot of pressure from

893
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,231
I mean restaurant

894
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,815
You know it just like we look outside the mobike and

895
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,863
You know

896
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
Looks I see so much

897
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:51,519
Right

898
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
Having to have any Masters that I

899
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
I like

900
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,639
Supply has interest in both sides

901
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,175
High-end

902
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
And the 10 signs and more

903
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,783
Strategic investor so he looks at strategic

904
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,599
I know I'm not feel financially

905
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,183
So it's at the base is also

906
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
Kind of Visa

907
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
Things going to happen

908
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
But oh well

909
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
Kind of decides

910
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
It's going to happen because

911
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
The interesting life

912
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
So in case I would you have

913

In order to force murderer

915
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
The different outcome

916
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,407
Sounds like that might raise the money first and then

917
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
Maternal

918
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
Summit hours about

00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
So that's why it happen

920
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
If I did with the money

921
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
It's probably not going to have

922
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,927
Send we all have

923
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,279
Money to buy

So I wonder how difficult was it to integrated two teams after the merger

936
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,183
Because the kind of people were different in the cultures were different

937
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
It's not easy

938
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
I'll just some similarities percent difference

939
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,631
Salt as an adult getting too many details but yeah I mean

940
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
The two companies with

941
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,751
I'll have that over 10000 people is not going to be the same

942
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:35,199
Andrea fried eggs Addison

943
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:41,599
So this article and also each position

944
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,023
Difficult as a we are against off

945
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
The archive

946
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
We imagine

947
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,215
Where was okay yeah I was naughty it was difficult but no noise

948
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,335
What's also interesting is that every time these murders happen

949
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,431
A lot of Highly capable Executives with leave and start their own Ventures

950
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,503
Whether it's a new VC firm or their own startups

951
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:14,623
And if you look at the alumni from the McClendon P merger have since left the company

952
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
Is there anyone that jump out at you

953
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,999
Or is doing something that you find very impressive

954
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
I mean

955
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,631
Full size beds

956
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
I mean

957
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,727
And also become big

958
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,663
Is nausea

959
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
Yes or no

960
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,807
Quite a few people. And

961
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,695
Stop

962
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,279
Former CEO is doing this

963
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,351
Champion it right that the new coming in stores

964
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
I think has a great potential

965
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
And as a strong team

966
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Empresso that's a

967
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,287
I didn't tell us about penguins

968
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
What come out

969
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
Got

970
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,663
So the English name of the newly merged company

971
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
This internet plus hold

972
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
What what is your understanding of the

973
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
The phrase internet

974
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,623
We always remember Indianapolis

975
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
Is

976
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
Chinese at that time with Tim Carter

977
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,535
And what we doing

978
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
Is that you want to do like more like child

979
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
Trend

980
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
Okay so offline penis

981
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
LOL Emoji with Allah

982
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,823
I think the train is still going strong

983
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
And

984
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
So so that's why we never met this way

985
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,015
First name in Chinese name

986
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
That English

987
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Translation

988
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,367
Chinese name

989
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
The new

990
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,975
Make wine +.

991
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
So I did get the Chinese name

992
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,863
But it's interesting that the English names pek

993
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
As to what a person says

994
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
New company is

995
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
It's going to focus on

996
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
With all things.

997
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:11,615
So I think that also signals that the new company has allowed ambitions

998
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
Beyond juice

999
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Food or restaurant

1000
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991

1003
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,879
How closely do you follow the development

1004
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
May 20th

1005
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,975
And do you agree that the moves that they're making

1006
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
The new ones are

1007
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
As a material shareholder

1008
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,351
It's all I think

1009
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
Laurel Market Force

1018
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
We will talk about a concept

1019
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,735
Super high velocity

1020
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
Ashoka

1021
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Want to be independent

1022
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
So you looked at me

No end to launching is doing

1039
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,343
With your new business

1040
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,695
At the same time now that Audi Baba is no longer a shareholder in

1041
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463

1042
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511

In the related area

1045
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,911
So it seems like even after this merger to make me to make wine and didn't

1046
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
The battle

1047
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Watching TV

1048
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
Moving to New categories

1049
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
Do you think that makes sense

1050

And where is The Foundry for me tattoo

1051
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
I mean for a company's where to set the boundary is always

1052
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Difficult

1053
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
And the different data will have

1054
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
And

1055
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
How to say Ride Along

1058
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
Do you think

1059
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
The company has a chance

1060
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Powerful comeback

1061
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Hospital

1062
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,495
When are the battles

1063
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,895
Keeping away Asia home base

1064
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,687
Optimistic

1065
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,735
Some other motive

1066
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
So

1067
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
Yeah

1068
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063

And what are the ones that are not as important

1072
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,767
I mean the home base you have

1073
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,351

1074
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,631
HomeBase

1075
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
So the home base has

1076
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
To be

1077
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215

1154
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,927
Therefore he needs to do it or it's something deeper

1155
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,975
Meaning that he knows that

1156
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,535

1171
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207

1172
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,255

1195
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
How you judge a good leader is by

1196
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
Partly by how they

1197
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,439
Whether they know the right boundaries

1198
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255

So it is

1207
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
It's very hard to figure out

1208
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,879
Even though you had to say is
