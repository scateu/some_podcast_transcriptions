The first questions I would start with the OD States part of your life

61
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,624
Can you tell us when did you leave timeline what prompted

62
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
In

63
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
What kind of expertise

64
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
When you first went to the US

65
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
Was there any adjustment.

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Oh okay yeah it was I thinking early 70s when my brother was a PhD in

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
Us went to visit my parents

68
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Family

69
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
After many years

70
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Absent

71
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
And he saw that

72
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
Why the large gap that us had

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Education cess

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
And compared to

75
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
All of Asia

76
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
And he said why don't you come live with us

77
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,624
So so I did late 72

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,208
A lot older

79
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,328
So he was out in Oak Ridge at Oak Ridge National Labs Gulfport Mississippi

80
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
Which I went to and lived in

81
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:22,240
It was all really quite an experience because I wouldn't give me some

82
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
The only

83
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
Chinese student in high school which is probably something

84
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
English back then

85
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
I didn't speak any English when I went but I think with typical southern hospitality

86
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
Welcome with open arms

87
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
Can you fax the oak ridger

88
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,096
Newspaper of the small town of Oakridge recently had a three-part series

89
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
Interviewing with me so I really treasure the days

90
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
And I think the people are very warm and wonderful

91
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,824
The teachers were very patience

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
Look it up to speak with the language

93
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Did you encounter any difficulty at all

94
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,064
Well of course they're always you know some people unfamiliar with

95
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,696
Asian boy Oregon

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
A lot of people cutting

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
Occasionally when someone picks on me

98
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
And I didn't really know they were picking on me always be some other warm student will come to my

99
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
Has so I never had any real

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
I seriously

101
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
A 6 years

102
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
6 years yeah middle school and high school

103
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
For your Chinese amazing

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
So how do you

105
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
How to compute people search death

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
United basketball

107
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
Yeah so I went when I first went to the u.s. my mother said that I have a 2 wishes to things you must

108
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
If I let you go

109
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
First you have to marry a Chinese wife

110
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,751
Which I did not comment

111
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
I did that situation

112
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,359
The second was she said you need to write me a letter every week

113
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
And then she corrected every mistake on the letter

114
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,063
At the time phone calls were expensive there was no email

115
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,647
So it was all based on this one letter from me to her

116
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
She wrote the letter back

117
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
Correcting my previous letter

118
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
And then that help me keep up

119
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
My mother moved in with me

120
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
So they were have to write anything to her

121
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,055
Walmart my family

122
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Got it

123
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
And then you went to New York

124
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,199
I did very different City

125
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
That would prompt you to choose Cumbia

126
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Well Colombia is a very

127
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,671
Famous school for and I apply to a bunch of famous schools

128
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
And it was

129
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
I mean

130
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
Peking Chinese restaurant 1st and you go to the highest-ranked one that except

131
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,215
New York

132
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,359
No New York was a positive factor but I think I was still very much a Chinese mentality

133
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
How do you go to the ranks and say okay

134
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,503
Columbia's rank whatever number 7

135
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,855
Did you know you were going to study computer science when you went there

136
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
I did not

137
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,487
I enjoy computer science a lot in high school actually got exposed to it in high school but

138
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
I did yes IBM.

139
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Equivalent to 360

140
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,447
So when I went to Columbia I was going to study math

141
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:38,335
Because in Tennessee I was State winner in mathematics I thought I was really good

142
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,711
But it turned out in a Tennessee was a small state

143
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
I did not I did not do that well I was placed in the most advanced math class for 7 people

144
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
That was probably number 7 in the class

145
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
You get an A- just forever

146
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
Pretty good at it but then I also discovered that computer science

147
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
Which was a lot of fun than I thought that was a lot

148
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
Remember the first time you came across a computer

149
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,711
First time it was at the University of Chicago

150
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
High School sophomore year I went to there to study number Theory

151
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Special master

152
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
The class and then they gave me an account

153
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,327
Barely knew how to program I mostly play games on it

154
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
It was a lot of fun

155
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,911
But your brother didn't show you how to

156
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,519
Program computer no no he didn't have or know how to program one

157
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,591
Well he was he was a biochemist

158
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Okay

159
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Lemon juice

160
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Helena IR

161
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Columbia

162
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Quantum dots

163
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
I went to Carnegie Mellon

164
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
To school straight to school to the PHD program

165
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,207
Yeah I was fortunate to have had a professor John Kender

166
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Who was the CMU grad

167
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
And teaching at

168
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Columbia

169
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
And

170
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
He liked me a lot and recommended

171
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
I got into CMU

172
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
The best school and I was

173
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
So when was the first time you should

174
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Sure the term artificial intelligence

175
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,455
It was in my sophomore year at Columbia

176
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Darling

177
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
It was in a course are called natural language processing

178
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,439
I was taught by a professor who was a student of Roger schank

179
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Was one of the early

180
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
Cognitive science based natural language

181
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Experts

182
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
So

183
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
So we build systems using lisp

184
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
How to understand understand

185
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
I froze a dialogue system

186
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
It's light is what you would call we would call

187
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
A chatbot

188
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
Sowak would build a chatbot for my 19

189
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
80 + 81

190
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
What it was

191
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Intelligence

192
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
Nose in the

193
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Late 80s

194
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Fields medal

195
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
I'm fine

196
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Yazawa for breakthrough

197
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Siri

198
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Who knows

199
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Come to reality

200
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
Teens what are the

201
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
The critical Factor

202
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
Change

203
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Popular and so prevalent

204
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
Right I think the biggest factor is really the maturation of

205
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Even though

206
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
Are there were multiple ups and downs

207
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
There are times when neuron that works real hard.

208
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,743
Hidden Markov models for my PhD thesis which way the same class of neural Nets

209
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
Butter

210
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
And then they kept improving

211
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
And even though they were. If I don't I

212
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,959
Deep learning reinforcement learning those algorithmic improvements

213
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
And the people will continually work

214
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
That's the most important

215
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Boxer

216
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,871
Of course the author almost as important factor

217
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Is the availability of

218
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Huge amount

219
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Yeah because

220
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
The internet company

221
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,903
Exactly a lot of people think it's all algorithms but actually

222
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
You need to have a

223
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
Training with large amounts of data

224
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,047
And you need to tune your hours and based on the amount of data you have

225
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,887
Do you get more day that you improve your hours in better you get more data improve it better

226
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
And then. It already cycle

227
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,007
Is what I drove today and as you said

228
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
Who has the most day that was the internet companies

229
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
So the US is suck Google

230
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,711
Facebook Amazon China is Baidu Alibaba

231
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,319
So when you finish your PhD are you planning a career in a cup

232
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Gmail

233
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
I was

234
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
I stayed at honeydew melon

235
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
They made me

236
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
Assistant professor

237
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Yes yes I was

238
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
I research scientist and an assistant professor

239
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Skip the postdoc

240
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
You really made an exception because my PhD at a time

241
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
What's considered an important breakthrough in speech recognition

242
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Golf course in hangzhou

243
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
It really wasn't anything

244
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Close to good enough

245
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
But but I stayed and talked

246
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
And what led you from there

247
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
To work

248
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Call Tacos El Bebe

249
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Academia

250
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
2

251
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,695
L'accademia really wasn't quite for me

252
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
So I felt

253
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
All the work you need to do to get

254
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,351
Grand get students was a lot of busy work

255
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
Without the corresponding aha moment

256
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
When you can get to do exciting research

257
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Exciting

258
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
And actually more importantly University wasn't a great place to make things happen

259
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,407
Write papers it's still kind of Ivory Tower

260
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Still academic

261
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
I wanted to

262
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Change the world

263
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
And of course it was Apple that called

264
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
And it was

265
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,927
A similar style recruiting that said look do you want to spend your life

266
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
Writing useless papers or do you want to essentially the same things that job Steve

267
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,191
Jobs at the John sculley sugar water but useless paper

268
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
How big was Apple when you

269
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
Gosh I think was about

270
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,663
Suite 3000 I think it's been a long time I think

271
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
And what do you say was your proudest The Chew

272
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
When you are at

273
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Call my proudest achievement

274
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,439
Was getting on Wall Street Journal and Good Morning America

275
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
When we demonstrated our speech recognition

276
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
Which still again did not work but it was fun.

277
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
Close to working system because

278
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
We had a great team of Engineers

279
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
Tell my PhD algorithms a real time

280
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,383
It was really really fast faster than anybody else

281
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
But it wears wasn't good enough

282
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,295
Butts up whenever the last Wall Street Journal cover did the stock went up a few points

283
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
And then I go

284
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
It was in 1990

285
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
392 92-93

286
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
That's when I first remember you

287
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Caring about you

288
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
I'm reading the newspaper

289
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,887
I'm sorry I didn't work as well

290
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
If you are looking forward to buy a map to get to the market

291
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
Is it was not a failure but it was not not a success

292
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
Honolulu Airport

293
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
You look familiar

294
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
I was a pineapple for 6 years

295
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,599
And then towards the last two or three years it was discontinued around the playoff

296
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
I think from career development

297
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
You know I learned a lot in adversity

298
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Console people

299
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
Managing teams in good times and bad also got a bunch of promotions because my boss is skipped

300
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
Getting fired or so from being a manager to

301
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
Tovp Injustice I think about

302
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Two and a half

303
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,807
So it's it gave me a chance for Accelerated growth

304
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
I wanted also argue it was not too fast

305
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,951
I had to go back and relearn in another company's but

306
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Ultimately

307
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
The iterative rounds of layoffs

308
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Southwest is too much

309
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
SGI

310
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Resolve I thought wow that's a

311
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,031
That was an exciting company and little did I know I was

312
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,919
Jumping out of the Boiling Pot Into the Fire

313
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
Hallelujah SEI number

314
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Paula Stephan there

315
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
Justice 2 years

316
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
We we actually build the first set of web servers so I went to a totally different business

317
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,791
It was I with a profit-and-loss

318
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
3D technology for the web and then we fell down

319
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Web servers

320
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
What service were a big success

321
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
I'll make a few hundred million dollars

322
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
And then the 3D for the web was too early

323
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
It was called vrml virtual reality in 1996

324
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
And if I'm there you went to Microsoft

325
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
Yes and the time

326
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
I was actually ready to go out

327
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Ice Outlook

328
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,231
Every company I went to it ended up getting killed by winter

329
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Because winter was the windows in Endowment for them

330
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Guerrilla

331
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,055
Facing the market share issue and then Apple couldn't deal with it

332
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,199
Entailment our products are almost as good much cheaper and STI the same thing

333
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Market solution

334
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
People eating out

335
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,903
Yeah at first SGI workstation road with only things you can use for

336
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
Cobb movie animation but later

337
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
Wenzhou beginner yoga

338
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
And I sold so that's a

339
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Calls me to say okay I'm just going to have

340
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,655
After work for either Microsoft or Intel

341
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
But if that's the Wintel duopoly

342
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
So I interviewed at Microsoft

343
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
Intel got two job offers

344
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
And the chosen

345
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
What women do to stop Microsoft

346
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
Well I thought

347
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
Oh yes it was changed

348
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
Both companies offered me to had their research lab in China

349
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
And I think it was really my roots

350
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Insoft

351
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
Where is that I really didn't know much about semiconductors

352
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,911
I felt I want to work in a company where my expertise is at the

353
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
The core of the company

354
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
As opposed to ascending peripheral

355
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
ISO Microsoft with a software company

356
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
I saw that was trapped

357
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Austin Hardware companies

358
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
Apple NSG eyewear

359
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
Software was evaluated purely as

360
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
And to help yourself Hardware

361
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,319
And that Microsoft was maybe a first chance I could do so

362
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
How come both those companies were thinking about setting up

363
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Honda Center

364
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Incheon

365
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Going on up

366
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
I held it management team

367
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Think about that

368
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
I am guessing that one of them decided to do it first and the other herd

369
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
I suspect Microsoft shows first

370
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
And then I think Intel said hey Microsoft doing we should do

371
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Go to Microsoft

372
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Honey RV Center

373
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
India at a time

374
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
No no no

375
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,879
He was actually research incorp your fundamental research and both companies are doing that

376
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,999
And there certainly were no strong indication China would be an academic power attitude

377
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Yeah that's what's so surprising

378
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
Microsoft only had Redmond and Cambridge

379
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,959
That's Cambridgeshire UK and China Beijing with the desert

380
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,311
Did you expect that you will be working in China doing the

381
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,175
Oh yes yes yes it was specifically for that position

382
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,735
And I felt you know China

383
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,343
I met a lot of great Chinese employees fellow students

384
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
At Carnegie Mellon an apple

385
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
I saw that the people in China

386
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,535
We're incredibly hard-working very smart very motivated

387
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,119
Maybe not as good education as you ask but I felt

388
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Microsoft

389
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Could do something

390
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
If a brand is was strong and we could hire the smartest people

391
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
Being a Taiwanese election

392
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Hesitation

393
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
To work in Beijing

394
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,759
I know it was actually one of my father is

395
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Wishes on

396
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
On his Deathbed

397
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
I would spend time in

398
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,671
I saw my parents and emigrated from mainland China to

399
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:11,071
Emigrated move from a move

400
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Check exactly

401
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,959
So my father has always wanted to

402
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
I hope the move back himself

403
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Witchwood

404
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Wouldn't be materialized in his lifetime

405
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
But he thought I should

406
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,527
How is your adjustment process when you first started working in the mail

407
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Cuz you haven't really

408
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
Yeah but it was very open environment I think all the universities academic academic

409
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,583
We're very very curious they were wondering the same price as you are

410
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,191
Why would you pick Giant

411
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,519
What do you hope to do what

412
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,615
And then we showed no we really want to bring the smartest students

413
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,735
So we brought back from the US top researcher

414
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
A lot of people

415
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Very famous

416
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,975
Yeah yeah we're very fortunate there was just a wave of Chinese

417
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:16,863
Yes ma'am in China right I would say probably Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

418
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,519
What are the first grader China waved but largely not Mainland but definitely msra

419
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,151
Typically phds in their early mid-30s

420
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Who are rising stars

421
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
I'm almost all of them

422
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Born in

423
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,391
Yeah about other senior people or maybe yeah

424
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
80% point in mainland China

425
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
The junior people are 100%

426
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Guava juice

427
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,655
And how did you first meet his car into a recent TV show

428
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,239
The account they said that you met Eric Schmidt on the golf course

429
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,871
Yes I did well I actually went back to Microsoft headquarters

430
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,431
And then when I heard that Google was starting

431
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
It's on us

432
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Google China presence

433
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
I thought I had the right combination because

434
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
The school wanted to R&D

435
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
They wanted someone who understood China

436
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Communicate

437
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
What's Silicon Valley culture

438
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,047
So actually volunteered myself and send an email to Eric Schmidt

439
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,119
And then we were arranged to meet

440
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
I mostly because

441
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
There were too many Microsoft people interviewing

442
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
And they

443
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
Saltado

444
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,687
I would prefer not to be seen by a lot of Microsoft?

445
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
Google what tips do you have for

446
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
People who are

447
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
Trying to attract owls

448
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Join their company

449
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,511
Well I think you have to find people with the right cultural fit

450
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
And you have to have a very high bar

451
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,631
And you have to show

452
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
The people's Iraq map

453
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
In your company

454
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
And iiii

455
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
I think you want to find people

456
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
The people who the rights culture and the background

457
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
Will generally find it to be

458
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
Because people will want to work with people

459
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
Quora similar minded equally smart

460
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,551
And they can learn from

461
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,367
And in a culture that nurturing

462
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
And also

463
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
Consistent with the values that they believe in

464
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,280
So I think part of it is you got to pick up

465
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
Who to Target

466
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
And then and it happening

467
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,728
Incredibly important original nucleus of people who are themselves

468
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
And then attract more people

469
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Over the top

470
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Crew

471
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
People

472
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Google give me

473
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,744
Yeah what's Microsoft's the top reasons were

474
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
This is the

475
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Only place

476
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
Statscan do fundamental research with the freedom

477
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
And you will

478
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
Be helped with the team

479
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Super smart young people

480
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
Incredibly hard-working you remember how it was for you

481
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
And then Microsoft as a brand

482
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,480
Offer Google it was some this was a chance to really build up

483
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
A business

484
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
That's could be

485
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Phenomenal

486
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
And that combined business engineering everything we happy empowerment

487
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
After headquarters

488
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,000
Second is the Google brand itself.

489
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
Add the time Google was

490
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Clear and by far

491
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
The most attractive company to Europe

492
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
Exactly

493
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Workforce

494
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,520
And then the third would be all the wonderful

495
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,080
Actually not so important but

496
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Incredibly important

497
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,176
Recruiting the wonderful the benefit

498
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
I thought we had a

499
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
Executive chef

500
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,832
Lobster for lunch at

501
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
All kind of benefits

502
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
In the US there was

503
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Doing yard

504
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
Laundry for you and all the other good stuff

505
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
So all those benefits

506
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Actually did work

507
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
In attacking people

508
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,656
Even though I don't think they work or

509
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
As far as the long-term

510
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
How would you define the culture

511
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Google China

512
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,176
We wanted to really have an independent mindset

513
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,504
That because I felt the only way Google China could succeed

514
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
Was to

515
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,088
Delete this is your own company

516
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
And go after it

517
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,696
And in order to do that we wanted to

518
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,488
Have the Google values

519
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
But have the freedom

520
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,352
To really I roll out new product features

521
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
And

522
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,448
Iterate and show numbers in terms of

523
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
Market growth and

524
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,544
And also advertising Revenue growth

525
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
So it was a probably

526
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,152
Almost like a startup within the compass

527
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
When do you think you had the first

528
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Claim that Google my name

529
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
I need to leave

530
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
I I didn't

531
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
I didn't

532
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,464
I think the Google business so went up for the first 3 years

533
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
That I was there the market share went up significantly

534
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,632
Revenues were almost a billion dollars that search share went up

535
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
Sure sure was about to Triple

536
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
My tenure

537
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
But the last year

538
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,312
I think there were

539
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
Some difficulties

540
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
I think

541
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Hardly just do to Google

542
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,248
Feeling that okay time to build one

543
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
One Google

544
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
And not have this you know

545
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Difference

546
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
Everything being different

547
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,464
Because all the products features a lot of code was for

548
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
And people were questioning Hey look

549
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,864
Google now has expanded successfully throughout the world then maybe China should you

550
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
Just be like any other country

551
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
So I didn't have as much freedom

552
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Has asked

553
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
Before and also I think they are

554
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
It was the one year when Google's Financial numbers were not

555
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,408
The greatest last numbers

556
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
The last budget

557
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
As far as to attract

558
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
Traffic and usage in marketing

559
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
So those those were the

560
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,368
Some of the challenges we faced

561
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
But also I think I would

562
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,744
More I left Google because not because of the challenges

563
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
But because I saw the opportunity

564
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,632
I saw that mobile was going to be a huge deal

565
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,704
Harley being in Google I saw the power of Android

566
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,360
And then I saw that the entrepreneurial energy the entrepreneurs and the BCS were growing in China

567
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
But there was a gap in the

568
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Early seed-stage funding

569
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
So I thought feeling. Gap

570
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
What's v my technical background

571
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
And also be a lot of fun to help young people

572
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Car companies

573
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
So that was really the

574
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
Started with A and Q

575
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Beijing model

576
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
That's right right

577
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Right now

578
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
As you evolve them Auto

579
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Alaska

580
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
70 years

581
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
What were some of the

582
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
The biggest

583
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Lessons

584
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Takeaways

585
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,944
Right so our model today is

586
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,248
Basically a VC model

587
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
It's Wheaton Aston series A and B

588
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
We still do angel deals when we can

589
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,744
We rarely we don't incubate but I don't want any more investing early stage

590
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
Stop ta deal sweat when one comes along

591
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
I think we pride ourselves on being very

592
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
Technically

593
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
Knowledgeable

594
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
Picking the right trans

595
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,288
And we

596
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,128
We we still have a lot of the early spirit that we love our

597
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,944
Entrepreneurs we have a very strong service team

598
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
To help in terms of marketing PR

599
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Oanda

600
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
Finance legal and so on so we have a big team

601
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,440
That's continues to help the entrepreneurs even though it's series A&B

602
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
What is a service mentality the

603
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
Prawn entrepreneur mentality

604
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,864
Yeah and then we have now in a Eye Institute

605
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Which is now

606
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
Implementing AI

607
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,008
But also helping RVC is that deal referral and judgment

608
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,408
That's maybe a little bit like you know Greylock and Benchmark in the technical

609
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,016
Type little bit like Andreessen Horowitz Enterprise Services operations

610
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,600
And maybe a little bit like a Google Ventures and happy are all engineers

611
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
So we're trying to make

612
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Make this model work.

613
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
The fund is doing well

614
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
But in retrospect you asking me what things out I learned that were maybe not quite as I originally expected

615
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
I think it is

616
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,728
Is probably obvious to you hun that many people in DC now

617
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,032
And then myself too but at the time

618
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,104
I thought a nurturing incubation environment

619
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
Could help a lot of people

620
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,712
Philips there areas in which there not strong

621
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
And increase your chance of

622
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,064
However I think in retrospect

623
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
I think the strongest

624
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,904
Finally successful entrepreneurs

625
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
Are so strong and you're so confident

626
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
I think they feel

627
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
An entity like an incubus

628
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,936
Or someone who for the watches over them like a teacher or even a boss is something that's highly on

629
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Undesirable

630
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
The great entrepreneurs want to be independent

631
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
They want to be

632
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,360
Funded they want to give

633
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Be given import

634
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,456
But they need to be their own boss

635
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,064
And they're big and strong and powerful and confident they'll make mistakes

636
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
Comes from learning from the mistakes

637
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Not from a teacher

638
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,232
Who guides them along the way so that's how we made our roll ships

639
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
The one that I think is more

640
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
Complimentary

641
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
2 people who are off

642
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
It's a typo

643
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Strong

644
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
I just hope I can

645
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Older

646
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:33,152
Yeah. Yes space changes a lot because in the early stages were doing mobile

647
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
It was very young

648
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
Because the money is because

649
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
At that time PC people wear in the mid-thirties

650
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,136
And they couldn't change their mindset so he's one General

651
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
And so we back young people lights very Lean Startup very low small amounts of money

652
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
And a very small amount of money was enough

653
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,888
Because it was a three engineers

654
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,728
But now as we going to heavier Styles where you have to

655
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,288
You know I think about new retail new house

656
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
I think about new education you actually have to

657
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
A big customer acquisition

658
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,968
You may have even offline activities

659
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,552
And also the Chinese competition evolve differently from the US

660
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
Having us continues to feel

661
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
Light startup is good life isn't always good

662
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
Mark Zuckerberg exactly but in China

663
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
The competition is so fierce

664
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,632
That's if you have a light model someone might copy you or do to

665
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Ride the next wave

666
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
So you have to really build very big deep Moats

667
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
And the most often have to do with

668
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
Ugly offline and the expensive

669
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,688
Capital expenditure or summer

670
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Experience experience

671
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
Ricer Miata

672
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,416
Exactly something so the amount of money we put in has to be a lot more even though series and the people tend to be

673
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
The older more experienced

674
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
I will start running larger

675
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,816
So what advice do you have for a US company

676
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
A sweet one

677
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
Inter China is

678
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
She giving you a

679
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Google Tim Cook salary

680
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
Recently that you can change the

681
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
From the sidelines

682
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,336
What he was defending apples moved

683
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Comply with Beijing

684
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Regulation

685
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
Yeah oh I'm more to the question

686
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Wenzhou have done well

687
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Going to be

688
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Morton

689
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,576
Starbucks

690
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
The internet guy

691
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Yeah

692
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
I I think

693
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
Foreign companies will have a tougher time than beef

694
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,704
On the one hand China is a big lucrative Market everyone should try to enter in

695
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Participate

696
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:37,312
But said the good days when Procter & Gamble could comment

697
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
Just take it all is done

698
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Starbucks

699
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Public was one of the

700
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,944
Last entrance yes that will have

701
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Kind of

702
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
Mindshare they have

703
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
Finding the next one will happen

704
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
Be tougher because the

705
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Chinese brand builders are getting better

706
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Minang traditional

707
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
I think it's

708
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:58,560
American company shouldn't take it

709
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,144
Internet companies have it maybe it'll even harder

710
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,216
Apple is the one example of success but you could argue

711
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,264
Did not have internet company

712
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,080
So an American Technology Company I would have

713
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
Have to advise

714
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
I want is if possible get a Chinese partner

715
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
And

716
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,808
I want to be part of this summer I've also try to get deceased

717
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,880
Find a local entrepreneur that's another model

718
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
If you are

719
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
If you are in a

720
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,376
Press certain areas may be a state-owned company or a bank

721
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
It all depends

722
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,984
Internet company maybe bat was good but

723
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,568
So so I think you have to evaluate but having someone who knows local

724
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
Yep that's core

725
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
And that that's important

726
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,456
Who buys I have is if you have a

727
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,272
Very strong technology differentiation

728
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
Consider selling the technology

729
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
Consider license

730
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
Because that's another way

731
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
That's you

732
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,304
China is now very much much better in respecting IP I think

733
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,192
Technology licensing to be a very good and easy business you don't have to deal with the complexities of all the

734
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
Local market and running

735
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
So

736
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,872
What would you saying is the most successful us

737
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:24,832
Apple would certainly be one of them they're doing okay so far although I think they're facing some challenges

738
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
As well

739
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,208
There's not not not to be growing but

740
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
I think

741
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
They

742
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
Carolina

743
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
I think

744
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
Actually some traditional companies are still

745
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
I build a strong enough roots

746
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,520
They're still doing okay IBM being one example.

747
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,616
They have a very strong brand very strong local partnership ecosystem

748
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,152
Those are probably two

749
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Styles to consider

750
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,320
But they're also Hardware companies like Intel and video I think they're also doing

751
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
Because they're kind of a

752
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Lap dance

753
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
That infrastructure

754
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
It's a little bit easier to

755
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
It's a little bit like Licensing hours

756
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
What do you think

757
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Yahoo

758
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Adult

759
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Uber

760
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
In a while to realize

761
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Yes you more of a

762
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
15 motivate

763
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Yes

764
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
I think so

765
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
I think so I think

766
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
Are there Uber deal was

767
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,064
A very shrewd to be down there where the time it that that they did

768
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,392
And I think the Alibaba Yahoo maybe a little bit of luck

769
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:38,048
Because the time it was hard to Envision the way things will play out

770
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,608
But nevertheless I think Jerry saw Jack

771
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,216
As an amazing amazing God

772
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,520
That's right so I think it is

773
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,920
Maybe you well informed from the people angle but the business side garage different did not see it play out this way

774
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
It was great

775
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,600
Who recently wrote a piece for the economist about a phenomenal as a lamo or Alzheimer's with offline

776
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Do you think

777
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,928
So the boundary between all my offline

778
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
Is being lured you think China is ahead of it

779
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,816
In which area of application are you most excited

780
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,216
Price online merges with offline is when you can capture everything in the physical world

781
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,800
Digitize it and upload it and combine with online

782
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
So it when you're shopping

783
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Actually

784
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,248
The fact you picked up some products are bought some product that's captured and combine with your online pattern

785
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
That could be done with your sister

786
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:37,440
Online payments you could also be done with a video camera or other are there sensors and mechanisms

787
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
The entire o m o is

788
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,096
Is is huge in China because we see it hitting

789
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,168
A lot of areas including retail

790
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Including

791
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,520
Public transportation including education

792
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
And also

793
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
If you look at the amount of digital activity

794
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
Best happening in offline

795
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
China Islam

796
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Away passing the US

797
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Online wise

798
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
Yunnan China

799
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
Mobile users is maybe three or four times

800
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
Us

801
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
But in terms of online

802
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Payment

803
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,816
He is so much bigger online

804
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
Especially offline Mobile payment is off the chart

805
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,936
Is over over 50 x

806
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
And then that's enabling

807
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
So in China I think the

808
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Biggest enabler

809
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,384
How much is as much as we love a i&o mo

810
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,944
We think a huge enabler that's already happened

811
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Is the

812
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Mobile payment

813
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,808
Now in China over 600 million people

814
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
Can do a peer-to-peer

815
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
Micropayments

816
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,952
And almost frictionless almost without Commission

817
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,280
Exchanges to each other and that will empower

818
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
Many times of applications

819
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
So are investments

820
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
T-Mobile

821
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
You know that some of the live streaming

822
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
And

823
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,336
Food delivery that's all taken off because Mobile payment will be the enabler

824
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,640
That will make everything happen a lot faster

825
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
So I think the offline

826
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Payment

827
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
I will unlock

828
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,040
Alana song gross

829
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
An accelerated ways even faster than beef

830
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Before

831
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,488
So you know if you asked me to predict future of AI as possible China are you as well be ahead

832
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,072
But if you ask about the future poema

833
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,120
About the mobile payment driven

834
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
Online offline merging creating value

835
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
There's no doubt

836
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
China will be the leader in

837
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
Normal asked questions.

838
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,104
When you get a Microsoft

839
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
Once you had a

840
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:34,944
Open letters

841
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Concussion

842
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
2

843
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
A lot of the Chinese

844
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
Also

845
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Buku lineup

846
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Coming

847
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,160
The future president

848
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Baidu answer

849
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
Ciccio's on 10th and and and and

850
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,584
What made you capable of

851
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Pretty August

852
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
In the first place

853
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,936
And what do you think someone like me

854
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
For any other one

855
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Well I think

856
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,688
There is a place and time for everything

857
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,760
There was a time when Microsoft brand was the most amazing

858
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
There's a time when Google was a most amazing

859
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,136
And there are times NBA team

860
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
And now I think the age of entrepreneurs

861
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
So I think it's hard to

862
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
Fight against the trend

863
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,120
I think actually the entrepreneurial trend is the most powerful

864
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,216
Including the government's support for the mass entrepreneur and innovation

865
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Campaign

866
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
As well as I think the

867
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
The parents and the

868
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
The young people themselves

869
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
I thinking differently

870
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,968
So I think it's hard to watch with somebody's mind and force them to

871
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,528
Still think some companies hot when it's not

872
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,832
I think right now

873
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
If you want to follow the trend

874
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,416
People want to be entrepreneurs

875
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
They want to learn how to be entrepreneur

876
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
And I think we're in the fortunate position as Avicii

877
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,096
To be able to connect to those people

878
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
And find a way to fulfill the dream

879
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
My last question

880
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
What you and I have

881
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,920
Using that

882
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
City phone number

883
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
What do you think of someone a mod

884
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,232
Well I I think the

885
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,792
I think the China model is very hard to reply

886
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
I actually don't think it will

887
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,912
Can be replicated at anything close to China scale

888
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,520
Partly is because I think China have all the things happening at the same time

889
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Very hard-working Industrial

890
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
Industrious

891
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
Population

892
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
Plenty of capital coming in

893
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,248
The willingness to take risks and

894
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,112
All of those things at the right time and the

895
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,232
The ride Revolution came along with the internet's mobile now ai

896
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,048
So it was almost a perfect storm

897
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,376
Design perfect square for China to go from

898
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,936
A poor country to manufacturing now into tap

899
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,288
That cannot necessarily be replicated for other countries because

900
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
Are the initial step of

901
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
Using cheap labor

902
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
To gain a strong ground hold in the world is may not be doable because

903
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
He's taking a lot of those jobs

904
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,856
So it's not clear

905
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
Having more

906
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,952
Unskilled laborers is a benefit to large population

907
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,256
Country anymore that's the number one reason

908
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,072
The other thing is those are perfect storm elements

909
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
Are just hard to realign for another country

910
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,192
So I think what's most likely to happen is

911
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,264
China and US War each become a very strong

912
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
Powerful corner

913
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
The Otherworld

914
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,664
With its software Technologies know-how and

915
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
Going into other countries

916
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Write a Chinese camp

917
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
An American Cup

918
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
Right so that will happen in many different ways you know Google is used to Facebook are used to expanding their own presence

919
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
Subsidiaries

920
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
In Chinese companies maybe be here

921
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Or even tell me

922
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,960
Write in China some of those companies are expanding himself like xiaomi

923
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,776
Some companies are doing Investments like

924
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,080
Some companies are doing startups

925
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
But still not leaving China

926
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
But like the you know Tokyo copycat

927
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,456
Two different countries

928
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,296
And the live streaming CopyCats in the bicycle copycats

929
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,600
Those are necessarily biome

930
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,904
Xiaomi or

931
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
So older models

932
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
Chinese Laundry wedge sandals

933
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Yes I think in the end

934
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,864
China and us will really play very big role

935
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,704
The other countries were obviously the ones with bigger markets and more

936
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,008
Advanced infrastructure will still enjoy

937
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Good growth

938
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:48,128
But it's hard to really a replication that you admire the most

939
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
The entrepreneur I think

940
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Would have to be Steve Jobs

941
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,112
I think he has the boldness to dream The Impossible

942
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
And also

943
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,440
Learning to become a better leader

944
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,000
Now he's obviously had a lot of issues and faults

945
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
And had to leave and come back

946
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,864
But I think God he is in thought they inimitable

947
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
What's up

948
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
And work

949
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Best decision

950
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
Probably

951
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:24,480
I think I have to say marry my wife but professionally my moving to China

952
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,064
Yeah I think the

953
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
Worst decision

954
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
Is probably

955
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,952
Just generally believing

956
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,768
Speech recognition could work in the 90

957
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304

Without learning

960
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,192
From the previous lesson but eventually I learned

961
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
