A setting of China has 1.4 billion paper

236
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119

245
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Gelato

246
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Probably need to

247
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
To tackle a problem

248
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
So possible today a month later

249
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,207
Are you still in the honeymoon period or

250
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,351

00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
Seems like

253
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Occupy myself as a problem solver

254
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
I really like so problem

255
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,615
August 5th everybody know if you notice something too comfortable

256
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
I could leave email when they're coming to mail be the most leave

257
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,527
Most livable city in the world

258
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,135
So if I could choose like a Aqueduct Interstate Melvin I could be a lecturer you knowing

259
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
MLB diversity

260
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,023
I really enjoy all the problems and and the most important or the problem solving

261
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
I think that what does veritas

262
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
Is very important to connect to a mission

263
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
We want to see the world

264
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
There is no strangers

265
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Santino people can travel

266
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Have the best experience

267
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
Being a hot Coachella myself I think

268
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
The best

269
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Experience a traveler's Journal have this kind of War

270
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Amingo Visa Locos

271
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Say something

272
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Like a local

273
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
So that's the best

274
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
About travel

275
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,695
And I do believe that's a reason why people want to try

276
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
I think life is like a journey

277
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
The Nanny

278
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Actress Limited

279
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,351
But the voice is defined by yourself

280
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
If you want

281
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Broaden your beef

282
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
You have to travel

283
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
Will travel you actually another people's life

284
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
I fundamentally this

285
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
People white people going to travel

286
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Slappy leaving the experience

287
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
NBC building

288
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
Exactly what you attract

289
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,271
Two people special people that young people in the real nice

290
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
This is exactly what they want

291
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,879
So this is something I feel like every day of February

292
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
You know very tight schedule already feel very passionate

293
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Could you talk about your

294
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Communication with

295
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
US headquarters

296
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
So far

297
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
What has encouraged you and what have been some

298
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Of the challenges

299
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
The sings like a Hot Wheel

300
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
It's been a difference

301
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
About China

302
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
One of the

303
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
One of the symptoms you know actually sit well

304
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,575
No actually he's allowed to propagate in the u.s. codicil

305
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Xfinity from saying that

306
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
Chinese magnetic diplopia system

307
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
Sulekha for example the US is more like

308
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
Leica Android is very very open at

309
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
Antonis like iOS is very close you could have everything right

310
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
So think about if you do something

311
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
Prada program from

312
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Windows to Mac

313
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,359
You look you just don't send pictures like a Ridah interface

314
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
You asked me to review the code

315
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
So that's exactly the effort

316
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,527
I tried to expand the US can call this you should do

317
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
So this is where you would have liked a visit unit in

318
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
In Beijing so we have engineers

319
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
Pretty have a full stack people here

320
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
So we also

321
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,839
Hot people have the startup mentality

322
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
And we try to recruit the most aggressive people

323
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
And

324
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Aggressive and penance

325
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Keep them very ambitious girl

326
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
You spell them by the Pecos

327
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
So I think that's only saying

328
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
You can do the right until you can do to be in China

329
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Take a lot of us

330
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Founders have difficulty

331
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Nazi

332
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
China s just another

333
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
A lot of them

334
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
Consider China as like an international market is they don't under

335
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Thurston Howell

336
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
You need to

337
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Start everything

338
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,583
Scratch you get the impression that the Airbnb

339
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
Co-founders have been more receptive

340
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
And open-minded

341
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Perhaps other USA

342
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Founders

343
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,335
Yeah I think they're very open-minded I think a

344
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
Nate trailer 2

345
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
A channel number times

346
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
And actress do you know his high frequency

347
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
I think being physically in one place

348
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Actually will

349
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
Make you instantly realized

350
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
This is a different opencv

351
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
So

352
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
In order to make this happen

353
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
I was so

354
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Initial program

355
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Turn off side business.

356
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,959
Supposed to bring all the senior folks from San Francisco to Beijing

357
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
So what has all the people

358
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
What is the biggest shark the biggest

359
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
Shut for them apart from the big buildings is like

360
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
People Kia

361
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Actually travel

362
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Ibiza Beach Republican do nothing

363
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
So basically

364
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
Which app is so important before daddy no

365
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
All the payments of sanctions to do something

366
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
Pretty important

367
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
What is that important

368
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,055
So this is something that we miss is going to communication people into Rihanna this is

369
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,639
WeChat pay alipay it just like Patton

370
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Chinese daily life

371
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
So this is very different from the credit card in US

372
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
So so I think this can listen to help them a lot

373
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Twins dad in the water

374
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
The difference

375
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
So I

376
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
Attempt to use the APA system to describe the difference

377
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
So if you want to pull a program to China you had to rewrite the code

378
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
You just don't repeat on interface

379
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
I'm in in terms of

380
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Speak out

381
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
WeChat is an Airbnb

382
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Now has a WeChat Mini

383
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Any program

384
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
We just talk about how that

385
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Came about

386
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127

387
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Your head after you

388
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991

389
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783

390
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319

Open cyst

393
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
So weak with toes

394
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,535
They had called I know it's another way to broaden our top on a Chevy

395
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
So we designed that

396
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
Button hot baby just make the world globally

397
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Because

398
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Indian has lots of globalist

399
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,847
Saudi lots of things that should not have like a dirty work at the Baga need to be having snot like a local startup just

400
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
Udemy program you can do in one week

401
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
So with your dad and we have to need all agreements

402
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
And we also need

403
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Make sure everybody is

404
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Committed

405
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Lesbian Veracruz

406
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
Program has increased tremendously fast

407
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
So we also

408
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
Well how many program we can do lots of

409
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,655
Chinese Palace Kendall campaign

410
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,983
Like a communication of the red packet

411
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,103
And also connected to the WeChat app Apple account

412
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
So they should be one of the across driver for us

413
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Nothing

414
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
We bought a destination stage

415
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
I think there's more to come

416
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
Everybody has been putting a lot of resources

417
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
As we all know

418
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
Airbnb experiences

419
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
Could talk about how everything's purses

420
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Developing China Inn

421
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Are there Chinese

422
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,655
Consumers embracing it and wire that's where the opportunities

423
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Json challenges

424
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Yeah

425
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Experience

426
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,335
All company strategy I think it's very important for us to

427
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
To provide

428
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
Do you use a magic Journey

429
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
So

430
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
I think a few years ago we only have 10 experience in Shanghai

431
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,343
Now we have like a more than two cells

432
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Experiences

433
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
More than 10 cities

434
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
In China

435
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,767
So the experience has grown tremendously

436
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
Experience

437
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
What we do is

438
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
We actually are

439
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,263
Try to make sure this is something unique offer to the

440
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Guest

441
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
So doing the experiments

442
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
We find out

443
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
Or the Chinese gas

444
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
Especially young people did want to redefine travel

445
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
So this can't experiment too damn is a bayou.

446
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Experience

447
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
And he's actually easier to Jenna world of mouse

448
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
So we have a very good momentum for experience in China

449
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
What are the most popular

450
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Types of

451
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
Most popular like a

452
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Photowalk

453
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,983
Basically you some people take you to walk around

454
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,031
The metropolitan cities

455
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
They gave us to talk about history and

456
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
How to take some photos

457
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
I just like

458
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Experience

459
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
Insignia just back from trip from Sydney

460
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
So that was amazing

461
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,855
So basically is a is Australian guy used to study in China

462
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
So he gave us

463
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,463
The experience a group of Chinese cursing in Chinese

464
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Talk about

465
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
So Olivia Satterfield artino this is

466
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Text me the number have

467
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Is kennel cough grade of the traditional

468
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
This candle like apus

469
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
So

470
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
Young people they just

471
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,615
Right away to try to swipe another WeChat

472
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Newman's

473
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
So I think for this kind of thing

474
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
Is a way for us to really fun travel

475
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
Other things you know could it be

476
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
Some something about

477
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,975
At night night for example you want to experience some kind of like pops

478
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
So there is some local take you have some drink

479
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
So this is a very popular experience

480
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Ambien

481
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
For the people joining those are

482
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,471
Experiences are they mostly

483
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Taurus or a local

484
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
I think we can see the more of the more actually people

485
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
U2 experience at for the weekend

486
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
So they do not disturb the listing

487
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,575
Today actually know the way

488
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
To extend travel

489
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
So you can see in Shanghai or Beijing

490
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,023
They have people meet in the city or come from the a nearby City to come to Beijing

491
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Another way to

492
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Who discovered the city

493
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
So basically I think we position ourselves

494
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,471
How to help people just like a live like a local

495
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,031
So this is the important ingredients

496
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
2 hour accommodation capability

497
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,199
So people leave their you know in the condition they want to find out what to do nearby

498
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
So sometimes you also have a dinner

499
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Ibiza

500
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
Some people who is kind of like a

501
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Athena table

502
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
So

503
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,439
So this is, I find out he's a young people really like

504
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Deserve

505
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
So people tend to POF

506
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,815
You know superfan about that

507
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,399
The number to City Hall and get started in a people really like this

508
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Experience

509
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
Sue a person already believed experience

510
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Biblical verb be

511
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
And was so I will working on

512
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,199
A number ways how to make cooking and enlisting and experience very smooth

513
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
So how do you decide which

514
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Experiences

515
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Is 2

516
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Select

517
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
And feature

518
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Airbnb

519
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Sofa

520
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,023
Basically there is a category of we have a design for experience

521
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Dubai expensive

522
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Appear before

523
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
So there is kind of like a lion

524
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
A song that uses feedback

525
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
You know they have good reviews

526
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Conversion

527
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
The second is actually we also look at

528
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,615
What's the next city beach

529
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Youknowdenise conservacion

530
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
People

531
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,271
After booking they want to look for something to do

532
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,599
Experiments

533
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
To make sure the experience

534
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,463
Already fit the user's needs

535
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,047
So or the numbers can tell us which ones on the app works

536
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
Which way is actually not exactly what

537
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,167
People want when you do some work on that

538
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
So this is something like that we have a

539
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
Set a very classy bedroom

540
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
To improve the

541
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Product

542
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,175
Ultimately I think this is something we protect our water

543
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
User Journey

544
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,295
For you sir Johnny is a candle of non-standard experience

545
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
It'll be one speed unique

546
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
How to make a scalable

547
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,719
Is the saying we had to break down the basic non-standard

548
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
To the standard components

549
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
So we will

550
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
Identify what a key component to make

551
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
To make up a unique

552
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:59,007
I think all of these is a candle like a advantage of Barry afford to accumulate

553
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Because of window

554
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,335
Exactly what the host one

555
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
And what guess what

556
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
And we will fund the things which make discoverable

557
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,783
So actually some of the experience and now he's in the brig please gaming mode

558
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
How many countries

559
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
So so I think that's something I think we find out

560
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
It's a very exciting

561
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
So sounds like that

562
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
Experiences in China

563
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
Is becoming more

564
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
Weekend

565
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Which means

566
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Will be a higher frequency

567
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216

624
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
The setting of Chinese gets ready

625
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616

So they were

628
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Somehow Mandarin concierge

629
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,808

645
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,088
Distance Lance and Cindy

646
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Princess

647
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
In the early days of Airbnb China

648
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
You guys were more focused on

649
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Chinese outbound

650
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Then

651
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
Inbound

652
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,400

00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
It's a travel visa cross-border

656
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
And we have this black Rubber Company

657
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
So

658
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,712
Migos make sure that

659
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,784
Can plate with full potential

660
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
So everything just happened naturally

661
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
So people

662
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
First the first wave

663
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
People don't know and baby the girl bounce

664
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
They have a very good experience

665
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
The comeback to become

666
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
Maybe a house in Shanghai

667
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,912
And they know some people from Suzhou they they come to Shanghai Define there is a

668
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
Beautifully singing Pusheen

669
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,264
So did they have great experience the compass

670
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
Suzhou did they have at least as well

671
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,920
And this is how they go so busy is ordinary fact he was very very strong

672
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Especially where community-driven

673
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:28,064
So we always have the first candle like a missionary a user's

674
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
Because they believe this candle like your human interaction

675
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
So I think

676
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Mortar mixer

677
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,584

And offline support

682
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,800
So make sure they're not alone so there is some

683
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,128
People we know we work together to a provider scandal

684
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664

And they know Lisa Hernandez

782
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,688
I feel like it was some kind of the destiny and it was so

783
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
Everything works pretty well you know

784
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272

And you know the industry in the world to solve

787
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904

Establish credibility

801
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
With

802
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Folks in a

803
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Headquarters

804
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Back home in Darien

805
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
San Francisco

806
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,160
Nothing first one at the end is the company really playing the valley

807
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,488
The way I think I can natural fit in Elven culture

808
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
Read like a

809
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,840
The very interesting experience of an experience I join here

810
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,400
I don't feel like the first day I just feel like you know here

811
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:35,264
I don't feel like getting used to it like I talk to people and

812
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,664
I just feel like we're the same people so that's very unique just like you don't need to have people to jumpstart like to educate

813
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,736
Culture why seem like that

814
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,600
The next part is basically I think the training at any Mackenzie Ziegler healthy

815
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:54,464
How to use constructive thinking communication analytical

816
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,536
So anything is the back by Logic and

817
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
The numbers

818
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
So Def

819
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
You know 10 some kind of like a

820
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
Credibility

00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
The People Sing you're not just like

822
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
They're passionate results

823
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
I think about the reality

824
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
I think I have

825
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Close to seven years

826
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
Ultralight spinning travel

827
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
I don't know

828
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
Bisacodyl bad is ready ready

829
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
Great learning experience and the

830
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
I think that's wrong

831
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
Alachua

832
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
2sinx

833
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Straight to the problem

834
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:29,536
So basically there is no Samsung Note 3 for PC why do the problem I like to communicate directly

835
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
Because I want to solve the problem

836
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
Something Orchestra sings help me

837
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,680
To communicate I feel like a

838
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
People are here 1/2

839
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Realize the mission

840
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,800
Saudi riyal Committees of the problem

841
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
So I have no problem coming to vary directly

842
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,920
Especially not have this can look like a candle

843
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
Trash from the Thunders

844
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,528
Circus just like Speed Run Away by the problem

845
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
I don't worry about it

846
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
Weather should rephrase

847
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
Because I know everybody's

848
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Believe

849
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,000
We all have the same vision of the problem

850
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,816
A lot of people in Airbnb

851
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
San Francisco

852
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
So you deaf

853
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Thanks

854
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,752
So when you are starting a startup in the travel space why did you pay

855
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
Content sharing

856
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
As

857
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
You are starting

858
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
Seriously

859
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
To be honest

860
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
I just feel like okay

861
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
I have this candle like a

862
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
Nation I think

863
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
The proofs of memories are important parts

864
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000
But he's always getting on

865
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
I think it's real nice

866
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
What's the best material that

867
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
So the learning semi is learning

868
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
Lots of light interaction

869
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
And also

870
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
UPS entrepreneur you grow the business

871
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
I think all those things

872
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Exactly

873
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Get you know deeper of the industry

874
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,664
Another reason from counties actually

875
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
Got another waiver for mobile internet

876
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
Set a timer

877
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
I choose

878
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
The Ultimate Warrior travel

879
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Another mobile

880
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
Soboba Indian that is easy.

881
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:07,072
So we designed a candle like a application basically

882
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
Official by Apple

883
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
So that's actually Hawkins.

884
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
So

885
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
Doing the learning

886
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
Experience of from Wauchula

887
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
See the numbers

888
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
And the fruit but you see the use of the requirement

889
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
How to make you realize

890
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
What is the

891
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
And what is the

892
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
Strategy and also the secret of travel

893
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
So that's actually I think what a believer

894
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
Nbnb

895
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,976
The most important common people

896
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
Four people anyways accommodation

897
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
You have to offer that

898
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,912
That kind of like copy9 is a people radio looking for

899
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
So that's a thing you know how where you from

900
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
What was the biggest challenge

901
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
Yuan calendar

902
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
Wellbutrin

903
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Retro

904
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
Some lessons

905
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
You need to be the super team so that's I think

906
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
The team is very important you need to empower team

907
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,856
You need to set the right culture

908
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,648
The couch wrestling

909
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,720
The most important I believe I think that you should treat a team like

910
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Sporting

911
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
So

912
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
Everybody have to grow

913
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,376
Sucrose is the most important for employees

914
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,520
So I think there is a mistake to make he's like you think you're very nice to the

915
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,616
Happy but you don't think about me bro special for me I will fix a lot

916
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,200
Imprudently make people everybody for their full potential

917
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
Japanese kabedon

918
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
Just like a coach

919
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
Sometimes it is something like a

920
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
Great analogy

921
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
That's our experience as well

922
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,696
So what kind of town are you looking to add

923
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
2 MB China

924
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,280
And how can our listeners

925
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Reach out and getting

926
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:49,216
Put the tenant in we won't have in China basically first appear in a vision you know the waist way one.

927
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
The second is actually they have to be a pretty down-to-earth they can solve problem the next thing we want girl

928
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,944
Actually we want the field of non capability

929
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
Enable in a we have

930
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Ecuador flight spirit

931
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
The Simpsons

932
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
Kenny the music Rose mentality

933
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
The people

934
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
You should have a very strong teeth at The Grove

935
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
And we also should get used to change

936
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
So did you

937
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
You know any reorg

Do desert rose opportunity

940
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,032
So that's something like Warcraft here and I'm actually looking for

941
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
How can applicants

Most scalable

980
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
So

981
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,904
Zoe in Pewaukee City Hall MS

982

Do you have that you

1029
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Nothing has changed

1030
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,992
I think the human life is reversing

1031
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,320
I used to know have something a hypothesis I want

1032
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
Prove he's right

1033
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:56,000
But I try all my Bass Pro

1034
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,304
YouTube but this what I think I make a lot of mistakes

1035
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
Because I try to prove a hypothesis right

1036
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,984
I think it's not it's enough santifico Arie Sabrina's actually there is a sinking fraud

1037
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
So now I feel like I have something

1038
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
The worst scenario

1039
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
So what

1040
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Do not do that

1041
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
Daniel Correa

1043
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
How to change me

1044
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
And not making

1045
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
Pre assumption

1046
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,256
Like if you make a Samsung you want to do right if you can do not to Cherokee

1047
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
It's very easy to

1048
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,888
The reality the world is so complicated

1049
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,216
Simplify 4 reasons but if you make a big decision

1050
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,056
You just simplify cherry-picking some stats with both of your judgment

1051
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
You can either claim success for yourself

1052
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
But not for the reality

1053
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
So I didn't tell what it is

1054
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,296
The better you know how this kind of like Rivers thinking mindset

1055
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
You tried to change yourself

1056
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
