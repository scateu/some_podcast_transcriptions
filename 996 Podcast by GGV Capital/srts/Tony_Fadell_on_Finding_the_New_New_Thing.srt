00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
So you have been a prolific coach and investors since you left us in 2016 could you share with us what excites

37
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Do these days

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
Well I think

39
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
You know

40
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,920
The first thing that's exciting is that Innovations happening everywhere

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,736
You know there's always been great ideas all around the world

42
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
But

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
After really the

44
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,392
IPhone in and smartphone Revolution happen

45
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,768
We unlock the DNA test for people around the world to to make revolutionary technology

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,328
Easter open source through Communications Network

47
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Master the internet

48
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
And now you can see innovation

49
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
And and creation of new

50
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
Businesses new technologies new product

51
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
All around the world

52
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
So to me it's

53
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
Engaging the entire global

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Set of brains

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
And not just ones in Silicon Valley or in the east coast of the US but literally the whole world can now innovate

56
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,624
Incredible World Class levels

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
And to me that's really exciting because that means we can get to

58
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
Solve big problems fast

59
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Which is really

60
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,888
Are there any particular parts of the world that you're especially excited about

61
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Well I'm definitely excited

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,008
By what I've seen in China

63
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Since

64
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
You know coming I started coming here in

65
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
2001

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
With the very first time with the iPod

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,712
And then

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
And seeing how much it's changed

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,832
This is the first time I've been back in about 5 years

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
And to see how much

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
You know

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Not just

73
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
You know copycatting in a lot of ways that you thought

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,608
But it's literally innovating in all new ways that we've never seen before and and

75
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
Because

76
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
You know I think of

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
First-mover advantages

78
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
I'll all the time when I when I invest

79
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
But I also think of last mover advantage

80
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
Truck right and if you think about China when you didn't have credit cards and there wasn't a lot of consumer credit and there was wasn't a lot

81
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
I have a lot of things here

82
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
And you get to use the best

83
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Technology

84
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
And actually make it yourself

85
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
And create things that the world has never seen before

86
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
That's really exciting

87
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,303
Because we're not just taking old systems and innovate

88
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
For creating new things and new species of fish

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Things that have never been seen

90
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,031
So Jennie you've known Tony for a long time could you talk about how you first met

91
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,687
Well yeah I still remember Non-24 about 5 years and she probably 5 years exactly

92
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
To this day

93
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,343
But then pants and I were attending a party in the valley at the Venice house

94
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
And I was

95
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
The first question that I ask entrepreneurs

96
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
Weather entrepreneur time it would be who's the coolest guy who's the coolest guy in the room that I got to know

97
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,239
Just in case I have feel the been sitting next to me Xeo off Evan oil and then on my right was Aaron Levy

98
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,567
PO box and the opposite to the guy across the table for me

99
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,199
Can you play back then is that while you know he has a new company and you cool products you should just get to know him now

100
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,087
And so that's how we met and went out to Tony and he was busy introducing his cool Nest protect

101
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
But I that time that was about to be launched

102
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,207
Oh that's how we met and I think also that was just

103
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Hit it off

104
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,047
It's always great to buy entrepreneurs whom you can talk talk about

105
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
Cool can you know if you lie

106
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,191
Give me the straight by this is. This is not good this thing is

107
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Not real

108
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Idol with always kept in touch and it's it's been a very interesting and a very engaging interaction

109
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
We've invested a lot of things together

110
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
Can we talk all the time about running boards together

111
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:45,087
So it's really great and fun to see how things have developed over the last 5 years

112
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,927
But you know when we met we instantly hit it off as you said you know

113
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
No BS

114
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
You tell it like it is I tell it like it is

115
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
And when you speak it when you meet people like that regardless of wherever they're at

116
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
You just

117
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:02,239
Resonate with them you like okay this is someone I can get along with that was it was clear after our first

118
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
Do you know one or two conversations is like

119
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Okay

120
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
We're going to get to know each other a lot more and we've actually talked a lot

121
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
And she's very busy hours

122
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,759
We talked a lot Hans as well we talked many times

123
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
And continue to find great entrepreneurs to back around the world

124
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
The hunt tonight

125
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,279
After that first meeting I came in second meeting to go pay a visit to NASA and 22

126
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
Trying to see if we can invest in that

127
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
We were too late later than you

128
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,103
And so you know we would love to find more ways to work together as partners this time

129
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,431
Not just you know you best entrepreneurs

130
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
So Tony you have close to 250

131
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Investments now

132
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,647
Most of them since being attacked at least in the US and Europe

133
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
What do you look for when you invest in founders

134
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
And what excite you

135
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Well

136
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
You know

137
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Tumi

138
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
You know there's lots of money out there

139
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
And there's a lot of entrepreneurs doing a lot of

140
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Interesting things

141
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
But for me

142
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
What I want to be able to do

143
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Is not just

144
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Make money

145
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
My job is not to make money I'm not investing other

146
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
People's money

147
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
I'm investing my time

148
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
More so than money

149
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
And what I want to do is I want to really be able to

150
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,903
Help entrepreneurs who are doing very hard things

151
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Which are usually in deep technology

152
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Things that don't have revenues for a while

153
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
But take many years to develop

154
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
Before they can become really disruptive in an Indus

155
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
Help those entrepreneurs and Mentor them

156
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,007
With not just myself but our team

157
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
To help them get their dream to become reality to affect the world as fast as possible

158
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
For the most amount of good

159
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
So for me

160
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
I was

161
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
A young entrepreneur when I went to Silicon Valley in 1991 and Beyond and I had lots of people who helped

162
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,767
Helped me cuz they saw something in me and they said I want to help this kid and it wasn't always about money

163
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
And so now that I'm older you know almost you know 25 Going on 30 years later since going to Silicon Valley in the fur

164
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
First place

165
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
Now I think it's my time

166
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
To be able to do what other people did for me

167
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
And help those Innovations grow and now they we can do them

168
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
A lot of places and do many more meaningful things that we

169
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
We could have 30 years

170
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
So for me that's what

171
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
So exciting and it's not just about

172
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Consumer Hardware

173
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
Building you know the next iPod or something or nest

174
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
It's really about

175
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Technology be applied to new spaces

176
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
The things that

177
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
We know when we created our last 30 years

178
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
Is not about you can innovate that shirt

179
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,751
But it's about bringing that and that democratization of those those Technologies

180
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
To agriculture

181
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
To food

182
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Two medicine

183
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
Ted Automotive

184
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,479
If we look at it there's so many things that now need to be

185
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,831
Either revolutionized by the software and Hardware evolution

186
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
Or they need to actually

187
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
Be created new things that we've never seen before to be created

188
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
That's what's interesting to me

189
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,095
Because I don't want to keep doing the same thing you know I left Apple because after

190
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
18 Generations the iPod or whatever

191
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
The 19th one you know it's pretty pretty predictable I think you can pretty much predict what the next cell phone waves

192
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Smartphone always going to look like or the one after that

193
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,919
That's not what you want to do is be on The Cutting Edge

194
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Create something that's totally changing

195
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
Hopefully like I've been able to do

196
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
In my career now do it with

197
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,135
200 other companies in different things that I don't know anything about

198
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
And that's what the best thing is you going to do something

199
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
You don't know anything about to come fresh dive you go

200
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,143
Why don't they do it that way this is the way we've always done it so it's never going to change has come and go

201
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
That doesn't make much sense what's the rethinking

202
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
That's what's fun

203
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Is rethinking

204
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Old Industries

205
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
I was thinking of new things no one's ever thought of

206
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
To me that keeps me young

207
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
And I get to work with lots of young people

208
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Nn

209
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Hopefully help them Reach their dream

210
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
So how do you tell if a team

211
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Science

212
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Versus someone who actually have a chance to

213
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,743
Grow and learn evolve into something truly revolutionary

214
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Hansa grade question

215
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
You asked them what their mission

216
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,983
You ask them what they're really trying to do if they're trying to just trying to find more money to continue the researching from car

217
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
College from University

218
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,639
It's very clear it's like all I just want to do this and they don't think about the business implications they don't

219
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,455
They just want to keep having fun doing what they're doing

220
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
When they say

221
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,575
I have this technology and it can change the world in these dramatic areas

222
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
And then they can state

223
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,183
Maybe not the right but I some kind of business

224
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Is there some kind of Market case

225
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
And they're trying to

226
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,095
Get other people to help them understand and build a business

227
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
That's when you know it's something

228
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Interesting

229
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
You know

230
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
We see a lot of great demos and nothing wrong with robotics you know when those cool AI robots

231
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Running around but then I keep saying

232
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,711
What meat are we feeling what are we actually really

233
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Fixing

234
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Right

235
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
You can create and that's fun

236
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
But what are you doing

237
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
White in 10 years when you wake up

238
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
What

239
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,279
Are you going to have on your resume to show that you've done some build something great

240
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,863
And all the people on your team to do something great and not something great is

241
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Not just another product or another demo

242
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
But a business

243
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
Something that will last beyond

244
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Your time at the camp

245
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Right so if I think about it

246
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
My time at Apple

247
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
It still has the iPhone

248
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
And I feel relieved that

249
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
With something we are building that really was important and it still continues to

250
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
Nest continues to go on and create new products

251
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
And we created a culture in a business

252
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
To create more products

253
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
That's the kind of thing you want to talk to an entrepreneur about

254
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
Not just this one idea and getting it to the market

255
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
What is their big vision

256
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,519
Where does it need to go in even if they don't know what it is they have to have like

257
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,383
Wow I want to change the world in this way for the right reasons for these kind of business reasons

258
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Make sure it's sustainable

259
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
It's not just

260
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
Bring the technology to the world

261
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:10,367
I also think a large part of being a successful entrepreneur is solving nearby problem in the right time

262
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:15,999
So the timing is also important so what do you consider to be at the right problem at this current age

263
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Well timing is every

264
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,167
Sometimes a failure is based on execution that other failures are based on time

265
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,239
You always want to be a little bit sooner

266
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
Bennett needs to be

267
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
In the nest was just a little bit

268
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Too soon

269
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
But it worked out

270
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,967
Right it was just a little bit cutting everybody's doing

271
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
Right now each market something in China that's a great idea that might not be a great idea in North America

272
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
May not be a great idea in

273
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Europe

274
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
So you have to think about timing

275
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Not Justa

276
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
What people are talking about in

277
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
The Press

278
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
But what are customer saying that

279
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
Just because you have a great idea

280
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
And you're not

281
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Close enough to the market

282
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Need

283
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
And it'll take a really big gap or leap

284
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
For them to understand what it is

285
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
If it takes more than

286
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
2 minutes to sell your idea

287
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
You're probably not

288
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,327
Doing a good job either explaining it or you're too far Advanced from where they're thinking

289
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Redemptive

290
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Buyer purchase

291
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Sitting somewhere

292
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,983
So I think about you know my time at General Magic

293
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
General Magic

294
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,103
Most people don't know what it is but we are basically creating the iPhone

295
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
In 1991 to 1994

296
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,759
We had the best team in the best ever we had downloadable apps

297
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
We hadn't

298
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
Games we had an email Wireless email me at everything

299
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,767
That's what used today it took us 15 years to get there any of the smartest people

300
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,607
And so we were a total failure we obviously

301
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
It showed up 15 years

302
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Later

303
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
But we had the right idea

304
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
So

305
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
What is going on here in China

306
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,639
And when I look at startups and thinking about the timing

307
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
There's things that the market needs now

308
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
And things that'll get funded

309
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,063
And there's something that usually

310
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,647
Something pressing for like made in China 2025

311
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,255
If you're doing something that needs to be done right now you're probably not innovatively

312
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,839
You need to be building something that is going to be a hit

313
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
In 45 years

314
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
When the market wakes up

315
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
Because that means you're starting before anyone elses

316
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
But you can't be so close

317
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
That

318
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,895
Everyone else is doing it or it's pretty simple. Implement

319
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
But you also can't be 10 years out

320
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
Because then business isn't happening

321
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:50,111
Do you have to really be in if you're doing anything important I always say is it takes 10 years or

322
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
To see full

323
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Fruition

324
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
You know to come to full

325
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,767
Ripeness in a way right

326
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
10 years are really realize a business

327
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
A product

328
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
A good product

329
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Is usually 3

330
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
4 years

331
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Write good businesses

332
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
And so

333
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
You should always be thinking in those kinds of her eyes

334
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
Obviously you want to ship something in a year or year-and-a-half

335
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Something from the time you start

336
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
It was that kind of Windows I see

337
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
In business but you got to make sure

338
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
That what you're pitching

339
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Close enough

340
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
To what the need is or Annie that you discovered that they didn't know they need

341
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
So that they can convert or they'll actually put their

342
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Signature on a contra

343
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
In some way or puts

344
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
Portfolio what will be there

345
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Top three

346
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
Products that fit that description.

347
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
It could be something

348
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Quite game-changing

349
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
It's stupid early if was time but is closed

350
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,039
Well I think I really break up we're starting to see a breakout almost happening an impossible foe

351
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Impossible Foods is

352
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,439
Is basically meat without a Col Rite Aid or so it's a burger that's

353
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Vegetable based

354
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
But it has

355
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,839
Almost all the same or Better Properties than regular meat

356
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Right

357
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
There's a lack of protein in the world

358
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
We are unsustainably farming

359
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,615
Cows and cattle today and it's killing the planet is killing us it's a totally inefficient

360
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
And we're just at the point where

361
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Meat eaters Argo

362
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,527
I'll actually try that and they like it and it's not

363
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
Crazy GMO technology but it's right on the verge

364
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
And it's going

365
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Multi

366
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Continent

367
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Right

368
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
Suzhou Chapel

369
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
What is it Underground

370
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
We've been working on it and you can have the team has

371
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
I've been working with them for a while

372
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
The teams are working on

373
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,055
6 years now and we're finally there and it's going to be in total

374
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
Brightness as a full business in in the next

375
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
Two to three years because it'll be everywhere

376
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
It's taking a long time so that's

377
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,807
Kind of I think hopefully an example of what I you know

378
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
What I mean

379
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Let's see another one

380
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
I think transfer

381
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Asportation

382
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Is a big one so if you look

383
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
At

384
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
You know we've been talked about self Drive

385
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,399
We all want it to happen all understand this

386
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Site he's not ready for

387
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
The technology

388
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,335
Everybody's been saying it's coming in 2019

389
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
20/20

390
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,015
You know we have automaker saying we have full self-driving or we're going to have a software upgrade for full self-driving

391
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
No we're not

392
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
The stuff isn't ready

393
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
It's not even nearly ready

394
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
I think

395
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Just like

396
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
People

397
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
We have to learn to

398
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Crawl

399
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Before we walk

400
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
How to walk

401
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Before we were

402
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,703
And you know and run before we Sprint

403
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
Cars are going to be the same way

404
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
And it's not just the tip

405
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
Cars are all about

406
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
You know different speeds in different location

407
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
At different times of day on

408
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
Under different Environmental

409
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
We are going to do the same thing

410
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
To think we're going to all of a sudden making a highway vehicle that's going to work

411
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
Tremendously well in cities

412
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
No today we have some

413
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Self-driving capability

414
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
On highways in very controlled

415
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
Digital situation

416
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
If we look at countries around the world

417
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
There are driving modalities that are

418
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:23,103
Very analog not digital the US for the most part 2 digital transportation

419
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
Emerging Markets Emerging Markets

420
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,551
China is in between cities that are digital and there's other ones that

421
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:37,951
To think that we're going to be able to address all of this in version 1.0 or even 5.0

422
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
Actually insane

423
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
And I eat

424
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
When I see people investing

425
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
Like craziness is over going to have

426
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Self-driving taxis

427
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
They're going to be the worst taxis in the world

428
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
You're not going to want them

429
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
They're nice

430
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
Mobility stuff with the bikes in the scooters in

431
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
And other transportation

432
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
But self-driving

433
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
I like self-driving in

434
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Campuses

435
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,319
I'm slow speeds where you can you know where you want to do this

436
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
Highly controlled it's highly digital

437
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:13,023
It only has to work under certain environment to still at the steering wheel in a thing so someone has to get in to keep it running during the day

438
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
We're going to have those kinds of on-ramp

439
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
Text for people to say that

440
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
It's going to be autonomous driving

441
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
In 3 years

442
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
We all have a dip

443
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
We all have different expectations

444
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
It's all marketing

445
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
All kind of crazy

446
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
It's not

447
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
What realities

448
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Just like

449
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,319
The iPhone we had it in 1994 with General Magic

450
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
People that understand the need we understand

451
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
But the technology is not right

452
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,279
Basically we don't we don't have the technology

453
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,351
The all the and the regulations and all the other things

454
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
That is much too early

455
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
Now that's a you shouldn't invest

456
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
No

457
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
But you have to invest smart

458
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,311
And you have to understand what can be deployed when

459
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
And not think that

460
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,383
You know now we're talkin about

461
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
People are talking about

462
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,039
Fleet Mobility Management Solutions software solution for autonomous vehicles

463
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
I'm like

464
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,719
Oh my God that's going to be 20-30 by the time we need 2027 or something like that

465
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
We can't even make a car

466
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,607
An Eevee based car that runs won't rent long-range enough without all the

467
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,471
All the computers and they're still already too expensive

468
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
So much to go

469
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,823
So that's an example of something that happened today

470
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
If you smartly to find it yes it will happen

471
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,967
But the way it's being defined and being built

472
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
It's so far out there

473
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,831
That we all want it cuz it's cool science fiction My Name happened

474
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,879
It's on Mark it's all driven by

475
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
Marketing and shareholders and

476
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
In and people think they're going to make a ton of money right now

477
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
And they're just

478
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
You know they're chasing a dollar they don't understand

479
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
All the social implications governmental up

480
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
And the technologic

481
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263
How about vertigo indoor farming

482
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
Another thing that I think is

483
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Very interesting

484
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
But you have to look at the biz

485
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
You have to go back and go

486
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
How much

487
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
How much

488
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Is it costing

489
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
To produce these vets

490
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
For these fruits

491
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,720
In which location what are the alternative

492
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,048
Sounds sexy and it's interesting for a marketing thing

493
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,144
But when you come down to the business aspects

494
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
You know some of these vertical

495
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
1000 containers

496
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
It's cuz everyone's trying one

497
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
Right I always said that

498
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,664
If we put anything on Indiegogo or anything

499
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
You can sell

500
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,504
Between 10000 and 100000 of anything

501
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
To anyone cuz there's enough early adopter

502
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
But they're just demoing

503
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
To say it's going to truly be a business

504
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
We're so far away from that

505
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
Now do we have to try absolutely

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,840
But the valuations a lot of these things are getting well out of hand

507
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
And they just seem cool and it was like that sounds cool

508
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
But

509
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
The reality is we have to look at the egg

510
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Economics

511
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Because

512
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,456
It's not going to be carbon-based because we're going to be getting rid of you know Logistics services and

513
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:16,064
There's all these other elements that have to happen to incentivize to make these things more

514
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
And they're not today

515
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
And

516
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,512
It's you have to really look at the numbers has anyone about all kinds of certain things

517
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:31,168
But I always go back to not the sales numbers but the real hard unit economics

518
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
You understand what are we really solving

519
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,568
What are you betting on

520
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,360
If you can't get the economics right

521
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Regardless of the kids you can't scale

522
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,016
Nnnn I always look at the economics from a scale point of view

523
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
Not just like it's going to be hard really making a thousand of them so it's really expensive so we'll never get to 100,000 likes

524
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Solar panels

525
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
4 years

526
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
From the 70s but it's finally taking off

527
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
In the last 10 years

528
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Right

529
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
Because everyone's like we'll never scale I'm not worried about scale anymore

530
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
If we figure out the unaka economics

531
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,032
China or another he's going to go off and figure out how to make

532
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,848
Custom the cost out happens so much more quickly

533
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
What's the what's the real fundamental reason why something should exist

534
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Look at that

535
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
Look at those.

536
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,624
Which of the following in indoor vertical farming that could be different

537
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
Wish I was talking to you about that later

538
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,744
Okay I can't wait to hear more

539
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,144
Maybe Switching gears a little bit so it's when you've been a very successful entrepreneurs for 25 years and Los Angeles McKinney

540
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
How do you strike

541
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
The right balance

542
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Between you know

543
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
Taking on the role of a coach

544
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,872
To the founder of the say Hey you know this is something

545
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,760
Getting rid of the issues within that I don't know David is trying to catch the guy to get it in the unit

546
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Well you know I've

547
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
I and you probably seen it.

548
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,744
You know sometimes you have to bite your tongue

549
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,560
The first time just like you can ask them questions

550
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
Nuna

551
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
You can either see in some entrepreneurs use like

552
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Why did you do it that way

553
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
Did you ever consider this

554
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Or did you ever think of that

555
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
And neither

556
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,640
Do you know kind of a bit flips in their brain

557
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,808
And literally within hours or days a week

558
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
Or it's like

559
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
Next month

560
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,696
9 months a year later it still hasn't like

561
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Sunken

562
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
I have all the ideas or anything

563
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,584
But at least coming back to you

564
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
With a

565
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
I thought about that and here's why I don't think it's going to work

566
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Right

567
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Or

568
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,056
You know or we rule it out right then and there like yeah I already thought about it

569
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
Yeah that's not going to work

570
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,944
So you can really understand in and I like to do that in the process of when

571
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
We're thinking about making the investment

572
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,368
And challenging their to see if they're mensurable sure at the time of the investment

573
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
Roll your roll the dice then and you have no Leverage

574
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
In a way

575
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,168
And so you always want to have that kind of

576
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
Too many times I

577
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,288
Because I'm not worried about missing the next deal

578
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:21,920
This is about fun and Indian meetings where it's about working with great people who really want to work together

579
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,248
Write a lot of

580
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
Investors are like they want to have their best fit

581
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,904
Put forward they want to say I'm entrepreneur friendly and I'm not going to challenge

582
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
To a certain extent

583
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
For me I gota

584
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
180 degrees out

585
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:42,400
I challenge you from day one I'll send him a hundred questions.

586
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,032
And I want to see how far until a break

587
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
Not that I'm trying to like but it's there I want to see how far they're going to go and how deep and how fast they're going to respond

588
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
Detailed response

589
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
Because that's going to tell you what their normal

590
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,624
Kind of way they think about problems or how they communicate or whatever

591
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
And if they can do that

592
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,488
Then it's a great litmus test for what I think's going to happen over time

593
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,328
I never thought about that

594
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
No we haven't gotten there

595
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,448
As opposed to someone who always says oh yeah we thought about that or

596
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,984
Yeah we're going to do that too

597
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
They just have to say no we didn't think about

598
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
And Hugo okay

599
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,408
I know that they're real because they said

600
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Right exactly

601
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
So yeah so it's that kind of thing

602
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,344
So do you get moments where you feel like this problem is

603
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
Attractive enough that

604
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
You want to do it yourself

605
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,024
Nephew

606
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
There a few moments

607
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
You know from me

608
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,752
Did everyone that's ever going to get back in the game one day you're going to go back

609
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,336
I was going to get back to it and Nest was something bad

610
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
I thought of

611
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,176
And I couldn't let it go it took nine months

612
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
For me

613
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
To find leak

614
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
To doing

615
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Cuz

616
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
I had to look at it from every angle

617
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Cuz I really wanted it to be right

618
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
I had been at that point

619
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Over 20 years

620
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Of

621
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
You know multiple startups that

622
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,352
Failed or were marginally successful

623
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
You nope

624
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
Years and years at Apple running like crazy

625
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:25,568
So to throw yourself into it again when you didn't have to you already financially on lsf

626
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,408
To throw yourself into it you have to make sure all the variables there and let you know

627
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
You don't not that I'm risk-averse

628
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
But I like to risk mitigation

629
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,320
But make sure I really understand what the real

630
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
Opportunities but what are the real risks

631
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Before diving into

632
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
And so when I look at these other businesses

633
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,816
I have different calculus I use for when I'm going to be the CEO

634
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,400
Verses when other people are the CEO and I think I can help them

635
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,776
And investing get them around certain obstacles cuz I've been there before and I think it's a good business

636
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
But is it something good enough that I would want to

637
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
You know

638
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,200
Tear myself away from my family and all I said since I already had been doing it for

639
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
I effectively now

640
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
25 to 30 years depending on how you count

641
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,952
So it's very hard for me to want to engage and say how I wish I could do that cuz I know how

642
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
End

643
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,048
I have to tell you it's a Young Person's game

644
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,704
The real you have to be in your 30s you know 20 year olds

645
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,056
Videos there are some of them but they're usually not successful

646
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,456
Sometimes I get lucky but most of time it's in your mid-30s

647
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
Early forties is where you're really sick

648
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,856
So you really figured out you failed enough times you've learned

649
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Right

650
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
And so

651
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,304
I'm not in that category

652
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,168
You know that's where I can come back to Mentor so so my calculus for me to do something is very different

653
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
So I

654
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
So when I see something I can oh my God

655
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,360
If I was 30 again would I be there

656
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:08,224
Cuz I get to go have a fun ride with that entrepreneur

657
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,016
And helping them

658
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,856
With their board and their investors everything else I get to be in a list

659
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
I can have a lot of fun

660
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,768
And and I get to be young again at the same time I get to help them

661
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,584
And I get to almost be CEO without being CEO

662
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,680
Cemeteries wife Kitty and I like

663
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216
BBC

664
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:34,848
You know it's some point everyone has a different reason for when they going to get involved with the risk level you knowing

665
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,432
I'd much rather take my time and help 200 on sugar

666
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,528
Rights and then just one company with a lot of people but

667
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
It's tough

668
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
You know how it is

669
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
You know I always would love to go back to college or High School inside

670
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
YouTube

671
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
OK Google

672
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:59,680
Exactly

673
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,008
Self do you your face in Paris is traveling through Asia

674
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
When you see go to different markets

675
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
What are the differences

676
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
I'm similarities among the founders you choose to back

677
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Frosty geography

678
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,784
In what kind of lens do you use to look at investment

679
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Indifferent geography

680
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Oh yeah okay

681
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Well I think

682
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
Looking at the investment is very different than looking at the

683
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
Human nature that I found throughout all our travel

684
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Is the same everywhere

685
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,680
Everybody wants to care for their families everybody cares about their

686
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Communities

687
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
For the mall on their governments are

688
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,312
Even care about themselves

689
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
Human nature is the same

690
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:43,712
So entrepreneurs it's very easy to go and find entrepreneurial Talent

691
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
That's very similar

692
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,320
They have their mission-based they work hard there

693
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:53,184
They're proactive that you know they can communicate well and you can find that on every Khan

694
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
When it comes to Investments

695
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
A very different calculus

696
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
And how you

697
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Choose to invest

698
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Na

699
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Company

700
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
China

701
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
Versus the US

702
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Versus Europe

703
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,800
Because each of them are a different

704
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Stages

705
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
You know

706
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
One thing we learned way back when

707
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
During

708
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
During the time

709
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,504
Apple we did the iPod

710
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Right in the

711
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
An apple wasn't doing well it's time and iPod came out

712
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
And it was

713
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
A

714
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Critical in someone

715
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,000
Success in the first year 2 years

716
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
But it was all Apple Focus so you can only have a Mac

717
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
Brighten an iPod

718
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
It said use an iPod

719
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
So what you had to do was

720
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,544
We could only marketed to more or less you do you SRT

721
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,920
Little bit of Japan nobody was really in Europe using Apple Mac

722
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
Work that we modified in all that

723
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,600
And by your three we made it work with a piece

724
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
So

725
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,976
When we took it to Europe

726
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,840
Because I could work with a PC and we took it to the rest of the world's people are starting all I want

727
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,448
That first time we hit the European Shores

728
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Or the Asian Shores

729
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
With it

730
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,800
We use the marketing as if

731
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
We were still Marketing in the US after 3 years

732
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
We forgot that the markets themselves

733
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,832
Didn't really know what an iPod was they really didn't know what 10,000 songs in your pocket but they didn't know all the

734
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,696
So the first 6 months when we launched it in these other countries

735
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
We didn't Taylor the marketing

736
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
To understand the market

737
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,864
We tailored it based on what we've done in the US in copy

738
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
We had to bring those people up to

739
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
It's a what is this long way of saying you know

740
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
What it is

741
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,592
You got to understand the Dynamics of each mark

742
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
To understand it

743
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,408
Investment is really make

744
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,200
In the US

745
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
You know

746
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
You had to

747
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Day

748
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
I'm fundamentally deep.

749
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,952
And that detective is coming out of research institutions

750
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
It's it's

751
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
That's where I like to invest

752
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,608
It's not about social mobile that's over now there's certain things that are old

753
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
Adipex really hot

754
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
In Europe

755
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Deepak is just starting

756
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
It's mostly

757
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,824
Kind of the US

758
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
223 years ago

759
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,016
You know business process Automation and and alternative business models and that's

760
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
An innovating

761
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
In that Mark

762
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,672
In China Chinese much more about

763
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
You know

764
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Scale

765
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
It's not about the technology

766
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Azide

767
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,400
But it's about taking something where you have a good

768
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,728
Market that you figured out that unit economics you figured out it

769
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:50,336
And pressing the button to get the capital and scaling it up to billions of people

770
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
Right

771
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
And so it's all about execution

772
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
It's all about

773
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,296
Customer acquisition cost about how do you submit vat

774
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Kind of thing

775
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
Do you have to look under that

776
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
At some point

777
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,720
That calculus is going to move to the US again

778
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Right

779
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
And then it's going to move to the you know to Europe

780
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,888
So these things are always out of phase each of these regions are out of phase

781
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
If you look at Southeast Asia

782
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,752
Very different than all of those again

783
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
So

784
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
Entrepreneurs

785
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Easy to determine

786
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,456
Weather option or has a business that investable and then makes a lot of sense

787
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Is very

788
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,040
Locally driven and you need to have great partner

789
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,856
In each of those areas to help you do the do

790
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Due diligence to under

791
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Stand it

792
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
And so

793
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
You know and it's great to learn about these things

794
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,024
It's hard to sometimes pull the trigger when

795
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
You don't really have all the data

796
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
To make the investor

797
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,680
And so you like the way you would is if

798
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
You are investing in the US

799
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,312
10 years or 20 years and that's what's so great about ggv is that

800
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,848
Are you guys been here

801
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
And now you're going even further into other mark

802
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Ripe

803
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
And investing ahead of the Curve

804
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
Bright and learning that's

805
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
Just like you should be

806
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
Creating startups

807
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,880
Ahead of the Curve

808
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
Right and that's

809
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:12,768
Investment is all about seeing the next Horizon entrepreneurs are all about seeing the next Horizon

810
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
And then finding those things

811
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
And emailing it

812
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
And so it really takes people on the ground

813
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
Great understanding

814
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,984
Cuz you just can't cook

815
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
Key cutter and copy

816
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
From Play Store

817
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
It doesn't work that way

818
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:30,688
I know all of these NBC firms try to globalize when it was way too early to do so

819
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
I have to go to be treated

820
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
I think 440g for us

821
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
Play friends with benefit from the

822
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
Country simplification of iPhones and Android phone

823
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:44,000
When you have some of the smartphone penetration in a lot of markets

824
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,072
Easier to scale the business model has worked

825
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
In one country

826
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
Other

827
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Especially in

828
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:55,264
Emerging Markets versus the high degree of organization and Rising middle class

829
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
It is Market pantry

830
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,128
Oh absolutely. There's a lot of similarities you can do

831
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
And now that we ate like

832
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,784
Finally there's 4G in India you're finally there's 40 everywhere and it's cheap enough

833
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,856
And it's cheap enough right and so

834
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
And then you have to look at you know the arpu

835
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
And figure out what is really the discretionary Capital that each of these families has and where

836
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,240
Deployed or for that matter the it budgets for each of these

837
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,824
They all everybody around the world has to digital

838
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Right

839
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
I'm Families 2

840
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
The question is is

841
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,224
What's the cycle where are they

842
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
Where's the acceptance just like when I was coming back to the iPod

843
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,368
You got it just the timing is critical in each of the

844
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:47,744
When everybody just says that they can move their model their business model from one continent

845
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,072
To the next really easily

846
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:57,728
You know that's right and that's the kind of the entrepreneur who you know sometimes they need to be mentored

847
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,080
And other times they just say that because they're selling it trying to prop up there you know there

848
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
Valuation

849
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
And I'm like forget it just like

850
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:11,808
Smattering a on every single present form of social

851
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,880
Mobile or whatever is Uber of

852
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah you know I'm the aif leads like no

853
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
Sorry Akon

854
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Fit right

855
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,304
Allege that she got to be much more

856
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
The thoughtful.

857
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:30,240
Do you think would be entrepreneurship first train at big companies or should I jump straight into entrepreneurship

858
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,056
You yourself has been awesome big companies

859
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,128
Yeah I have some real Lessons Learned on that

860
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,920
If you're going to be a great entrepreneur

861
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:43,040
You better know what sales and marketing is not just what engineering is or operations are fine

862
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
You need to know

863
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Pretty well

864
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
What each

865
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
Function does and how they kind of in a relay

866
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
At a massive company Corporation are you going to learn that

867
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
No way

868
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
You're going to be a cog in the machine

869
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
At a startup

870
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
A five people are 10 people are going to know that

871
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
Absolutely not

872
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
What I'm

873
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
What I'm 4 is so small

874
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
80

875
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,664
800 Polaris 850 person startup

876
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,224
Will you can go in in the first two years

877
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,784
You can watch it grow what it means to

878
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,184
What kind of stress goes on in the environment when they're like growing a 20 people per quarter 10 people per quarter

879
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,048
When you can go and have lunch with a marketing person and learn what they're talking about Earth science

880
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
And you can start to get

881
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,936
Some sense if I could not learn this stuff in school no bitoku

882
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,080
Right you're not going to tell you about the failures going to hear about the successes and the real big failures and then

883
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,688
The knot wanted Dynamic and it's really happening in case study

884
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,248
You got to be there you got to learn

885
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
You got to learn by doing

886
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,856
And Learn by doing means learn by doing with others

887
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
Who are knowledgeable and experienced with a good enough team

888
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
If you just

889
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
Got to school

890
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
And this is what happened to me I start my own company

891
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
I didn't know what I didn't know

892
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:05,472
Right and that's what was so great about me going to General magic I got to see everything

893
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,008
Wasn't

894
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,824
I wasn't maybe that's awful is best

895
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,920
But that's what I was number 30 at this company

896
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,272
But we grew. 200 in the very short. Time you got to meet and learn

897
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
Become part of

898
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Mini

899
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
Piece of the organization

900
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
Industrial pH

901
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,488
You know I can't when everyone says I PhD

902
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
It's not a PhD in art

903
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Frontier realism

904
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
It's not a ph meter

905
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,632
It's a very near thing

906
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
That doesn't help you

907
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Create a company

908
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:41,056
You got to really be able to speak the language of all these different divisions in different types of

909
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Some people know how to

910
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
No enough when you need something

911
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Not that you know who the best

912
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
Experienced professional Hazard how to do that

913
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
Start to understand

914
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
And you can only do that by

915
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,160
When working in Azusa Sears b or a c company

916
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Das Racist

917
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
Two or three rounds of financing

918
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
51200

919
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,816
Exactly small enough that you can

920
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Tok almost everyone

921
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
But big enough. You have given functions you merge

922
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
Exactly and

923
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
And

924
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
You're going to go through some failures

925
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,080
If it's not going to be about maintenance mode

926
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:18,176
Oh yeah we just need to have this is like real

927
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
You know

928
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,528
Yeah a real fighting to try to win the market

929
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,344
Fix this problem or whatever and it's really

930
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
Ugly and gory

931
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
Cuz that's where you going to learn

932
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
It's fun it's bassinet

933
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
You know

934
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
So yeah so

935
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
Do not go to big company

936
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
Huge what do not go to little tiny one

937
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
Go to something there you can really

938
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,776
Add value but they're going to teach you probably more than you're going to be able to bring

939
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Go to the Jacob

940
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Yep

941
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
I remember you said before that nests would have never happened if I didn't get out of the echo chamber of Silicon Valley

942
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,344
So how did this happen and why did you move to Paris in 2009

943
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Okay

944
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
What are the biggest reasons why I'm here

945
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,256
Here in China while I'm traveling throughout the world to Southeast Asia

946
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
Why we're living in Paris

947
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Is that

948
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,192
You don't know about other people's problems

949
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Unless

950
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
You lived

951
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,848
And you know a lot of people say oh yeah I can go and you know

952
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,664
I can from Silicon Valley or whatever else

953
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Everything looks

954
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Like

955
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
It's all solvable

956
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
It's absolutely not

957
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,856
The reason why

958
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
You start

959
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
A startup

960
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
You know

961
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Do you know

962
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,840
Get created in Europe and then they got shipped over the us when the US started in

963
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
Everybody has different problems

964
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
With different needs

965
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
And different ways of being

966
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,056
And even though you might think o that cars the same as that car over there

967
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,895
There's a regulation differences Galore between the two different cars

968
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,735
Here in China that you know a Buick here's a Buick in the US

969
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
There's so many differences

970
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
That

971
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
You need

972
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
2

973
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
Be able to live there

974
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
The other thing is

975
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
You have obituary

976
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,767
In other words you get used to your environment

977
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,351
So after being in Silicon Valley for at that point 20 years

978
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,167
You got to see everything is the same

979
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,263
They're all shades of the same thing you see the same problems you see everything else

980
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,055
Do when you get outside that

981
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
And you go to a different place

982
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Where

983
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
Fundamentally everything's different

984
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:32,063
It knocks you off your thing and you have to re-evaluate everything and relearn how to live and learn how other people and why did they do

985
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Do it that way

986
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,879
We did it that way is it smarter

987
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
I always thought

988
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,207
That's the way it's always done this like a big company

989
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,607
That's the way we've always done if you continue to do it that way

990
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,911
The US political system was really smart

991
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
When mute living in France

992
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
And seeing how they elect the president

993
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Oh my God I'm like

994
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,687
This is genius compared to the US

995
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
And so

996
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
When you have that kind of experience

997
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,807
Angular wait a second

998
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,343
They're smart people all around the

999
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,927
They may not be Market in the media might not be focused on

1000
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
Mosto

1001
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
Times people like

1002
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,839
Come eat with me and move your startup near me

1003
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
Cuz I know better

1004
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
No no no you got to go the other way

1005
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,727
And go meet with people because

1006
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,263
Technologies vent democratize

1007
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,543
Communications Bank

1008
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,847
All the specimen democratized everyone can get access

1009
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Now it's about going to the market

1010
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
And making them

1011
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Those markets

1012
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,479
And so that's

1013
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:37,599
If I wouldn't have done that I would not have seen the problems I would have continued to solve

1014
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
What everybody else. Where the

1015
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,743
What I love is you know what the other thing that happened when I was

1016
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,559
Cuz this was in Paris in 2009

1017
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
When we were there

1018
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
But that went to different museums

1019
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
And when your Paris

1020
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
There's hundreds of Museum

1021
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
And you start see a pattern

1022
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,799
And the pattern emerges where

1023
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
If you looked at Picasso

1024
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
Michelangelo

1025
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,943
Or any of the great artist

1026
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
You start going wait a second

1027
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
They lived in this city for a while

1028
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,647
Then they took a bunch of a little bit of time off and they lived in this city for a while

1029
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
And then they lived in that City with

1030
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,535
I'm a different inspiration in new our new things that they were working on

1031
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,167
And it was all about refreshing and pressing reset on your brain to get new Inspirations new ways

1032
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
I'm looking at the world

1033
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,519
To come up with new ideas and Creative Solutions or ideas

1034
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
And so you're like

1035
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,639
I'm in Paris I see this TRS they did this on my

1036
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,271
Duh of course I got to do the same thing

1037
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,831
Came back to build it now traveling the world

1038
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
Other things

1039
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,671
And I got some really cool things that I want to do now

1040
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Being

1041
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
You know traveling in this area of the world as well as in Europe

1042
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
I'm going

1043
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,887
We got to build some of these other companies I'm trying to find Investments around that stuff because it's

1044
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,191
I would have never seen it in Silicon Valley

1045
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Or

1046
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,751
Frankly in Paris cuz that's

1047
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
Getting worried

1048
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,543
Any in Europe

1049
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,103
Unless you travel to the place where they jump

1050
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
For example

1051
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,247
You know we were talking about this earlier which is if you think about Southeast Asia

1052
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,551
Southeast Asia

1053
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
Is very much like Europe

1054
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,391
Was before

1055
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:19,231
That ain't you right before the European Union

1056
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
There's different currencies

1057
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
People are traveling around middle class is now being established and its traveling around Commerce is

1058
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,495
Happening within aside a block and things need to move more quickly

1059
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
So what technology

1060
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,847
What things need to be built for that region

1061
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
That trading region

1062
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
It's not all going to come in and out of China

1063
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
Amongst themselves what needs to be built in

1064
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
What's inside of that

1065
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,975
And to make it more fluid reduce the friction

1066
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Because

1067
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,559
I don't think given this whole

1068
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
Wave up

1069
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
Populist Behavior

1070
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,703
There's going to be another EU created anytime soon

1071
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:06,591
There might be trading blocs but there's not going to be a new kind of political political system put on

1072
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
So given that

1073
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,991
How are our business is going to adapt to that what business that can be started in

1074
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
And that could be really

1075
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
Wild an interesting to watch

1076
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
And it's just

1077
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
Now getting there

1078
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
As you see things like

1079
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
Gojak

1080
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
Grab and other wood starting to go

1081
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
The multiple countries

1082
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Check right

1083
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Pretty interested

1084
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
DDS

1085
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,983
So we're now sitting in Beijing end

1086
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,383
What has surprised you or impressed you the most about your current trip to China with her overall impression of the China

1087
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Ecosystem

1088
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
China

1089
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
It's underestimated

1090
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,575
I think a lot of people want to continue to

1091
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
Oh

1092
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
The China 15 years ago

1093
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
It's the

1094
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,023
An incredible opportunity or any credible threat depending on how you look

1095
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
And

1096
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
You know

1097
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
I hope that

1098
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,287
While there has to be the right Reckoning and balance between

1099
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,103
Superpowers in the world and trading blocs and

1100
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,151
All that stuff's got to get yourself worked out

1101
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,759
We still need to cooperate we still need to work together

1102
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
And we still need

1103
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,855
Information to flow and

1104
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
The knowledge of

1105
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
All different people

1106
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Flow

1107
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Freely between each eye

1108
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,303
Because it's really important because we live on one play

1109
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
And

1110
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,887
We cannot be hunkering down

1111
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
Especially when you look at the IPC

1112
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:42,591
See report from last week saying global climate change is going to affect us in 12 years none

1113
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
30 years

1114
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,919
We're going to have to be working together

1115
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
And

1116
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,759
I would rather see countries compete

1117
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
To make the world better

1118
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
Dental

1119
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,903
Off each other and then we starve each other of the innovation

1120
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
I know that's bae

1121
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
But

1122
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
China

1123
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,887
Is an incredible opportunity for the world because it can set the standards and help

1124
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,191
To bring scale

1125
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,263
To the lot of these industries that are going to need it

1126
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Help us with climate

1127
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
Just like we did with solar panel

1128
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,663
Rightly or wrongly forget solar panel dumping and all the others

1129
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,967
If people play the game right

1130
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,807
And they play by the rules Within

1131
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,599
And we don't have a

1132
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,695
Global Currency meltdown because of currency War

1133
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
We can help the planet go much more quickly

1134
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Together than apart

1135
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
If we have

1136
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,351
Global Currency Wars

1137
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
And global trade Wars

1138
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,935
We're going to slow down

1139
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
Tremendously

1140
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:45,311
The revolution we need to get to a CO2

1141
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,335
Les

1142
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,943
Otherwise we can lose 10 or 20 years on our way

1143
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,247
Because we're being or sticking their head in the ground

1144
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,879
Did US is awesome we're going to do it our way we can't do it someone planet

1145
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,695
There's no Mars sorry

1146
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
There's no moon

1147
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
There's no space

1148
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,167
We got it we got to solve it we got to solve it together and so for me China

1149
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
He's going to be a

1150
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,263
Huge win especially as more cities are developed

1151
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,615
The rest of the world at least in the you-know-what

1152
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,919
Some people consider the modern world China is very modern

1153
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,711
The US and Europe

1154
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
North America in Europe

1155
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,783
There's not new city been created

1156
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,623
Should have been created and you can use the new technology to create

1157
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,999
And you can figure out new ways of being and do that more so than the Middle East

1158
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,791
Write more so than Africa

1159
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
Could you have all the pieces

1160
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
So I hope that

1161
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:46,495
The technology that's going to be created in the cities that occurred going to be model to help us get out of this because

1162
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
We're going to need it

1163
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,639
The population growth is slowing around the world but it's not selling fast enough

1164
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
No not going to solve it

1165
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,503
We're going to need experimental cities and a lot of different innovation

1166
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:01,343
But his DNA to mutate enough time to find our way out of this

1167
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,391
Which one is the best bicycle

1168
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,695
Chinese incredible opportunity

1169
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
The help

1170
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,023
Save the world even though yes

1171
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,327
If there do need to be reformed

1172
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
But

1173
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
This is where

1174
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,447
Everyone can leave together

1175
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
And not

1176
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Be divided

1177
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,639
So I think we talked about how the world is changing

1178
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,455
Entrepreneurship is changing is getting more global

1179
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:32,319
Capital as well as getting more Global absolutely

1180
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
So many interactions

1181
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,159
It's with investors in us and Europe

1182
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,743
In Asia as well any import advice

1183
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,023
For folks like us

1184
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Well

1185
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,863
The dirt

1186
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
You know

1187
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Look

1188
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
In the world they're good people they're bad

1189
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,567
They're good businesses and bad breath

1190
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
Good leaders

1191
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Badly

1192
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
In the world of capitalism

1193
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
Two same thing

1194
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
At the end of the day

1195
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,759
Entrepreneurs

1196
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
Should only take money

1197
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,831
From people they respect

1198
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,879
From people who can add value

1199
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
Not just a brand name

1200
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,743
It's about a person to person relations

1201
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
Bright

1202
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Or mentor

1203
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,351
It's not just the firm

1204
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
It's the person you're going to have on your board

1205
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,935
It's going to be about

1206
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
The

1207
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,775
Hopefully a person you can call in the middle of night

1208
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
When your

1209
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
When

1210
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,359
You're an utter panic

1211
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:31,199
To get advice and that you trust and they're not going to use it as a weapon against you

1212
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
That is a trusted partner

1213
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
Write someone you want to go have

1214
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,343
Lunch or dinner with that you wouldn't

1215
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,671
Your mind having your families get together and at some point

1216
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
Obviously there's always business

1217
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,767
But at the end of the day

1218
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
It's got to have a personal

1219
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
Relationship because it's all about trust

1220
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,143
And it's two ways word

1221
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
You know when you get

1222
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,471
An investment from someone they're trusting you

1223
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
To return that

1224
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,055
But you're also trusting that they're going to

1225
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Believe in you

1226
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
It's not just a business right

1227
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
Transact

1228
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Because

1229
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
You know with all the failed

1230
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,783
Startups out there cuz there's still going to be tons more

1231
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
This is about a long-term relationship

1232
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
Right and so

1233
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,927
Even if a startup doesn't work out

1234
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,023
There are so many entrepreneurs that I back again

1235
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
Because I saw him in the tough times

1236
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
Swipe right

1237
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Through the hard times

1238
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
Cuz that's when you really know a person who is when weather's on the investor side or on the entrepreneur side when it's tough times

1239
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,103
That you can push each other you're there for each other

1240
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
And

1241
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,687
You know in 20 years you going to call each other go

1242
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,015
Remember I'm here and you know

1243
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,343
Wouldn't when it was top you were there for me I'm there for you whatever it is

1244
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:46,719
No matter how much we read in the media and all the BS and you know social networks

1245
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,303
You know you know taking people down everything about that relation

1246
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
At the end of the day not what the media says or what

1247
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,399
The latest thing on Twitter

1248
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
And so

1249
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:02,335
The reason why I'm successful is because of the relationship that hope I've invested in until this is not about trains

1250
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
What about relations

1251
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,967
And so and it's a two-way street cuz you're getting married look

1252
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,271
Investors getting married to a

1253
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,159
A entrepreneur if it's good and an entrepreneur is getting married to a partner not a VC firm

1254
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,999
And a VC firm is made up of really good partners if they're really good

1255
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,583
So yeah there's Bad actors out there and bad forms

1256
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,631
You got to be much smarter

1257
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,215
As an entrepreneur and you got to be much smarter than vestra to make sure

1258
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,799
That it's not just that I'm putting my money into something cuz it's a

1259
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
Oh my God it's the next next

1260
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,615
Hottest thing

1261
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
It's because you really believe it

1262
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,223
And at the end of the day it it's not about who

1263
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,783
Gives you the biggest pre-money valuation

1264
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:49,183
Whatever you're going to see it in the terms you going to see them how fast they work together how fast they get back to you how much value they can

1265
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
Any

1266
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:55,583
Requires both side because an entrepreneur with too much ego

1267
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:02,239
Aunt Anna Vissi who thinks that there is a new CEO you don't want that either

1268
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
So

1269
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
Look take capital from good Folk

1270
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
Right

1271
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
And only invest in

1272
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,175
The cuz

1273
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
Look

1274
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,551
It's inevitably lot of things are going to go south it's not going to work out like we all wanted to

1275
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:20,415
You know you get one in five one in 10 is a great home run

1276
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,463
We don't hear about all the failures

1277
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
But

1278
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
They do happen

1279
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
You got to be there for that

1280
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,583
And

1281
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,655
Let's just remember it's about people

1282
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,471
And relationships not about transactions in money

1283
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:39,359
So we're going to proceed to the final part of the interview which is around a rapid fire questions

1284
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:43,711
Admire the most and why

1285
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,991
Right now

1286
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
The best

1287
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,063
Visionary operator

1288
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
All around

1289
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
Kind of businessman

1290
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
Quiet

1291
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Smart

1292
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
Everything

1293
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Jeff Bezos

1294
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,023
Jeff without a doubt

1295
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
You know I watched

1296
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,631
Two side go up to the first time I think it was in 1994

1297
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,167
And

1298
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,191
To see

1299
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
The long-term thinking

1300
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,311
The Abyssal long-term thinking there

1301
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
You know very Chinese like

1302
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,199
I'm glad you said it that's how we feel

1303
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,271
The ability to keep rolling the dice and saying

1304
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
I'm not going to give back

1305
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:25,183
The money and buy shares back from shareholders I'm going to continue to invest in myself

1306
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,463
That's

1307
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
An amazing

1308
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,327
And of course now he's got a huge

1309
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,375
Responsibility to the world

1310
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
To not just

1311
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
You know show how business is done right

1312
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
But the show how to be

1313
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
Done in a socially

1314
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Conscious manner

1315
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,383
You know is a homely face for them

1316
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,151
Because

1317
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,943
They can make a lot of

1318
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,479
Great changes for the world

1319
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
And in many directions

1320
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,575
And. So I'm looking forward to

1321
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Sing the next phase of

1322
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Jeff and Mary

1323
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,415
But what he's done in the last

1324
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
20 years

1325
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
Amazing

1326
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Absolutely.

1327
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Dino hats off

1328
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Undeniable

1329
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,399
But you don't have an answer this question or if you do we'll have to

1330
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
Broadcast

1331
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,751
But all he will think that or call Elon Musk

1332
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
The next Steve Jobs

1333
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
What do you think about that

1334
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,871
I think they're two totally buried if

1335
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
I know I

1336
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,479
I met and spent time with you on and it's been a lot of time

1337
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
They're very good

1338
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:22,783
Tulsa

1339
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
We just leave it at that

1340
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Okay thanks

1341
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,999
What's something you read recently that you would recommend

1342
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,815
Whether it's a book or article

1343
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,119
Well you know they're too older books

1344
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
So I can some people might think they're older but they're

1345
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
Absolutely

1346
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,007
I think about them on almost a daily basis

1347
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,055
And a third book as well

1348
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
From a design purse

1349
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
But

1350
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,151
There's from Daniel Kahneman that

1351
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Thinking Fast

1352
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
Consuelo

1353
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
And the other one

1354
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Kasabian

1355
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
That's a good book

1356
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Sapiens

1357
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
Just rock my world

1358
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,951
So those two books

1359
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
It's a lot of it

1360
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Sapiens

1361
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
So much about

1362
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
Society

1363
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:14,751
And thinking fast and so is so much about the individual and when you combine the thoughts and both of those books

1364
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:19,871
And where we're going with societies where we're going with you individually and where we're going with the

1365
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,967
Individual as a computer

1366
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:27,551
You put those together and it's it's a synthesis for

1367
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
Helping you

1368
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,903
Understand the world in a better way

1369
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,975
To help you make better decisions as a leader for where we need

1370
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
To go

1371
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
I'm as a society people and us

1372
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
Society of people that co-evolved with

1373
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
So I take

1374
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,167
The third book

1375
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,727
That I'd recommend in this is only from a

1376
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,775
Seeing things in a different way

1377
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
And

1378
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,079
Seeing things

1379
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,151
To get out your space if you can't move to go see things differently

1380
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,223
Is a book called In Praise of Shadows

1381
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
I don't know if you know it

1382
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
But it's only a

1383
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
60 or 70

1384
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
Page Plus

1385
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,927
And it's by a Japanese author in 19

1386
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
30 poo

1387
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,999
Wrote down all

1388
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
Of his comparisons of

1389
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,607
The old Asian Japanese world

1390
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,239
To the more Western modernize world when things were becoming Electra

1391
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,335
And machines lights and everything we're coming to Japan

1392
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:28,735
And the difference is between them two and you can then see like oh my God there's a different way of living

1393
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:35,135
And maybe the way we're living today isn't the most effective way there might be some older things are some different ways

1394
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,671
So makes you

1395
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,719
Rethink your surroundings

1396
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,535
And help you tune into that

1397
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Kind of

1398
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,863
What is it that I perpetuate

1399
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,655
That I kind of suppress

1400
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
That I need to go look at

1401
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,007
Again and rethink of in the new light

1402
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,543
To get your mind

1403
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
In a flowing again

1404
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
For Creative juices

1405
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,639
What do you do for fun

1406
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
What to do for fun

1407
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
I love to bike

1408
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,991
I love to run

1409
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Yoga

1410
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
So do yoga live

1411
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Music

1412
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:10,463
Without a doubt I'm going I can't I can't get enough music music music music music music music music concerts

1413
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,487
Going a lot of cons

1414
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:17,119
Now I'm watching my what's also fun now for me is no watching my kids grow

1415
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,703
And going out surfing when I know the kids can surf better than me

1416
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:25,055
I try but they're already like well past it

1417
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:29,151
And so so fun for me is watching them grow

1418
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,431
And then the other one is

1419
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,991
In and our family grow but the other thing that's fun is

1420
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,271
Watching the startup

1421
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,319
And watching

1422
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,367
You know they're all little kids

1423
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,695
In a way I'm watching them mature and watching the leaders

1424
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:45,023
Not just the entrepreneur the founder but the watching the management team

1425
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,071
And seeing them

1426
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,119
Go through different phase in your life

1427
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Wow

1428
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
It's really amazed

1429
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,543
So those are all fun things for me and I'm only doing the things I like

1430
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
In my life

1431
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
Because they're fun

1432
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Cuz I don't have to

1433
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,199
You answer me another question which is

1434
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
A lot of people who do well

1435
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,807
Morcheeba lot in life

1436
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
Are quite intense

1437
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
An operator faster

1438
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,695
Sure going to try to manage a large organization

1439
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,231
Operative

1440
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:20,607
Saudi reconcile how do you reconcile that to get every move in the right direction

1441
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,423
Without burning a lot of them with his $0.11

1442
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:27,007
Well it's a really great question but it's all relative

1443
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Right

1444
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,591
Sometimes you can push too hard

1445
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,127
Because that's what you want

1446
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,175
You also have to remember that

1447
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,479
Good decisions don't just happen

1448
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
Fast sure does take some time

1449
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,575
Analysis paralysis

1450
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,111
Would you also can't make

1451
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,903
Knee-jerk reactions

1452
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
Based on gut

1453
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
Like there is there are

1454
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
There are

1455
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,559
Backbase decisions and opinion-based

1456
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,607
And leaders need to know the difference

1457
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,775
Opinion-based ones should be made by a core team or one person and continued that right

1458
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,359
And fact-based ones as long as you don't get in that now is paralysis

1459
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:09,759
It should be fast and so they make a good enough decision you know and you know what the bassist was making

1460
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
Undo it if the assumption

1461
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
So

1462
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
There's there's a

1463
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,927
If you're working

1464
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
100 hours a week

1465
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
120 hours a week

1466
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
No way

1467
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,119
Look it's not going to happen it's not sustainable

1468
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,447
That's what happen when I was in my 20s and I

1469
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
I had to reboot my life because

1470
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,287
I think Elon Musk is learning that right

1471
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,591
Write the can't work that

1472
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
It just

1473
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,383
Do not get to make

1474
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,967
So your organization needs to move fast

1475
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,527
You need to

1476
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,647
Have them you set up the main goals they set up the sub goals

1477
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,975
And then they get back to you the tasks and the work product

1478
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,047
You know that they're going to be in the deliverables in the timing

1479
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,839
And then you can negotiate over there

1480
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,631
Right and you push

1481
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,935
And when hourly happens is is

1482
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
1

1483
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,591
One team says I can move this fast the other team says I can move that fast and they have to work together cuz I don't teams

1484
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:11,711
Do they normally push you pull me kind of experience as long as you have it laid out

1485
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:15,039
See you but you have to agree on what the parameters are in

1486
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
And those things up front

1487
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
It sucks

1488
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,647
Not hat it's not fun and things change all the time

1489
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,975
But until people understand that relationship in that bonding

1490
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,279
And that they each have to work with each other

1491
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,815
And under some kind of

1492
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
You know

1493
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,399
Schedule of deliverables

1494
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,703
That's when the home thing gets moving

1495
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,287
It's your job as a leader to set the mission and set the major goals

1496
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
Let them come back

1497
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
With the details

1498
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,407
And make sure you all agree

1499
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,479
But then each team's going to push each other and as soon as it comes up

1500
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
You know it's like

1501
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:50,111
You want me to get involved I can help him push him along if you want and I will

1502
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,439
And if it happens enough times then you'll know you need to replace the fur

1503
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
Or sometimes they rise to the challenge

1504
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
But typically

1505
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,583
I see if you pired well enough

1506
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,631
People will rise to the challenge

1507
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
As long as you're not number one

1508
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:06,239
Overdoing it like going too fast

1509
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
Right you can explain your decisions

1510
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:14,431
And that you set up some framework for a scheduling so that everybody understands their interdependencies

1511
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
So everything can Loop

1512
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
Right

1513
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
So you got to have

1514
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,575
Good tools to make that

1515
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,671
But if they all have two relatively be on the same page

1516
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
If not

1517
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
You're going to find out very quickly

1518
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,511
To trim off those

1519
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
Those people

1520
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,071
And then the other one is when you're

1521
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:34,143
At a certain enough sizes you make sure you have mentoring

1522
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
Inside the

1523
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
So that the mentor

1524
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Third party method

1525
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,799
I just not internal third-party Metra comes in

1526
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
And then came then

1527
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
You know

1528
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
Be that

1529
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,175
Advocate for whichever party

1530
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,503
Is moving too fast or moving too slow and whatever

1531
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,855
To help you normalize what's really going on because I would get a lot of people

1532
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879
Appointing each other

1533
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
And the more times

1534
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,303
You know I get people blaming I always say look

1535
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,351
You can come in

1536
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,399
Complain to me as much as you want

1537
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,959
Cable TV show up in my office

1538
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
I'm going to make a decision

1539
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
The neither of you can only like

1540
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,823
So you guys figured out before you get in

1541
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,967
The meeting should never be about the arguments inside the meeting unless something new happened

1542
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,247
After planting or who knows what it is

1543
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,087
Ghosting should be all worked out just like a great Board of meeting

1544
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:31,999
A great Rapport building goes really smoothly because all of us individual issues got worked out well before the board meeting in the board meeting

1545
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
Music for Molly

1546
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
Large

1547
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,351
Team meetings are also the same

1548
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,935
All those little things we talked about the big thing

1549
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,727
And we get through the big decisions

1550
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
Not the little stopper squabbling

1551
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
So

1552
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
You know I'm at

1553
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
Stats about being a perv

1554
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
Nnn learning that end

1555
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,455
Having a mentor there

1556
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,783
Help those people learn that because you really a lot of young teams

1557
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
They start

1558
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
Daniel pointing

1559
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,647
They don't understand what it means to be over

1560
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
So that's just a

1561
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
You know

1562
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
Lack of experience

1563
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,303
But that can be learned quickly if you have the right tools

1564
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,607
As a follow-up question

1565
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,143
BBQ in the valley

1566
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,447
I was bleeding work-life balance

1567
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,983
And

1568
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,079
And also thought they had that you can we innovate you work the Chinese

1569
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
At least not at 6

1570
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
What's the name of this podcast

1571
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,455
Because we

1572
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,759
That's impossible they think that

1573
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,783
To do innovation

1574
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
Indicted Armin

1575
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,879
Between the two kind of arguments

1576
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,671
So what would you think truth lies

1577
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,999
How could something move fast

1578
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
Work hard in Stoughton

1579
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,095
Well first they have to understand what

1580
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,143
Their true value in differentiate

1581
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,215
If you understand what your true differentiation is

1582
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
Anna value

1583
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
Then you work really hard on that

1584
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,335
And you have to work double time to build it till I get

1585
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Okay

1586
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
You can't

1587
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:59,295
There's certain crunch periods when it's a week or two weeks were people all we're all shipping something or something's got to happen

1588
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,623
Yes there's going to be extra time and yeah I could be 996

1589
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,647
Chicopee 997

1590
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,463
Whatever it takes

1591
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,255
They can't be that all the time

1592
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Ripe

1593
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
Because again

1594
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,607
Just like you can be in the

1595
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,167
Echo chamber of a Spate of a

1596
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
City

1597
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Orab

1598
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
Industry

1599
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,263
You can be the echo chamber of a

1600
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,359
What company and you can never get to see what reality is like outside

1601
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:28,223
And know what real problems are cuz all you're doing a 7 coming for us you need to remember what your own problems

1602
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,623
Everybody needs time to process

1603
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,183
I always say sometimes

1604
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
You need to slow down

1605
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Speed up

1606
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
And that means having the proper checkpoints product development checkpoints right proper board means the proper communication

1607
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,983
Patience doesn't mean it needs to be this you know

1608
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,311
Lots of red tape and tons of you know

1609
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Processing

1610
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,383
But you gotta slow down and you got

1611
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
Taking some cases

1612
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,967
To be able to go faster so that you don't make

1613
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,271
And that's about

1614
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
You know

1615
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,087
Again experience manager

1616
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,415
As opposed to just work faster and harder and we'll get it solved

1617
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,695
It doesn't work

1618
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,279
Because you're going to do that and like you said you're going to end up burning

1619
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,815
It's just not

1620
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,351
Just not going to work in

1621
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
You know I've seen that a lot in

1622
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,959
Startups and young managers I associate a lot in

1623
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
You know where I

1624
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,031
Been in various places in China

1625
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
You know it's

1626
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
It's not thoughtful

1627
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,919
You got it you got to have you step on the gas

1628
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
The step on the brakes

1629
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Sometimes

1630
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
And you know what

1631
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,319
Frankly my some of my best ideas and best solutions to problems that happen

1632
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
When I'm away from you

1633
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,927
Jennifer just even a few hours when I go for that run

1634
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
Don't go for a run and have music

1635
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,791
Don't go for whatever you know in

1636
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:49,119
And be distracted cuz you're sitting there walking and you're still on your phone like

1637
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
You got to have a shutdown

1638
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,935
Sleep

1639
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
It doesn't mean you having another meeting and I was literally

1640
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:01,151
I called Tony time

1641
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,199
You know I'd be nice just like okay

1642
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,015
And I'm not thinking about it but all the sudden boom

1643
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,319
The solution the problem shows up in your brain

1644
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,343
People think that

1645
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,879
Working harder is going to solve it

1646
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
It's Not Over

1647
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Most the time

1648
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,511
The world's increasing need swimming global

1649
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
Do you worry about

1650
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,095
The mindset of Silicon Valley

1651
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,887
As being the hungry now

1652
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,215
Not not not be aware enough

1653
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,495
What's going on

1654
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,543
I think that

1655
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
People

1656
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
Ra

1657
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,103
Product of the

1658
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
And

1659
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
Just like

1660
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,967
I needed to get out of

1661
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,247
Silicon Valley

1662
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,599
After 25 years it's great and nothing wrong with it but I get to learn new ways

1663
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,647
I think that each person should

1664
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
Understand that there's great things

1665
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
About all kinds of play

1666
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
Places and there's not so great things

1667
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
Nowadays

1668
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,095
Because of the democratization of

1669
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,911
You should go to different places and see how they ended

1670
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,703
And see how they build Ark

1671
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
And how they get along

1672
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:02,079
That thing you got to do much but you got to have more than one data point

1673
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,615
To know the right way.

1674
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,223
And a lot of people now ask me who are in Silicon Valley phone number

1675
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,503
What would you do

1676
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
Right now if you were me

1677
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,063
And I said

1678
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,087
You're in your 20s

1679
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,623
I said go somewhere

1680
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:18,207
Go somewhere go to China go to Korea

1681
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,255
Go to your go somewhere else

1682
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
For 3 months

1683
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,351
Just go live there go

1684
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,167
See what it's all about building that work outside

1685
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,727
Do you get a new baselining

1686
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:34,847
Of what's going on around the world to come back with fresh ideas and your valuable to someone

1687
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,151
Even if you have to go back for whatever reason

1688
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,943
You're valuable because you have

1689
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,807
A different perspective than what everyone else has and as we know great startups

1690
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,855
Ingrate

1691
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
You know what to call it

1692
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
Colleges look for

1693
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,463
They look for people who are differentiated

1694
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,815
Differentiate yourself it ain't going to happen when you're in the same place all day

1695
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:59,167
Go differentiate yourself and go challenge yourself somewhere else

1696
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,775
And go learn about a place or learn about a new sector alert about anything

1697
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:09,151
Do you come back and you're more valuable for yourself and more valuable for other people around you

1698
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,271
