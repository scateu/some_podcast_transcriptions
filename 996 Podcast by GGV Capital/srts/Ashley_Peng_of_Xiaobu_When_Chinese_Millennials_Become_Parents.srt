Good to see you

42
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,968
Great how did you come up with the idea for shampoo

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Was

44
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
2 years old

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
Saddle her highchair

46
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
And having

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
She just has kept us

48
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Throwing her food away

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864
Her dad got really angry because he reminded

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
Several times that she just

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Didn't listen to him at all

52
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
Eventually

53
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
Her dad

54
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
Yelled at her and

55
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
It's through her into a dark room

56
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,992
Season my daughter was afraid of Darkness

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
As always said she

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
She didn't like her dad

59
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Jaheim

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Election in 2000

61
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
Cipro ears to correct this mistake

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Rochester the fitness

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Part also

64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,680
The intimacy between her dad and her

65
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
And actually I've learned a lot

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
In this process

67
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
I think most importantly

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Two lessons

69
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
First

70
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Both my husband and I

71
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
We had to master degrees

72
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
Frontier Hall University and Stanford

73
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
University

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
So

75
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Both of us

76
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Is like

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
We received the best education we're smart

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Oh wait still no no

79
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
Sing about education

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
Comes to like educating

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Our daughter

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Piano better than

83
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Anatomy

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Or our parents

85
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Rice

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
So

87
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Reverb artist

88
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
Yeah yeah yeah

89
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
I think so because

90
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Very basic mistake

91
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
It's because we know

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
Nothing about parenting

93
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,552
Delete that example I mentioned

94
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
The Amendments reasons

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
It's because my daughter was

96
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
At 2

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
She was at this sensitive period Where

98
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
She was testing

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
The space she was

100
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Experiencing the founder of

101
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
Throwing things away

102
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
Getting control of something

103
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
You know about

104
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
Wait we just

105
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Use our adult

106
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,383
View to sink that the sheets she didn't listen to

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
She was annoying

108
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
The Redeemer

109
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
Parents should learn about

110
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
It's not natural right it's not that

111
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,071
Because you are smart you you have a very good degree that you should naturally know about these it's not

112
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
It's something that you really have to

113
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
So

114
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
This is the first lesson

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,079
The second edition is that I actually use many ways to try to bring

116
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
Back together

117
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
I tried to

118
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,735
Vector my daughter that you should like your dad that

119
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,367
Love you and I actually didn't work if you don't work at all

120
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
And he went Rudy

121
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
The most important to

122
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,863
Help us is game for the parenting activities that we together with her

123
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
So

124
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,215
Play together they actually do things

125
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Together

126
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,871
Can do a lot of things and that is so fun

127
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
All these things brings her back

128
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
Her dad

129
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
Was not that easy

130
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Because you know like

131
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,855
Chinese people tend to

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
More serious

133
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Or read it

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
We're not video

135
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Free used to 2

136
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Aldo

137
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Activities or sports or

138
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,143
Hentwi record

139
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
DIY kind of saying yes because

140
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,775
What we were raised up we didn't have to

141
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,943
This and do not have that email regine's we have to learn about these things

142
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,759
And I actually spend a lot of time

143
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Researching

144
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
Online and learned about

145
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
I spend so much time

146
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
Exerting all kinds of methods

147
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
From the flooring website

148
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,375
And try to find out to the phone way to engage

149
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Wish my teeth

150
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
And it was not that easy

151
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
Should I study law book series

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Because you haven't

153
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
Learn about the series before you engage please her

154
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,943
Also I collect ideas

155
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
And I have to arrange them

156
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
Based on her age

157
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Based on her interest

158
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
And I have to teach my family

159
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,743
To do these things because it's not the only my job I have to

160
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Teach her

161
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Dad have

162
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
T chart

163
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Her grandparents

164
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
How to

165
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,239
Use this interesting found way to re-engage with her

166
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
And I realized

167
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
If every X have to go

168
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Through these processes

169
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
Will be like the bereans too high

170
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
A very interesting way

171
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
And I could see if it works

172
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
On children

173
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Actually

174
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
I have some friends

175
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
Sending their

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
Try to my home

177
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
And

178
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
The children will change

179
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Raising two or three days

180
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
If you

181
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
Use a right way to engage with

182
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
The change very fast

183
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,591
And I stink all the parents should learn about

184
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Have to go through

185
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
The pain for a and a complicated process

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
So

187
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,647
I came up with the idea of shampoo that we can create something

188
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
That led the parents

189
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
Learn about the Saints

190
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Berkeley

191
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
An easy lie

192
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,887
So basically that's how I

193
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Tamales ideas

194
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,799
So it's something that you wish existed when you were a new parents yourself

195
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
So yeah when I was new parents

196
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
I don't think there's anything

197
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
Exist I still remember I searched

198
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
Parenting activities with keys of

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Free

200
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
Elias Tarrytown Baidu

201
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Probably

202
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
20 articles

203
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
15 of them are the same

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,655
And rectify that gave me about

205
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
20 ideas

206
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
And that's why

207
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Anna Pizza

208
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,127
I think there were only about like 7:08 ideas that attracted me

209
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
Result in a picture

210
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,551
Animation to video Genova picture I have to have to read

211
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Imagine

212
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
And try to understand what it means from all the wording

213
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
And apixaban

214
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
And I Try by

215
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
NFL

216
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Free so

217
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,935
Situation

218
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
Started the whole thing

219
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
I was so pissed off I feel like there's no real guidance online

220
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
How to engage with your kids

221
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
Incontinent

222
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,903
Accompany your keys

223
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Activities

224
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
WhatsApp

225
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
I just passed

226
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
Fall activities

227
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Because I can

228
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,399
Quickly understand that I should do activities

229
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Took me so long

230
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
How to actually do what

231
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,079
So I think that's why I told oh my

232
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
A user is my team.

233
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Practicing it

234
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
Is the most difficult

235
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,247
Because

236
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Really easy to understand the concept

237
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Actually doing it

238
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
It is at the following and the thief

239
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
I thought they are a lot of snow

240
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Florence

241
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Community sites

242
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
About how you should do

243
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
You can raise your kids

244
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
Especially from people in the same community

245
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
Share with each other

246
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,823
Also in there other sites like baby tree we've been around a long time

247
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
Yes a lot of content on it

248
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Were they not enough for you

249
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
I think the most important thing is that it's not

250
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Systemic

251
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,903
Super Sub or the kind of hunting I mention is basically

252
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
It was actually an almost

253
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Naughty this is

254
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Which Apple started

255
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
Actually when I was a new mom

256
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
Not too much content

257
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
And and also even if there was something

258
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
It was scattered all are fragmented

259
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Do you have to do a lot of work

260
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
To oxidize them

261
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
3D

262
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,391
Make some something that you not only you can digest but also you can teach your family

263
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
That's actually very difficult

264
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Yes

265
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
So you are a millennial parent yourself I wonder what are some characteristics of this generation of

266
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
Millennial parents in China

267
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:27,871
Being a millennial parent in China today is that like as in more difficult than before or is it easier

268
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Very important

269
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Characteristics

270
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Lack of information

271
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
For this generous

272
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
Old people

273
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
Too much information and actually

274
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
You don't have enough time

275
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
You have to look for the information

276
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Very

277
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Efficiently

278
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
I think that's a very

279
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Big difference

280
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
So my parents

281
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Generation

282
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
There were only

283
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
About

284
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
A handful of experts talking about

285
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,831
These things and they were just a simple magazines that you could trust

286
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,975
You could get this information and in just a blunt

287
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
But now it's

288
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
It's Britney

289
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
A nesting stats y

290
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,375
The pay for accountant

291
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
Is rhydian you trans

292
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
In China

293
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
All these parents

294
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
So much information

295
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Out the air

296
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
And they

297
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Mortgage magically more

298
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Authority

299
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Information

300
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
3D photo

301
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
And also

302
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
Information

303
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
To be

304
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
Very easy to be digested

305
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Sometimes we feel

306
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
That's a little bit country

307
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Because normally we would

308
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Information

309
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Exist

310
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
For example in books

311
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Rye

312
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Please sistematica

313
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
And then maybe courses

314
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
School

315
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
Diesel

316
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
It's too much

317
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,735
It's too heavy for these losers

318
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Good information

319
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Very very efficient way

320
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
So that's

321
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
Jose

322
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
Required

323
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
Content provider

324
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
To support that

325
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
That's why I sing

326
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
If you ask the weather

327
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
Easier or more challenging to

328
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
Raise a child

329
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
I think it's very difficult

330
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
To say like

331
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,591
When I was young I still remember my mom works 6 days a week

332
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
Stayed at home

333
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Mom

334
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,479
Didn't even exist at a time

335
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
In China

336
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
It's not

337
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Even possible

338
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
So most apparent

339
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Just

340
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
Jewel their children

341
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Add to their grandparents

342
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
I still remember I

343
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
I spend a lot of time at

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
My hometown so

345
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Nowadays

346
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Differently people have more choice

347
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
Mm equals 1/2

348
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,335
A lot of things help them break them whole like we don't have to cook now

349
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
A lot of time

350
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
So maybe it's easier

351
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
At the same time

352
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
It's getting more and more challenging

353
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
My mom actually just studied very

354
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Basic things

355
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Pat Toomey

356
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
And she just

357
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
She understood saver basic

358
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Principles

359
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
And she did very well

360
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
I grew up

361
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
But now

362
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
I think most parents

363
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
They're not

364
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Not to join

365
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
The train. I was saying

366
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
Make a pushing very hard on their children

367
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
And pacing

368
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Among

369
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
Like a different mother

370
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Yeah and

371
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
The tiger mother

372
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,671
It's very difficult to do this because

373
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Cuz everyone is doing this

374
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
And

375
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
And the competition is getting

376
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
More and more fierce

377
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
I would say this is the most rich Hannigan

378
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Hardee's

379
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
Just understand what you really want for your

380
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Hialeah

381
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
What is really good for Dan

382
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
And stick to it

383
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Instead of just

384
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
Being driven by fomo fear of missing out

385
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Yeah

386
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,951
One term that I frequently see on the shell boo app is quality companionship

387
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
This is actually

388
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,071
Kind of opposed to what many Chinese parents are used to do which is

389
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,911
To send their children to various classes and activities

390
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
And camps and hope that these activities will shave their children into who they want them to be so why do you think quality

391
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Companionship is so important

392
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
First

393
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
I think I have a 1 ways a little bit

394
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Knowledge

395
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
Education would know that

396
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Parenthood

397
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
The faces

398
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
For everything

399
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
For all the educator

400
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
Companionship is the basics

401
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
If you

402
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
Don't spend time with you

403
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
Especially Spell haiku

404
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Time visual kids

405
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
There's no way that they

406
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Plus you

407
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Did love you

408
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
And a photo

409
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Your guys's

410
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
If

411
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
That lock

412
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Lacoste

413
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
And love

414
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
Is missing in the relationship

415
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
It's very very difficult for you to

416
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
To do anything

417
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
And I think a lot of love

418
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Aaron's

419
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Actually

420
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
Did you realize how important

421
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
They always feel like a

422
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
Correcting the child at that moment

423
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Is more important than

424
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
NEC

425
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
Why sing the so-called Racine

426
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,287
Is more important than maintaining

427
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Relationship with

428
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,383
The first is really The Thundermans

429
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
If you ask any

430
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Capers

431
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
Or any research

432
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
They were

433
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Stephanie

434
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
Ethically

435
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
I think no one can be better teacher than

436
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
The Pirates

437
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
What you did at this age

438
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Especially for children

439
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Before

440
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
School

441
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Because

442
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
For children from 0 to 6

443
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
So different

444
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
You know like why

445
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,543
Almost all the countries require the children to

446
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Start school to real school

447
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,919
At the age of about six or seven

448
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
No earlier than that

449
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Because

450
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
Before this age

451
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Children develop so differently

452
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Some shooting

453
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Stars versus trolley

454
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Ross motion

455
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,023
And they survived the relatively slowly

456
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Fine motor

457
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,423
Are very strong and language skill

458
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
I'm South children height table at Cosmo

459
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
It's no

460
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
There's no standard

461
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
Orno like

462
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
General principle

463
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Said you can

464
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
So

465
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
At this stage

466
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Really require parents to

467
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Charity

468
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Child

469
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Play song your observations

470
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Play song you're on

471
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Christianity

472
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
And also based on your knowledge

473
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
Education

474
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,399
So this all comes very naturally

475
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Waze

476
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
High quality

477
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Nobody can ever

478
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Ready substitute this

479
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
So

480
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
It's so important to teach YouTube

481
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Parents

482
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
The correct way to engage wizard

483
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Actually

484
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Is Maury fake

485
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
You spending time with your

486
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Chide

487
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,671
For about like half an hour maybe

488
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
More

489
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
Effective than sending them

490
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
A school

491
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
Special results School

492
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
Was very Light commercial

493
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
Driven schools

494
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
Very limited training teachers

495
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Actually

496
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Should have the

497
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Can do much better

498
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Then

499
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Zeze

500
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
So-called

501
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,271
Teach her the damn not even like a serious teacher that you still like her

502
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
Employees hired by

503
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
A commercial Training Center

504
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
And maybe get

505
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Change 4

506
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
About 10 days

507
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
And started to teach your child

508
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
I think all the parents

509
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Should have the comfy

510
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
And should have the

511
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Responsibility

512
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
You already think that you are the best

513
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
For your child

514
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Other state

515
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,175
Quality companionship is something that's relatively new in China

516
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
It's a it's a concept thing

517
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
That's popular in developed

518
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Country

519
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
So I think the fact that you

520
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
We are like that's important and want to make the epochal in China

521
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
It's very admirable and makes a lot of sense

522
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
But as you know many most

523
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
Most of the Chinese families

524
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
Have to income parents

525
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
So it's harder for the mom

526
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
It's been a lot of quality time

527
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
With there with with with her kiss

528
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
What would be your advice

529
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
2

530
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Most families are in that situation

531
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
To achieve quality companionship

532
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
Yeah I think so

533
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,159
The first is that you really have to find information very

534
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Efficiently

535
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
When is it half an hour high quality

536
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Companionship

537
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
The time you should spend

538
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Much more than just

539
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
Half an hour

540
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
Because you have to think about how you should

541
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
To do with your tongue

542
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
How you feel you have to

543
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Connect Bluetooth

544
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,175
If you do

545
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,575
I understand what game said you you can play with your child or children can initiate a lot of love

546
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
Activities in Greensboro

547
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
If the parents

548
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Inspiring

549
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
I want to play a few ideas

550
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583
Two children who have to do their homework

551
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,447
Jackson's of time required is much more than the time you spend with your

552
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Your children

553
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,311
Again that's why weight would do shampoo

554
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Because we want to save time for

555
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
And we want you

556
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Find Seas

557
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,319
If I can spend very very limited time

558
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
For example like

559
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,184
Ava video 1800s just don't like 1 minute

560
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
You just been one minute

561
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
To learn about

562
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
And the activity please select is already

563
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,168
A face down there a gif face down

564
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
I even Tara Maids

565
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
For your child based on your feedback

566
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,920
Ojc things you have to do for us to do the homework or you find someone to do the homework for you

567
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,272
Amazon concentrate and you play with your

568
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Children

569
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Show

570
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
That's the first part

571
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
As you come hard I do saying

572
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
You have to teach your family

573
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Do this

574
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,840
This maybe not very common in the States but in China

575
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Yeah it's

576
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Vervain normal

577
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,960
I heard a number is it more than 80%

578
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Of children raised in

579
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
CDs

580
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
Are Ray stop actually buy

581
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
So

582
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
You really really have to

583
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
Educate the whole family

584
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
You have to

585
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
Mobilizing have to

586
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
Metsm

587
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
Started as well

588
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
It's actually very challenging because

589
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
It's difficult work

590
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
The elderly's 3D

591
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
Open mind

592
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
And studying you

593
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Approach

594
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
If you ready

595
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
Find a way

596
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Ray effect

597
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Safeway to

598
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,544
To make some feel

599
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
This is the act

600
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
V

601
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Very anxious

602
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
This is new with the newest.

603
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Next

604
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Actually very very important

605
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
I think

606
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
Against

607
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
Much more effective than lecturing

608
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
This is a choo choo

609
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
Your children and also true to your heart your parrot

220 Alder

611
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
So

612
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
The teacher then and let them

613
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
Music

614
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
The scientific

615
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
And

616
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Systematic way

617
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
To engage Boise

618
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,336
Because you cannot just rely on

619
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
So

620
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,944
Obviously you have gone through a lot and also

621
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224

Complaints for many others

624
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,624
So how do you think about when you design your product

625
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,720
Do you design for the parents duties and for the grandparents as well

626
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,816

We're very Hands-On to learn about them

629
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,520
And how do you get more people to share their experience in content

630
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Are you apart from 2

631
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
Got started

632
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,664
The first day we adopted a very

633
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Scientific way

634
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Because we walked this

635
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
To be

636
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
First Delight.

637
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808

643
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
The framework

644
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
It is very important

645
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,568
That's a rarity Define the product

646
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848

Design Concepts

652
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,488
Because we know that the users want the information

653
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Information

654
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Easy

655
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
And they want

656
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,912
How to share with other people

657
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
A special visitor laminate

658
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496

659
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
Very easy

660
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056

Of course

665
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
It's more of a castle

666
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320

738
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
It's not just account

739
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
Let me put it this way

740
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
If we divide

741
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
How industry into several

742
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Community-based

743
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Accountant

744
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Where

745
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
People just

746
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
The discussion

747
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,688
They discuss the things and the universe

748
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
And the information is

749
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Reach

750
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
And also

751
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
Not very system

752
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,744
Like just the accountant

753
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512

754
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584

755
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864

Offer service

758
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
And I think we are at the

759
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
The search stage

760
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Because we

761
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
We ready I think is the most important

762
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Practicing

763
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
I keep saying that

764
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Any

765
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,040
Activities that you do is your

766
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064

Could be very different

768
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
How strong you are

769
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
Imagination

770
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
Because you could sink this is

771
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
Boring this book

772
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024

773
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Cyn.

774
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
You would think of throwing things

775
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
Show me a place away is very boring

776
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936

It could be very very far

779
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
The actual doing part is right

780
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Important

781
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
And that's why

782
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Use a lot of them

783
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Tennessee

I think this is

803
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
Especially true

Elmira Castle

823
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
We used to have

824
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,608
Used to have word limit of law

825
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
300 words

826
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
And they had

827
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
I said to 500

828
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,592
And of one salted and then complete

829
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896

That picture

833
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
So

834
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
Our

835
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
I think Oliver

836
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Rickey Stokes

837
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
Different from other

838
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Like just a photo album

839
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
It's not just

840
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
Nazareth

00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,632
Video diaries video

842
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Arab

843
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
How are you

844
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Accompany your child

845
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
2

846
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
To grow up

847
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,848
Obviously to start any company in China you need to pay

848
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Very large Market

849
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm in just to get some

850
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:47,040
Background the early childhood education Market in China is actually huge today

851
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,136
So there are 20 million new babies born in China every year

852
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,720
Montgomery is actually encouraging people to have more babies now

853
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,376
So because we're living in a time when we're really starting to feel the consequences of the one-child policy wishes

854
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Contributed to an aging Society

855
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
Is projected that by 2040 24% of China's population will be aged 65 or older

856
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:16,736
So the Chinese government has actually reversed that decade-long one-child policy and is pursuing a two child policy now

857
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:22,368
And I even started heading out subsidies and benefits to persuade people to have a second child

858
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,744
And this is why we had ggv felt like the early childhood education Market is

859
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Worth betting on

860
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,608
We could go to the Stamford

861
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
China

862
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,960
I guess was the economic Forum with number Summit 2 weekends ago

863
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:42,336
I have to say no

864
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,736
How does bakers basin from Kickin It is vital to get tickets Adele

865
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,576
Actually I got the news and I almost forgot the

866
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
Tickets and I give up because it has another meeting at Shanghai

867
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,256
Too bad

868
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,096
We are probably because

869
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,936
James chairman of secret

870
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,008
Separate ESP alarm PSI PhD from Stanford

871
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
Who wrote the book

872
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:17,152
Asia population policy the China Hut

873
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
What does he talk about how

874
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,992
Have you only have one child policy

875
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,296
Makes the China and Asia Society in

876
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
Decrease by productivity in

877
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,160
In base foundation for economic growth

878
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
So

879
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Side effects of some of his efforts

880
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
Now China has a two child policy

881
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
Are you seeing the impact

882
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Of that

883
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,680
I something as pasta for your business

884
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
Do you see Chinese parents

885
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
These days are more willing to have a second child

886
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Or do you see the stuff take some time to

887
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
To adjust for that

888
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Because the pace of life

889
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
Still very fast in people are very busy

890
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
I think it's the definitely

891
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
For the industry

892
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
People started to

893
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
To have more

894
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,744
Keith and when they started we have more keys

895
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
StayWell

896
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Feel

897
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Essex people

898
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
People with one teeth

899
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
RVD

900
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,192
Different from people with several kids

901
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
I know we have two and a second one is exponentially more

902
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah exactly

903
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Batteries Plus

904
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,736
Yes oh Daisy actually require

905
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
Much more

906
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
Cervix much more efficient service

907
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
Good for the industry

908
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,536
I cannot focus the like whether Chinese people would have more or less

909
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Children

910
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
I think one thing is

911
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Tiffany true

912
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
People started to

913
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,240
Raise the child in the more

914
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
I would say

915
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,872
Sanlitun

916
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
Yeah exactly

917
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
So they don't chase for

918
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
I think the lesson of this

919
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Parents

920
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Chasing

921
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
I chasing for

922
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
So cord

923
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Justice

924
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
Next school results

925
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
These days

926
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
They

927
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
More and more people have

928
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
World

929
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
View on

930
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Education

931
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
And this definitely

932
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,704
Helps the whole Jenner

933
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,008
You measure the word knowledge

934
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,824
Its impact

935
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
Proliferation of mobile Commerce in China

936
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,736
90% of transactions on e-commerce are all done over a smartphone

937
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,088
He also see that WeChat pay is truly popular

938
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:37,184
People that share share money with each other each other

939
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,048
And so given the given the mobile payments so big in China

940
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
11 times the size of

941
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
Bouquet Market in the US

942
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
Do you see that people are not used

943
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
Used to paying for knowledge as well

944
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,360
And therefore more willing user you more than user to Windows pay for premium hunting

945
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,432
Because it's so easy and they see the body

946
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,248
Yeah definitely payment is

947
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Definitely

948
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
Some say that

949
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
People to

950
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Or not encourage

951
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Enable

952
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
M2

953
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Payforit

954
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
Pay for the concert

955
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
But I think more important

956
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Play it

957
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Estimation

958
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Hamachi

959
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
There's just too much

960
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
And people

961
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,056
Study to see the value of

962
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
Selection

963
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
And

964
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
See the value of

965
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
High quality

966
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
So

967
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
That's a very good shape

968
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,648
Nu Eve also worked at eCommerce company or me out babe before

969
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
How did that experience inform

970
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
How you're running shovel today

971
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,072
I think he may yeah

972
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
What channels do

973
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Observe

974
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Young Harris

975
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
I realize that they are really

976
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Bye

977
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
Because the end

978
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,616
Are many companies that

979
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
Try to leverage that

980
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Add interest

981
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
To to get them to buy

982
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
A lot a lot more more than they need

983
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
However

984
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
The trust you

985
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
Because You released there

986
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184

987
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
Christy ring

988
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
So

989
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
They can buy for once

990
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
They can buy under

993
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704

As a founder

1019
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648

This is actually a very different

1128
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Difficult question

1129
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
Because I am

1139
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312

Cannot be missing

1147
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512

The future of China

1153
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008

00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
This September

1173
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,807
A local school and she attended a very

1174
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,647
Like a foreign style International style kindergarten

1175
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,463
And she was raised up

1176
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
I mean

1177
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Waze

1178
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
All kinds of freedom

1179
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,679
Increase in the first week

1180
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
She said she was shocked and she was

1181
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
Complaining everyday

1182
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,615
You said all the teacher

1183
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
Doesn't allow us

1184
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
To talk

1185
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,503
At all what they were walking

1186
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,087
They don't allow me to go to the bathroom

1187
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,159
Before I get the

1188
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,999
In a while she stays half these rules this

1189
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:18,399
This is unfair and it is a ridiculous

1190
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,983
That's in the public school system

1191
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,079
There are so many children there are 800 children

1192
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:32,223
In there school for 1 grapefruit wine

1193
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
What is a teacher assistant

1194
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:39,391
Don't allow you to go to the playground during the break

1195
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:44,511
Because

1196
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,791
So she have to

1197
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:51,423
Chapter goes through these things and so that she understand how this Society work

1198
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,471
She will not

1199
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,775
Lucchese seems like a foreigner

1200
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:02,175
She's looking at these things as a foreigner now

1201
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,759
This is so absurd

1202
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551
After reading that hurt

1203
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Experiments

1204
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,647
So that's why I sent her to the public

1205
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,463
School in action

1206
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,791
Surprised surprised about my decision

1207
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
But me why I'd like to thank the parents

1208
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
A very important

1209
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
You have to teach them

1210
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
How to

1211
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
Have their own

1212
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,543
Opinion cheap theaters

1213
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
Yasir remine

1214
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
At least I will tell her

1215
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,711
It is still right for her to

1216
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,759
To have doubt on these things

1217
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:42,623
So it's important that the parents knows about things

1218
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,207
If you eat the parents just a photo what the teacher said

1219
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,767
Then maybe

1220
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
A challenges

1221
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:55,679
If they come to the Future work or come from more International environment

1222
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,263
Why does the role of the

1223
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
The pens are so important

1224
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,663
If you know about these you can you can correct them

1225
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,503
You kept a lot of the other things

1226
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,551
Other than School

1227
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
So

1228
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,367
I do think that very

1229
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Basic education

1230
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,951
You should still do it

1231
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
Despite of all these

1232
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,863
Elementary School you do Public School

1233
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
Local school

1234
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
Junior High School in high school

1235
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519

1236
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,335
Because I'll have to get ready

1237
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
I think for

1238
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,663
Elementary School

1239
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199

1240
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Make

1241
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
All the dishes

1242
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,879
Junior High and high school the more

1243
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Anomor

1244
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:53,023
Yeah I'm worried Vengeance Z10 sync on their own

1245
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,095
I think the thing I will do is that what I will

1246
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,119
Xposed for

1247
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887

Buspar

1249
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,959
And I will

1250
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
Make more decisions on her

1251
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,567
So I can also see you

1252
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
From now on

1253
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
Maybe she will

1254
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199

Difficult to say

1264
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:32,959
Now we move to the last part of the interview which is surrounded quick fire questions

1265
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,543
The first one is a entrepreneur you admire the most and why

00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079

And the other people's mind

1299
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
I think that's

1300
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
