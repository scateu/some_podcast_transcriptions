00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
In China was ucweb

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
And it's a pretty straightforward collaborations Amino Google just put the search bar on UC Browser

63
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,920
When Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D Co-op

Prenatal for the two of us to meet

65
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,856

00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Iowa State

67
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
2010

68
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
And

69
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
It took us a good

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Six months maybe even more than that

71
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,656
Eventually came to how we would like to come to eat

72
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
Already put together

73
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
And what product

74
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,104
It's a lot of discussions I was here late night discussion strings

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
Coffee's and Prince Charming

76
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,040
DNN smoking yes

77
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,624
Was it his idea first and then you

78
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
It was mainly his idea

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,303
But there was a discussions and ideas change also evolve over time

80
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,423
Both of us has a really you know I me as part of my job at Google working with

81
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Have a small team building Android system

82
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
It was part of my job to evangelize the Android

83
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
Is a open source operating system for the Next Generation

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Cinepolis

85
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
And then himself has a deep interest in Mobile at that time

86
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
So when I met him he has a bag of phones back then was you know what's my fault

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,463
Enterprise iPhone at that time also and also

88
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,767
And I myself also had a bag of full with me

89
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,095
Is that it was my job to carry all these hoes and use them

90
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,215
Especially USD Google service Google Maps Google search

91
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
Odyssey headphones and also Andreas

92
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
How's the weather

93
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
So we both had him read adventures and stuff like that

94
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,527
And it's pretty natural 4C Venturi saying hey maybe there's a way that we can

95
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,367
We can put together company and build that the Next Generation smartphones

96
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Fortunate

97
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
What did you think this was like a

98
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
Crazy idea at that time because there were so many large players in the smartphone world

99
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,727
I Claudius right there's a lot of big players back then

100
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
Samsung S5

101
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
And of course a poem

102
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Beijing China

103
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
There are many players and at the time Nokia's dominant but the opportunity really is

104
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
Will be this back then was

105
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,855
It wasn't really about future from what's the snowfall

106
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
It was

107
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Finger smartphone is a computer

108
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,975
Annie's a computer that allows you to process

109
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
And the Ant us

110
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
You can do it yeah it's a computer

111
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Anything that PCS can do

112
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Back in the old days

113
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
Eventually smartphones

114
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
And although

115
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
And more

116
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
So that was a really exciting idea

117
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,383
So we haven't thought much about all competition licensing

118
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
We just saying hey

119
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
There's an opportunity we can together pill company that builds this next generation

120
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Phone sent that people will

121
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Places opportunity that we talk.

122
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,671
Well I first met Beijing a bit earlier in 2008

123
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
Back then she had a thesis around three drivers

124
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
For internet growth in China

125
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
And they were similar to mine

126
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
Social networking was the first

127
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
E-commerce was sucking

128
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
IMobile

129
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Wireless internet

130
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
What's the third

131
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,335
Can I try to collaborate on social networking around casing lo1

132
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
That wasn't a successful so we hope to be

133
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
Then we try to Calabria run

134
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
E commerce company at Brand call Bangkok

135
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Funko

136
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Tempting

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,391
Which grow fast for a few years but eventually turn off

138
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,743
Is there a project that we try to work out together and make it work cuz he mobile

139
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
And not what size xiaomi

140
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
I remember the first time

141
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
I heard that ID about xiaomi from Beijing

142
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
And if I'm been

143
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
I thought

144
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
They were completely nuts

145
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,055
He's in history of phone companies in the world

146
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
No stop has ever been successful

147
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
And some even predicted

148
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
When I first invest in xiaomi 2010

149
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
That the only way

150
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Xiaomi can be big in China

151
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Is it Motorola

152
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Ericsson

153
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
And Nokia in back the Nokia was extreme dick was

154
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Everywhere in China

155
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
All three had to fail

156
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Pastrami

157
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
To have a chance to secede

158
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Get out of the habit

159
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
The more I heard about

160
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
Beijing and been talking about xiaomi

161
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,823
The more you can see how they hire they may have a chance

162
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
He's the only team in China

163
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
I had experiencing e-commerce

164
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
In Brimfield

165
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
In software engineering

166
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
In

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
Internet services for gaming

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
And

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Home Design exterior

170
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
No one else had all five skills Under One Roof

171
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,791
And this is why I saw they have a they may have a chance

172
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,119
To do something very special not no one else has ever done

173
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,495
Another person in that was key in the show me the history was Hugo Barra

174
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
I'm asking it was you being that

175
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
Convince him to join xiaomi

176
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,479
And he is now at Oculus at Facebook and actually at the recent CS

177
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,599
Aqueous announced that it will form a partnership with xiaomi to take his VR headset to try no

178
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,975
So how did you first meet you go and how did you convince him to join a Chinese company

179
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,631
That was so fast growing but little know outside of China so the first time I met Hugo

180
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Actually

181
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,215
Back in 2007

182
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Are you outside on Google

183
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
I was in charge of the pieces for the China Market

184

So you and I could join him and I was out of the way

187
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Recklessly

188
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,183
He was face at UK and I was Beijing Beijing with me

But I will travel around the world a lot and back amount of Aladdin you know every month or every other month

190
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,215
We met and talked about you know how we feel great products together for Google and

191
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,799
And I would really take the FedEx Mobile products Euro to the market

192
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
At the Google time and when we saw the xiaomi Hugo is one of the person who pay a lot of

193
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,159
Attention enough cause interest in to watch I miss doing cuz what we are doing actually building Android phone

194
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
Is closely related to what Google history

195
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
With Andy Rubin in the mobile access by Google

196
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
Tell him and I keep a very close connections and discussions and then conversations and beatings even outside Salvation Army

197
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
In

198
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
As we

199
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Launch the first song

200
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,687
I was a decent successful about the 2nd of August

201
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Msv started to look at

202
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Expanding beyond the China Market

203
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
You know he'll go

204
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
Is Sunny the person that comes to my mind that we could work quickly

205
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
Que Malaysian we talked a lot about

206
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
Yahoo be the best guy to have a starter International

207
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
And obviously

208
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
YouTube

209
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
Squinting of anybody better than Hugo Hogan DDS

210
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
I remember the first time I met Hugo

211
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
That was in 2006

212
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,311
He came to China with a mutual friend Robin check and that was the first time

213
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
They ever come to China

214
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
Google was extremely impressive

215
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
And impressed

216
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
By what was happening in China

217
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Announce before he joined Google in Android

218
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
And once you join Google Android

219
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,647
I think the rest is his Sports history

220
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
So how long was Hugo at Shelby in

221
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
How do you say keep in touch with him

222
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
Yes yes of course he's

00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,423
You don't show me in I was so late 2013

224
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,287
And he left and returned to us

225
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,871
In March April 2000

226
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
So he's been with us for over 3 years

227
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
I was just reading

228
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
And I have to stay at Javier's yet

229
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
Huge contributions to International

231
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Starting

232
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
The team-building out

233
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
The operations Inc

234
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Gorgeous

235
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
The biggest OSU

236
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791

238
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
CSI Vegas

239
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,055
And I'm in a hehehe all station launched the Oculus products

240
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
I miss that lunch events by few hours because of my

241
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Call Fat's anyway

242
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,735
Singapore right after that then

243
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
I was at USA

244
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Give me a number mean by we're crossing over

245
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
I think China definitely changed

246
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Hugo

247
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
To go is now very used to working 9 to 6 if not 7 days a week

248
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
Before you join xiaomi

249
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,679
I can tell he wasn't sure what he should join a china-based startup

250
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
Even though from the numbers he saw the Android

251
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
Xiaomi what's a definite growing fast if not a fascist

252
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
I'm on Android phone for a while

253
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,455
But I think China was such a unique situation

254
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
That it took him some time to think and decide that

255
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,623
Xiaomi was a perfect opportunity for him to tie China

256
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,463
Cuz he had all the friends and metal Amor people that's comfortable with

257
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Insight shop

258
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
And I think are not definitely made a indelible mark on him

259
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,423
So even though he's not back into somebody I think there's a quite a bit of China in him

260
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
Yeah and speak some really good Chinese

261
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591

00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127

In Arleta

264
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
Once you guys assemble a team

265
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
It's impressive how you make xiaomi war

266
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,303

Very quickly you guys change your time at 6

271
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543

Or even midnight to midnight seven days a week

274
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,575
I remember the first lunch party but she'll me one that I went to those back on August 16th 2011

275
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Don't forget our date

276
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
About two dozen people showed up

277
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,975
And after they drink went through the introduction of the phone

278
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,815
You finally got to the the highlight of the of the show

279
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
Kebab lunch party which was the price of the phone

280
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,447

In a market

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
As competitive as

294
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
China I was probably trace it back to the

295
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Time in v

296
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
How about starting a company

Physical creation

316
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:53,439
And the reason that were able to do this is just because of the way. Stopping Ambien

317
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
His mother is really around 7 thread customer where you, of course is the most efficient channel that

318
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Established

319
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
And everything are not only selling on so proud of you,

320
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
But I also

321
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Mlb.com

322
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
So it was something that the no other smartphone company

323
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
And this is really the Tipping Point

324
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
And also remember who was first found

325
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
That it's hard to sell online

326
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Back in 2011

327
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
That didn't work out very well

328
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
It happened right before shot

329
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,511
But it turns out that becomes a person wasn't as simple as to set up a website about a product

330
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583
Selling so there's a lot of attention shoes operation

331
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Really making the website

332
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959

00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Also remember within the first 34 hours

335
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
You got something like 450

336
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
1000 phones ordered

337
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Online

338
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
He was amazing

339
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
Besides a iPhone

340
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
I never anything anything like

341
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
It was exciting moment but you're also very stressful moment

342
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Turn around

343
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Lightsaber

344
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,239
People call you got what you got to do any more Teen Hunger marketing or see you again sell

345
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,079
That you purposely starve a customers and not giving the phone quickly now

346
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,431
Yeah that was the most stressful things that vampire

347
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
Cuz one of the aspect of my business model is two thing of smartphones has

348
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319

Who uses the van Econoline

351
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,023
And Frankly Speaking if we can sell a lot more than what we able to produce

352
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,119
You've asked any night companies like Google or Facebook today is it hey would you like to have

353
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
An extra 10 million users to use your service they would

354
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
Assess that young small startup

355
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,175
We just unable to read the cable on demand

356
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711

Faster

360
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
As investor in the previous board member in xiaomi

361
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
Back in 2011 I predicted that in your first year

362
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,911
You guys can probably sell 200,000 films

363
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471
And even do that I would have been extremely impressed

364
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
Amber by the end of 2011

365
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
You got soul something like over a million phones for the first generation the you are we launching August 16th

366
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
Hands that you said 2011

367
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
And

368
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,575
For the whole cycle of Maven be sewed

369
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
7.1 and 7.2

370
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
2012 is great

371
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
2013 was even better

372
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
2014 was absolutely amazing

373
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,375
Instincts are the plateau in 2015 and 2016 was a tough year

374
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,471
But somehow as a team you guys manage come back in 2017

375
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,543
And I was also impressed sitting in the phone industry

376
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
What is your monkey was opened up here we are for sure

377
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:57,759
I think he's actually a really good. For us to read to it eventually

378
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,647
I think in 2015 and 16 we are running into a couple of challenges

379
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
One Challenge

380
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,047
Which I mentioned the previously about the business model of xiaomi

381
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
And apparently e-commerce growth

382
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:16,959
After the first few years in audit 2010-11 tarvish

383
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,823
Reedy high double-digit growth e-commerce growth in China

384
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
CNN is not a sauce but the whole entire commas

385
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
You, is the holy Spectrum

386
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
China

387
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Especially in smartphone

388
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
Yes we are seeing

389
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
Some amazing

390
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
Hi GG

391
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,791
Digit you in trouble did you grow and it's slowing down to becoming a myth

392
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
Double digit and then

393
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Load up

394
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
So you got musk rose has already passed out

395
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
So that's that's one of the one of the big change we seeing

396
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,847
The second change was Seattle's we're seeing is

397
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,151
Often people bought the first generation folks

398
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Smartphone

399
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
Mom and a son already

400
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
Aware the spec

401
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,575
Performance and enjoy the reading comprising the

402
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
That's due to

403
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,255
Part of it due to the xiaomi to pay more attention on the phone

404
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
The look and feel you know what material

405
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,447
How beautiful the Foley house in the fullness X-ray camera

406
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Camera pictures

407
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Videos

408
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Idaho Spectrum experience

409
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,335
People to asking much more than this

410
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
Oh you know hi spec

411
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
You know they can't lullaby

412
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
Yeah that the whole special mix

413
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Everything I mentioned passport

414
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,879
So we are learning the changes of the Consumer Electronics

415
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,695
You know where where we haven't haven't seen

416
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
And then it's at. Where we started the other sounds like

417
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
For xiaomi to Reedy

418
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,887
Keep innovating and out Univision competitors work

419
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
We need to do

420
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
It'll be okay Integrity structures

421
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
How many people we have

422
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
How many resources we should be investing

423
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,639
Including out this great components and Technologies

424
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
That has edges over

425
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
So these are the these are. Where

426
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,879
Although it's still realize he misses up and you're one of my messages

427
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,999
Play eternity I think it's actually a cold in two years.

428
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
How we can become stronger

429
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
Housing copies the change of a business models Avenue, Sylvania, slowing down not what we should be doing to recover

430
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
And then

431
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
What we should be doing the capture the next one

432
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
You're next

433
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Big Rock

434
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
So those are the two year period

435
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
Get us to think deeply into

436
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Making xiaomi stronger

437
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
Unplugging ovation

438
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
I'm resource investing in 90s

439
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
And I'm catching the next big

440
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
So that was something that we

441
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,375
So show me has an ecosystem approach

442
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,519
When you go into a xiaomi store you not only can buy phones and computers but also

443
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,103
Air purifiers ricecookers headphones umbrellas

444
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,919
How does could you explain how the Seacoast

445
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,271
System works and how do you ensure a quality control of these products

446
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,879
They shall me invest in because they obviously have an impact on your brand

447
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
So

448
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
This is something that came up

449
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,536
About two or three years after we launched the first phone

450
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:26,912
And the discussions internet between the founder of Scientology myself and cabal the founders was

451
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,520
If you look at the success of our model on smartphone

452
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,080
You can generalize it and say okay

453
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
What we're doing is not asphalt but

454
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
We can

455
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,224
Take consumer electronics we get to coyotes

456
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
You know s Topeka opportunity

457
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,160
They can we apply what we have done you know it's my fault

458
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
Including settings are the customers really commas

459
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
And how can we take these and generalized

460
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Adam Pugh

461
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Bigger business

462
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
That cuz you might really

463
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
So this is what the ecosystem here comes out

464
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:07,616
And of course you know there's a way that discovered a discussion in trying to say whether we should be doing beauty products on sale

465
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,664
Or whether we should be leveraging

466
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
Bestar phenomenon

467
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
China

468
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:17,088
And read it to me in a way where we can use the investment at 11

469
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,952
And Legend being a really really great and reinvested himself and also instrumental for 9mm self

470
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,536
He told me you got a chest and he himself has Led Zeppelin

471
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,864
To do that used to leverage that you masked man

472
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
Sa-2

473
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,424
Tokyo this ecosystem

474
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
And this becomes relief active

475
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
The way we do it

476
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,848
Is we have a team of Rita talented product managers

477
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,432
Each are responsible for some keravada products

478
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,528
And the Parliament is just Wilbur crocifissa ecosystem company

479
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
To build

480
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,088
And design the Box

481
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
Starting mr. This feature design

482
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,256
And I will come together to say okay what features we would like to have

483
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
What will be the look and feel

484
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
I thought we would like to have in the car

485
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
We like them to have

486
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,472
I sent you her the same design philosophies

487
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
Yesterday you look back and look at all the

488
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
What if we have fires in an air purifier is a scooters

489
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
I will rice cookers they all look the same

490
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,320
Driven you know by audio engineering

491
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,392
You know they would do that manufacture Supply Chain management

492
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
And then we have them to launch their products to the market

493
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,256
We do the tech what we do the CO2 Market

494
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
Marketing sales

495
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,168
We put them in a store in the way where we designer store S1 store

496
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,264
Because the Milwaukee and they will be able to see in a phone's being the center and then

497
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
L'Occitane products

498
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
You are on the phone

499
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,152
It's being put together right right next to each other

500
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
The farm

501
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
You know

502
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
What team is OAR

503
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
You know how I feel

504
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
So those are those are that the general idea

505
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,208
And you become so reflective because you not only motivate

506
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,608
The eagle system companies to redo great products because they are and we met that that that intrapreneurs write their own picture

507
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
We had a small shower

508
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,032
But you don't show me green and motivate a team because we had we don't have over a hundred teams in repeating these different products

509
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
Any gifts

510
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,432
A really really good spectrum of products

511
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
On our website

512
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
That's how you know the customers

513
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Any loss.

514
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
You know what happened was going to walk in and look at all the products

515
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
I will keep

516
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,744
What's amazing to me is that when you guys first start trying to

517
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Gilmore products Beyond phones

518
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
Whereas he took

519
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Samsung and Sony

520
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
To do everything in-house

521
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
You guys develop ecosystem

522
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,776
An ecosystem had a network of very hungry Chinese entrepreneurs

523
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
Who are with very willing to learn from xiaomi

524
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
You did everything that I can

525
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
The focus on their core products what carrier Neshaminy brand

526
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,784
11 to the xiaomi ecosystem of suppliers

527
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
To help him descale

528
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
As a result

529
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,184
You have so many new offerings for users everyday every week

530
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,256
Every month from your ecosystem of portfolio companies

531
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,328
Both online and offline retail store

532
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,168
So that leaves days when we sent out of the xiaomi store at Seaport walk in

533
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
Big frequency of store visits

534
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
It just a lot higher

535
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
The ne

536
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Store for other phone companies

537
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
In the world

538
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
And is also one of the

539
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Learnings we had in the last couple

540
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Challenges

541
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
And let me see the father of

542
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Bahamas

543
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
And it was okay well

544
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
How to optimize a business model

545
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,952
Fed up doing everything

546
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
You know we realize

547
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,328
The most powerful pieces mother of show me wasn't only to see,

548
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
It was Sarah and I was a kid

549
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:46,496
Set the right means because I was sunny, is much more efficient so I can schedule the customers

550
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
But

551
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
Let me have a store

552
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:55,712
It's if it's a hydrogen ion store that doesn't attract and plus the store what allows customers to her

553
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
Atarax

554
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
Looking like direct interaction with the product

555
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:05,952
You know any given day out there taking the penis and watch a movie

556
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,304
Hey you look show me how they can try it and they can decide whether to

557
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:15,424
But as long as distorted as an operator bios

558
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
Xiaomi designs

559
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Everything is

560
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,568
Xiaomi where we can offer the products

561
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,896
At the same price as those being offered online

562
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
Take us to the most

563
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:31,040
When did they have an experience of the product store

564
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,624
So it's a shelter up becomes optimize speed

565
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
Online off

566
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:43,328
Do you ever see guys carry any products does not Brennan show me inside of stores or on your websites Wheatley do

567
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,888
Reduce some of the

568
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
But the products are

569
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
Where can fleas live

570
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
End

571
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:55,360
All the products today that are selling in the mist or are being built by that you can still come in

572
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Yeah most of them are carrying the Migra

573
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
Some of it

574
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,504
Doesn't carry to be home brand but you has the same Quality Bar

575
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
Hysterectomy Home Products

576
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,368
Xiaomi products and also they are all be with

577
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,392
Burrito Company

578
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,696
That believes in the same pieces

579
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:15,072
During a past speech Legend was compare xiaomi to Muji

580
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,680
Which is very interesting to me because Muji is kind of like the exemplification of

581
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
New retail where there is

582
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,032
High quality beautiful design

583
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
Relatively affordable

584
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Cost

585
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
And everytime I go inside

586
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,456
Emoji store end up buying something even though I

587
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,040
Don't have I don't need anything and I think it's the same with xiaomi

588
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,392
When I go to China always go to a salvage yard and I always end up buying something

589
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
So

590
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
How how fast are those xiaomi Jazz expanding in China how many stores are there how many cities

591
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Are you guys in

592
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
So

593
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,680
Today we had 287 stores

594
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,496
It took us two years to get together this number

595
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,592
I was fully in charge of telemarketing from 2014 to

596
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616

597
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,432
I want to change my door again back to the ID field

598
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:06,784
And one of the major task when I was three sets of marketing was to be all this week

599
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
Cuz we're seeing more clear

600
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880

A lot of customers

00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
They know everything smart

615
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
But they didn't know we have so many

616
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Cuz you made it honey products

617
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,584
So very common expression

636
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,160
Spend time in browser on the products and eventually there's a okay

637
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928

00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,696
DaVinci gossip Hildebran that'll be the national bird for Chinese consumers with many products

663
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744

Yep so that's also the opportunity right and if I

667
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
The last two-and-a-half years

668
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
We started by Indian business back in 2000

669
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
What's the first time in Hugo and I went out to eat

670
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664

00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
And then we built at 2 tomorrow morning

673
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
And now

Azshara missionaria number one smartphone

675
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
And as we are spending on

676
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,048
Business in India mostly really,

677
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,120
We also at about the same time

678
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Maybe a slightly

679
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
After we started that

680
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
The Whitney retard

681
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Operation in China

682
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Reset at the beauty of a retard

683
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
And it wasn't

684
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,992
We know how to buy a hundred stores but the Indus already smarter

685
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,552
Guess it doesn't have the number of products that we have

686
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,928
But the retail presence in Europe

687
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Midas stores are selling anywhere between

688
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
Ford 4000

689
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
Even pretty shoes number for

690
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
A store that's about

691
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Six seven

692
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,544
And so the business is growing is growing in a way that way

693
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568

696
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
And we believe

697
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
The growth

698
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
I will continue

699
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
Probably not success again

700
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,856
But I think this year we should be able to

701
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Achieve another

702
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,232
If you're looking to launch more ecosystem products

703
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
India

704
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
What are the planets away accidentally

705
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
Is I know whether we should be launching at

706
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376

707
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656

00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
And also southeast Asia countries

730
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,152
As far as Eastern Europe we are number three in Russia

731
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Now we are

732
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,504
And also I Ukraine I think we are also in between your

733
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
So all these

734
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
Eastern countries and developing countries are

735
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,368
Just a few years behind China

736
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
So this is the market that

737
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,024
Enjoying Pascal's we we have already have our hands for it

738
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,816
40 world countries

739
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
Just about

740
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,656
Two two weeks ago we open the first door in Spain

741
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:20,032
Is a store that is open by us and our Distributors and so far the stores doing great

742
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,360
It was a it was really a small trial

743
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
NNU seems to be

744
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,760
It seems to us that customers are really anticipating the Sham Apartments

745
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,064
Developed countries

746
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,904
So it's a good result so far all the way short

747
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,000
Beat up to it to give it a little more time to see how customers are reacting to our custom

748
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
My phone says when somebody gets them

749
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,144
But if this continues to go well I think developed country is Within Reach

750
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:52,288
I was suddenly faced a starting with the Western Europe countries

751
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
That that we were looking at

752
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,896
And follow probably by

753
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
North America

754
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
18 maybe sometime

755
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,600
I think one of the reasons xiaomi has become so so

756
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,184
Successful is because it has a very unique approach to marketing

757
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,792
Could you share with us what is a me fan or Misa in Chinese

758

We have these events where we call a popcorn Yuan

791
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504

Now

801
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,336
At the last two years as we're spilling out retail stores

802
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
This a slightly change

803
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,944
Skills for every single retail stores that will open a new city

804
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
The movie fences that City would come join us

805

806
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136

807
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
I've been to many minutes

808
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,512
An actual person to pick many of the location of the stores by self

809

Search events

813
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
I'll meet friends to come along

814
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:35,616
You know they will see this as an opportunity to get to know us more personally SOS getting to know Adam Eva

815
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,200
So he becomes a sort of a platform for me

816
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,296
Get us each other and get to know each other and also get to know a lot more about tell me about

817
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,344
And we also started to see

818
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
Similar things happening in India

819
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
Asia

820
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
And also in Spanish

821
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,024
And one of the reason we pixpaint open the first door

822
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Country was because

823
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Be found at in Spain behalf

824
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
A lot more

825
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,520
So I'm spending a business in different countries

826
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
This is going to be stupid

827
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
What marketing

828
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360

00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
May not understand

832
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
Most of the things you just said

833
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,624
So is easy for him to say that xiaomi is a copycat of Apple

834
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
When you hear this

835
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
How do you deal with it

836
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,000
How do you try to get them to see that it is different

837
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,888
Okay so I'm from several aspects first of all I think that's it comes to a question with Pope

838
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
I would mostly be

839
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448

Delphi / 6000

848
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Over half of these are

849
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
Despicable

850
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280

851
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,584

June 25th

860
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
We launched chamonix

861

Jesus

865
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
This is exactly what they were

866
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Expecting

867
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
You know my name

868
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
Xiaomi who came up with this phone

869
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
That has no face

870
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Top

871
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,664
And Anacortes Mix phone was pretty revolutionary

872
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,712
We won't be sake suppliers

873
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736

Pretty prestigious Hawaii

877
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
So

878
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,352
All these are something that being

879
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Built-in table

880
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:10,240

00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
Air purifier

886
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712

887
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760

Designers

892
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Ecosystem

893
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
All together

894
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,816
So I would say we are probably to The Other Extreme of

895
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
The Embrace openness

896
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424

A protocol

901
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Where are we

902
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
Encourage all the iot companies to build in

903
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
And understand Us shopping open

904
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
So any other

00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
Companies for brooding

906
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,040
Gadgets or

907
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,344
Appliances are more than welcome to

908
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Turd

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
Modules and imbue into their products

910
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,744
Any becomes all connected device

00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
So

914
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
I myself as anything that

915
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Is that all

916
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,448
Being like apple I think that's a stop

917
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,312
Right unn this will probably take some adjustment and also for people who don't know us

918
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
If they are able to come back and look at a store

919
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,784
So you guys launched the remix to it's a day before Apple launch iPhone 10

920
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
How do you think it went

921
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,624
And what was the rationale for doing that

922
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,208
I mean you could do it again would you have done anything differently

923
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,352
I think the date is probably just coincidence because we use it has to set the alarm stay

924
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
Fuel Metallica

925
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Just a lock

926
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
How to make stories

927
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
Is it again

928
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
Another EDM

929
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
We tok mix 1

930
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
Which is really in the way

931
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
Henry SF we can do to make

932
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,319
The mix more practical to Reedy

933
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,207
Allow people to buy is what makes one

934
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
Is

935
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,047
Because it's so hot

936
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
And

937
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
Hopefully the whole cycle

938
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
We just couldn't keep up

939
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
And they becomes a shoes complaint for

940
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,751
I'm in the absence of Light how can we make

941
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Mix 2

942
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
Better than this one in yet

943
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,591
No alarm

944
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
So so he's been lot of

945
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
Time in engineering

946
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Field

947
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
I'm and it's also pretty well received device

948
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
And we also improve a couple

949
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
User experience

950
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Including

951
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
Price of one of the complaints that people have

952
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
What is a mix 1

953
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,303
The back camera it doesn't take video

954
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
It takes good

955
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,863
Good images

956
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
So I mix to reading room

957
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Camera XP

958
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
And you compare the Imaging

959
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
You have an excuse

960
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,639
That any other phone company World iPhone

961
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
Apple included

962
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
Because your ecosystem products

963
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
It's just so comprehensive

964
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,807
Some people would say xiaomi is already number one

965
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
Internet of things or iot company in the world

966
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
What is the iot strategy

967
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
And are you working on your Alexa

968
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,583
What would I look like okay so we just launched while a few months back

969
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,167
We just wants our first smart speaker

970
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,727
It's called Cheyenne jobs

971
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,823
And that speaker is able to

972
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Drive

973
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
You know we are Chinese

974
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
DIYs

975
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Almost all out

976
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
You can ask the council turn on and off

977
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,807
TVs

978
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
You can ask

979
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,231
So I can clean it to suction your lips

980
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
So it's a very natural fit

981
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
Biote

982
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,655
What are we going to be like Alexa systems

983
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,447
We have discussed that in

984
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
I actually got

985
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Assistant

986
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
Enchiladas

987
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,407
And now with over 80 million Connecticut

988
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
Show me Island

989
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
Remix

990
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,367
We also commissioning not only the smart speakers but

991
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,695
How can how can we more effectively control all this

992
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
Well-managed

993
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
And be stupid

994
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
There's a scenario where you were

995
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
My speakers at home

996
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,399
Places when you are way

997
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
How do you really control

998
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,311
So are these are something that we have been

999
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Working on

1000
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,919
And one of the angle and looking eye with your promises

1001
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,223
As I having all these connected devices

1002
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Either with you

1003
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Or at home

1004
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
I like what

1005
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,135
It'll provide a very unique opportunity for us to do a lot of

1006
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Data mining

1007
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,719
Based on the data that is already promised.

1008
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,791
And of course we put privacy I have everything

1009
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,095
But with you sad content

1010
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,911
We like we are but a towel in on a bigger scale

1011
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,959
You know how air quality looks like

1012
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
In all

1013
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,311
Major big and small cities

1014
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,639
You know how I would have pollution landscape look like

1015
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
In spaghetti squash

1016
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
Amino

1017
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
What city

1018
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,807
What was the population are more inclined to exercise

1019
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
Well with the amoeba information and also does Moscow information you will be the CEO you know it looks like this

1020
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
You know China people I'm waiting time to exercise and run then another problem

1021
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
Does desiderata

1022
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,679
A data mining opportunities

1023
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,727
And this is why the AI

1024
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
Artificial intelligence

1025
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Algorithms

1026
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,127
And I believe this is actually where the future

1027
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,295
Show me recently launched a partnership with Baidu in Ai and iot

1028
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:49,695
Why did you choose to partner with Baidu could you explain more about the thinking behind the partnership

1029
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:55,327
I wasn't person in charge of this partnership but I think in general we are partnering with many companies on

1030
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,215
And by Dosa and he's one of the companies that have it you may as well have it in

1031
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
Annie's a very natural part Partnerships

1032
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,383
And I think in the future AI was Sunday coming play

1033
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:14,015
Setting the smartphone has anybody that's my phone it would be the

1034
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,551
Biggest python for AI

1035
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
Imagine your phone can lolitas

1036
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
A communication device

1037
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
What is device by

1038
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
You can listen

1039
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
And you can watch

1040
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
You know thinking great images and photo

1041
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
And it

1042
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,607
Is a device that always with you

1043
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,703
So this is a problem that we believe will be one of the few sharpshooter

1044
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,311
And of course you know where your home Oklahoma OT devices

1045
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
I wish the gadgets

1046
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
People ready

1047
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
Can people catch a lot about

1048
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
You know

1049
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
Exercising

1050
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Vivid

1051
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
Healthy Lifestyles

1052
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,111
All these opportunities way I can come

1053
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,719
How many people in the US have the impression that

1054
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,303
Shelby's main differentiation point is affordability

1055
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Do you think that's still the case

1056
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,447
Today probably but as we are we are coming closer to

1057
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
Launching a product in USA I think it would

1058
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,543
Change a lot of customers

1059
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Perceptions

1060
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,127
Some of some of my friends in us when they

1061
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
Why they got a Hands-On some well products

1062
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
You know Dad

1063
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,087
They did love it so much and it's not

1064
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:27,487
Cuz we are not sending any of these in US

1065
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,815
Products you know it.

1066
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,399
I still remember one time I I brought Mascoutah

1067
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,703
Mi scooter

1068
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,823
Yes over to Boston

1069
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
Students in the classroom

1070
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
And if they love it

1071
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,991
Is a scooter on Android

1072
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,807
But you can actually control it with a remote control

1073
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,879
You didn't even have his follow you you know whenever you go

1074
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,975
I'm anemic smile turns left and right

1075
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,791
Following your about 2 feet away from you right

1076
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
You can even have it

1077
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
You know I carry Goods

1078
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
Around

1079
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Where will you go

1080
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,727
Is really a cool piece of and of course when they hit when they

1081
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,311
At the very last I told him like using only cost $400

1082
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,711
They like crazy

1083
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,295
But he was really that you know dieta products out that way.

1084
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,903
So then how would you describe Sammy's company culture

1085
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,975
And what are some unique management practices that you

1086
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,791
Have seen or started a xiaomi that's different

1087
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,583
From Western companies you've been with

1088
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:41,215
I'm in are there any practices you brought yourself me from either Google or Microsoft

1089
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
Nnn over a lot of a lot of my city

1090
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,063
Not that Michael's having Google engine it didn't work out of date they washable

1091
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
Yunnan

1092
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,607
I founded this company together with leaking out of co-founders

1093
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
And

1094
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,191
Chinese Peking I think the last 70 years

1095
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,263
I was able to find a way to fit my life in the

1096
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Yeah I don't know how

1097
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
3D

1098
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
Makes any sense

1099
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,759
Kid there's no one like that and tomato paste to fit your life

1100
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:31,903
Yes and tells her that a lot of US dollars in China

1101
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
I will achieve

1102
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
Some cut some of us a test

1103
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,303
And and also and smartphone last

1104
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,119
Most of you probably know it's really competitive

1105
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
I'm in one product

1106
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
So you really have to really push

1107
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,055
The Innovation and not just yourself but also

1108
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
DanTDM

1109
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,639
Operational

1110
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
Person

1111
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
Not even being in a store

1112
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,527
Just thinking how can we build a store

1113
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
Different from and better than any other

1114
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
And that's how

1115
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,207
I'm pretty sure. All the founders anime

1116
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Happy monkey

1117
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,583
Nothing at that actually very similar to mini of the city

1118
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:16,959
Cuz I I Know Tab know a lot of them you know what Google used to be Sodom and still a second company

1119
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
And I think innovation

1120
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,823
It is in the blood

1121
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
This is what

1122
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Champion

1123
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Companies house

1124
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,223
I remember the first time I took huc

1125
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,783
To meet you guys back in the summer of 2010

1126
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
They walked away thinking that you guys are us

1127
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Talented

1128
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
And knowledgeable

1129
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
Aswad innovative

1130
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,487
Has any Silicon Valley company we have ever met

1131
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,095
And may not have a lot of HTC engineers

1132
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,143
Barbara Palvin

1133
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
So on a more fun note

1134
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,031
You are a success story of an engineer turned manager and founder

1135
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:57,407
You change a row a few times but it's not always easy for engineers to

1136
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,455
Make it managers are founders

1137
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:03,551
What advice do you have for a Chinese engineers in the US or China

1138
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,599
Who may want to start their own company

1139
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:10,719
What kind of things do they need to watch out for

1140
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
I'll be happy to share some money

1141
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Myself

1142
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,631
I think one of the big running is

1143
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
It's not a choice

1144
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,727
To say oh I would rather do

1145
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
IND

1146
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Products

1147
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
And I don't I just don't want to do

1148
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
Cuz you have no choice

1149
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
Company

1150
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,759
You just have to do whatever his name

1151
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
Commissioner

1152
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:41,183
You know you've asked me if I have been doing engineering

1153
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,207
I myself and

1154
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Joint pain

1155
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,047
Centrelink references

1156
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Is what I have been

1157
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
But when it comes to

1158
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,495
Xiaomi this is the company that I have found it

1159
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,263
When

1160
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,079
Assassin operational marketing is

1161
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
The job.

1162
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,895
You have to take over

1163
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,919
Uses of pickle

1164
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
And then you just have to find a way to

1165
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Make yourself

1166
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,391
Enjoy it and personally I am not

1167
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Like

1168
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,463
I don't like

1169
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,791
Spending time in shopping mall

1170
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,351
Before Ayatollah marketing job in

1171
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
I will be with my family and I will be sitting

1172
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,495
How much are waiting for

1173
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
The family of sha'ban

1174
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,151
And have no interest at all in in retail

1175
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
But I'm

1176
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
Havana realize

1177
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,015
Xiaomi we have to be at the retail presence

1178
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
You know I force myself to

1179
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
To stop

1180
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
Learning return

1181
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
And that

1182
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,695
Actually travel over to the Tokyo Tower

1183
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,559
Hong Kong too many places and you and you are sometimes when we enter the soil stop looking at

1184
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,375
Oh why do they design the

1185
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,143
The bazaar

1186
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,447
Why do they use these types

1187
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,983
What the lion looks like

1188
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,031
What's a material that they use to build a table

1189
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,847
You know how did they design the store so that people walk in

1190
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
Maximize the outcome

1191
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,943
And then it was interesting right the first

1192
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
At the first few months it was

1193
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,015
You know I have no idea how to build

1194
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:15,647
But as I stop eating out the first or the second store and then I see the

1195
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
The turnout the store

1196
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
Improving

1197
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
The stove

1198
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,303
Team is actually become sexually funk

1199
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,119
And anything for any people who

1200
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,655
Who wants to do a startup

1201
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
This is something that you just have to

1202
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,287
Whatever it takes

1203
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:39,967
I don't think it's it's any of ice but it is a learning that I have

1204
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,575
So if you've something to remember I even the earlier days when

1205
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
When we don't have any

1206
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,159
And have You Met My remember that

1207
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,695
You don't have any CFOs

1208
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
I do about few years back

1209
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Penny delivery

1210
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,583
Holidays in the first year we don't have any friends

1211
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,935
Religion and I said hey we need to talk to

1212
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
SMU masters of

1213
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,103
Apology message xiamen and one of them

1214
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,687
Go put together

1215
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
Pieces forecast

1216
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:17,855
I've no idea and how to do a piece of work at it

1217
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,391
Look up some books

1218
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,463
So I didn't talk to my wife

1219
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,559
A test that my wife actually had a small business

1220
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,863
She had a small business back in the US

1221
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,167
So she has some experience putting together

1222
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:37,567
You know something you know the finance forecast so she give me the sex especially

1223
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,359
Spectiv

1224
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:44,479
What's your present course or Saturday with your rent yours is not right and that's it so I took that

1225
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
And then I feel the very first

1226
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,855
A company forecast vs forecast

1227
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,135
On that success

1228
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,727
There are a lot of great Chinese engineers in the US

1229
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,543
Increasingly even the PM's are doing well

1230
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
In Silicon Valley

1231
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,895
Many Chinese internet companies have set of R&D centers in the US

1232
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:17,759
Ben do you see show me doing that or do you have more in the u.s. in the future

1233
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
Exorcist

1234
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:23,903
Yes we have our first office in San Diego told you what's going on with us

1235
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,695
Be not I think enough

1236
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,071
I'm at and I think we should ask as we spending more business hours

1237
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
China

1238
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,375
Expression you getting close to enter

1239
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
American

1240
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,495
Does Ashley's having pool and symptomatic

1241
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
1970 typing

1242
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,175
So for the last part of this podcast will have a bunch of Rapid Fire questions

1243
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,455
The first one is

1244
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,783
What was the best and worst decision that you have ever made

1245
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,487
Decisions I might have made some bad decisions but I don't know how to wait

1246
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:05,887
Wait at the bust

1247
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:12,543
What were the best decisions I would certainly say that this decision.

1248
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,895
Kicking back

1249
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
It's probably

1250
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
Pathogen

1251
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
My life

1252
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,807
What motivates you to wake up each morning and what keeps you up at night

1253
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,855
What are you excited and worried about

1254
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,207
I think the part that keeps me really motivating everyday

1255
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
I done got a half

1256
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
Lenny the latest Technologies

1257
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,399
But it's the learning

1258
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
Comes with

1259
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
My

1260
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
Operational jobs in sales

1261
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,079

00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,039
You know suppliers

I am also learning from

1268
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,511
And how did I know you know

1269
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:08,607
I'm pretty sure you know it's the business of Jamaica growing

1270
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:17,055
What I worry I think that's all I think that at that award on a daily basis

1271
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,687
Today I asked my role changes again at 2 months

1272
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
IPhones

1273
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
Laughing a lot of

1274
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,391
Wedding version

1275
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,439
How can we fit in

And what customers would like

1277
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Next Generation

1278
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,119
To all these

1279
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Questions.

1280
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
And thinking

1281
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Even

1282
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,591
I am I even dream of something

1283
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,639
