Joker be like so fragile listings and scabs

61
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584

Western audio

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Why are these

67
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
So so many fraudulent

68
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616

69
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
And accounts

70
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
What's the purpose

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
So I'm

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
As for example like sort of a we everything going online when we have this fear of going to the

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
Kind of Internet a mobile app like so the Eero

74
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096
And the opportunity of directly touching a large number of users from app

75
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Perspective

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Is significant the in-house

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
Expanded and that's Channel some also at the same time be quickly noticed by the

78
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
Attack person being Channel

79
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
That to facilitate all these

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,968
Kind of illicit activities we saw

81
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
And those incredible example which we talked about

82
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
Milestone spammy content and fake listings

83
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
+ 4

84
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,280
In this case he's a professional attackers not just for one off

85
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
Thanks Lisa actually coordinated organized crime rings that have strong financial incentives

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
And other

87
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,847
So they're plenty of action waste a cashier monetized

88
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Craigslist

89
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Voice example

90
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,967
I'm the cash set up song fake listing to

91
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
Attract normal user so that they can chase

92
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
I make money scams it says

93
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Afterwards

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,207
Or more often they also set up a business for example they can trick some

95
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,559
Small businesses I can promote your business and you pay me this much and I can

96
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
Help you find a lot of

97
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
Offense I can help you write reviews and

98
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
And then they can also do a lot of other things

99
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Example Day Camp

100
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,823
I tried to hijacking some existing peoples

101
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Accounts

102
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
Can put up the fake listing there and answer that

103
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Lmpeople

104
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,319
Click those things they castrate download malware so they can monetize further to other

105
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Channels

106
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,695
So a lot of CR customers are consumer internet

107
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Like Alibaba

108
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Dimming the ones I mentioned

109
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Do you see more of those attacks

110
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,935
In China or in the US and how are your client's knees difference

111
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
Different in these two mark

112
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:34,079
So these attacks we see a comment

113
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
Kind of the issue actually crossbows China

114
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
I swear

115
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Datavisor

116
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Common challenges

117
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
And we talked about that what we talked

118
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Talk about these fake

119
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
What is one example

120
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Protect

121
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
It is a broader category of

122
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Attack

123
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
For example you need cream for

124
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
Atlanta

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Conduction

126
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Which is

127
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Maybe more, Sam Elliott

128
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
The credit car likes

129
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
The twin the day that got leaked

130
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
And someone else obtain this information that's hackers

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
Then they just use this

132
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Credit card

133
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
To issue a payment transaction

134
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
I know without owner

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Actually

136
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Convert injection

137
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Which result

138
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
The

139
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Typically what we call the chargeback

140
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Attacks it to emergency

141
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Depends

142
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
And also other type of

143
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
Ataxic as fraudulent in stores

144
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,519
Fraudulent marketing words

145
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
Anno domini apps

146
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Natural looking

147
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
To expand their user base

148
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Fifo example

149
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Crying like users

150
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
Different Channel such as what

151
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
Facebook a Google intern many other channels

152
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
Where they could apply uses as well

153
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
And in such kind of different kind of channels

154
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
Sometimes they're also add Network dress up channels in subnetwork

155
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
And there could be

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Places

157
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Weather for Campo

158
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Lighting stores

159
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
Purchase actually fraudulent meaning

160
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
They never existed

161
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
These are not real user in stores

162
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
And the Beast another example

163
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
Off the fraudulent activity that we see very common

164
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,087
The other type of use cases we also talked about

165
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,927
Doctor is more like we do FMLA today of identity theft

166
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
I want sensitive information

167
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Credit card information

168
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
And I

169
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Social Security

170
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,983
Social Security numbers or credit card information address information

171
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
Thomas identity can potentially be abused

172
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,943
By someone else that we don't know about the use this information

173
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
Apply for new credit card

174
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
And also for example to

175
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Open new bank account

176
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Without actually

177
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
The

178
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,255
The real user actually knowing about the existence

179
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
And that when they have these like a new credit card new accounts

180
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Then they cut

181
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Further performance examples

182
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,543
Are transactions other type of illicit activity we talked about

183
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
And now I'm so

184
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
These are different forms

185
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Off the attacks that we

186
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,967
Saw that actually post

187
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,783
Like a China I could consumer-facing

188
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
Applications online service as well as those in the US

189
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
Face comment

190
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
And that obviously is for titan smite

191
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
Different cycling to Regions

192
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
But

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
It is a common challenge

194
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
This is

195
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Something that happened

196
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
When oldies online services

197
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Actually

198
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,311
Quickly increasing in a we all act

199
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Removing

200
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
If I'm offline in Europe

201
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
To the online

202
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
And it just makes

203
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Bees attack

204
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Idiot

205
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
And these are the problems that they'd of Isaiah is

206
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Address

207
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,647
How did you two first meet each other

208
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
Yeah we met each other at the Microsoft

209
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Research when we first

210
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,559
Join Microsoft we agree to have to join the same Mouse

211
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Microsoft

212
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
Watch Silicon Valley love

213
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,447
And then we seem collaborative

214
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,007
Think with each other ever since year was that

215
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
It was

216
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
2006

217
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
Okay so it's been 12 years

218
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Microsoft for almost

219
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
10 years

220
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,879
Did you guys work on projects together while you were there

221
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Yes

222
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:37,279
We closely Clarity with each other as you since the very beginning

223
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,887
Many of the projects in the security like a broad security area

224
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
So was it a difficult decision to leave Microsoft

225
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
When did you know it was the right time to make

226
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,383
I can talk about it so it's actually

227
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
So I want to say

228
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
From that time I saw the one we to like says make a decision that Wheatley to a kind of

229
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
I know in the Silicon Valley law people thinking of startup

230
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
A lot of the times

231
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
Oh God you actually didn't occur to us

232
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
For very long time but

233
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
When the idea occurred to us

234
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
It actually is relatively

235
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
Quick and easy for us to decide that Samsung

236
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
Yes we are very interesting doing that is something exciting and we wanted to go out go about

237
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,783
So I would say it's a, decision Prospect

238
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
David wasn't really hard

239
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
So I remember Harry Shum from Microsoft was the one who

240
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Connected us

241
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
You got a ride already left

242
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Microsoft

243
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Stop doing this

244
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
How do you guys know Harry and

245
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
How did you get him

246
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
I believe in you

247
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,495
Yeah yeah so hurry actually he's

248
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
I came from CMU in both my

249
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
Husband and I

250
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,711
And how is legendary one right and that is the kind of alarm 9

251
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
Very senior alumni role model

252
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,415
Coming from CMU what you socially the

253
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
De facto CTO iMac

254
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Microsoft Word

255
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863
He I think he's hungry are the CTO of AI

256
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,727
He has the role model

257
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Before I saw likes

258
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
CMU graduate

259
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,919
Angus area of AI machine learning excetera

260
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
And

261
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,551
So hurry and ask God to know each other like so that actually

262
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
4

263
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Microsoft time when

264
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
My husband I actually graduated

265
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
Lhasa from CMU

266
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
He was trying to actually recruit us

267
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,095
2 after Microsoft the Asia

268
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
That was kind of the route of the daughters of the early days.

269
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,823
That's right

270
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
So

271
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,455
So from that perspective like so from that time

272
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,831
He's being like a a mentor to us and roll mod on plus like a mentor

273
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
To ask

274
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
So I'm

275
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,231
When we two actually kind of a laptop Microsoft

276
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Actually we we actually

277
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
When should I saw Tahari

278
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Talk about this

279
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
No idea what we wanted

280
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,007
Do and he gave us a lot of encouragement and how bad that I actually

281
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,591
Brainstorming this and talk about this

282
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,431
We've been kept in touch from time to time overtime and

283
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Got a lot of advice from him

284
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
How did you guess

285
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Besides that this

286
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Problem

287
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
Yes we have the actual working this area for a long time ever

288
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Testing soil pH

289
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
PST time

290
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
I was working on network

291
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Intrusion detection

292
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
And the email West

293
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Honda

294
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
The forensic analysis so we're always in that I can.

295
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Security Outfield

296
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,871
Andy Microsoft where I live it higher because we don't do network-level and stuff a lot in my

297
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,735
Microsoft Microsoft we work with so many product groups all the way up

298
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Research we work with

299
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Christine we will quit

300
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Hotmail

301
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,927
Forefront and the air like a sky face extra so we work with many internal team

302
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
A Microsoft we develop a lot

303
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
System to help design tunnel

304
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
Fights virus type of attack dogs

305
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
And in the techniques with the dead that was

306
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
More like very focused

307
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
So when you have one problem

308
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:38,687
I have at one specific solution for a problem we have another brand new solution for

309
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
After 7 years we feel huh

310
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Everything I do

311
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,623
Surface very different but the other Bluetooth connected

312
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:52,511
Instead of actually chasing them off to the other whether you located at what their behavior change them

313
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,911
It's already late

314
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
Tomorrow maybe I can convince

315
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,799
So I'm there all connected underground that's why we feel

316
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,383
We want to leave Microsoft computer generic solution

317
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,991
Melania project

318
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,135
Not chasing after what the heck things happened when we talk to different people

319
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,487
And then we also see that opportunity because most people even today

320
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,095
What their solution is there actually after the fact that she attacked they feuding rules

321
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
Is she attacking they have labels that Cheney models are always very active

322
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
We want to be a we want to do something proactively

323
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
Carlton looking at things automatically

324
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
Discover new patent

325
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:45,247
That's the idea we feel we actually have idea how to ask if you that

326
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
That's why we

327
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
We shall we want to be Microsoft to give a try

328
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Got it

329
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
What's the easy

330
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,671
Warhawk difficult was it to do your own salad

331
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Having been the comfort

332
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Microsoft

333
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
Gazelle

334
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
It's not easy even though there's an idea and makes sense this

335
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
Officially a part of Market fit

336
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,751
Just take that first jump Lee Buffet to leave a comfort job coaches

337
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,591
Khushi believe I wear comfortable successful career

338
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
In a Safe Company to come out and do this

339
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
It's not easy decision so

340
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
What was it like after you make.

341
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
So I think of the decision perspective

342
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
We were talking about that is

343
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
Actually seems that

344
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,559
Ratatouille easy decision for the journey was not enough

345
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,959
Play ever want to go by your journey as it can be to

346
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,103
Talk about why the decision seems easy is I think after

347
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,431
Kind of be in this area long time post office

348
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Passion

349
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
We want to do something big

350
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Black and

351
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
You see all the all the unicorns that you don't

352
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
Morton the research

353
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
Word Microsoft research at a time

354
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Kind of focusing out and vomiting

355
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
The state of all that's what we two

356
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
Actually are doing

357
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
And we very good at it. At the same time

358
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,567
We see this gap between research and Industry and the True Value

359
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Proposition severitus

360
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
And I'm So at the same time it's very difficult to get

361
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Ross

362
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,575
Particularly in the security likes out of area

363
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,415
So we too are very excited about

364
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,743
Coming from research to say can we bring this

365
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,583
Kind of a new ideas and latest technology whatever would come up

366
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
Quickly to production

367
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,959
And that's something brand new in sounds really exciting and we think

368
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,567
Also the time in that time works very well because the mega timing

369
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
Is everything moving online

370
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,991
And I made attack a lot easier and everybody's a needle such solution the four

371
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,599
The other we can come machine learning AI Solutions with big data

372
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Is a technologist being involved

373
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
2

374
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
The state where it's more mature

375
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
The product Isaiah to Anna bring to the market

376
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,399
So we were very excited about that possibility

377
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Leaving the comfort zone

378
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
Definitely

379
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
A Samsung

380
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
A lot of people was a question but I think that in this case we to have some advantage of being ladies because

381
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:28,319
You feel maybe the family burden a lot more

382
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
The family

383
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,743
Kind of meals we probably both very thankful to Allah

384
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Aspen at that time

385
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,095
They both stopped working

386
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
Mercer

387
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
Facebook my Microsoft I'm not leaving

388
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
Bring up the idea and

389
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,575
We always have this joke I went to my husband and told him about this and say

390
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
Well why don't you like some other cheat

391
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
Me as a housewife except I don't do housewife

392
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:16,191
What you would know houses

393
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:25,151
I guess that also is that is another factor to some extent

394
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Shield

395
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:32,575
Kind of Tourism advantage in to stay with the family support and being kind of ladies we feel

396
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
Not like that is kind of

397
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
That

398
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
Possible

399
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,327
Tell me what you see conversation

400
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,423
Supportive young children when you started a company right

401
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
Barrie Ontario

402
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Yeah.

403
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Children

404
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,919
Oh I have nannies so that they actually gave me a lot of help

405
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
The Palm Neon

406
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,855
I am still still open

407
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
Husband

408
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
My parents and in-laws

409
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,535
Nanny's especially nearby to

410
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Is my mom here

411
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
Nearby I know yes

412
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
I think we got the the whole family

413
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Support

414
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Actually want to

415
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,543
My parents

416
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Gave me tremendous

417
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
They stayed with us

418
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Support

419
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
And also

420
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
That's why we

421
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Very thankful for

422
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Family

423
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
I think of anybody

424
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Hoodoo star double weather

425
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Kind of love

426
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
Ladies will guys that you need have any

427
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
Support use your schedule

428
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Very long

429
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Always at work

430
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
So you need someone

431
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
Saudi decision was easy and a support was there

432
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
What's the journey like

433
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
After you start a startup

434
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
How difficult is it to get stuff off the ground

435
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
Hire people and then

436
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,663
Try to convince people join you this database didn't have any brand at all

437
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
You you two hadn't had any success

438
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
So how easy was I want to go watch

439
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087
Set to get their project

440
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
APA running head

441
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,487
So I will also didn't talk about the name Justine

442
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,607
Elsia and the one we to actually looking at this Riley said decision was easy

443
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
And nausea also pops because

444
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,591
We didn't read it now

445
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,391
Play essay like before we make the decisions actually

446
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
To get likes

447
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Calling

448
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Sartre like

449
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,095
Talking about this and the day working as good advice to say

450
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,447
Here are the first important for nausea should talk to to really learn

451
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,239
Are you ready

452
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
Is there something you want to do to make sure and that before you jump into this and said oh it's is not what we want

453
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,223
So with that we did we actually talked to a few

454
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
Folks have been doing startups

455
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
And say what does it take

456
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
To do a startup

457
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,928
I think after that we came back and

458
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
So we will ask what do you feel

459
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
When we too had that consist now so

460
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
We don't think we have ready

461
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:29,472
I think I want to do it there is always

462
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Somewhere

463
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
To get started

464
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
And now we have to start somewhere

465
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,176
Animate the first step is to quit a job

466
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
Stop the beauty where can I buy

467
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
So it said like this other

468
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
Truly like draw lost things we not ready for

469
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
And the alarms things to feel on all the way

470
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,024
But that we decided to do it and then that's that's where we get started

471
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,352
I won't say the journey is is

472
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Definitely

473
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,424
Hot lava hotter

474
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
Then I would say when we started

475
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Initially pass because he initially we don't have any expectation what's it's going to look like to play with no expect

476
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Patient and but it was actually not easy you talked about so example recruiting right

477
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
And

478
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,160
My husband's working like saw the Microsoft to and then bleeding a lot

479
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Team as well

480
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,048
And everybody's complaining recordings very hot and competitive

481
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
How old is Val Like Son of the heart

482
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:35,008
When your install.

483
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
That's one thing

484
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,432
Where your equal one Microsoft recruiting on at 41st Street

485
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,016
So how did you guys get the initial hires

486
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Good people

487
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
The first two or three High

488
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Text join YouTube leaving you

489
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
Yeah I think that the first few

490
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
People actually that someone that way

491
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
We know I never found

492
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
The previous.

493
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
And then

494
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
We are we grab those

495
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
You have to stop at

496
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
And then I'm moving on

497
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
As many

498
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Actually start to have

499
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
The referrals

500
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
She going on that way

501
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Including and

502
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Stop

503
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Program

504
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,272
Weihai internal recruiters

505
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
She says you're so then

506
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
Actually get the ball rolling

507
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Extjs call the company

508
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,768
Strong discipline and initially

509
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
That does mean we grow actually

510
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
Slower

511
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,960
But one thing we did what I told all about

512
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Recruiting

513
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,568
And that I think it was overtime is paid off because

514
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,408
We do kind of said a stronger team when you have a face

515
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,272
It actually made the further down recruiting site at UCF

516
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Temperature

517
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,088
How many people do you have

518
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
We have already I think I over 80 people

519
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
Today and quickly

520
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Obsessed

521
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:05,376
So both of you grab in China went to college there and then came to the US for grad school

522
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,192
So you still have a very strong connection there

523
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
Current customers are based in China so have you thought about starting this company in China and why did you choose to start a

524
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Natural ant

525
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
Started yet because

526
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
We actually work

527
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
Microsoft Live all I'm home

528
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,576
And also it's Silicon Valley rights

529
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
The place of innovation so we actually

530
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
Didn't think off of Akshay at starting

531
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
China

532
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,744
Until that the reactor

533
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,792
They have a good customer base and react

534
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
I just thought of China branch

535
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:42,240
Particular we working the Technology field rice Silicon Valley is this field

536
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,800
For both star math must fear and

537
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Zhuhai technology

538
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,384
So it didn't occur to us

539
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
We have a startup

540
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
2

541
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Find different places

542
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,784
Stop door datavisor when we started

543
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
The idea is it

544
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
The technology

545
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Tostada

546
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Did you send out

547
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
Do you have engineers in China

548
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Crudos engineers

549
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
US company in a cell

550
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Sea turtle

551
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
I would say actually initially we thought we have the silica Maddie angle and it must be someone

552
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
Attractive but actually

553
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,320
Successful companies already in China so far

554
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,208
I think they grow really fast as well

555
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
It's also

556
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
Very difficult to recruiting there

557
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
In a consumer company

558
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Is that Enterprise

559
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
So, sometimes go even faster

560
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
So be attractive store Enterprise company

561
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
Dashiell especially comparison

562
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,360
So makes it even harder so how did you overcome that

563
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Did you go through

564
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
The Microsoft connection

565
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,968
To be more people that. Know you

566
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,992
Devil believe

567
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
To try and join you how did you get

568
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
What was your hook

569
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
Because the first few engineers in China

570
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
First of all we had one of our early founding members and now who actually let the

571
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,632
He went to China relocated that's actually fake a step and if someone

572
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Being there

573
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
And living

574
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
People relocate

575
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,336
He wasn't

576
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:26,432
Us actually for a few years but a few years already

577
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,272
Yeah probably

578
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
And not going to China so that

579
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
Pic first app

580
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,048
And we do actually locally get help

581
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
Perform

582
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
I would invest us

583
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
There are two helpless that I had

584
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
These are actually

585
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
Early Anchor Point

586
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Some of the clients some of them

587
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,408
And that's why I remind myself you

588
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,736
Yeah

589
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,576
And I told the later stage when we want to also

590
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,136
Have the product development in China

591
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
We also had

592
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
He likes other very capable team members when they

593
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Us

594
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Who wanted to relocate back to

595
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,960
Actually. I actually help with the team tremendously

596
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
Stay here for too long

597
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,848
There were similar kind of work to here

598
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,432
Well sometimes yes and then decided not too long

599
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,528
And also to my son we find that opportunity

600
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,576
Attractive to them as well

601
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,904
So who was your first customer in

602
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
What was the process like

603
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
Attracting women on boarding

604
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Customer

605
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
We will actually just

606
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,496
Closing the the first founding Ron and then we met and mimosa

607
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,592
Saunders I should buy asking so I know if I like a friend

608
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Who actually on

609
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,736
Helped them to around Google and they actually introduced

610
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,344
Because they did talk to them asked what's your biggest problem and they had to spend problem

611
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
So we said all that I want all file friends actually having a start-up at that time so we we talk to them

612
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,120
At the I wish I still remember that was actually at a Starbucks

613
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Sidemen clothing

614
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
Stanford at the night and then we

615
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,592
So talking about all that the product refuting and the initial put the times that we have and and then

616
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
I actually got pretty

617
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:36,480
Excited about our solution

618
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
At that time small cheap

619
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,320
I think we have to help them

620
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
Softer Spanish

621
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,440
Then we actually go back to do a

622
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
POC with them and then

623
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
POC results was very good

624
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
Quickly move on board

625
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,144
So that was actually the first class was actually very lucky we happened

626
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
Meet him actually

627
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
It is

628
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,008
Is memorial paying client to

629
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,104
Doesn't receive almost Market cabin back then

630
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Is a few billion dollars

631
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Like Yelp

632
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
Do you think you'll be that easy

633
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,992
To get into Yelp

634
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,648
To give people more contacts mama is sort of like the tender of China social networking app

635
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Mostly anonymous

636
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,720
Social networking for people to me

637
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
People

638
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Maybe outside of basketball

639
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
Comparable to Snapchat

640
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
So can you imagine

641
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,936
Meeting Snapchat anybody seniors

642
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
Snapchat

643
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
Having a few our conversation

644
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
Did they give you the steel

645
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,128
Who is the west of the POC so it's not giving us it's just giving us opportunity

646
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,552
This lucky part is also

647
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,672
Something reflecting today's word the particular for China

648
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,488
That grow really fast

649
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,280
Three and half years

650
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:59,168
So they grow phenomena such a fastest speed in their team is also

651
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,752
Relativity, as well as a young team going up quickly

652
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
Expand province

653
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Off.

654
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
Kale it becomes

655
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,944
A key issue that they have to solve for them to go to the next step

656
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,296
I think that's a reflection just to say there are many companies in China

657
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,344
A face similar challenges

658
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
That's really fast gross

659
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
In relativity

660
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,000
Kind of younger and experienced team of handling

661
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,656
A really large scale issues that is very detrimental to post user experience in business growth

662
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
Anywhere I want

663
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Teas could help

664
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,312
So I would say we were lucky to get that boom by the first time

665
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,616
But that's also like strengthen

666
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,432
Sum of all belief of going to China

667
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
As I walk the major markets as well because y'all many more companies like

668
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Benefit from

669
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
From our expense investing

670
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
So many consumers

671
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Did the market is so big

672
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
And the

673
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Growth is so fast

674
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
Not they know they're having issues

675
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Salt

676
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
And

677
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Like you said not as many of them

678
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Scale

679
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
4

680
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Therefore they very open-minded

681
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Anything

682
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Bicknell makes sense

683
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Salisbury Marathon

684
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
Instead of a lot of hurdles and

685
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Who you know

686
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Have you had it all the references

687
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
Have you are you at

688
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,392
Complying to this regulation derivation

689
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
This much

690
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Fuel hurdles

691
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
Enterprise company

692
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
Penetrate the Chinese market

693
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Can trust you in soap

694
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
Throw a little bit more like I'll be able to risk attacking and embracing new technology

695
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,312
How to try out new things

696
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,664
And I think that's also that kind of spirit to help them

697
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
Medic Rolex

698
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,504
The part of the growing fast I think.

699
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,856
When they were all kinds they have not gone IPO yet afterwards

700
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
On the spam problem

701
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,720
Not such like sort of an issue that they have to

702
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,512
Become greedy headache about

703
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
I think.

704
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,352
Then be able to focus on their Core Business

705
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
Start inviting you to come to

706
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Sparkasse

707
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Also.

708
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
We wanted a lot of sass companies

709
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Security service

710
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Roofing companies in

711
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Us to know that

712
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Telemachus Ashley

713
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Gray Market

714
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
But you don't have anybody on

715
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
Your team.

716
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
From China

717
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
It help you to penetrate.

718
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
At 8

719
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
You think that is very difficult

720
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Tacoma takes a long time

721
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
But for those

722
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Yahoo. Both China and us

723
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Matthew Thomas

724
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Even better mark

725
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
The Kraken

726
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,608
I think of China definitely sees very promising large Market

727
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
Price of a monkey sizes

728
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
So many opportunities

729
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,240
A lot of life

730
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
Internet services

731
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
In a traditional companies and moving

732
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
To online

733
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
3 day fast

734
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,968
And that was another thing I mentioned in notice

735
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Is really their willingness

736
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,576
To adopt new technology and new solutions

737
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
To help them grow faster

738
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
Doctor general lights

739
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Sentimental

740
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Mus is all of us

741
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
The cut cost

742
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,560
In China is helping to make more money and grow faster

743
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Very different motivation

744
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
And people usually move faster when can help

745
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,520
So today how many percent of your clients are in China versus

746
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Does the US

747
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,872
I think we have about

748
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
So

749
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,736
When we enter into China

750
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Omaha flights

751
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040

752
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
I'm here and today we definitely see you like

753
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
Maki grow fast

00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
The number of customized statue

755
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
Growing at the fastest

756

US map

757
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
5 scale bigger

758
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
And that's

759
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Who sing with other

760
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
Company that selling both

761
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
Into us and China

762
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Comparison

763
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Chinese market Chinese

764
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Klein's archery

765
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
More open mobile

766
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Try new things

767
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Grow faster pace

South Africa

770
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
SAS company

771
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Who don't have a telemarketer

772
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Benchmark

773
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,808
So you guys have a very bicultural.

774
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
Team like a lot of team members

775
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Have Chinese background have an office in Beijing

776
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
Is it

777
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:09,024
Difficult to run a bicultural team like both

778
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
In both countries at the same time

779
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
Do you think that's a long-term competitive

780
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,240
I think the song probably want to comment on the

781
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,312
Lingala culture particles

782
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
Heard from the technology perspective

783
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
The customer

784
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:32,320
You'll wish that they today issues like a everyday

785
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
I think that there's definitely

786
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
Culture differ

787
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
Patina Chinese

788
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Customer

789
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Hazmat

790
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Chinese

791
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Customers usually move out of crib

792
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
And I'm there

793
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
Quickly prepare theme

794
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Quickly as well

795
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
The same time they ask

796
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
She have a lot more requests

797
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
NWS

798
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
I said they want

799
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
More requests

800
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
I'm supporting boss

801
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
USA

802
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
China is that

803
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
So we have actually us

804
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Support team and also

805
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Even you can have all developed

806
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
The support you actually need to have

807
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Pueblo CO

808
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,168
Face to face time with a customized

809
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
Number one

810
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
Important city in China

811
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
So we do actually work with

812
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
The China

813
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Remote

814
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
The looming Tower

815
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
Remote

816
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
What causes thatch

817
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,784
But in the meanwhile I think of Technology

818
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
Very good

819
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Accor

820
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
With a custom always always

821
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Noah members

822
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
China Inn

823
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
I should also come

824
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Very easy day

825
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
To all the

826
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Of course

827
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
People standing

828
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
To go

829
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
Kristin Fontana

830
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
The time Factor

831
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
I think the remote

832
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
Collaboration

833
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Casspi actually work

834
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
I will say reasonable

835
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Play well

836
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
So you have a lot of calls

837
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
A night here

838
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
7 body type

839
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
And morning with newt

840
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
It's ammonia noon timing

841
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
Just about time you get up in the morning China

842
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,208
Certificate

843
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Sometimes we talk

844
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
Morning time as well but it's only four

845
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,656
But that usually Sawa like

846
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
I'm sum of all

847
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
That company meetings will be

848
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
The late of

849
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Accommodated

850
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Go to McDowell

851
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,176
Encourage likes

852
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,480
Location of crossbows teams

853
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
So we will have

854
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
Coming to visit

855
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
USS Titan

856
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
To come over

857
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
And then we also

858
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Members from

859
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
I'm here going to China

860
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
Do Charles to work with them together

861
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
So I am now

862
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
The China teams

863
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,912
Probably about 30 people today by

864
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
How quickly growing

865
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,240
To actually more than double their now

866
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,056
It's really

867
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
How many people do you have

868
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
Here by comparison

869
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,176
What do we have is about the 50 people

870
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
Sakuku have more in China

871
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Yuan to

872
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
Probably 50-50

873
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,464
And are more people almost people in China in Beijing or

874
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,400
Are we first open the Beijing off

875
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Staffing 2000

876
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,728
And now we have

877
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Quite some time

878
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
So that's why we

879
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Show houses lately

880
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
That's why

881
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Chloe

882
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
I'm looking for support

883
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
It support

884
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
For sale shenzhen

885
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
We are hiring a few

886
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,856
We feel also from

887
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,416
Like some of the

888
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
Is back to write

889
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
And giving the child not culture we want

890
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,840
I want to be with the customer listen to them that helps was this I'm off to the developer

891
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,400
As well we also have R&D team

892
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Locating post

893
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,008
And the reason is a that they were able to

894
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,288
Bead directory

895
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
Like get to know the business values

896
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
My voice and the

897
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
So be able to

898
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Perform

899
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
At the support

900
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,504
And then the other

901
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,600
I think it also makes it recruiting slightly easier because the

902
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,416
As we talked about the recruiting in China

903
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,744
Is also difficult as well cuz he couldn't Beijing and 9th

904
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Think I had a

905
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Presence

906
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,608
Different locations also enable us

907
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
The best pasta

908
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Sure

909
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,056
So how does your approach to fraud detection and prevention differ from the traditional

910
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,360
What will differentiate your technology

911
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
I think I'll main differentiation

912
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
We are called

913
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Supervisor

914
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Which

915
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,064
As I mentioned before that most of a solution

916
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Concurrently

917
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Small react

918
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
You see something bad you rather rules are you

919
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,952
You see something values.

920
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
Machine learning

921
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,560
Solutions that should work well

922
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
When the things asked

923
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Staples

924
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
The mission all I can image recognition Mozart

925
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
People ashy

926
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,008
What people look like don't change

927
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
Weather in fraud scenario

928
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
That actually changes very quickly

929
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,944
Waupaca evolve sometime overnight over a few hours that could change

930
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
If you're always like a writing rules to start even I can machine learning Solutions

931
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
2 start training

932
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
It's actually very

933
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
Slow and always react

934
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,024
That's why we did not put something brand-new we called it an unsupervised machine learning solution that a table

935
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Tudi taxing

936
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,888
Bad things on the Fly and look at the things that you real time

937
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Protecting you from a patent

938
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,264
That's what differentiates us from all the other Solutions

939
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
And it seems we actually

940
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Just thought it was a social off you

941
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
We actually few 2

942
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Skill

943
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:49,760
So we had we can actually process succulents off of your van so very quickly in our

944
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Distributor engine

945
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
And that's also the main differentiation

946
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
Competitors

947
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,512
Do you hope to expand into new areas going forward

948
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,840
Yeah so I'm currently we started with the socials

949
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
So that's where we actually

950
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,168
Different land Memorial

951
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Social network

952
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
Can we see a lava axe

953
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,520
She abdomens we're still going pretty strong

954
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Sector

955
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,592
I know we move into the gaming sack

956
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Picture of in the middle

957
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
Because a lot of people actually

958
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,992
Have a huge Mark Hedges $1000000 to mocking.

959
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
To buy new users in gaming

960
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,856
And many of those sacks you're faking stall speed

961
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,440
They are only limited source of a good insult. They are such

962
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,000
Channels

963
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,888
So the gaming company Ortega on the whoever we need to buy New Uses and upper having a party

964
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
Wasted their marketing dollar so

965
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,288
We help with them trash you've added all the advice and help

966
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,360
Get three phones for those and avoid those are bad

967
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Install

968
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,432
That's a second Market that we asked

969
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
Doing pretty strong

970
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,064
And we also are doing a moving to the financial markets

971
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
I know we are free

972
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Temple wework

973
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
With some of the largest

974
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,440
Clyde Jackson money transfers

975
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,464
Banks is that true

976
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:07,584
Because there are a lot of issues in a financial institution as well for example

977
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
In us it's a lot of things

978
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
Extra credit face

979
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
But it was credit bureaus information leak

980
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Anybody cash

981
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,568
To pretend to be me to apply a credit card online

982
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
And he can get the credit card and starting

983
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
A lot of

984
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
Coordinated attack

985
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
We also see a lot of

986
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Synergies between.

987
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Different sectors

988
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,880
Because many of the attackers will playground in the social

989
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
Oh I have a success

990
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
Here and I can launch lives

991
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Attack

992
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:40,096
What about tomorrow I start attacking financial industry that actually give me much higher

993
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,632
Higher all ice

994
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,192
A nostalgic place so that's what we

995
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,008
We actually shifting there as well talk to you how

996
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Jack manual

997
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Finesse remix

998
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
2 Chainz

999
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,104
Different type of

1000
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Do you actually see overtime C

1001
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Cheese similar

1002
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
Players Saints

1003
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,807
That's very similar patterns and it sometimes

1004
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:05,695
They're always think of attack is always evolving they actually very Advanced and they change very quickly

1005
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
But the way that we

1006
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,535
Traditionally people think

1007
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
Financial institutions

1008
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,351
It's actually have different attack

1009
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Havana Social sector

1010
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Damn is that she eats

1011
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Tempeh bacon

1012
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
Even not even a penny right now

1013
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:23,359
But financial institution you get a one card that you actually able to have a lava

1014
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
Like a revenue-generating

1015
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,711
But in English in now

1016
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
That these actually cast actually

1017
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:35,135
Because they can't use a launch large-scale attack they was just try to

1018
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
To see whatever they

1019
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
So far I know you seen a lot of

1020
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,071
Interesting fraud cases can you tell me an anecdote

1021
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Yeso

1022
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
It's Rudy

1023
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,959
See some of the fraud patterns nowadays

1024
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,495
It actually

1025
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
So one of the cases

1026
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Police officer

1027
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Lost

1028
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
A big heo attack

1029
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,711
Cancel account takeover

1030
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
Account takeover

1031
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,575
Usually before recession much smaller

1032
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Skip this attack

1033
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
12 minutes of accounts

1034
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Compromise

1035
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,511
And the pot is actually making the very different font

1036
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Traditional

1037
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327
It's Quickly evolve

1038
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,119
It's actually change super fast

1039
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,775
And if you took a tummy ATO attack they was just what credential stuffing and I try to login and then

1040
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
And they do some similar things

1041
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
But for this particular hu attack

1042
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
Dashie

1043
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,759
So that you love each iot device all over the world

1044
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Switch IP address

1045
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
Have only very very little

1046
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,135
Activities and each one coming from varidesk

1047
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
Distributed the world

1048
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
And then logging to this

1049
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,743
Accounts

1050
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,303
Their attack patterns very quickly change

1051
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,119
The first time they actually logging Dash

1052
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
Pretend to be not good

1053
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
Yashow very Quest

1054
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,775
If they login to stop twitching bad things immediately

1055
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,847
And in the bathroom seat Dewey media 2K

1056
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,383
You can write a rule that

1057
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
You logging you made it to a lot of bad things

1058
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
This is actually the second

1059
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
That type of behavior

1060
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Captured

1061
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,927
And then they change it to Vera

1062
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,231
Delsey weight limit themselves

1063
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
Very quickly

1064
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:22,143
And and they are they do only one thing at a time and then another thing at a time and they have a very long as randomization

1065
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
And this change is only a night

1066
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
A few days today I changed

1067
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,639
And then when they see this thing that she doesn't go well they switched quickly switch to another patch

1068
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,967
Which is the only login it don't do much things at all

1069
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,831
And they run them so you can see the the whole like a week off

1070
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:45,951
What time when they actually conducting this attack first to use very sophisticated message over

1071
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,743
Iot devices

1072
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,303
They pretend to be iPhone which is the most

1073
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
Most popular devices there

1074
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,399
And then they did quickly change patent

1075
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
And this

1076
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
Attack pattern changes

1077
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Is something that we

1078
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,543
See very popular

1079
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Amount all the attacks

1080
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
These days

1081
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,407
And for some of the client

1082
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
Received that they actually attack

1083
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,551
Section very patient initially they were actually created many different

1084
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Like

1085
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
Master

1086
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
Distilled account

1087
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
2 attack

1088
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
And then when they see that

1089
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
It's not very

1090
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
Thomas Ian

1091
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
Solutions architect

1092
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,631
Then they will say I register call that a dude. Don't do anything

1093
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
And I I just wait

1094
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,471
Well I like I feel like a monster

1095
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
And I don't do anything that I starts with X

1096
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,823
By that time most of the Ruby

1097
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,895
Justin watching this is older, this is actually a good account

1098
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
The Nostalgia attack

1099
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,479
And then at some point today also see

1100
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,551
If I actually become

1101
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,391
Very socially well connected to my profile looks good

1102
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
Then it actually might the chance of miso

1103
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,511
Accessing

1104
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
They're sold that in that case

1105
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:59,167
They could slip you the connections among that go to users among themselves

1106
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,287
And look at it very good profile pictures and I have a long letter and things about themselves

1107
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
And it attacked that way

1108
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,151
And even though this at all the solutions actually able to

1109
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
Capturing

1110
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,063
Then they were actually moved to Old heo attacks and and compromise the old user account

1111
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
The conductive

1112
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Activity there

1113
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
So the

1114
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
The things that we are trained to react

1115
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Seeing that

1116
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
A lot of ass

1117
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
Changes

1118
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
The different behaviors

1119
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
If you're the solution is always like

1120
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,167
You see that behavior and you have something deploy

1121
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
They are always

1122
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
Chasing after what day

1123
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Conducted

1124
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
Always react

1125
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
That's why I think we have a lot of

1126
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,895
Access into checking this

1127
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
Bayer Advanced

1128
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
And the distributed attack

1129
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
Using all the time

1130
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
So

1131
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:54,207
Has mentioned it was actually easier for you because you were a woman like starting a business

1132
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
At times where you thought it was harder because you were a woman

1133
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
And have you

1134
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
Encounters

1135
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
Instances where people were treating you differently

1136
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,263
I could definitely lighter as woman like

1137
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
AccuWeather app

1138
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
Silicon Valley where do exams

1139
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,639
No particularly

1140
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:18,527
Rainberry technical field

1141
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
See different views in different

1142
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
Perspective

1143
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Is coming up

1144
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
And that

1145
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
That's

1146
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
Perhaps I think it said it said it a normal thing

1147
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
Phenomenal

1148
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Weather today

1149
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,119
And that's just reality

1150
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:37,215
These different views perspectives

1151
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
And I would talk about OverWatch I think we to probably see you kind of lucky because

1152
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
On my way

1153
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
And

1154
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,223
Owl

1155
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
Masters in France

1156
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,063
How old is super supportive

1157
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:57,695
Despite the fact that the two of us by two co-founders that I've always liked so the female co-founders

1158
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,999
Anna nobody actually

1159
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,095
Serious questions because of that

1160
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,167
Particular combination factor to question

1161
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,239
Weather is going to be successful not week are tremendous

1162
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,567
Support along from the people around us

1163
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,871
But definitely draw occasions

1164
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:20,735
I would to talk about that maybe a couple of examples where it would be did to feel like sense

1165
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:25,599
A different example of a common theme was B

1166
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,671
We going to maybe parties

1167
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Posted

1168
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,999
Somewhere those are kind of

1169
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
The

1170
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,095
Sometimes in life

1171
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
People to call

1172
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,911
When do a lot of attendees

1173
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,215
Likes of a guys and being female

1174
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,519
End of the people you don't know about

1175
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:48,895
Yeah sometimes it's difficult to start a conversation because the tenderness is

1176
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,967
The guys like to talk to guys today

1177
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,039
Dot. Sometimes we sell laxatives

1178
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
And

1179
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
Where

1180
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,439
Joe likes of the week we'd love to see more like Southern

1181
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
Gmail

1182
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
Turn off being there

1183
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,119
Back machine there like you there's a community

1184
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
Ana support

1185
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,703
And I also I think it before

1186
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,079
Going to be laughing my ass off every Mission we talked to

1187
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
People likes out of

1188
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,943
But introduction of fans Etc

1189
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,295
About at the start of Journey and

1190
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,599
So we've talked to folks on pole light

1191
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
1

1192
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,207
Example like Southern gaster

1193
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,559
Just just as a casual conversation

1194
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
And the idea media restarting

1195
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,447
Oh seems to Charming ladies want to have asada

1196
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:49,311
Facebook.com

1197
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,359
The conscious bring to us

1198
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:58,015
Is there's a question is that going to be stuck until Friday right are they serious about it

1199
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,343
But both of you also have very strong technical records

1200
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,415
Careers before you did this so

1201
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
I guess

1202
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,767
When people see that they're like okay they're serious

1203
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
So I would say

1204
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,631
Such thing exists but I think of most part

1205
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
The place to

1206
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,727
Does the people surrounding us

1207
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Xcetera

1208
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Fairies

1209
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,175
So what advice do you have for other female founders

1210
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
Quanta services

1211
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,295
So I encourage like

1212
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,063
Female

1213
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
Female

1214
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,719
Female likes turn off

1215
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
If you have

1216
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Dreams

1217
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
To golf

1218
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Assuage

1219
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
And that

1220
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
So for the two of us

1221
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
Even though I sell the Wii word to FEMA

1222
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,775
So we went ahead and did

1223
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,055
And I really am

1224
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
Encourage others

1225
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,383
To do the same and

1226
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
So

1227
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,455
After all I think

1228
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
I really think

1229
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,391
It should not be relevant to the gender from the perspective by

1230
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,439
When we two are lucky anthem

1231
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
This

1232
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,231
We are knocking

1233
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
Considering

1234
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
Because we're having a

1235
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,815
Technology startup

1236
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,095
And

1237
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
Because we're two

1238
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
Female cofounders

1239
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,215
We shouldn't do it never occurred to us

1240
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,263
But I also encourage others

1241
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,799
To hold the same view

1242
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,079
To actually move

1243
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Forwarding

1244
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
Doing it

1245
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,175
I also likes other

1246
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
Wheat or lucky like

1247
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Ricardo Lawson

1248
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Support

1249
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,063
And I would also hope likes of the

1250
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,135
I think I Community also give more support

1251
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
Two other

1252
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
Like female

1253
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Kind of

1254
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,279
Potential cofounders like us

1255
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,839
Dad to give them enough support

1256
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,655
So that they could move forward

1257
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
And the disappointing

1258
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,007
Sometimes comes from family Tramadol family

1259
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Import

1260
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,311
You wouldn't be able to do it

1261
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,151
And was friends supporting his investors

1262
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
Support Jewish

1263
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
Needs to be a lot of snow

1264
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
Support

1265
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
For this to happen

1266
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
2

1267
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
I read

1268
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
Before I talk

1269
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,671
Around the time maybe

1270
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,463
We too are thinking about startup

1271
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,071
I rather Sheryl Sandberg spark healthy.

1272
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
A lot of

1273
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
Courage I get home

1274
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,727
Samurai

1275
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
So

1276
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,287
As you this kind of

1277
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Stromedy

1278
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,199
Experience like Mentor Oman on the role model

1279
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,759
Yeah I know that could also in French

1280
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
Address

1281
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,647
Do you think China or in the US

1282
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Deers

1283
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,839
China auctions

1284
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,423
Feels less about this gender actually yeah

1285
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Actually

1286
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,799
China Tucson

1287
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
Because I asked

1288
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
The same question

1289
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
People ask the same questions

1290
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,711
And the maybe this is incorrect

1291
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,759
Reception and I feel like

1292
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:10,783
China

1293
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Gender likes other

1294
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Bias

1295
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Seems the last

1296
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
The problem that pee

1297
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Alot definition

1298
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
You see people talk about it less

1299
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
Yummy exist

1300
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Talk about it

1301
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,215
Some statistics shows in China women leaders actually

1302
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
The percentages

1303
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Greater

1304
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,311
Yeah I've seen the same

1305
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,871
I think that's really a few yeah yeah

1306
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
But I don't remember the details

1307
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,479
I've read some stuff maybe when we actually

1308
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
I'm going up

1309
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,855
More point

1310
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
Kingsoft

1311
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,255
But here I think we have

1312
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
Allowed

1313
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
LC9 engine

1314
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
12

1315
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,119
Wayne Thompson

1316
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Bahari

1317
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
Do not consider

1318
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,239
And we have actually a lot of a gray tiger

1319
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
Female engineer

1320
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,103
Small company actually our gender balance

1321
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Dairy Queen

1322
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
I will say hi

1323
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
But I dislike

1324
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,159

1326
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,999
We are now in the final section

1327
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,023
Apple podcast

1328
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,559
Quickfire

1329
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,655
Give us the first answer

1330
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,239
Tell us an entrepreneur you admire the most

1331
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,031
Could be the US from China

1332
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:43,199
So I don't many entrepreneurs actually add my does so many great entrepreneurs

1333
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,295

1334
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,623
Dairy Queen admira hero mask

1337
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,607
Is the wild idea he has

1338
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,423
And the reading to pursue them really 2 challenges

1339
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
The boundary of Technology

1340
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:10,335
Enough for the US to become from technology to that is really inspiring

1341
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:18,271
It's actually very interesting to see email I actually have the same picture

1342
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:22,623
Together

1343
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,695

1344
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719

00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Something slow

1353
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
And I like that book

1354
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,639
Guys talking about how human brain

1355
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
World's End

1356
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
Where you develop

1357
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
Fire

1358
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Play cautious

1359
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Lights

1360
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Decision

1361
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,623
And

1362
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
And then quite a bit of even a thing

1363
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,767
Think of some of the concept of applying today like a

1364
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
Kind of

1365
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,351
Business ronning pot

About voicemail

1367
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
The concept of marketing

1368
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
And I can reflect

1369
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,751
To those blocks

1370
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
2 +

1373
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
When you book

1374
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
That's actually

1375
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
Athenia Mason

1376
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
Just thought of his the hard journey but I see other people

1377
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Alarm

1378
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,047
Gizmos used for after

1379
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,607
Already encountered some of the things you talk

1380
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
Things he talked about

1381
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:44,287
I know like when I read it I know that I will make the same mistakes

1382
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
Cuz I just haven't done it yet

1383
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,175
What do you do for fun

1384
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:56,575
Country we don't have a lot of time to me I have time I like to travel with my family

1385
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Extended time

1386
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
I like them know

1387
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:07,583
I always enjoy reading 5 time quiet time I can

1388
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:12,959
The dog that Interruption like a Wells maybe some tea and excetera

1389
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
And that's luxury

1390
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,543
Usually eat with wings

1391
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,079
Bookstore Chinese books

1392
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
I revolver

1393
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,639
What I will be in

1394
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:27,295
So for trying Chinese books actually

1395
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,343
I love to read that

1396
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,671
What we talked about is the

1397
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
The Source MacBook

1398
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,743
I don't know if you're not like that

1399
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:41,631
So I think you know

1400
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,423
Maven to test if there's a new

1401
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,983
China's new type of volcano

1402
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
Particular recently

1403
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,567
Doll like a set of several new ones

1404
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
About a girl.

1405
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Talking about

1406
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,479
And so I left those because

1407
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,551
They are there is a again it's

1408
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
School of imagination

1409
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,927
One can do and really to

1410
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
You the best

1411
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,719
Stopwatch

1412
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
And

1413
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,071
I like a lot of it also the characters

1414
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,727
There are two of different words like how you essentially is imported the reality into a different word

1415
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
And

1416
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
Then you suddenly

1417
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,359
Some of the things you learn from that word

1418
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
And you can take

1419
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
To apply the reality in thinking of

1420
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:33,599
Different away and I interpret that as another book we read read before

1421
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
A Game of Thrones

1422
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,695
What's the popular show there I think the complications there

1423
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
Sartre

1424
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
So

1425
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
The part that.

1426
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Enjoy

1427
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
