Glad to be here

79
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
So I wonder how did it come soon

80
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
Choose a topic of this

81
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,928
And why did you choose to focus on why why out of all the live streaming platform

82
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,816
Yasso back in 2014 in the summer time I went back to China to

83
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,144
Start researching my new film Project actually broke

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
Es6 project ideas in mind

85
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
I do some research filming in China

86
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,616
And then just randomly one of my friend who has a financial analyst at that time asked me

87
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
Since you're working tap for so many years

88
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
Have you heard of this company called why why

89
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
It's listed on NASDAQ

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Acmarket that back then was over

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
3 $4 already

92
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,904
How to make money

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
So I was intrigued because for many years

94
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
As possible saying I work in

95
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
Beijing China Alibaba and TripAdvisor China

96
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
I'm button

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,472
I asked around my friends in Beijing or Shanghai

98
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,360
You're not.

99
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,224
It's about these Gamers addicted to gaming this is the kill time online

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,344
How can company that even tech people in the big city

101
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Know about it get listed on NASDAQ

102
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
So that was my first impetus to start researching

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
And then

104
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
I luckily swear in Dutch

105
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Connection

106
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
China's internet industry

107
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
And I was introduced to the Shell in the founder of YY

108
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,007
And Alicia Linda introduced me to YYC marketing department

109
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,359
Eyeshadow as the live stream

110
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
In China did you some event

111
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
There was like wow this is so fascinating

112
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,879
You see all these live streamers who

113
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,839
Because whether my can we have mixers there there's this sounds much better

114
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,167
And then they attract money

115
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
And then as soon as I realized

116
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
There are a lot of too hot

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
You know

118
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Rich

119
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,015
And as well as the the losers all getting together in the showroom

120
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
And every night when they do their shows

121
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
It's 2252 even 100,000 people watching simultaneously I was like wow

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
This is fascinating because

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,095
The rich and the poor that don't get together

124
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Community

125
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
The altogether

126
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,983
And they actually talk to each other the wish of each other

127
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,799
So that was so fast maybe I decided to

128
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Make You Feel My

129
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
And how long did it take you to make

130
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
The film and what were your biggest challenge

131
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
So

132
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,831
I started filming in summer 2014 before live streaming really explode in China

133
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,231
If you guys follow developments in industry in China unit watching will explode into mainstream Consciousness in 2016

134
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Because I need to have a

135
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Why why every year

136
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Hazardous

137
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Annual competition

138
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
I was like wow that's going to be a cool so I followed my

139
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Life's humorous as

140
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Prepare

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
To go to this competition to win

142
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,639
Kotoko the idol title

143
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
And that can be fun to watch

144
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
And then

145
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,063
Next year I can come back and feeling a little bit about the personal stories

146
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
I got it in the Buda

147
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
More typical three a structure

148
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
But then

149
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
Very quickly soon after I finish filming the first competition

150
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
Where one of the livestreamer Wong laws

151
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
Be the girl the female

152
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
She had a plastic surgery

153
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
And she moved

154
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
So I can like

155
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
Film her personal life title cut it in

156
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
Before the competition

157
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,991
To cheat to build a 3X talk to animals

158
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
The film the next

159
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Competition

160
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,415
I feel all the way into 2016 as a witness the explosion of Life streaming

161
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
In China and then

162
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,095
So that's almost like two years of filming production and then the editing took a long time to get a year-and-a-half

163
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Because

164
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Such a complex ecosystem

165
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
The business rules

166
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
How to replicate

167
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
The social

168
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
Status the luxury cars that

169
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
And

170
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
How

171
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
The agency Worx trying to

172
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Komodo life shimmers to manage

173
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
So the business rules as well as

174
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
Different levels of relationship is so complex

175
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
So to me a long time to arrive trying to streamline the story

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
Enough so obvious cook

177
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,327
Potentially understanding but in the same time

178
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Retained

179
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Complexity

180
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,519
Because that to me was what's fascinating about this weekend

181
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
In this fantasy world

182
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
Simplicity and complexity between

183
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Portraying this

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Virtual community

185
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
The counter

186
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
Stories how the characters are feeling

187
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
As the flame goes up and down

188
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
As all intros

189
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,255
Trash dump

190
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
About the relationship with their families

191
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Real life relationships

192
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
I be impacted

193
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
As they're all Einstein grow

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
It feels like a mixture of Hollywood

195
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Netflix

196
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Snapchat

197
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Kind of Hall combine

198
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
Take me to Arden Mall

199
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,639
Yeah I mean when I was making the film

200
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Futurama Black Mirror

201
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,063
I so so the overall feeling is the film is very sci-fi ish because I feel like China is already

202
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Compared to the US

203
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
Is coming in the future already

204
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
So I decided cautiously to make the

205
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,511
This film feel more like a sci-fi film

206
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
Is selfies very

207
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Black Mirror

208
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Yes your film is Black Mirror

209
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
I'm seeing a white wife

210
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
It's system

211
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Reminds me of online

212
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Hollywood

213
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
And Netflix

214
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Snapchat

215
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Go out that's that's absolutely correct

216
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
So I love your title

217
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Republic of Zaire

218
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
I found a very thoughtful

219
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Can you explain the logic

220
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Yeah I mean what's the logic

221
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,559
Because you wanted you want to convey this film is about China obvious

222
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
People's Republic

223
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Something

224
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,727
But then something

225
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
So what is this why why or

226
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Virtual

227
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Community about

228
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
It's about

229
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Indiana

230
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
People ask me to explain

231
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
Why do these poor people spend money on

232
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
Why do they switch people spend money on

233
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
It's so hard to explain the

234
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,023
Each row in an online community

235
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Multifaceted

236
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
It's not simple to summarize

237
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
So Indiana just decided like desire

238
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Desire

239
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Is

240
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
Is this longing is this aspiration but it's

241
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,383
This emotion

242
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Brodie knob

243
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,807
Places like money

244
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
The film characters all have

245
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
They all leave

246
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,719
Pretty deep impression on the viewer from the two wall homes

247
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
In her celebrities who devote their whole life to live streaming

248
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
A white white widow to how The super-rich Who lavished

249
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,495
Virtual gifts on their favorite streamers to the Dallas Zoo who are the migrant workers searching for cheap entertainment

250
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
I always wonder how did you find it

251
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
How do you

252
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Get them to agree to

253
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,039
So I was lucky as a mission

254
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Is conscious about

255
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
PR

256
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
Does a temperate on a company you'll be different

257
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
Not as evil

258
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
So the marketing team was really really nice to me

259
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,031
Introduce me to the the Marisol said can you help introduce me to this one

260
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
And then they will do that

261
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
At first the Maca team definitely

262
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,479
Try to put satellite humor to me

263
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
Br

264
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,087
Am I becoming baby no no

265
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,439
It's what why wanderlife Gmail

266
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,511
The Host

267
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Some of them can be boring

268
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
And so that's one thing

269
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
Secondly some of them actually tell a different story

270
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,735
You know one of them

271
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
I'm not going to name names.

272
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
She's putting herself

273
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
Online but you realize just

274
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,767
29 year old teacher married with kids

275
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:50,143
I can I can poetry about her

276
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
And

277
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
Ecology

278
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
Every last human has to have some

279
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
I need that

280
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
They need money

281
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
So their fans can support

282
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Most of the channel that make up a story

283
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,743
I lie about who they really are

284
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,351
In the beginning the last summer were confused based thought I was making a cover video for why

285
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
So I can show up

286
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,007
Documentary

287
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
I don't like

288
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
I don't know that India can we just hang out

289
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Sew in

290
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,599
With the guys is easier with the Michael Walker

291
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,927
Really easy to open up to me because I'm a guy

292
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
We can just hang on head beer they'll hang out but we Somoza very difficult because she's a girl she live stream

293
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,191
She flirts and talk sometimes dirty jokes to her pictures

294
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,287
With me a guy

295
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,127
And she feel really uncomfortable so far. Of time

296
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Chapters that you cannot come

297
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Dollar fly bath bomb

298
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
New York

299
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Because I'm very sick

300
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Scanned and

301
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Light included when they're like Friday

302
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Really

303
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
How do you get them

304
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
How to be comfortable in

305
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
I think the keys are you just have to show up

306
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,639
What's a show-off holding the camera in front of them

307
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
Loreena McKennitt forget

308
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Is there anyway so

309
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
So I'm anyview reviewers have called the film

310
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Provocative and unsettled

311
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Terrifying

312
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
It was at

313
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Part of your intestine

314
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
How to do

315
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
For it to be that way or was that

316
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
I didn't know different types of filmmakers

317
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Different types of documentary film

318
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Some documentary filmmakers just

319
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Want to give the impression

320
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
Observing life

321
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
You know I'll always the filmmaker

322
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
But I'm

323
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
The kind of like I want to tell ghost story

324
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
I want to find the most romantic moment

325
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
Telugu story

326
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
To keep a strong impression on my audio

327
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
My aunt is trying to figure out what the message is

328
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
So

329
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,399
Obviously I followed them for two years I have like 700 hours of footage

330
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Which I shot

331
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
As well as hundreds and hundreds of

332
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
Hours of recordings of their live streaming shows

333
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
It's up to me to pick the right moment

334
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
So yes I

335
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Intentionally

336
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
Really push for some

337
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
Traumatic or provocative

338
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Portage in

339
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Koepsell footage in the film

340
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,231
Because you know even when I explain live streaming to a Chinese artist who made

341
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
Uniquely Chinese

342
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Complex

343
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
An astonishing

344
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
I also asked honest because

345
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Any given night

346
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
So yes I think

347
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,783
The part of what the reality is it is released

348
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
We think that

349
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
They'll be other forms of life

350
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Streaming of any merger

351
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
What is the southeast

352
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Where I

353
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Latin America

354
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
When I look at why why

355
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Wow when I'm at college

356
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
It feels like

357
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
A bit of

358
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Pro wrestling

359
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
And so proper

360
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
During the day in

361
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
In the US

362
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
Professional sports all combined

363
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
So this is very intense feeling

364
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
That even the

365
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
The most girls

366
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575

On order where you're champion

372
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279

You feel like you did it

Sports sports

376
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
So popular

377
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,847
That's why why why and other major path election in plantando I have competition though I have a annual competition

378
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
Most of the competition was sometimes weekly competition because

379
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Do you want to encourage livestreamer

00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Live streamers fast

381
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
The patrons and the poor thing as all get together to support and give him or her to win win the number one

382
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
For the vanity for the reports for the fame

383
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
So where is soccer popular

384
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
I think this

385
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
People Are People

386
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,751
Garfield is there a great team

387
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Get that Auto

388
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
I wonder if you got different reception

389
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
From Chinese audience

390
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Versus

391
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
Very different I think I think

392
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Usher

393
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,391
In developed World Rochester New York

394
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
When people watch this film they were like

395
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Wow

396
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Can this be real

397
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
This is so crazy

398
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
And

399
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,959
I think I think they look at it almost really like a black man because several reviewers

400
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
Mission

401
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Great dystopian

402
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
Near future Carlos story but I think for Chinese people

403
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
It's real because first of all will have heard of

404
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,575
Lie to me if you not haven't been a fan of Lie to Me

405
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Secondly

406
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,671
In terms of the motivation is a llama understandable for

407
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,999
For Chinese people to understand why the rich want to show off

408
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
By throwing money Ally

409
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
So awesome

410
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,279
So we're saying we have actually been seeing LifeStream kind of slowing down

411
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
Where is 4 video is rising fast

412
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Become the go-to medium for

413
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,703
Entertainment for the vast majority of Chinese mobile internet users

414
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Like going and I'm quite sure also

415
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Did you see this trend

416
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Call me when you were

417
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,735

418
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,319
You know I saw that taking a lot of this

419
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
That the buzz

420
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Phone for live streaming

421
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
So what you think

422
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
Anchovy

423
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Every night watching

424
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
I saw the Elsa population

425
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,991
A short video show videos

426
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Kind of funny

427
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
You can you can spell however much time you want

428
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
No longer is like show video

429
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Right now.

430
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
The popularity I think overshadow

431
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
Where is shareholder in

432
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,703
So we know how they're doing

433
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
I will guess the puppy. Overlap

434
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Queen why are you

435
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
And quite so

436
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Asbury

437
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Different

438
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Entertainment body wash

439
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:40,159
Yolanda / live streamers I follow actually went and started taking off their all yours in Christ

440
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:47,327
What impression have been getting working us China cross-border tag is that there's General sense

441
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,655
Amount of people in China that Tech is a Force for good

442
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
Where is the opposite of

443
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Do you agree with

444
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,591
Media impressions

445
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
Honestly I feel like

446
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
In the US

447
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,527
We tend to live in our own media Bubba right depends on which meter would follow

448
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Which Twitter

449
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
You know celebrities will follow

450
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,951
I feel like such a lot of the film coming out

451
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
About America

452
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
Oversee the majority of the internet consumers

453
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,399
Not as concerned as some of the media Elites about

454
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Kotoko the dangerous

455
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
Technology

456
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,591
Even though yes I'm the older mainstream media right now while talking about the Facebook privacy or

457
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,407
Nature of Technology

458
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Mainstream media

459
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
You know you can watch

460
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295

00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063

Watch cam girls you can watch

463
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
Like I recently talked to

464
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,767
Reporter who is doing a story writing a book about

465
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
America's largest Indian Premier luncheon topics

466
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
I think it's the same thing that you talked

467
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Show users

468
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
Their day-to-day they are not thinking as much about

469
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
But I definitely do agree

470
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
In the mainstream traditional media

471
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
In the US there's a lawn mower

472
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
Pause and reflection

473
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
About the compass rose technology

474
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,807
Can play in this society as compared to what's happening in China today

475
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
Bingo Wing China filming

476
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135

Morristown restaurants

478
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
People in Tennessee

479
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Can make their life

480
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
We'll make the world

481
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
Better absolutely I think I think China

482
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,496
You know this child is being discussed elsewhere. We don't have as much of a concern

483
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,336
That's not to say everybody don't

484
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Care about public General

485
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
And as I also like we are

486
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
More

487
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Open to embrace the latest the newest

488
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
Technology and I think

489
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Even right now right I mean

490
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Chinese people still believe in technology

491
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
Either like a i to hear this

492
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
Almost a bad name

493
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Inside of a superlative

Sufficient

503
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
You feel like texting

Exchanging

00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
Either

517
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,944
Middle school and college I was always interested in the humanities

518
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,552
Chinese song over traditional Chinese

519
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,904
Yeah your parents would

520
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
Expectation, not you

521
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744

Something better

525

Something stable

526
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,680
With a better is a better future so that's why

527
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
I decided to do biology

528
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
The science

529
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,568
And then button does not satisfy a lot size

530
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Emotionally satisfying

531
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,456
Bill I didn't know what else to do Chinese immigrants

532
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992

00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
Business law or medicine

534
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
So I picked

535
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
Business because this is the most flexible

536
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,512
I asked you to Love talk I lost it I started off as a product manager

537

To do it

548
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
I feel like I'm getting farther and farther away from the creative

549
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
I love to get my hands dirty

550
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:17,664

So yeah I've been

556
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Certain point

557
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
I just have to ask my question

558
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
Entrepreneur launch my company become a multi-millionaire first before I do what I like or do I want to do what I like

00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
Like first time you were back in

Probably.

567
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,000

Into the

571
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,752
Ali Alibaba group I was managing the technology

572
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Operation

573
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,848
No I mean

574
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,432
I took a year off during filmmaking and then I join that you coming

575
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Start up

576
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
And I didn't go anywhere so and then

577
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
Because I really wanted

578
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,440
People were already talking about

579
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,792
Chinese internet company because the first wave the Baidu and the Soul who

580
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
You can always argue do coffee

581
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,192
It's copy to China by the body

582
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
Wanted to understand the culture

583
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
What makes Alibaba

584
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
Crop

585
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
Oyster takeaway

586
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,944
I don't think

587
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
The only culture is so strong

588
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
I personally don't think

589
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
It's right for everyone but

590
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
I mean I consider myself still

591
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
Loco loco loco

592
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,816
The culture what are talking about does the clothes camaraderie

593
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
Essex

594
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
6

595
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,336
So I like that

596
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,432
Everybody was battling Giacomo is the general right

597
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
We are trying to

598
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:34,624
You guys are the truths that's all

599
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,952
To the battle

600
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
Abaddon some other people

601
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,840
Different

602
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
TripAdvisor

603
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
So that was

604
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
Great different intensive basically

605
00:26:54,336 --> 00:27:00,480
Disadvantage of a typical Western internet company trying to expand in China

606
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Whereas you have a lot of

607
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Great industry know how

608
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,928
You have a suck very successful business model in the US

609
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
How to adapter

610
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Indo China Market

611
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Where is

612
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
Fat movies

613
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Do you want to replicate the success story

614
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
In a different Market

615
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,776
Or do you want to create something that was always something we struggle

616
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
It was

617
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,104
Great learning experience but

618
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Challenger

619
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Cushing and Chino

620
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Falcon

621
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,296
I think if I could change

622
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Was that party

623
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Yeah

624
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:45,280
Competing I mean it was hard

625
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
China back then

626
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
The two biggest comfortable look that was

627
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,704
Sitrep because it has both hotel booking as well as Council reviews

628
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
As well as

629
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,312
Qunar

630
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,896
Hotel beta at the hotel room

631
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Hi sweetie ice Adele

632
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Simple analysis

633
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
Chinese founder

634
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Who stole

635
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
First Auto

636
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Workout for year 2

637
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Hated

638
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
This is so slow

639
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
And not fast-moving enough

640
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
Have they come out and do their next order

641
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
The successful startup

642
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Super hot

643
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
You should have told me that because I was thinking through your startup

644
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
So are you still playing with you

645
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,720
No because

646
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,328
Whenever I travel back to China out to the US that you'll equation always say welcome

647
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Welcome back to the US

648
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:59,264
Like whenever I say I'm a filmmaker I feel always feel like I'm the Frog

649
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,920
You know I like

650
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
I feel like I can say I'm a film

651
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
So what's the next

652
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
So we can expect

653
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
What are you working

654
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,184
Netflix original

655
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
Sure it's a 39 minutes

656
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,024
It's called family

657
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
It's about me having kids through surrogacy

658
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
In the US

659
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
And take my kids

660
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,472
Kotoko Modern Family back to China

661
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
Essays my traditional Chinese pirate

662
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,128
Watch on leaves early film

663
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,200
Wedding Banquet is kind of similar to guys a comedy with a lot

664
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
I saw your own

665
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Stop my old stories

666
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
So you will see me

667
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
You'll hear my voice

668
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Do you finally essay

669
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Inspiration the model

670
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Or something

671
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,256
Obviously

672
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
Castes

673
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Truly

674
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,632
Chinese buy also has Universal appeal because

675
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,936
You focus so much on the human emotion

676
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
With nowhere near

677
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
But is this

678
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
The same color

679
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
We're really appreciative of

680
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
People who can tell the China story

681
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,248
In English to the greater World in a way that's

682
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Authentic

683
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
True to

684
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,136
So in that way I think 9

685
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
Sex and what you're doing or

686
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Our kind of

687
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Thank you

688
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,048
So as someone who have

689
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
Had a lot of dramatic

690
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Careershift

691
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
I wonder how you develop

692
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
The self-knowledge

693
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Uno

694
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,752
What you're good at and what you should be doing because I think a lot of her audience

695
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,312
Are younger people trying to figure out

696
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
What their next steps

697
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Springfield

698
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
What did you do

699
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Help you find your

700
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
That's a tough one

701
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
A lot of times you have to be

702
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Almost stupid

703
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,472
To stop burn.

704
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,080
I mean despite what everybody else tells you you're going to fail you have to have that

705
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Strong

706
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,664
If I put in a bad word

707
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,576
Start doing

708
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,880
Rather than thinking about it like when I

709
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Star

710
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Wanted

711
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
What is a mixer um I just

712
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,560
Start writing screenplay

713
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
Read some books and started making

714
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Short films

715
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
I watch a lot of the old title loan in that way

716
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
I did it

717
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Like I said earlier

718
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Long time

719
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Before

720
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
I had my last film which is

721
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Is the road to fame

722
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
That

723
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,248
When I saw the film was not permitted on the festival

724
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Cause I knew

725
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
I could do this

726
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
I knew my next one will be even better

727
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
So you need to be able to get your hands dirty to

728
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Before you know

729
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
You can be

730
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
Do this for time

731
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
So

732
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
How have you figured out if

733
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
4 documentary

734
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,520
No it's very hard because

735
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:16,640
When I first started doing documentary full-time every once awhile put my business hat on

736
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
I'll be thinking about

737
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
The ROI of all the hours and put it in for my cat

738
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,368
Optimize this process

739
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
To make it faster

740
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
I mean

741
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,328
If you think about it documentary film by Nature has limited market up here

742
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
Just like

743
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Certain types of writing

744
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:42,496
So there's no business model per say I'm not doing this

745
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Right now

746
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,824
How to really try to make a lot of money

747
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
Ideally

748
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,200
What's you making nothing on me happy enough reputation all the people

749
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,736
Will commission what to do filmed

750
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
HBO

751
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,600
And Netflix and then that's how you can make a decent living

752
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
Kind of in transition

753
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,976
I'm thinking about

754
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
On the other way

755
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Document

756
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
China commercial

757
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
Talking to me right now I miss her

758
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
So hands I know you're really enjoyed

759
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Hear from your perspective

760
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
What do you like about it

761
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
Barclays personal

762
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,272
Because he was ugly

763
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Pennywise

764
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
Just seeing the story being

765
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Play It Again

766
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
And see how the characters are in it

767
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
Different but familiar

768
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
This is something

769
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Easy for me for me to relate

770
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Secondly I think

771
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
Amazing job

772
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
Of showing the

773
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Plexaderm

774
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
Struggling

775
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
Explain to the westerners

776
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,240
How it works

777
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Yeah with a film is every

778
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm so alive

779
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,384
I think if we have more time will probably want to go into how it is

780
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
It's very similar

781
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,504
Professional sports in other form of payment work in the western world

782
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
What developer around the country

783
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,112
Around the world how there's a lot of similarities

784
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
I would love to

785
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Odyssey

786
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Wow

787
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
Go through some of that

788
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Later

789
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
The other format

790
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
To show how he sees a 2

791
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
Guess it's just a lot of things I saw in a film

792
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Baby unique

793
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
Play Chinese for the value so extremely Universal

794
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,008
Denso Universal aspect that's not as obvious to

795
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
Westerners who watches

796
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
For the first time

797
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
It was so shocked by the details

798
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
That lady

799
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Forget

800
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,944
That there is a universal connection

801
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,248
As well and not something that I think.

802
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,576
I am sure will Howard tomorrow West 2nd of topic material

803
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648
You lived in China on the ground 480

804
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
This reminds you of

805
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464
Like what you saw

806
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:48,192
Tennyson point where is a country with a rising middle class but also

807
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,008
Are Creepypastas kind of Left Behind as well

808
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,336
And they wanted to see a part of this progress and movement

809
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:59,712
And my pretties we know why why he gives them a chance to do that however little money they make

810
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,832
They using that in a way that give us a lift themselves their life a lot more meaning

811
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,136
And the part about connection is

812
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Is Grambling University

813
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
Specifically Chinese

814
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,256
But the desired

815
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
It was a great way great work

816
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,120
These are to be connected to be meaningful

817
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
Prepartum movement

818
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Extremely

819
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
And become popular in the US I said you were to have its call you to

820
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:34,016
I mean the login never took off in China phone virus reason

821
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
Took the Roses login in China

822
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,672
Into the celebrities on YouTube the type of content

823
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
They produce

824
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
How do we lie on

825
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,864
Stouts controversy to generate popular in China

826
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
YouTube

827
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
Almost

828
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Fail

829
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Amortization

830
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Should the weight of whiteheads

831
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,872
If you have other set interesting broadcasters on YouTube

832
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Advertising

833
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
I see you was wrong around the world who willing

834
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Google pay

835
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
For additional evaluation services

836
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
It just that

837
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Did not

838
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
Do as good a job

839
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
At the courthouse

840
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,024
And one thing that will be

841
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Hopefully

842
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
They learned about that both us and China

843
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
MPL companies go by services

844
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
That we can go truly

845
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Between

846
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
More classical

847
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
So the concept of nine

848
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
XSP

849
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Snooze alarm

850
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
96 ICU

851
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Jack Ma.

852
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
I just released the article

853
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,296
About what he thinks about the phenomena so I was wondering if someone who lived

854
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
In both us

855
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
China

856
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,880
Deeply what's your

857
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Perspective on

858
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Idaho

859
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,256
I don't know if we should call it ours or

860
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Mentality

861
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
This phenomenon

862
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
Do you work done at 6

863
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:57,728
Around the Clock

864
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
I do not have sex

865
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,592
I think the reality is that most startups are doing

866
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Right

867
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,176
Whether you're the startups are in the US or in China

868
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:11,296
If you want your starter to succeed or anybody was doing anything this will truly passionate about

869
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
NSX

870
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,440
I remember when I was working Alibaba what it was lunch in Sugar bizarre China

871
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
We were all working on it

872
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,304
Nobody complained about it

873
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,096
A part of something great

874
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
You want to work 9

875
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,728
I think right now what China discussion

876
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
Is Bali in China

877
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
10 from 2

878
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,128
The true reason why we're having discussion in China

879
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
What is

880
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
I don't

881
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,064
Potential know the younger generation I don't feel that the younger generation

882
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
That's one

883
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
Set Ali is

884
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
A lot of the internet companies in China

885
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
In the house

886
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
Alibaba tencent

887
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
Established companies already

888
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Establish company

889
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,144
Country is hard to call today the startup culture.

890
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,704
Cohesiveness submission definition

891
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,752
Get people excited

892
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
22906

893
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,872
Observing Seneca Valley as well right

894
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,576
I think well in instead of trying to enforce or ask

895
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,648
I need the HR to do a better job in Tennessee

896
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
Buying to the punch of the working

897
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
Mickey's fun for people wanting to do it

898
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
Want to do

899
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Company

900
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
I've worked in

901
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,592
Probably six or seven different companies in my in my car

902
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
UMBC alone

903
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
CVS Medford

904
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Parlor

905
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
In

906
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,040
I think a lot of people think that they're

907
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
Just working in order to live

908
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
So

909
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
About work-life balance

910
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Complete Arsenal

911
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
But when I

912
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
For the things I do

913
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
I don't just do it for mine

914
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Employer

915
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
I'm doing for myself

916
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
And I feel I'm sure you can

917
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
Set to do filmmaking for yourself

918
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
You'll get a story you want to tell this mission one achieve

919
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
Personal growth

920
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
You want to get to

921
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,128
Is a Personal Agenda and viewpoints

922
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
You want to come

923
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,736
And for all of us who are Multicultural with living multiple cities

924
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
How do you tell something

925
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
That's uniquely you

926
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
Quite a bit of Chinese elements

927
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,720
Yet at the same time if you want to make a universal sound people get it don't see you're weird

928
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,000
I think that wow

929
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
There's something deeper

930
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
Is something I can learn from

931
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Sukhumi is never about work-life balance

932
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Is always about work-life

933
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
Cuz I don't treat work as work

934
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
A cheetah work as my life calling

935
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,056
What is a life calling

936
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Why would you be bounced away from

937
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,640
Retreat at the jobs to make money

938
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
You don't bite me meaning what you do

939
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
Quite frankly you should be doing at all

940
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,296
You should do something that you truly truly truly

941
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
So you don't find it something that you have to fight against

942
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
So would that want to remove

943
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
To the last

944
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
Part of the interview which is around a

945
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,768
Quick fire questions you can just say the first thing that comes

946
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Remind

947
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
The first one is whose entrepreneur you admire the most

948
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
Ponemah

949
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
Professionally

950
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Well mannered

951
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Internet company in China

952
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
As someone who worked at Alibaba

953
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,040
