Thanks thanks having me

85
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
So first question for you

86
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Starbucks

87
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
What about the compass

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Tell us about me

89
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
NYU

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Cool

91
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,112
First came back to China actually had no idea what else

92
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,464
I was like thinking about maybe joining a company or like a coup start a company

93
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
Looking for opportunities

94
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,096
And because I was working at or else we do a lot alike and have Frost

95
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,936
So I was looking at and financial which does a lot alike

96
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Credit analyzing insta

97
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
And I realize that they don't

98
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
Could a lot of Versailles on their recruiting

99
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
Site like Curry side

100
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,432
So that got me interested because in the US

101
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
Call me they all have like a really fancy career site

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,112
I went out to her to like talk with Bunkhouse HRT Post in China

103
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,208
And I realize they have some real pinpoints like besides a career page

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,327
Such a slack collaboration between HR and their hiring managers and the interviewees

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,655
And also they have problem like liking all the talent back

106
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,519
And lastly they have problem analyzing their recruiting data

107
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
So I found those pain points are real and then I looked at the market there's not like Rudy koopor I Solutions all there

108
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
So I decided to build while myself

109
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,855
So has it always been your plan to return to China or did it happen organically

110
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
I think more organically it was not life

111
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
Swirl defended I think

112
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,583
Overall I think I was thinking about like come back to China documentary about life

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,447
I still haven't Wells like feeling old I feel like I learned a bit like in the US already

114
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
Like come back and see what's going on

115
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
I guess not like Rudy planet

116
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,919
So when you decide to start mocha you already come back

117
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
China

118
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
This problem that you

119
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
You just mentioned it wasn't like

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
Understood that problem why you were in the US

121
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,439
Yeah so I was anxious in the US I see all of financing happening

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
I know the market

123
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Is Rihanna

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
But I just don't know what's going on there

125
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
And how this

126
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,935
Fear of missing out I feel like om light in San Francisco everything's going well

127
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
I just don't know what are the opportunities in China I'm like trying to understand in the US but never seen the

128
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
Darling just so different so I decided to take a leap of faith

129
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
Not knowing anything and come back

130
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
And then like looks

131
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Simple problems to solve

132
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
Originally actually gave myself 6 months

133
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
How to discover what you do

134
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,183
Actually only took me like two months to fund ideomotor

135
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Oh wow

136
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
The same feeling I think that fomo is universal to all Chinese students who study abroad these days

137
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,215
Read out a news on your WeChat moments in like all your friends doing interesting things

138
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Yes

139
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
So what were some of the challenges you

140
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Effaced coming back

141
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Attorney

142
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Did you

143
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
You know feel like

144
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
The time away

145
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Actually

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Cookie further away from what

147
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
What's going on in China and really understand the market or were there that you could bring back

148
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
More positive or negative

149
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
It's a really good question I think there's positive and I think there's some also like a non- but like I guess things that

150
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:33,471
I need to improve more I guess I'll start with the things that learning LOL that help me in the US

151
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,055
I think the one thing that I learned in college was sort of not working

152
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
I think I was

153
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Lucky to join

154
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,687
Business attorney in Berkeley Hills, Dallas ins Inc

155
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
Supervisor in Siler no not working

156
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
Actually really important that I think I'd learn some of the

157
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Excuse

158
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,463
So help me to know how to network and that goes to the downside of being a sort of sea turtle were returning

159
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
Is because I have no connection

160
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
I don't know who to call about to discover problem

161
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
But I do have the skills to not work

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
Childlike ask my friend okay I'll make this intro or like okay talk to this person and then get that person to introduce me to

163
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
To another person

164
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
So do you have the skills budget

165
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Cuz I don't have that resource

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
But I feel like

167
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
My education in the US really help me that I have asked you to learn how this feel to not work those things are

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
More valuable and ghost longer-term

169
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,695
The resource heart rate hinders me

170
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Recruiting

171
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
So I have no connection in China

172
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
I don't know who are the reliable

173
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
Coworkers or colleagues

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
To hire Sebastian

175
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Florida

176
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
In the beginning which was really hard to like recruit as I gradually to view my network now I think I know more

177
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
China

178
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
So you eventually could over

179
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Overcome that challenge just by working

180
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Hard at it

181
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
But it wasn't easy

182
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
It was not easy at first

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Year of mocha

184
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
I probably interviewed 500 HR

185
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
I will go on to the recruiting website as send my resume

186
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
And they will ask me to

187
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,631
Come interview for positions and they all say oh actually

188
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
Ideas to have this pain points and then start the car

189
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Workstation that way

190
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
About creative

191
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Yeah

192
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Call Sol

193
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
If you look at

194
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
The market in China

195
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
Force a sand cloud

196
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
How would you

197
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Define

198
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
What stage of the market

199
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
We're in in China

200
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
And you've seen the US

201
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
So how do you contrast

202
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,255
U.s. I think in China the South Marcus really early

203
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
I mean in China

204
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
It's been that way like there software companies

205
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Are there mostly on premise

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,727
The sauce babe I think it just started in

207
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
I guess

208
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Mm

209
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
14 or 15 years so it's Rudy

210
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
I think it's rude in you in early

211
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
Whenever I go back to the US and also going to introduce me to like those 80s companies who are in the

212
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Similar space to us

213
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,903
And I talked to them I feel like the 80s which stands for applicant tracking system

214
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
And that's what we do

215
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,839
I feel like 80s in the u.s. is like a commodity like everybody use it like and they understand the value of

216
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
But now in China

217
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,959
How to educate people and even for senior-level

218
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
Like when we talked to some CEOs they won't even

219
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
I understand the battery behind a soft

220
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
And it would take time oh like

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
You can really increase the efficiency you can really collect all your data and do your business in a more data-driven way

222
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Doesn't the Marcus barrier

223
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
What kind of challenges

224
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Has that presented given

225
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Flea market

226
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
You're in an early Market

227
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
You can't just rely on the fact that

228
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Your customers going to

229
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
What you doing

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
Budget Suites

231
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
You sell how you deal with that

232
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,471
Esl couple challenges I think it goes three ways

233
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
The first challenge would be

234
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
IRacing forum

235
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,103
Most of the Masters in China they have never have sex

236
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
Embossing Enterprise

237
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Companies

238
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,783
So most of them don't see Darkseid or they don't think it's a big opportunity

239
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
No reason found

240
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,391
It's challenging in Enterprise space ordinance a space

241
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
Plus number one

242
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Who is recruiting Talent

243
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,303
Because there's no successful SAS business in China

244
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,375
Like in the US you can say all of their Salesforce there

245
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Workday

246
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
In China there's no search

247
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Big companies

248
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
Intolerance will not come to us

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Brother they will go through like

250
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,919
Alibaba or they will go to like tencent weibo a WeChat whatever

251
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
So the Second Challenge will be Talent

252
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
I guess La so you will be acquiring customer

253
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
It takes time to meditate

254
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
And also the willingness to

255
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
Pay for them is relatively low but I mean

256
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
In the market and we see it

257
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Growing tremendous

258
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
So those are the three

259
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
So who was your first customer

260
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
And how did you find them and convince

261
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
So there's a really cool story about this

262
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,311
I was not even ready to launch the Porter Airline Commercial Way

263
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,383
So it was April 2000

264
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
16

265
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
I got a call from a recruiter

266
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
Who was saying okay try the portal gun for like a week

267
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
By and later on I was like we were in beta

268
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
How did you discover us

269
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
It was actually

270
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
We were posting a recruiting post

271
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Politechnika

272
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Discussion board

273
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,143
How to recruit people on that technique award

274
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,543
PCO according to the description of the company this is something you should do that I want you

275
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
So he called me up and then like you ask me

276
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
Porta introduction like PPT warlike stuff

277
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,319
Nothing like I have no life introduction stuff and then I made that were nine and send to him

278
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
And then after mom's with clothes deal that's our first customer

279
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
That's awesome and also probably gave you an indication like

280
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Okay there's a mark

281
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Yes def

282
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Tara Strong

283
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
Okay now you mention one of your big challenges

284
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Recruiting a team

285
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Yeah

286
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
But you're over a hundred people today

287
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Yasso

288
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,127
When we invested you were 20 or 30 people you've grown by over a hundred head since

289
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
If we invested

290
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,199
Do you eventually overcome that issue

291
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Have you done that

292
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
And what are some of the tactics you've used

293
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
To get the best people

294
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
When you're competing with the likes of

295
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
Ali Baba & Company

296
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
Still Remains challenging but I think

297
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Some techniques

298
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
That I can share

299
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
I guess one thing is ask for reference

300
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
So I guess you read this

301
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Color blocking

302
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
Some Like Us block or like maybe quora

303
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
So you ask someone you think it's very smart

304
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Ask

305
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Who would be the person who

306
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Kiwi refer

307
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
And then talk to that person

308
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
And then ask for another referral

309
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
And that person will probably be pretty good

310
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
So I used that technique

311
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
All the time through my network

312
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,231
And also I guess one thing is to just be very prejudiced

313
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Youjizz

314
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
Option 1

315
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Find a talent that's really good you just

316
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
Stay in touch and always try

317
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,263
He will feel oh you are very sincere about it and also you are very persistent about

318
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,103
So over the time as the common growing in a positive way

319
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,431
He will eventually even though it in the early days it

320
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
It's really risky and later on you'll see the program

321
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,807
Okay sounds like for you recruiting has been very person

322
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Yeah you are out there you're

323
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Yourself

324
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Hand to hand combat training

325
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Candidates

326
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,535
How about this time hundred and thirty people 150

327
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
AP poll

328
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
You know our experiences

329
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
It gets harder for

330
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Baidu CEO

331
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Or founder

332
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
In this case

333
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
To be centrally involved

334
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Every new

335
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
I'm coming in so

336
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
How you going to scale that

337
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
That's a very good question

338
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
Two ways to solve that orlick not like

339
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Entirety but like to help

340
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
The situation the first one I guess is

341
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
You have to have a rude astrology chart

342
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,391
It's really important to have recruiters who are dedicated on

343
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Recruiting

344
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Especially when you're growing your booty

345
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
So we have this mistake

346
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Earlier this year in the first

347
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Half of this year

348
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
We had only one recruiters

349
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
And we didn't know how

350
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Heart it will be like a recruiter

351
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Shooting

352
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
We saw one person will be nice

353
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,103
Banal like we realized that's not the case and we not have like four weeks

354
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
Liquid Rainbow the team and now it's really helping us

355
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
To move the funnel and like move the needle

356
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,831
The first answer will be having a really strong HR team and recruiting team

357
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
I guess the second part is

358
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Culturally by example

359
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
I would go out of my way to hire mydirect

360
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
And very persistent

361
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,495
Shows a good example to the other hiring managers they will go out of their way to her there.

362
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,103
A lasting having that sort of Paddy and culture in The Colony

363
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
The Harry is not only the recruiters

364
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Problems but also the hiring manager

365
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Job is Rudy critical

366
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,319
And I'm guessing you use your own product as well right

367
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,951
That must help totally I think it helped a lot and I chew we were successful to

368
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,279
ReDiscover some of the calendar we interviewed earlier

369
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
Have them onboard

370
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,167
Because when we were only like about like 30 people people are like scared of drawing

371
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Early startup

372
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,519
But we still keep their record in the system and we have all the

373
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Interview comments

374
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,431
Some recruiter join us they would look into our system see all earlier

375
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Why don't we

376
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Team against

377
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
And we actually close to

378
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
The talents

379
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
Do you hire a lot of Chinese overseas

380
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Attorneys or do you prefer more Loco

381
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
We actually don't have

382
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
Too many overseer attorneys

383
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,935
We do we have a preference we only look at the skill sets

384
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,287
But I guess I'm the manager level I personally I guess

385
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Referral to have like Little Tokyo

386
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Because we have

387
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
Easier for them to recruit their team

388
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Rather than like us we have

389
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Do the not working

390
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
All over again

391
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
No eyes you're even going out your

392
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
You team have you hired some

393
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Senior level folks

394
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Stoli

395
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
What's the market like in

396
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
In China for

397
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Super senior

398
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
Talent in art

399
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
Using the same techniques to find those p

400
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
People as well or do you have to

401
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Do certain

402
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
What kind of executive searches

403
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Or or this kind

404
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Define the right

405
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
I think the techniques

406
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,383
Are the same but I guess one singing I guess I noticed it's different from the u.s. to Telemark the senior Italian Market

407
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
It is

408
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
In the US as a senior talent to care about Act

409
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
Understand

410
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Don't understand that much

411
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
And I think the reason behind it was

412
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
Because not many people have made money

413
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Equity

414
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
They were mostly just earning cash

415
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Sew in

416
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Chinatown Market

417
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Senior leaders

418
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
I think have a

419
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Relatively

420
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Before understanding

421
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Alexia

422
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
Actually like last night I was trying to escape

423
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,591
Play my offer to a senior leadership like technical it leadership role

424
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
I am Beijing even though

425
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
He has been working for I think more than 10 years

426
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
And he still cannot really understand how I actually works how fast can work

427
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Well

428
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
And it's a technical leader yeah I think that's

429
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Actually there's some similarities

430
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
He's with us equities

431
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
Is a difficult concept

432
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
To convey value

433
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Chicken day

434
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Engineering

435
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Yeah but there is

436
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
There's more of a culture of people knowing that you can make a lot of money if your company does well in your neck

437
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
So

438
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
That piece

439
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Yeah in China

440
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
So as you

441
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Think about your own

442
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Life

443
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
So far

444
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
We talked a little

445
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
What about the fact that

446
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
You were in the US

447
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,719
Came back to China do you think that's making you a better leader

448
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
And

449
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
If you had to do it all over again with

450
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Make the same decisions or

451
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Try something different

452
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,495
To the first question I sing you didn't make me a better leader in a lot of ways and I'll come back to that later

453
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
August 2nd car show make a different Choice that's hard to say maybe I will stay a little bit of

454
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247
Do just what I'll have more I guess more management skills

455
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,879
STI guest Coral growing bigger and have gas more experience my help

456
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,719
Real life looking backwards but it's hard to say whether I will make the same decision

457
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
I guess

458
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
To the first question like Hall

459
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,631
Does my experience in the USA, Education sort of made me a better leader

460
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
I guess in the US

461
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
People value innovation lot

462
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,543
And people trying to sing about long-term how do we create value

463
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Yeah

464
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
So have you had turnover in your company or have most of

465
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Date who you want

466
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
We did have some time

467
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,135
So why do you think that's happening in China One thing I

468
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Observe is that

469
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
The war for talent

470
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
As severe as it is in the US Maybe

471
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Even more

472
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
And so you do CP

473
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
People picking up and leaving

474
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
Is the fomo thing by

475
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
I'm trying to find the next great

476
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
How do you put

477
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Prevent your

478
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
Employee based from thinking about their next job and focusing on what they need

479
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Help help mocha

480
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,991
Yeah that's a really tough question and I think probably a lot of Founders have that same challenges

481
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Couple techniques

482
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
That I think it's important first

483
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:10,463
Higher leaders that's really charming and that they know how to lead the team they can leave

484
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
Have the folks under them

485
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Watching

486
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,863
Car the same time but also feeling like they are learning new stuff

487
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,959
Leaders who are softball about like training people making people grow

488
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Bus number 1

489
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
Have like really good managers

490
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
And I guess the number 2

491
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Thing to do is

492
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
You have to swap a swirl mark

493
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Surprise to them

494
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,735
We have seen that presents growing and he's making contributions

495
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
I'll make sure she's also compensated

496
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
So

497
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
Those are probably the only two things that sink

498
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
To help the sea

499
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
How about culture

500
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
You guys intentionally build your culture at MOCA and if so like

501
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
What is youku

502
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Important

503
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
I think that is to

504
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Attracting great talent

505
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,447
Retaining that I think that that's a really important

506
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
We really care about culture in the

507
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
Very early days

508
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Me and my co-founder we would

509
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
Right on like what's a cock

510
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,919
Overtime will actually come back to

511
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
I see how is that still write how sure that we want

512
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Animoca we have six

513
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
Es6 items

514
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
First its ownership

515
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
Second act

516
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
Sword will be be open sync different

517
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
And customer-centric and lastly will be tended as

518
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
Is critical to maintain people in the company

519
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Wechat

520
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Who likes rock

521
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,519
Would you buy with buy with real hands

522
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
And I feel like

523
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,175
The younger generation of Chinese Talent they would enjoy that lie because our company's really transparent

524
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
And they don't find that somewhere else

525
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,295
So that definitely helps us to retain Talent

526
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,391
Because our, states very transparent people get loud soldiers

527
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
They feel safe they know like what's going on they know how much money are left in Bank

528
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
They know what the revenue is growing really fast so that's

529
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
I think that's a

530
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
Nike outlet does that make it unique in China to have

531
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
All hands

532
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
Frequently and

533
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
A lot of transparent

534
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Ncn

535
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:03,103
In theory it sounds good but have you ended up having some unintended consequences

536
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Stop being so.

537
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Transparent open

538
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
Do people leave cuz they get scared cuz they have too much info

539
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,295
Some people got scared first but then they got used to

540
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,623
That's something that I found very fascinating is

541
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
The power of coffee

542
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
So I have a du-rag

543
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,024
Poor who is Boris m1978 Associates

544
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
40 years old still a lot of habits are really stubborn

545
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
She is not that open mind

546
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,960
After joining the company for half a year

547
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
She started real life

548
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,800
She is changing online

549
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
To ask me alright like it's been like

550
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
A year in motor and I am like so I lost

551
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
I feel like I'm changed but I don't know why there is positive or negative

552
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
Because you're becoming more old

553
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,464
You talk with your husband more over a you talk with your colleagues moreover

554
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,024
You just become more happier than your last job

555
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Because in her last job

556
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,864
People are not supposed to say things Pub

557
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
They're supposed to say goose in him publicly but not basking

558
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
And so

559
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,800
Chuhai some of negative emotions which makes

560
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
For supper I say

561
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,896
So I felt like the power of culture is really strong

562
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
You're actually part of the

563
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Post 90

564
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:19,136
Generation of Founders are those born after 1990 so I wonder how do you manage people who are older the

565
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,048
That's a good question I think one thing I learned there's some principles in management that I enjoyed

566
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
A summarizing time to

567
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
One principal I really like is

568
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
There's only one way to lead is lead by example

569
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
So I act the way that I want my leaders to

570
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,616
So I would like use the same standard to them as well

571
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,968
Legis another thing to manage them or like so I'll leave them as

572
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Personal caring

573
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
I do like wow wow a lot

574
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
I think some Chinese companies that don't do what I want

575
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:57,792
But I feel like one was really personal time that you can show you care that person Alot Like personally or their fan

576
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
Xiaomi

577
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Heard lights

578
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Career growth and stuff

579
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
So those are some techniques

580
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
That sounds great

581
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Yeah

582
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
Okay so I get to see you in the US pretty frequently you definitely come to the US quite a bit and I can see your network

583
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,408
Working skills at work

584
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
You do a good job of

585
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
Building out you know kind of a

586
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Broad

587
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Cast a wide net

588
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Have people that you've gotten to

589
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Danelle

590
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
Who are in one way or another helpful

591
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Why have you done that

592
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,488
Why you spend time in the US what do you get out of that and

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
Is it something you recommend other

594
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Other founders

595
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Here in China

596
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,656
I totally would recommend I think it's actually in sauce

597
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,240
The business librarian we're just like years behind the US March

598
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:44,384
So those Founders were senior leaders who in the SAS business in the US they have seen

599
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,784
All over they know where the pitfalls they know where they should emphasize where they should spend their money where

600
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
You should focus

601
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,392
So like talking was them really helps me like a voice on pfos

602
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
So I definitely recommend

603
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
Anakin like maybe gave one

604
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Concrete example

605
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
It's like recently we were thinking about life food in pasta

606
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,984
And the Sioux talking with senior leaders are like service like platform-as-a-service

607
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,104
Service because they tore down the row like when we serve Enterprise they will have customisation

608
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,456
So when cop with senior leaders at workday servicenow SLC

609
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,760
Do you understand how they do their pasta

610
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
And that would help us

611
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Astro Boy sound

612
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,672
Define the people are generally pretty open when you

613
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
I think so I think so

614
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,912
So when you first started the company did you model yourself after any American company or it was a

615
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,216
More of an idea that came

616
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Do you

617
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,384
I think it's a deer came to me like a mansion like how that you came I didn't really play it but like after that

618
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,992
I'll be okay my daddy look into the US market to co house market in the US

619
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
Is it like a viable

620
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:02,208
So I did, he's like Greenhouse lever who are really hot compress back there like 2015 when I started more

621
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,536
So those are so I'll be coming that way we're very similar

622
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,864
So thinking a little bit about mocha longer

623
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,144
Termite you guys are growing

624
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Super fast

625
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
Which were really happy about is a shareholder

626
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
How do you keep that going

627
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
And

628
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
What were some of the

629
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Concerns you have the

630
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
Keep you up at night

631
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,384
That really fast

632
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
Yeah I think how do I keep

633
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
Fast rolls I think it's Italian

634
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,296
I think Thailand's really really important

635
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,368
I think we do have a good strategy going up to the market

636
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Because the Chinese market

637
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Has a huge demand for

638
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
HR software

639
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,792
But the thing is peutinger HR software is not easy job

640
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
Biggest challenge or what keeps me up

641
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Tinnitus

642
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
The palace

643
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
How do you spell icing like

644
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
62/70 time recording my life senior leaders

645
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
So that will be

646
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
MocoSpace

647
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Challenge am I

648
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,408
And you know it as you think forward right if

649
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,712
If you're able to continue to grow effective

650
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
What is success

651
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
How will you know when you can tell I've done what I wanted to do

652
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Yeah I guess

653
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,440
The division of the companies to empower companies

654
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
Through a chart

655
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,792
Doggy and we are going to roll out more and more offerings

656
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
After recording we're going to probably do onboarding

657
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Organization management

658
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,960
And the payroll and all that

659
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Performance and stuff

660
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
So similar to like work days off

661
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:27,456
Midterm Milestone will be like Sorel 4-year will heat a scale that we are able to IPO in the US

662
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
Blessing for years

663
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
I guess that's just a small step

664
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,368
Are you for years and later on we're just going to continue to growing

665
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
Add more product offerings

666
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
To the

667
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Teleport

668
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,256
Have you guys added new products yet

669
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
I'm your man 80s

670
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,096
Strikeline so we haven't added like

671
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
Holding you like suit yet but we did a delay I like Fisher Witchwood priest robot

672
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Black pretty big

673
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
Honda Talon release

674
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
So how hard is it

675
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
How to add a new product

676
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,248
I think it's pretty hard especially icing in China

677
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Cuz I think.

678
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,088
One thing that's different from the US and China is

679
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
In China will you have really

680
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
Have no good life chords

681
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
Enterprise portal

682
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,792
In China because there's no successful

683
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
Products like Enterprise

684
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
A porta

685
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,704
So it's really hard to get talents we have to train our talent

686
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
We will have to tell them how do you think long-term

687
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
How do you say no to customization needs

688
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Right yeah

689
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
Adidas the challenge

690
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,432
Unlike video enterprise software

691
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
Have you thought about trying to

692
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Bringing

693
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Being a product managers who have

694
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Experience in the US Navy

695
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Armoire

696
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
Used to that kind of environment

697
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Or

698
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
I don't know how you yourself may be trying to

699
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Get some more

700
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Connections to

701
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
2 product

702
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Really smart product

703
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
People in the US

704
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,888
Yeah definitely I think that would definitely help end

705
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:54,752
That sucks you want the reason why all that was in the US 2 months ago was trying to recruit

706
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,288
Technical leaders

707
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
I think that would help. It just

708
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
It's really hard to recruit people

709
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
From the US

710
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:05,248
Because normally those senior leaders they will have already have families

711
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,088
Yeah and it's really hard for them to move back to China now when they are

712
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
Translate stable

713
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
Situation

714
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,000
It will be helpful and we will look forward to have some like

715
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,024
Senior leadership

716
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
Or like maybe just Junior people

717
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
From the US to join

718
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Import I in engineering

719
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
When and how will you go global

720
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:29,312
That's a tough question we've been thinking about it we sing the US Marcus very interested

721
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,152
But I think our products do not at the stage of maturity

722
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
I still like it raining very fast

723
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
So maybe

724
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
325 years

725
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,320
Hey sweetheart

726
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
The loud house

727
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,160
Sales team marketing team will be

728
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
Big Challenge

729
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
I have to

730
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,304
I guess how the China Market thong first and then maybe singing bother you

731
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
Global

732
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,912
Okay so for now it's focus on the China Market in China

733
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Yes

734
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
Okay I need that.

735
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
That makes a lot of sense

736
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
It's hard enough for companies

737
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Mature markets

738
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
And you're really in a

739
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
In a market that

740
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Sounds like you have a lot of work

741
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Keep growing it

742
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
The good news is

743
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
So yuan

744
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Can get very big

745
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
Just focusing

746
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
China Inn

747
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Expanded

748
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
New products that

749
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Give you the opportunity

750
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
He really likes me

751
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Quite a bit,

752
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
Yeah so you guys

753
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
That the metrics

754
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
Companies use in the US

755
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Serta mattresses

756
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Both internally and

757
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
And for like the financial Market

758
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Investors

759
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
Pretty well-known

760
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
And you guys have adopted a lot of

761
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,848
Do you think that that makes you unique in China

762
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Or you know decent Chinese company

763
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Caught on

764
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
To what USS markets

765
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Metrics

766
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,320
I think it does make me sort of unique I think.

767
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,392
Also one thing that GV definitely helped us a lot

768
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:52,256
I don't think a lot of Founders in the China Market that they understand how those metrics

769
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
So I think ggv

770
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,864
Having the global view Daphne helped us

771
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
To know what measure like for example NPS

772
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:05,312
Example IKR for example like retention Church LTV CAC

773
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
All of those things a measure

774
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,896
Yeah we do they like rigorously

775
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
Soulfly

776
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,296
We are quite unique to the investors in China they rarely see this

777
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Kind of like

778
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
Very detailed very rigorous mattress

779
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:23,232
So you're teaching them versus the Missouri River

780
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000

Questions that you just say the first

785
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Comes to mind

789
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
I think Bill Gates

790
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,456
He gave me the inspiration for entrepreneurship by saying

791
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
