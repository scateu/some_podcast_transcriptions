00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,215
There's only two

184
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
20000 apps

185
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Is that all you sure that you know

186
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
Android auto

187
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,551
So that's why I began to learn coding and the Cincinnati Bengals apps on a lot of games

188
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
And I just feel like home

189
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,951
The guest some apps I give up a really complicated I feel like people may like it

190
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,559
But as a result of people you know care about is that I said I feel

191
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Maybe

192
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
A popular spot if there are some stupid ass

193
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,983

194
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751

195
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,591
Kuwait

196
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
That's why I've recorded phone bomb that people do not inject the screen and it's an older fruit

197
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
If they are similar to each other

198
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
It kind of like

199
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Jackie speier

200
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
That's stupid I've got

201
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Pulse rate

202
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Highlands

203
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535

205
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Google Play

206
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,935
So we got a lot of light

207
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Comdata app

208
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
You built that after yourself

209
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
So it's not

210
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
It's really silly app

211
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:33,503
I do not

212
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527

214
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183

00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Lake Spaulding Twitter users

218
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,031
So that's why. Promotions free advertisement is real money

219
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Carlito money from this part

220
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,407
Buy YouTube channel

221
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
You cannot find that anymore because at that time

222
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
I feel like there's a lot engineer's asking

223
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Questions almost like overflow

224
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,463

227
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071

Rio very kind of like not that come

229
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
Not that you know really good answer

230
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
So that's why I stood out the top questions on stackoverflow talking asking about Android because it is my only

231
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Ability

232
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919

238
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
A lot of people are searching Asian girls

239
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
Yeah but still that's why I

240
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167

What's the real methodology and the philosophy behind it

1154
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,679
So that's why I feel like a why I think alike

00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
Uneventful

1161
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
First of all they didn't go to China

00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,127
It is in the continent

1195
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895

1197
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,015
