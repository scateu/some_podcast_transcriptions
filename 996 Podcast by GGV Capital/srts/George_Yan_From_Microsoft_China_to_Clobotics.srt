Thank you thank you guys

74
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
So the majority of your career we're spending

75
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Microsoft

76
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
I wonder what was it like to

77
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
To help are you as company run

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
How to operate

79
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Somewhat less than

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
About how us companies

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Can go to China

82
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,616
Great experience running the greater kind of team

83
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,944
Basically I am an engineer and I was born in

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
I'm having that engineer

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Discipline and attention to details in the logic to applying to a business world I found myself able to transition into that

86
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Tyrol preternatural

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,232
But the business is sold fast for Microsoft

88
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
The portfolio

89
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,608
It's not a problem to Consumer business to Hardware to services to Cloud

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
To licensing and Exedra

91
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
And that gives me a great

92
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
View of all aspects

93
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Of the business

94
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
As well as how we would need to

95
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Squeak different.

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
To make each one of the best

97
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Successful so I found that

98
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,784
That have experience is super helpful to lay the ground for me to jump

99
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
And I wanted to dive into the details so how did you manage to launch Microsoft Azure and Office 365

100
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
5 in China within such a short period of time

101
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
And how did you do with the regulatory challenges

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
I think it's

103
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
It's with a lot of luck

104
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
To be honest it's a understanding the Microsoft ecosystem the business

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,919
Technology behind it on the engineering team in US

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
My boss me understood

107
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
How would engineering product needs to ship a self to be here in China

108
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
Spending more than 10 years in China

109
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
I have a good feel of what

110
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,767
What is the government or the regulars looking at

111
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
When a multinational like Microsoft wants without a service

112
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
As well as that was the right timing for

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,239
China getting a lot of weight behind

114
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,615
The cloud and infrastructure native that booming and wanting to have a multinational

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
Cloud provider here

116
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
To being a plane

117
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,039
So I think we are lucky that we're the right time the right place with the right people

118
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
And I want to be very level-headed

119
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
What's a government

120
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
About

121
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
You know what what is a take and how we can eat sushi bar technology and change your features and write out code differently in water

122
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
For the product to be localized and able to

123
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,607
Run operating

124
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
So could you talk about

125
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Clobotics

126
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
That just give our listeners

127
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
Review of how it's helping

128
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Time to transform

129
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Traditional Inn

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
Other retail sites

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
We're focusing on digital tires

132
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Products

133
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
So we think that offline retail today is

134
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Unfairly

135
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Challenged

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
Because it's really hard to connect to people with a product

137
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
In the retail store

138
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
And how would you go

139
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
And connect those dots is

140
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Through the product in the middle

141
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
So recognizing the product is very hard problem

142
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,519
Is there any given one time there is hundreds of millions of different products are they in the mall

143
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
So how can a person go

144
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
The product so that we can have the interaction that

145
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
You have a soul naturally online we don't have it all flights

146
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
We believe that's a problem that we want to go

147
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,343
Digitizing the physical world starting with Rita

148
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Stihl products

149
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
And once you do that at once you can build

150
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,023
Customer interaction or you can building to business interaction with

151
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
The product

152
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,375
That you have a very different model for her offline retail wood

153
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Generate the revenue

154
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
So what what does your product look like

155
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
And who uses

156
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,895
So if you would going to a Walmart store even going to a

157
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
The mama Pop Shop store in Xi'an

158
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
Coca-Cola fridge you will see a iot device

159
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
We'll be sticking on the door

160
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,511
I'm basically two cameras looking in so they understand what are the products have been taken out of the Shelf

161
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
And we do local processing on the edge

162
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,727
So there's a small On The Edge chip that does deep learning algorithm to recognize what a product

163
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
I take it so it's only the bits that's changed gets

164
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Sandbox

165
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,175
The cloud what the heck what are you able to see all the product movements

166
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
Over a million a million have

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Coolers out in the market

168
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,391
So basically giving the headquarter that transparency and

169
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Into Howdy's

170
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
Point of Sales devices are working

171
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
At them

172
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
So if it isn't retail in wind energy or two

173
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Two very different

174
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
What's a commonality

175
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Two of The Outlaws

176
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
To the field product

177
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Service Pro

178
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Which one the focus on

179
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
Depends very good question that's a question that keeps me open hats that wake at night

180
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:50,015
Essentially when we got into this business we see the fundamental technology blocks are the same

181
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,647
It's going to be hard where it's going to involve some type of software computer vision screening of automation

182
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
End

183
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
We are

184
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,743
We believe that these

185
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
Technology should be applicable in 3rd different.

186
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
We went into wind energy first

187
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Because we had background

188
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
Draw a hardware

189
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Computer vision

190
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
So that's

191
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
Entry into that

192
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
Space give us that natural barrier

193
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,431
And has a celebration that we need to be number one in the market

194
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,551
Stop the 2 years in this industry worship our first product and we are already the China leader

195
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
In doing autonomous inspection for the winter writing desk

196
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
When we look at

197
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
The Second Industrial we see the retail industry is

198
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
It's a trillion dollar industry with

199
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
Still very little technology

200
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,959
And we believe the technology that if we can provide for the offline retailers in the cpg companies

201
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
They wouldn't use that as tools and weapons

202
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,847
To actually have a fair fight against the guys like amazonics

203
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
We want to see how this industry would get shaped

204
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
In the future

205
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,087
But that takes a longer time for us to be there when that battle happens

206
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,207
We got to make sure that we can survive this Revenue stream we can be leader insurance place that we sure of

207
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
To look at wintermyers mobile device to play we look at more of the retail space is offensive acceleration

208
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Template for the lawn

209
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
So what

210
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Conner Industries Borger

211
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Are you going tonight

212
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
We have

213
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
Plenty of things on our play for us to chew

214
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,639
Our goal is to be number one being those to feel that I think it's

215
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
It's going to be a while

216
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Before we can ourselves

217
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
I say we are

218
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
So we're not looking at the third industry we think.

219
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Our strategy is to have a

220
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
What's the fastest plane office play

221
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
And that's already

222
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,951
Complete I will just have to go super deep in these areas

223
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
To see how we can go help these Enterprises

224
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
To extrapolate

225
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Better value and better potty

226
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,423
Do the wind energy companies have more money

227
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
To pay you

228
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
They do have

229
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
The pretty significant budget

230
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
For the operations and maintenance area

231
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
This is actually a 25 billion dollar market

232
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,223
Andaz 450000 turbine

233
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
It's worldwide

234
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,111
So if you do the math the average house to $65,000 they spend

235
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,927
Operations and maintenance alone

236
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
For a

237
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Provide per year

238
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,863
And today we're only scratching the surface where is only getting $300 out of that 65

239
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:19,263
Thousand dollars that they're spending so there's a lot of Technology innovations that we can doing there to make sure that we can

240
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
That's a larger pie and also the pie South will get bigger

241
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
As the technology Innovations

242
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
So what's preventing you from

243
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Just focus on.

244
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
It takes time for a commercial business

245
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
To really accelerate

246
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,695
And for us to do that part well we already taken the right set of a group

247
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
12 + 4

248
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,023
This is not a game of

249
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
You know if you have

250
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
10 people you can go to

251
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
Attend turbines if you drive a hundred people is 200 it's actually just a set of people that's turning I the customers

252
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
Besides I'm fixing boxing proven products Etc

253
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,431
So we're not increasing the team where is celery and make sure the product is better

254
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,271
And that time is not going to go away by adding people so

255
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:08,671
For us we know the trajectory is there and we will have to go deeper if I going deeper we'll just have to take that

256
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,023
So could you talk a little bit about your technology and how it

257
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Appreciated from

258
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,399
The requirements for our technology

259
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
On the retail side

260
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Is scale

261
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Anybody today can take

262
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,359
10 or 20 pictures able to do some labeling and put it into a automl

263
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Engine words from large companies

264
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,735
And Trent out at Freddy decent model that can

265
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
Get your nail 90 or 95

266
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Inaccuracy

267
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,903
But that's not interest is great for devil but it doesn't work in a trillion Barb

268
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
We're talking about Millions

269
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Of products that we have to recognize

270
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,815
And on the weekly basis their hundred thousand products

271
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Update

272
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
So you think

273
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
To the platform that you

274
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
You provide

275
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Able for you to capture those image

276
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
Way to label this image finder

277
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,639
She was that you're looking for them building the models are pushing a models

278
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Universe small form factor

279
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
Into iot and into your devices

280
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
That's our bread-and-butter

281
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
And that's something that's really hard

282
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
To Chase or two

283
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Bee frog

284
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
I always use an example of

285
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
On the things that we previously did I micro

286
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
I'm doing the search War

287
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
We have always thought that

288
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,911
With more money with more power with more talents were able to catch up with Google

289
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
But we found that that was not the case cuz that was a data game

290
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,567
They were in the market for

291
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,895
Exactly so it doesn't matter how much

292
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
You know Helendale, call where you at

293
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
We Believe for us today we saw this big problem

294
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:47,487
I'm at work in their first and we're capturing better will get better I was around it that gives a first-mover advantage

295
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
What's the temperature scale many many many years

296
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,167
Robotics is only around 2 years old but it already has offices in

297
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Five cities

298
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
4 countries

299
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Why do you want your business

300
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Global firm

301

It's all about

302
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,895
Talent I think that Talent from multiple different backgrounds

303
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Coming together

304
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
I will come up with

305
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
BARC

306
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
These are the insight

307
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
That dumb I want when we built it

308
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Together

309
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Running Global development teams for Microsoft

310
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
For many many years

311
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
That's just part of our DNA

312
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
That gives back

313
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Unfair advantage

314
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
Quotes that having the best people in USA in Asia and in China except all come together

315
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239

00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Yo today

317
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Machine learning API General

318
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Music super hot Market

319
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
I'm able to tap into yuan

320
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Other markets that haven't been

321
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Watch to multiple times

322
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,087
I'm giving stuff on a resource economics

323
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
So

324
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Speaking of talents

325
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
You guys have a

326
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Killer engineering

327
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
A quarter of them

328
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Hold a PhD

329
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351

330
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
Percent of the team overall

331
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Masters to grow higher

332
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Many

333
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471

Prestigious Silicon Valley comp

335
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
Buy Microsoft Google Amazon

336
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
So what tips do you have

337
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Have for recruiting

338
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Technical Talent

339
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
When you pitch clobotics

340
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Talons what do you use to convince

341
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
I seldom our Club Onyx

342
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Dream

343
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
But in Chinese

344
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,743
I understand that we're about staying here but we can also

345
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
And the dream has to resume

346
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
I told the person to close his

347
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Imagine that

348
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Offline retail industry five years

349
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
If a person walks into a store

350
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
The stores no longer Isles after owls on rocks

351
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,383
After all it's more experience play

352
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,967
When you put on your AR class or when you looks to your mobile phone

353
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
Table in front of you with multiple products

354
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Now suddenly start talk to

355
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Start to give you more information

356
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
Start to tell you that there is alternative

357
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
Products that you can get as well by clicking it

358
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,535
You're getting more personalized information

359
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Personal discount

360
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
That's what I see doll fine retail

361
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
And

362
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Does that person wants to be

363
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,543
Departed I'd trade it does that person wants to tell his son and daughter that

364
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
His father or mother

365
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,711
Was a part of that Journey was part of that part of the mission that changed how retail industry worth

366
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
We Believe

367
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
Dancing resonates with a candidate

368
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
NY likes

Professionals

374
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
With amazing background

375
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
In multinational

376
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
Most important us tennis team leader

377
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
And the ones working

378
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Try not to bust a nut

379
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Long time as well

380
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
So when you and your co-founders will come from

381
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Being emotionless

382
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
For such a long time

383
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Macomber gucciardo

384
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
What changed

385
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
For you

386
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
What was the thing that switch

387
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
For you

388
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Decide to do that take the rest

389
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
After all these years

390
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
And then as you start building a company that

391
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
No longer part of Microsoft's long apart of the big company now you have a

392
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Sell yourself

393
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
And one brand

394
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
What are lessons

395
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Quotes on positive and negative side

396
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
They'll be helpful to login

397
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
Yet I think the most important takeaways

398
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Is 2 mi

399
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Two and a half years

400
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Startup world is

401
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
I started recognize

402
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Is that I know nothing

403
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
And that's super super

404
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Before present

405
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
Able to face himself and

406
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Able to admit

407
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
That you know not

408
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Extra large fishing too small pounds

409
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
You get into a position where

410
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,695
You think that you know everything you can you can't execute again do anything with your eyes closed

411
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
That's no longer in

412
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,839
So get yourself out of that comfort zone into a newer space cuz there's

413
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Bigger world out there

414
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,727
Enjoy being a cop machine

415
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,543
Animal from Nagasaki what to do and

416
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
Get paid while doing it

417
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,383
Watching for you and your co-founders

418
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
I think words

419
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
Which is built differently there still be bass of these people that build different

420
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
Yo you look at your disposal see your saved a right I think it's just takes a special breed of people that become CEO

421
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Everybody is fit for that role

422
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
And we're okay with that

423
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,327
We recruit a lot of people from multinational and sometimes they said you know I like my conference don't stay there

424
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
That's totally cool

425
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,959
But you go to find out of 10 people you talked to your friend a one or two person to have that spark

426
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,567
All you got to do is cut it given that knowledge that I need to leave that covers on Joyner

427
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,383
Next to in 3 years

428
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
It's going to be

429
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Totally different

430
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
I give it to you

431
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
It is that you can recall

432
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
That changed for you

433
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Personally

434
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
Yeah it's actually at the

435
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
Chichi vlp events

436
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,535
4 years ago I was sitting the back table

437
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Looking up

438
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,631
I'm at the startup CEOs giving the speech

439
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,239
And you know some of those guys are great articulating their mission all those not so well right

440
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
But you can speak

441
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
Here we can feel the passion that they had

442
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,455
You not in the way that they're telling the story right and I look deep down myself to say okay am I

443
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,831
Am I just going to be a person who has a fast track to the Sea Suites in a large company

444
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,135
Or do I want to do something bigger

445
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
What is said that twice L fight I felt like

446
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
I also had a mission

447
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
I also had a vision why cats

448
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,119
Able to digitize the physical world I am willing to

449
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
Who converts the two together to have the

450
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,751
Tell without the tool that the people have to support

451
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
How's the world be able to make that happen

452
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,943
So why not take a plunge and try it next time

453
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
Georgians in the world

454
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
Demotivated

455
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
What was their biggest

456
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
List challenge

457
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
Came out of

458
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
Outside of a big hump

459
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
Picture yourself

460
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Yeah I think it's about

461
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Able to recognize that

462
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,727
Now without the Big Brand without the

463
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Reputation

464
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
Peoples going to look at you

465
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Nobita

466
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
And you have to be okay with that

467
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
The Pride

468
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
All the extra

469
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
Accessories that you had with a large company

470
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
All that stuff goes away

471
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
And today you have to build that rep

472
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,391
Teach me how to use both our heads roll up your sleeves

473
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,951
With your co-founder to do at Farm ground up

474
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
And

475
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
That realization was

476
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
A shot

477
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Where you going to places where

478
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,679
Little People roll out the red carpet for you at

479
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
Time schedule for Exedra

480
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
And everything now you have to do it on your own

481
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
That shocked

482
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
5 Seconds

483
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
Right after that you know that you are in a different place

484
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
The battlefields different things

485
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Do you have to be different

486
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
The agility of adjusting yourself

487
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
For the new environment I think

488
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
Any CEO startup CEO needs to have

489
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
How to quickly

490
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
So you have so many office

491
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Lacrosse

492
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Play geography

493
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
How do you divide up

494
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Abilities across them in

495
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
And how do you minimize

496
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Yeah to try to build this

497
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,215
Seems the group of frogs that are deep in certain areas

498
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Fire around Toledo

499
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
For example the head of our us office

500
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
Is Avery on computer vision scientist

501
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
It has been

502
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
In the start of World as a CTO

503
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
So we build

504
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
Computer vision capabilities

505
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
You surround them

506
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
And you will see that

507
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Because he has

508
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Downtown the path previously

509
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
The amount of senior Talent

510
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,255
Send the June Attalla

511
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
And also the fresh hires in the interns

512
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
Can I start to come all together

513
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Indicted

514
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Pot

515
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
Apple support

516
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
If you're in China if you look at our China infrastructure

517
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
These guys are

518
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,919
Startup or exit a internet guys

519
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
So they know how to

520
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Quickly roll out of

521
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,039
I form and scale to millions and millions

522
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Services

523
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,903
Over very short a time so there's a fire around

524
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,487
Where that talent pool has a ride DNA built from

525
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
You haven't

526
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Exposed

527
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
To be

528
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,887
When you guys

529
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Thinking about

530
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
For robotics

531
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
What major

532
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Decide to do this

533
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
I think in China.

534
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
Previous no internet on mobile internet

535
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
Has been a really

536
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Rush

537
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,527
Of consumerization of all my spaces

538
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
To be honest

539
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,647
That's not something I'm very good at it's not in my DNA

540
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,208
Enterprise field for all of us

541
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
Keep on watching and waiting

542
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
I believe the next wave

543
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Okay

544
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Is going to happen on the to be side

545
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
And it is going to happen with

546
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Deep technology companies

547
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
That can go help and push the business model

548
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Working with a traditional Industries to

549
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
That's where my friend

550
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
You got to do something that you're good at

551
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,600
Yo in a place where all does all the cards are stacked against you

552
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Its global

553
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,720
It's deep Technical and it's able to scale

554
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Into services at other people

555
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
Knowing what you know now we look

556
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Career Microsoft

557
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
What are the

558
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
MCU

559
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Learn

560
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
Help you do what your do

561
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
And what are the skills as you wish

562
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Should have learned

563
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Either of your homeboys who else where

564
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Never would have better

565
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Where are you

566
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Two for the road

567
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,760
Asperger question we're just talking about that in the team yesterday

568
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
I believe I stating the

569
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,856
Microsoft engineer X-Men Xavier

570
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
I believe I

571
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
Spend a little bit

572
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
I would cut down to about eight years

573
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
Learn how to build a product a couple of times

574
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,400
I know how to scale a product and I would leave that last

575
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
4 years

576
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,472
To go to a company like Alibaba

577
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,544
Because I believe in the earlier days

578
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,944
Of Alibaba the way that. Jellett afford to go trans ability for the pressure to be on a person to

579
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
I need to be versatile enough to being different roles

580
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
That type of pressure

581
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,672
Is what I'm experiencing today and I'm learning from scratch but if I had that

582
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,768
Does company where everybody had a similar values and it already has a similar

583
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
Movement I believe I'll be more prepared

584
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,144
I'll have a better preparation before where I'm at

585
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
Best bagel bites

586
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Providence

587
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Thank you

588
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
I looking at

589
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,032
Advice to you gif

590
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,360
To entrepreneurs who are debating whether they should go

591
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
Train at a bit

592
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
First

593
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Or just you

594
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Starting a comp

595
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,552
Yes my personal experience I think that

596
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,624
Printing large companies I look at Microsoft is awful

597
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:29,024
And this is a place where you can move into multiple roles that started with an engineer and I was in product manager

598
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
My daughter wanted large

599
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
Engineering team that I

600
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
Came to China that Iran China business

601
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
So large

602
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:40,800
Large organizations able to give you these multiple roles and for you to do any take selling these

603
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,592
If you think about it

604
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
It's actually very low-risk

605
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,224
Rights you really don't have much to lose by trying new things and large comfy

606
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,624
You don't have to worry about the 70-80 people that are with you have to worry about their paychecks if it's bicycle you're free

607
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,976
While but that you should try to get as much out of as you can while in these couple

608
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,560
You got to tell you yourself that once you're ready

609
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Jump

610
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,400
Ayumi fewer you think they almost ready job

611
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,472
Because you going to have gravy seems like Gigi Viejas

612
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,848
Right to close the last mile to get you out of that door

613
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Everybody

614
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
Sitting you know at the ggb bad

615
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,856
And sometimes you just have to look at straight into house I thought that's go

616
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
How did you know it was

617
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Who is The Rifleman

618
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
After spending so many

619
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,792
It's actually a evolution of revolution

620
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
I've been preparing the same

621
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
For three years as was talking about

622
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
I believe that the market

623
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,008
The technology and my experience is not at the place where I think I'm ready

624
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,568
So it just becomes a natural progression

625
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Of where I want to take my next

626
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
Career with the people that I can join

627
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
So when you left Microsoft

628
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
I did a lot of people

629
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Come with you

630
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
Alpha record no

631
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,184
I think

632
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
You got to have your own

633
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Once

634
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
I'm on the road once I'm

635
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
Telling people my vision

636
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,632
There's other people work for Microsoft other places that cool

637
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,192
New my reputation in the industry

638
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
And decided that they want to share that dream with me

639
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,568
Everybody has to take their own path that's going to a different time for

640
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,664
Remember we welcome anybody from multiple backgrounds will share the same dream to come in

641
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Anytime to enjoying the journey

642
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Amir advice to give people who work

643
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
Take risk is very

644
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
I love you with an going to be

645
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
The companies were they going to

646
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,440
Stay so we actually afraid of texting

647
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Risk of losing their teeth

648
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
You think you realised

649
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
The training on

650
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
The practice

651
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Sessions

652
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Kakashi

653
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
If you have gout approachable

654
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
Different mentality

655
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
So you have service

656
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Variety of

657
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,824
First 20 engineering side and

658
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Going to the operational

659
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Hillside and now this

660
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
So could you talk about your

661
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Takeaways from

662
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Various

663
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
Bistros

664
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:03,392
Are different but your fundamental principles how you approach and solve a problem or the same

665
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
A technical background

666
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
You always very logically

667
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
How to dissect

668
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
The problem

669
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Play areas and doing trade-offs

670
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
We can show the logic

671
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
Supplies into the decision-making

672
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Process

673
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
That's just built in

674
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Intermi

675
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:22,336
And I've been trying to apply the same skills that's what I'm on a engineering running a product or

676
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
China

677
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
But I

678
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
Quickly found out that in a start of World

679
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
It's not always the

680
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
Therefore that actually have a

681
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Circle

682
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:38,464
Axios or either CEOs that are currently serving today it's companies are small and you're bigger than me

683
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
We talk on a daily basis

684
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
Bounce ideas off each other

685
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,376
To make sure that I don't get blindsided by things that I'm

686
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,912
I've been avoiding overlook

687
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
I think that's critical

688
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,520
Again recognizing that you don't know anything

689
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
And build a bass tabs

690
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
Support supporting system around you

691
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
For those guys to

692
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
Give you ID and a bison

693
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Challenge

694
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
I'm your strategy

695
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
I found out to be bear

696
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,880
BSU assembly in your Coke on me

697
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
How did you think about

698
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
And what role did

699
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
How do you come home

700
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
Actually didn't do any recruiting

701
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
Most of us work together for the past

702
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
8 to 10 years

703
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
So we knew each other

704
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
When you do that

705
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,824
These Punk hold on a team come together

706
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
We were able to have a good chance of achieving some

707
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
So it was a natural progression

708
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
And once you took the first step

709
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,064
Everybody said we want to go take the same steps that wasn't very natural

710
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
El Paso get there

711
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
I didn't

712
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,904
That's probably one of the benefits

713
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
For a

714
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
Older person like us

715
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
Is that we had that it

716
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,584
Experience in the large company so you have a TracFone

717
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
And a truck lifted means

718
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
So I advise I will give it to the younger guys I'm making sure that you really cherish your reputation and your track

719
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
If I could spend whatever

720
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
Cuz all that stuff is going to

721
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
Add up and

722
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
You run

723
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
Across border

724
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
You are sunshine

725
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
How do you deal with

726
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Cultural

727
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Differences in

728
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
And how do you make sure every

729
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Such a diverse

730
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
Write it down

731
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
LA Times

732
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Mytalking

733
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Things gets messed

734
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,472
A person's not there gets messed up by bypassing words back and forth

735
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
I want you to write it down

736
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
It's on the paper

737
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688
You will quickly realize when you write things down you actually what haven't you been more structure thoughts Luna things that

738
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
You thought me the stats didn't make sense on paper

739
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,928
Moore I'm to make it make sure that ideas or solid so we have a writing

740
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
We use Yelp

741
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
OneNote

742
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
So everybody can contribute to the the same

743
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Service

744
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
That we can see

745
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
How our company of her ideas professional

746
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Stop.

747
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
Topcoder Will Rock You

748
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
422

749
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
Did you think people work

750
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Same hours

751
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
Lacrosse

752
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,712
Different offices associate

753
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,784
Bob

754
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
I think the hours are

755
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Different

756
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
People are constantly thinking about the problem at work

757
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
We don't have office hours we don't have Punch Cards

758
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,560
We don't try call A Long Walk off a short people work

759
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
You can see through the

760
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
Activities on words on WeChat

761
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
WhatsApp for a new email

762
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
You and the people are constantly trying to solve

763
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
A problem

764
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,336
The problem is not going to go away

765
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:40,992
So whenever you feel like you're rested whenever you feel like you're ready when we feel like the timing is right

766
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,112
Start up as a self motivating a self-driven

767
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Services

768
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
It's not

769
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,768
You get a paycheck to paycheck that we give for the things that we give them today

770
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,584
Any of these guys can walk out of here and go to a cone company

771
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
They're not here for that

772
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
That vision

773
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,008
The faster that we can go cheaper the better prepare we can get that the better it is

774
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
Some people do we have in the US

775
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Let's hope people in the US

776
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,408
None of those guys are pretty seniors are very seasoned guys

777
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224
To be honest those guys also have less

778
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Financial burden

779
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,600
This is well so you don't these guys if they bleed in your vision

780
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,184
They want to spend time their productivity.

781
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
Come out it's just going to be

782
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
How many people do you have in China

783
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,352
We have over 60 some people in China

784
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,424
And it spread some sales marketing operations

785
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,472
And Engineering assets app

786
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
So

787
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
What we have seen so far

788
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
Summer engineering China 10 to 1

789
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
Get going

790
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
And it

791
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
He said

792
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
It doesn't work if

793
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Either way to go

794
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
The Architects in the US

795
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
In general show something within the seed

796
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Need more plan give NSYNC

797
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Tested

798
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
The product

799
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,976
Before they rolled out

800
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,792
More deliberate how do you reconcile the difference

801
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Cancel that you can be

802
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Cookies

803
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
Yes it's very good

804
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,728
We have something called the Prototype Google

805
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
Rex the Prototype grooves

806
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,384
Basically it helps me or helps people really put together that vision

807
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
You can see it

808
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
You know 6-10 month down the road what that looks like

809
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,576
Fortunate that our business is a scale

810
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
It's not something that

811
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
You can just ride and give it out and

812
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Give me feedback

813
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
You can do today

814
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
But how do you descale that service

815
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,072
All about deep engineering infrastructure

816
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,656
Social work and that part actually is going to take time and this is where the US

817
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:41,056
Oh you know the guys without experience even our CTO West done this for you know Bing search comes in

818
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:46,176
So the infrastructure that we built today can scale to millions and billions

819
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
List of SKU that we have

820
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Have to go recognize

821
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,784
Customers are multinational

822
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,696
So their expectation of our services are a Salazar super high when customers are putting he

823
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
Chi-Town yuutousei

824
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,328
The stuff that you give us

825
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
Saw that we want to do the right thing so we don't want to turn out that

826
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,240
Need a wasting engineering resources to rebuild MBR

827
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:14,336
Fortunately is very fitting to our

828
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Stop

829
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,456
What advice do you have for us

830
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
Tech companies for

831
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
Thinking about entering

832
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
The Chinese market

833
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
It's going to be challenged

834
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
To be honest

835
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
And I can tell you

836
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
The multinationals haven't

837
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Figure that out yet

838
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
And it does take

839
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
A special breed of people

840
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
Not only look straight

841
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
Please but understand a China environment

842
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
Understand local culture here

843
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
I know is how the US operation works

844
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
And able to

845
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
Learn quickly adapt

846
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
The local environment here

847
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
That takes a special

848
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Or special group

849
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,248
Up to four people to deliver

850
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
So take your

851
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
Time entering through China

852
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,648
It's not a place we stick a flag so where in China are you going to get

853
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Slaughtered

854
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,256
So take your time find their Vitality even groom that's holiday

855
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,072
If you have to but this is a325 your journey

856
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
And by the way this is going

857
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
If somebody found a secret formula should go

858
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,240
Sell that to Microsoft or Amazon anybody else right cuz they haven't really forgot to tell you

859
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
You in Peru

860
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Microsoft

861
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Knowing what you know now

862
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,640
What would you have recommended to the men's

863
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
I do it differently

864
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
City Market mosques us

865
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,784
Ventana Enterprise size or on the

866
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Consumer site with that

867
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,392
Ouch ouch

868
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
Look. I think all the other consumer side

869
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Timing wasn't right.

870
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
The team had a different agenda it was

871
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
The different DNA

872
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,096
So that part was

873
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
It was not going to happen

874
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,168
But on the Enterprise side

875
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
If

876
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
In a large corporation would

877
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Truly truly

878
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Call route

879
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Engineering team

880
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
Dedicated for China

881
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,920
And made that China leader to be responsible

882
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
Not only for sales and marketing

883
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
Before engineering for research

884
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
For investment

885
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,160
You make that a true CEO for China I believe the Dynamics will be very

886
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:10,304
And that's still something that not any of the multinational CEOs

887
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Maybe some

888
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
KFC

889
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Then what kind of person

890
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,264
Would have succeeded

891
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
As a Microsoft China

892
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
CEO

893
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
In charge of the entire Opera

894
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Encoding engine

895
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
Review were in sitting at Redmond

896
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
And you had to pick someone

897
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
The first Microsoft

898
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
What would he

899
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
He look like

900
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
I think I'm a very good

901
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,768
Choice what is about you that really should have seen

902
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,584
Okay as the things I was saying previous

903
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
Nissan of Santa products

904
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
Spell all times

905
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Understand

906
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
How business were Rhonda

907
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Understand that

908
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Cease of government

909
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
And also regulation policy

910
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
You know what I left Microsoft

911
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
But having

912
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
Don't do that two or three years the starter

913
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
I thought the door so much I've seen so many things

914
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
Underground lab

915
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,000
I would say that much better prepared

916
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
Then I was 4 years

917
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Manchester

918
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Exactly

919
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
So now it jumps to the final

920
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
Part of the interview which is around

921
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
Rapid fire

922
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Questions

923
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
The first one is

924
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Who is that

925
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
When are you admired

926
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
I'll give you two

927
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,224
Chairman Mao and George Washington

928
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
There becomes a virtual

929
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
OK Google

930
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
I think

931
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,416
I think Chairman Mao is a great entrepreneur right he

932
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,976
He had a great idea

933
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
He had

934
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
I was a mediocre

935
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
People right

936
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
She had very little tools

937
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,192
And he's able to go attacking this area where he bleed in

938
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
And turn around

939
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,336
And use whatever the resource that took a long game into creating what is

940
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
Kind of look like today

941
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,456
Right so I think the entrepreneur spear if you read his writing

942
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,528
It's always a part of his DNA he's me

943
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Pricing so I respect the person for

944
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Able to take that

945
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Plunged

946
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
We're changing our industry

947
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
He changed the world

948
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,488
George Washington

949
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
Rite-Way comes into and say hey we don't do something great

950
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,608
Again a great ideology

951
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
But very mediocre

952
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,472
Very little tools all the cards are stacked against

953
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,312
But you take the wrong real time Bill what is United States of America today

954
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
I believe these guys

955
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Your Love

956
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
I'm a history buff

957
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
What a weed

958
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
Things about how they pee comment

959
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Account end

960
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
I'll be able to conquer these difficulties

961
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
It makes me think that

962
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
The things I'm doing

963
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
What's in a book or article that you

964
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
I read recently

965
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,280
BBQ on recommending the principal

966
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,608
So principles of grey book

967
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,912
Because you're basically destihl

968
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
All of

969
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,240
These learnings are all of these things that you said

970
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,312
I wish that I can write those things down

971
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,432
Put together in a book and share with you so

972
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,576
This is not a book that you re wants to put on a bookshelf to something to carry with you all the time and just flip through chapter

973
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
And there's going to be these aha moments

974
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Cindy's Choppers you said

975
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,976
If I took a different path I look at a person differently

976
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
If we had

977
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,608
But you that person's background I might behave a little bit differently in Tulsa

978
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
All these things are so resonating and

979
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
So useful

980
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,032
It's it's something that should be a pocketbook size that carry with

981
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
All the CEOs order

982
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,408
So what do you think about when you get up in the morning

983
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
What motivates you to get out

984
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
In the morning everyday

985
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
And also what are the things

986
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Keep you awake

987
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
Indict

988
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,112
The thing that motivates me or that

989
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
Today Eddie some people and

990
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Yo

991
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,024
Sometimes later will be a hundred a thousand people that share the same vision

992
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
And it wants to go help

993
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,376
The traditional Enterprises and help them to digitize the

994
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
And if that dream spots around

995
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
I believe

996
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,288
The day the world will be very different than we see today but

997
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,872
The waiver changes that we can experience or going to be bigger

998
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Data Internet wave

999
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,432
It's gonna be bigger than a mobile internet

1000
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
It's going to be bigger than

1001
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
The cloud way that we have seen

1002
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,088
The physical world is the ultimate game where you

1003
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,416
Bring all the talents all that collectively all the weasels together

1004
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
To shape

1005
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
How we going to see things differently 5 to 10

1006
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
And what keeps you up at night

1007
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:33,216

I don't know how much time before these days

1028
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,208
I murdered a saltwater aquarium

1029
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
Fanatics

1030
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,560
And I have a saltwater tank at home

1031
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,400
It's a ecosystem on its own it has

1032
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
You don't lpsf

1033
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704

You don't need Lori has the order

1036
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
Things that you can't imagine to see I have it in my

1037
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,480
And it's delicate because you're basically shrinking the Steve

1038
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
Into your living room

1039
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,600
And the right chemical balance and write tweets that you have

1040
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,160
Are there Bright the right bells and whistles alerts that

1041
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
You have to mix it up

1042
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
Potassium and calcium are all correct in the right level schedule

1043
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,864
And that's something that I can focus on take my mind off

1044
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
What I do in a startup world

1045
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
And it calms me down when look at the

1046
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,032
Official snail swimming in the water you see the starfish in

1047
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,104
You excuse you see the crawl style waving back and forth

1048
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,944
What's that gives me into a different environment where I can distill

1049
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
NSYNC

1050
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
And process

1051
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
