00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,551
How do you transform yourself from a writer or editor could you also did

00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Leading a tech company

180
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,095
I think because I start a philosophy in University

181
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
Yeah that's the best of scenes.

182
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Is that a philosophy is that you

183
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
Cannot find a job

184
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
The first day I joined the University

185
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
They tell me you cannot find a job after I graduated

186
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,831
So you must help yourself to find the time away to survive

187
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
Right now I know why you're so argumentative

188
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,023
My wife

189
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119

190
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
We are leaving

191

We reposition ourselves into a

457
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,920
A news media more concerned that we all

458
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944

467
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
La carmencita aparts off news

468
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:09,472

Different power off

471
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:17,664
So we combined all the comments and the News together

472
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,504
The first one

473
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Even even today

474
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Is

475
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
What's the deal

476
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,928
That that is

477
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Lip reading the comments

478
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,816

High quality ice quality

480
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
Let's begin like

481
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
When you started

482
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Why why it was held to a wine right

483
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
And it was a

484
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,384
Online game web portal

485
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,736
Alphagamers for communication and community school for gamers

486
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,832
Sort of like Discord in the US so why did you pick this particular Market

487
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
Why the gamers

488
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,184
Because I got time II single weekend

489
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
We cannot see

490
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,096
We we can come up with an that n**** with Cena

491
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,936
That's very difficult to xidan Cena

492
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Yeah

493
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,776
I seen that if we want to

494
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
Being a bigger media

495
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,688
That's enough for next the 5-year Swisher

496
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
We should

497
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,760
Do something different from sing

498
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,624
I got time to call Cena I always focus on media is Shelf

499
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:35,744
I see no I would rather not to focus on media is self I will

500
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Focus on

501
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
Information business

502
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400

509
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
Information technology

510
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
So I want to immerse the

511
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,296
40 frontal Channel and make this channel independent brand

512
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Anda

513
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
We would provide those services

514
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,976
For the readers not news for the Raiders only

515
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256

518
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
Company to do that

519
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496

521
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
With my own money

522
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
Not only because

523
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,200
The company you were asked to mount it was as business I want to look

524
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,344
Even if there's no no money I can use my own money

525
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Amassment

526
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
That doesn't

527
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464

00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,088
Yeah I hate that you caused me to do two things

626
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
The first is a

It's very true

848
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,776
As we all know any content of a media company in China has to

849
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,848
But here to Chinese government regulations

850
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
And

851
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:52,480
How much resources does Weis spend on regulating its content

852
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
To make sure

853
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,832

Very very fast are we doing Barrel Associates

861
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,312
But just to leave the machine to do that

862
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,872
NYY went public

863
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
In New York in 2012

864
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,760
There had been a decrease in Chinese IPOs in the US

865
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,064
So in 2010 there were

866
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,856
41 Chinese IPOs

867
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
In the US and in 2011 there were 12

868
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,792
I mean 2012 before while I went public they're happy only one which is Vip Shop

869
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,888
So why did you choose to go public at this particular time

870
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,960
Icing good for Google CEO

871
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:50,080
You should not focus on revenue is not focus on the market price

872
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,175
Yeah I seen but when we feel this company we just the

873
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,479

Make money from Marshall gift we just want to provide a free world

880
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,007
Yeah so I think it for the most important things for me is to

00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
Who decides

00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847

00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
How does this

885
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
Come back to today

886
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503

China Buffet

892
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
Start multiple

893
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
Companies and then have them

894
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815

925
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
Because of the way

00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
Meet some problems

927
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,319

938
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,591
We are undone

How's the weather

942
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
This is different from the way

943
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,207
Depending on the content

944
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,303
You for the keeping company they do not a carburetor with us

950
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
What does a PR do

951
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,103

00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,959
I have an idea that's

965
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,543
Not the media other than Sports

966
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Selective media

967
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871

As one big company to company on this company wheel

1016
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:35,167
Also to stewing to make famous and fasting

1017
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:38,495
The NBA teams under your own ESPN

00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,991

1021
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
That sucks

1022
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
Just know that

1023
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
That's how you feel

1024
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Exactly

1025
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,183
Interesting fact

1026
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,023
And just to give some contacts in Q4 2017

1027
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,351
We are head 610000 monthly active

1028
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,703
Streamers which was more than the 550000 at twitch had

1029
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:13,823
And China is by far the largest gaming Esports marking the world with approximately

1030
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,407
Over 200 million gamers in 2017

1031
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
And the market is

1032
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,711
Expected to reach

1033
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,807
537 million Gamers spy 2022

1034
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,903
And the market brought in over a hundred million dollars in Revenue last year

1035
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:33,023
So going forward do you think the Esports Market will grow faster in China

1036
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
Elsewhere in the world

1037
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
I already see that

1038
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
If you

1039
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,447
To look at a single game company

1040
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,239

1041
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,287

1048
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,927
Jamie Brook hosting platform is actually the Next Generation off

1049
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
Best choice

1050
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231

1051
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023

Global expansion

1059
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
What was the motivation

00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,943
Behind spitting up
