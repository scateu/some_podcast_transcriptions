90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
The first one

91
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,311

Actually it's

99
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
It's very

100
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
I would say

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,247
I need to enjoy whatever he or she is doing

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,087
The dance that we all in or motivating out this person

113
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
Becomes a bat

114
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879

193
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
What a new

194
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519

00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
I think that's the

199
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
End

200
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
How did you find your way into the field of data analytics

201
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
I think the whole world is in a hyper-connected

202
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Behind the scene

203
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303

Give me Commerce right but I filled out this e-commerce is so fascinating you no end

207
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,919

Internet but also can sell things

209
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,367

I want to do e-commerce

212
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Reason I start

00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,871
If you want everything you know together

216
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
And I figure out and I learn

217
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
And then you know

218
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,599
You seen I shifted my focus from just a computer internet

219
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:06,719
2 e-commerce but funny conversation need to understand the data in the database

220
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Why don't you know everything

221
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
So I learn

222
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
And

223
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
Yeah and then I start to

224
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143

Odesza

233
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,439
Why did you join a LinkedIn after that

234
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
So and that's alright

235
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
What kind of eBay

00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,199
The manager who recruited me enough for that the eBay position

244
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503

Are smaller

248
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,695
EBay

00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
Had the employees or something

250
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,863

251
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655

And that he told me you Simon that usually go to summer Mall

254
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
I didn't understand what he was talking about

255
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
I told him

256
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151

257
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,039

00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
I don't hate

259
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
You didn't understand what I mean

260
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,719
You should really go somewhere you're not you're not growing in a smaller

261
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
He strongly believe I could do better

262
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Are you not in those smaller

263
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
No more do more

264
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
And then he recommended me to

265
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
A couple places you know

266
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
Yeah he's friends

267
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Run

268
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
And then I just

269
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
I got a couple offers

270
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Which is very small back then

271
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Breakfast Mall

272
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
Color keyboard

273
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
More than

274
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
500

275
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
Yeah definitely something like that

276
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
So you are there

277
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
For almost 5 years

278
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
You let him build the Analytics.

279
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
To support their companies monetization

280
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Talk about why analytics was in

281
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Import into LinkedIn and what kind of impact

282
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
Did your team have

283
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Is the

284
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
I think the great the greatest question

285
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,687
Lincoln really respect the data right

286
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
It is part of the

287
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
The company strategy

288
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
You know or is it

289
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
Part of the company culture

290
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
I was just joining LinkedIn

291
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
I remember

292
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,023
Ross Drive data Data Drive money money by Rick Ross

293
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
Clear

294
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,703
And the second piece is you know so I think Lincoln really in power

295
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Employees

296
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
How to use the data

297
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
He's not that I could do this this

298
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
That right

299
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,943
You just say hey we want some driving December result what are you guys can do

300
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,783
And we did a lot of our creative you know and projects

301
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,599
You know a prophecy

302
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Lincoln

303
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
But I think that you know six months ago and I read

304
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Hoffman reached out to publish a book

305
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Cut the

306
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
Please

307
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
Yeah you know that's the case of engine case

308
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Use

309
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
What's the project we deliver

310
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
I think that's the

311
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,871
Internal cross engine to boost a LinkedIn Revenue growth

312
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
That is call that part of the Marlin

313
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Internally

314
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
I think it's increase efficiency

315
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
See by sweetie

316
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Sometimes

317
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Walter Knoll

318
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
I don't know who you are

319
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Daddy

320
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
I'm making me upgrade my

321
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Provocation

322
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:12,991
I'll just stay home because you are working out my family not go to Hawaii

323
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,575
Announce what what exactly have done to

324
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,439
Assigning a used to close one deal for months just to work you guys did

325
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
I can close 3DS in a week

326
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,815
The contact

327
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Yeah what's the mom and seen a relay

328
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
Make me super super happy

329
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
And then the whole team have

330
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
I think that's the ultimate

331
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
The power to

332
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
So what was the exact reason that the conversion

333
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Increase

334
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
Is it because of better targeting

335
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
Better targeting you know

336
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Batter

337
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
Indochino fit

338
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Better messaging

339
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
Better positioning

340
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
The most part is the

341
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
The automation

342
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Writing a salesperson

343
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,047
Lompoc prison while you want to talk about

344
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,655
Seriously speaking you just need to click three buttons

345
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
To generate a PowerPoint

346
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Slides

347
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751

Who can recommend the war

351
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
You know that's a

352
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Cole Haans

353
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Pitch deck

354

355
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
We should really really push the productivity

356
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Toby's repair one

357
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399

Sunday

360
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,335
I remember in video semino internal

361
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
You know they are tracking

362
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
We found that there were

363
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,735
500000 PowerPoint stack

364
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Something like that

365
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,367
A year so we could translate into almost 2,000 data analyst work

366
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
If we do this manually

367
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
And that

368
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
And everything's a customized uniform

369
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Or custom

370
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
That's just the beginning

371
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,631
But also you know I'll be upstairs working on connected

372
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
And then

373
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
Fundamentally changed the way

374
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Lincoln Square

375
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
And this really really make me

376
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Personal fuel

377
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Providence

378
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Yes I can change

379
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
The lights

380
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
So you were making a

381
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
Quick difference

382
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Insidetheville again

383
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Yet many people

384
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
And I

385
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
I can relate to this

386
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Cuz I bought them for 798

387
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
China.

388
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
My neighbor said that there's a ceiling

389
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
4 Chinese in

390
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
The most most Asian

391
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,631
Employees Indians may be an exception most handsome place

392
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
The ceiling

393
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Ben Harper

394
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
Two leadership roles at meteor

395
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Hirelevel

396
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
So

397
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
What kind of examples for lessons

398
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Both positive and negative

399
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
While working at Lincoln is one of

400
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
A performer

401
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
I will start with a positive

402
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
I think I will end up with

403
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
The positive as well

404
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,695
In a piece of everything is two side of story

405
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
But number one is

406
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
I think you know the company culture is very important

407
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,375
Better than YouTube recent results and that you're performing

408
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Right

409
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,215
And that leadership team country colonized AR

410
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
How many grapes can a peephole

411
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
You need to grow them

412
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
I think Lincoln

413
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
At least what I was there in a WhatsApp

414
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Beijinger

415
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
In harmony I give me the opportunity to grow

416
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
You know I

417
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
I think that's very important for any employee no

418
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
Olivia NASA comedy

419
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Panda

420
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Space

421
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
Space is not the the free ride in or free vehicle to bring you your not to the next level

422
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,887
I think person speaking now we need to really work hard and that deliver

423
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Better

424
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
Apartments

425
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
Decide

426
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Feel

427
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
The seating seating problem

428
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,615
So I'll try came back in Little China

429
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:58,015
I understood that this a little bit more than that I was there I was there I talked about all this just a complication you chills

430
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
It's just a

431
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,903
In our Chinese a can of Ira Silo that you know not to uniting much

432
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,071
Right now I don't feel that way you know anymore or I don't feel much about that anymore

433
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,911
I feel you in the are Chinese you know like the engineers

434
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
Number one

435
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,895
So I think you spend too much time in the

436
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
At Sparta in this

437
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:32,575
View we forgot he know we need to grow our leadership skills

438
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,927
Corazon Bonito Crowell management skills we need to grow our business skills

439
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
A part of marketing sells you know

440
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
Everything on the customer and Market

441
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
If we don't have those skills

442
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,935
It's about hard for a person to become the the leader for the company because I

443
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
He or she will not have the

444
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,079
General you know how to manage the whole business

445
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
I think that's the

446
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
A very important learning I have

447
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
The second part is I feel

448
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
If you want to grow leadership skills

449
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Those kind of

450
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Excuse

451
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
That's not right at umich term

452
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Learnable

453
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Bring me to

454
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Learn.

455
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,815
However if we only learn from our only

456
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,375
Securence we won't become a very fixed man

457
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Massage person

458
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
But we have to

459
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,287
Intentionally to expand our an orphan O'Leary

460
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
That you already know I need someone

461
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Really good in this field

462
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Coach osprey

463
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
What does sometimes in life

464
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Myself writing essay

465
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
7 or 80 years ago

466
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,391
I didn't have the awareness writing a someone can

467
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
Colquitt County

468
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
Butter in that view

469
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
Is Annapolis a certain stage

470
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
When someone try to leave

471
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Guide me

472
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Tell me

473
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Something I really do the piano

474
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
I

475
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,799
Star Trek refusing me now.

476
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,151
To lessen.

477
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
Not to mention we got high

478
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Donna Stewart

479
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
So I think in this area

480
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
Could it be expanded

481
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
A much more open-minded

482
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
The man's side

483
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
Someone Cuda guide on the mentor

484
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
This person

485
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
I feel right now it's in somebody in our Chinese community

486
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Exact 2

487
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
How do you spell people

488
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
If we couldn't run today walk together

489
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
We want enough

490
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Much better

491
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
But not just

492
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,479
Simoniz floor by himself or run them they right now

493
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
Just keep learning from practice

494
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
Learning from practice results of anyone

495
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Nicole tour guide

496
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
It's kind of a

497
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Alaska Fusion

498
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
I think the last

499
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
Is the our education system

500
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
I'm not blaming our education system

501
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
So

502
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,703
We didn't the teacher module about a methodology

503
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Off of how to learn

504
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Talk too much about

505
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
How to be right on the final results

506
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,199
So my feeling you know right now I think there's some change you know

507
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Will happen

508
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
In the past several years

509
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
Are Chinese Engineers were in or

510
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,135
A que hora es stay in the Sonoma Valley

511
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
We need to learn the fundamental methodology

512
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
But not just that

513
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
How to get the results

514
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,120
So the Kitchen System Unity

515
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Talk to Matt about the results

516
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Not

517
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
How to learn

518
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Learning

519
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
And finally

520
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
I would say

521
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,968
You and you asking though we have to get a green card we haven't got H-1B we have got there

522
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
Milton Harrison

523
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,088
Those kind of limiting on people's ambitious and

524
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Yunnan

525
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
How to say

526
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
Is a desire

527
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,744
Being more creative I love you more

528
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
So if

529
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
I clean right now

530
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
If I look back

531
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
I just had too much fear

532
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
You know

533
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,824
EBay in LinkedIn everyday lose my job

534
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
So exactly end

535
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
However

536
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
I strongly believe you know us culture

537
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,040
Real encouraging you have your independent thinking you know right

538
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Being creative

539
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Being

540
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Customer-centric for Sandpoint

541
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,464
It's okay not to speak up

542
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,768
You know it's okay to express yourself

543
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Clearly

544
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
And then you know we Scots

545
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984
And that's what I learn how to link him after 9 months in my life

546
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,056
We have to be extremely honest and then

547
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
Brutally Honest by telling the truth

548
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:45,504
You know however I done Monday status care what were the fear

549
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
I had in my mind that's blocked me

550
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Off of being batter

551
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,672
So that's just my personal I said I'm not

552
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
Apply to everyone

553
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
But I

554
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
I recommend you know

555
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Other

556
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,352
I don't

557
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
I don't know what you know you

558
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
You have the same you no problem

559
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
And that

560
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
I think

561
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
I would recommend

562
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
So when we looking at

563
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
You're calling score of Indonesia

564
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
The / last stand

565
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
Decades

566
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
They have done amazing job

567
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
Auto variable

568
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,344
What are the lessons that we can learn from

569
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
Now you see

570
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
A lot of them were

571
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
I seen exactly

572
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
At Harbor and other places in just truly Market

573
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
Though I look at it you know the you know the top five

574
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,240
Fortune 500 writing us out especially for tech companies

575
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Hominy Indian exactive

576
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
Are managing you know

577
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Taobao

578
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Yeah business

579
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
I would say

580
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
Complication adjusting apart up there

581
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Very shallow in a surface you know

582
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Harbor I think deeply

583
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,184
Cultural bias in a writing though I think he knows how they teaching a businessman are almost across the

584
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,840
All the levels and the second is he not a teacher how people collaborate abuse others that's very important

585
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
I almost forgot

586
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,192
Operation is one of the most important thing in Ark

587
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Cracks are also a leader

588
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,824
I think of India employees they know how to collaborate

589
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
How to be collaborative

590
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
How do you know

591
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,968
Keeping your independent thinking

592
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,784
But also can compromise in the final

593
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Find the solution

594
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Also they know how to build an app

595
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,928
That's very important skills

596
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Because if you like me now

597
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
Agree on Samsung

598
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,584
You have to I leave the lobby you know everywhere right now

599
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
Underneath

600
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
And the final Ain't Enough

601
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
Agreement

602
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
So

603
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,264
I think I have a lot of thing to learn I know so

604
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
My feeling is he not so

605
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
They understand you know so the letter

606
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920
A lot better than

607
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Chinese import

608
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,272
Chinese employees of sometimes and they feel if they work

609
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
A hard enough

610
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,368
Fat people recognizing out there

611
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
Actually no no that's wrong

612
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,072
You know and you do your work it's almost like a product-market right

613
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,680
So you only feel that great a product result people know

614
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:18,080
That's a fader you have to email promoters Parker in the right Channel right now

615
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:24,480
You need to have right now

616
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
No it's not that

617
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
It's on the house

618
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
Stop playing politics

619
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
Is the hall

620
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
We make a great idea

621
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
Become a virgin

622
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
So I would have recommended

623
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Chinese

624
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Learn.

625
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,104
That's very important on basic skills

626
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
Anyone

627
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
Want to be successful in the company

628
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
Search for Chinese

629
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Folks in

630
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
But it's gray less

631
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Anyone

632
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
Young 22

633
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,928
Can I move up in the corporate ladder and do more make more impact life

634
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,816
Arby's in Lawton then I move back to the Bay Area in 2013 was felt like you

635
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,632
I learned a lot from being on the court of a Battlefield

636
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
In China for 8 years

637
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
You see so much and see that this is a TI something this

638
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Toughest Marquis Memorial

639
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Do

640
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,848
Have you see where or even goes.

641
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
I thought you were getting a second

642
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
Sorry I didn't on the podcast

643
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,760
Not even a little bit

644
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
He's dachshunds are sassy

645
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
Naches tennis Pacific

646
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
The great lessons

647
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,952
Then it's probably the motivation of doing nine at six podcast

648
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Is that they're not there maybe

649
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
Starting to China contact

650
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
But the implication

651
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,656
Application is actually quite Global Beyonce

652
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,032
I think another reason for that phenomena is a self-selection bias

653
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
So a lot of enterprising Chinese

654
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
People at Silicon Valley Tech companies actually moved

655
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,992
Back to China to either join or start companies like you did

656
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
So

657
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,832
There's kind of

658
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,136
Seal of officer at LinkedIn

659
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,928
Would you still have come back to China

660
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Heart attack

661
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,816
And this is a part of town is that India has is that you have so many Graces us with Indian exact

662
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,840
Eclipse in the US

663
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
What day

664
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
Be able to give her up

665
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,680
Justin bubak

666
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
To India

667
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
If I were already on the fourth minus list 5 years in a row

668
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
Mus what I give up

669
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
To go to China

670
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
Not so easy but interesting is that by

671
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Both places

672
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
The things you will learn

673
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Become quite powerful

674
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Anyway that you wouldn't have

675
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
You've just staying one place

676
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
That's exactly right

677
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
You know that's almost like

678
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
The story you shared it with me your hands remember

679
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
You're sure it was me

680
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,840
You did a lot of research on the Japan history

681
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
You learn a lot

682
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:54,240
My feeling is you know when you told me that story at the moment I connected

683
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
So if I stay in Silicon Valley

684
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
Advice on my career

685
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,896
I would have never learned this new language

686
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
Even though we talk Chinese

687
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,272
I am in Chinese I came back to the China Market

688
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
I just learned so much

689
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,928
It's almost like a new world that's my 20s know that I learned

690
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:18,048
And then you know so you know I IRA flag out this is

691
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
China Market

692
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
For me it's almost like

693
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
Japanese

694
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
I was learning taina

695
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,776
He really enjoy learning history

696
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
I think that's enough to teach me

697
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Afghanistan batter

698
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Customer

699
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
You decide to come back to

700
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
China Warriors go

701
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
And you decided

702
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Do

703
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
Take a punch in the edifice

704
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880

00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,608
Seoul local market

708
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,424
Adidas right Against All Odds

709
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
Viable business today

710
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,544
What are the some of the early challenges he have to

711
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Too Faced and how did you end up solving them with

712
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,016
You can pick two or three

713
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:15,648
I would have say naso coming back to China you know building a startup

714
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,696
Building enterprise software

715
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
You not being a startup person

716
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
All this for me

717
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
What's the computer new

718
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
You know I think that the reason because

719
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,168
Do this in the sunlight

720
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
You know because of whole

721
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
You know

722
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
The personal

723
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
A or B

724
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
I look back

725
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,432
I would have say I should have a better understanding of

726
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Part of my cassette

727
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,040
Right I should understand in a different state you know

728
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
WhatsApp

729
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,136
Nor should they sit first time light bill

730
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Starbucks

731
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
So we made a lot of mistakes

732
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,256
I think the most important one is

733
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
Under the market

734
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
But not just

735
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Book song

736
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
The technology be

737
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
Or the technology dream of you

738
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,568
We had in a full-time customer on the market

739
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:09,152
This is in the first lesson I would like to share with anyone

740
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,248
Wang computer startup you know you're any Market the second part is you know

I learned a little bit

743
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
It's a virus that leave it to earlier too much money a little bit too much money

744
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,768
You not doing the Cersei or you know early stage

745
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
That's actually clowder

746
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
A lot of things

747
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,704
Because we can do marketing we can do a lot of things

748
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,264
Early signal

749
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,592
If I had the less money

750
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
I would have to do is like a different

751
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,736
I recommend you no other

No marking

755
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368

758
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Become smooth

759
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960

Transino check

762
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,504
You know it's kind of a

763
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
I don't know that I even did not know that

764
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
Supposed to be the forecast

765
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
Even someone told me

766
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,792
Enough about 2 because it's not resonating always me at the moment

767
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:34,400
Then I made a lot of mistakes so high

768
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
Other entrepreneurs

769
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
They should agree.

770
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264

You don't know

776
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
We don't know

777
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,368
And that's why tweeting of each that's right

778
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,024
I think a lot of founders of us especially in China sees fundraising as a signal for a 6S

779
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
But as long as we close around evaluations High we are successful company

780
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
Pressure and like you said Can dilute your focus

781
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,288
So there could be a downside

782
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
To that as well

783
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,408
Different type of culture

Talk about valuation and money race too much

793
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Is reporters are so jaded

794
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
But they don't want none

795
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Report IU makes a lot of money

796
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008

00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,040
Not America southeast Asia India Emerging Markets very easy

00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
So what what recommendations do you have

810
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216

811
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
Chinese employees at Silicon Valley

812
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
Tech companies were interested in

813
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Coming back to China

814
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104

Really want

821
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
You know and I would have say

822
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
Here in China

823
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
This is acid

824
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Significant

825
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Historical points

826
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,048
You know people can come back

827
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
To become someone memorable

828
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
You know you human history

829
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
So this is the

830
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
The place

831
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
The Next Generation

Greatest Enterprises

833
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
So I would have say

834
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Someone in Silicon Valley

835
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,944

836
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,504
They are you know how does ambitious

837
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,808
Now they really want to do something about it being

838
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
I'm creative

839
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,160
Is the market in Elkin North Shore the greatest

840
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
No entrepreneur

841
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
I think that you know

842
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
In the next 5 or 10 years

843
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
So this opportunity

844
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
Really

845
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
Make sure to come back

846
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
I think some of them.

847
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,752
They might make me regret

848
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
You know this.

849
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,360
A lifetime opportunity enough for a lot of work

850
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,200
Young Smart well-educated engineer azure

851
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
Writing on Chinese

852
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Noah Fox

853
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
The two sinks

854
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
Coming back

855
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
If I say

856
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
I've heard a

857
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
It got to become a VP

858
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,744
He already come some scenery rakiraki or whatever

859
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,840
Golden chance and also kids family houses your car

860
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
It's harder and harder for them to come back

861
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,728
Right now I think it's the opportunity for them to

862
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
Play in this stuff

863
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
Nephew

864
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
They have nothing to lose

865
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Right

866
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
I almost you know

867
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,920
What are three or 45 years old

868
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Yeah

869
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
They are much younger than me

870
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504
They have nothing to lose

871
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
So

872
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,064
Again

873
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Eva

874
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
The process would be very painful

875
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,184
I would ever come and lean on them too

876
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
The Comeback that's the story I told it

877
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,560
Some of the employees in The Green Mile

878
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,120
I told him you know just a lifetime you know you haven't

879
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,728
By heart

880
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
This is the place you know for people to

881
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
Become better

882
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
And yeah

883
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
And also

884
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,920
Analyze the environment right thing about the crashing

885
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,968
Has just asked me you know this

886
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Other

887
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Country is exactly manager

888
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,368
Think about it if you want to grow your marketing you on The Fun Song lyrics

889
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Isalita

890
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
Competition

891
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,232
You want some

892
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,048
34

893
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,120
Chinese people who stay in Silicon Valley

894
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,936
But I mean here in China

895
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
I would have

896
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,776
A lot of people

897
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,824
Are trying to figure out the timing issue

898
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:03,200
How long should I stay in the US before coming back cuz if you stay too short

899
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,808
The premium of what you can bring back his limited but if you stay too long you get settled

900
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,696
Keyboard also worried about the economic uncertainties facing China right now

901
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,864
You don't disagree crashing you know

902
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:27,520
Is there anything you know about the outside

903
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,104
You know what

904
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Best

905
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
That's come out

906
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
For my part personal point of view

907
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,320
I would say timing isn't the most important

908
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
Every single sobcon choir

909
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,440
If your wife think improves and we can learn anything

910
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
Harmon Auto

911
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
Because everything

912
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Having an environment

913
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Requirements

914
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
It's much more efficient than

915
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Doing something

916
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,336
I would say this the place this battlefield

917
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
Learn in the battlefield

918
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
Right now

919
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Better schools

920
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
And you know

921
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
Just being in that environment

922
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,744
I think that the question is our rates are very legitimate and we hear that from a lot of

923
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,304
Folks who listen to 96

924
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,936
What comes out relaxed

925
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:31,264
Who else will hear from a lot of people who made that confession box it.

926
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
The first thing you do is

927
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
It's not worried about

928
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
That you were Superior

929
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
You cannot think that you know me

930
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,456
You have to be more humble and learn

931
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
To sit in here in China Mall

932
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
So if that's the case

933
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,088
It is much harder for someone woke

934
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Acquire that

935
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
Domain expertise

936
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,768
Bought something when you come back

937
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
Is most the time it doesn't

938
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,168
Either you're AI or machine learning specialist are you going to come back and stay

939
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,728
IAAI enrichment specialist

940
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
You can acquire expertise in the US and come back

941
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
When you have achieved it

942
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,872
The chance of you becoming a business leader

943
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
And do your startup in China

944
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
It's not going to be high

945
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,504
Because your mentality is always

946
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
He's already like IMAX Park

947

And then I also live in a different about people

1024
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,392
It told me I didn't have that problem with her

1025
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,024
Only you have that a problem with her okay then let me think about that.

1026
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
The problem is you know so

1027
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
I didn t know

1028
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Aware

1029
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
The problem

1030
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
I had

1031
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
Frases Amor Papa

1032
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
I have to change myself

1033
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,336

Go to China

1035
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
I become a little bit more

1036
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,968
I wish I could be more open

1037
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,528
People give me a feedback

1038
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
You know open mind

1039
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
Nintendo myself

1040
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
So I think that's the

1041
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
The largest

1042
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440

1043
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720

1049
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
A criticism

1050
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,288
And the people are self

1051
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,336
I think that the second part is

1052
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
In business

1053
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,919
The are so many great and knowledge in

1054
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Ingenerate

1055
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
In the history

1056
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
Because we are

1057
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
Seoul

1058
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063

1062
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,975
We made a lot of

1063
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
Cost

1064
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
Based on

1065
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
Personal.

1066
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
These are the facts

1067
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
So I mean we have to learn from the

1068
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
We have to learn from them

1069
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
We have to learn from

1070
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Making mistakes

1071
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
I need to be quick

1072
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Keep on making the same mistake

1073
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
For five years

1074
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
I think that company

1075
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431

1077
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
And keep them

1078
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
What one of my theories that assume that

1079
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Everybody

1080
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
Simile smart

1081
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
To get the right answer

1082
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
You have to go through

1083
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
Similar number of

1084
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Mistakes

1085
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
You could be Chinese

1086
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:49,983

At 6 to get there

1089
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,639
Used to be that somebody go to the process and a second-team can

1090
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
Copy and clone and take shortcut

1091
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
It's so you

1092
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
You get over it quickly

1093
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
You didn't have to go through some numbers

1094
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
But as

1095
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391

They got me going to get a ride

1099
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
So having said that

1100
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,631
Do you feel that

1101
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,191
We'll look at China vs. US have been working both places

We just see the breaker and it just really partigyle before it's ready

1113
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287

1138
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,079
Stop

1139
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,127
You know stabbing to that appeal.

1140
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Ross

1141
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,783
Another common criticism of Johnny stems from

1142
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
That's a big lottery is that

1143
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,599
Yeah there's no work life

1144
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Dallas

1145
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:18,719
Innovation for a long time

1146
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
And if we want to see

1147
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
Stay creative stay fresh

1148
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
Unipig timeout

1149
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
Think about things to yourself healthy and so far

1150
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,423
Is very legitimate

1151
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
In China what do you say

1152
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
And what do you practice

1153
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
Do you worry about life

1154
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Work-life balance here

1155
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,663
And you can see teams work 9:16 a.m. to 9 p.m.

1156
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,991
This week's events

1157
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
Deport efficient and

1158
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
Car proven

1159
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,135
The same time what do you have to choose

1160
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
We were just a creative Innovative for them.

1161
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
This is a great question

1162
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,815
Why wasn't working in the valley I was working very hard

1163
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,863
You know come carries my

1164
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,911
Colleagues or my peers

1165
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,959
I think that was one reason you know

1166
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239
I could

1167
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,567
Get promoted faster than normal

1168
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
How to remove back

1169
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
I found

1170
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,711
Every single company you know in China almost

1171
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
You know

1172
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
From

1173
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
Baidu tencent

1174
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,087
You know everyone's

1175
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
Zohar

1176
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
You know writing us all

1177
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
Prism clean out recently be harder

1178
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
A summer coming in

1179
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,791
I don't know annual I knew parties right

1180
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:33,215
Last chance will 96 and tomorrow something I got you know you speeding I recently

1181
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Butter

1182
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
My feeling is Tina so

1183
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
Having a clear goal

1184
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
CPAP delivery

1185
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
It's very important

1186
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
You know he's any Market

1187
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:45,503
Right if your competitors you know they doing much more working out then

1188
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,391
Do you want ya and I-55 and I have a company

1189
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
I would have said this company would

1190
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,143
So in China market near you have to

1191
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,215
Harder than us company

1192
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,263
Who survived in this market

1193
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,591
Even Alibaba you know the building is just

1194
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Couple blocks

1195
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,663
From my room

1196
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,015
You know you could have see at 11 or 10 p.m.

1197
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
11

1198
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
The whole building is almost there

1199
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,927
The dancer

1200
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Peer pressure

1201
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
I would say

1202
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,999
Around the other side

1203
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,327
I definitely think you know how to keep a certain level of

1204
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
You know space

1205
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
4 people tent

1206
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
I'm too deep thinking you know

1207
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
Cool effects on work

1208
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:42,079
But not jesting Buy hours

1209
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
How many hours we were

1210
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
Steel

1211
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
Country song believer

1212
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
But there should be some balance

1213
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,551
You asked me depression

1214
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
The first time I move back

1215
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
China

1216
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
We walk almost there

1217
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
Oo7

1218
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,511
Almost 7 7 days a week

1219
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,351
We won the home around in Oswego 4 a.m. in the morning

1220
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,703
We came back around 9 to 10 a.m. in the morning in morning

1221
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
Lbb

1222
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
We just have all faced under

1223
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,271
I think I almost nine months I'll be feeling we could enter

1224
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Evo

1225
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:29,439
Think it's not

1226
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,815
997 bus 7 days a half day we can talk all we can take off

1227
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,655
Steal your fill out this is so exhausted and then we have to learn ballet

1228
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,495
I was a tree company sure that she like that Tina and balancing point

1229
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
Butter to a certain level

1230
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
So what is your schedule now

1231
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,919
I recommend a national founders

1232
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
Antidepressant

1233
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,503
Because I've been day

1234
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
Go somewhere else

1235
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Right now

1236
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
Computer shutdown

1237
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
The Our Father

1238
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
Become a clear

1239
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
And before

1240
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,975
Right when they occupied today's

1241
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,535
Is far harder to make the right decision

1242
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:11,167
That's the recommendation I've been given by my friends and my pierced sometimes in my

1243
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,983
The unit on the couch

1244
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
So I learn

1245
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,311
A lot better than before

1246
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,359
So I would say there is a balance

1247
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
What is the schedule

1248
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Still

1249
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:32,159
96x

1250
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
I go to the office Elizabeth Sunday

1251
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,767
Quieter

1252
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
I can think of

1253
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
Maybe you know

1254
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
But the reason why I start managing you

1255
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,543
19 out of the bathroom but your share with me right now

1256
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,823
Funny story

1257
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,127
I think I need to learn a little bit how other people

1258
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,503
Always occupied by myself by my old house

1259
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
I don't change

1260
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,647
I'm also fascinated in Japanese sweetheart

1261
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,975
Some of them some of them can achieve

1262
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
Be able to think

1263
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Reflect

1264
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
And still be able to

1265
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Aggressively inquicker

1266
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,631
As needed

1267
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,679
How can you do both well

1268
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Insult me

1269
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
I've never questions

1270
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Juice

1271
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
Efficient and

1272
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,079
X

1273
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
Or you were

1274
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
Then I 607

1275
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
And you're not

1276
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
See that you have to choose

1277
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
I think there's a way to do both

1278
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
And that's a higher form

1279
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,575
I'm working in the quiver can do that

1280
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
Will be the most effective

1281
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,999
I wanted to ship the topic to gross you wrote a book

1282
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Call Chief growth officer

1283
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
In Chinese

1284
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,887
Which for many Chinese people was their first exposure to the

1285
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
The concept of data-driven

1286
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Gross

1287
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,263
About time gross as a term was already

1288
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,591
Frequently heard in the valley but still relatively novel in China

1289
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
So what do you think are the

1290
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Major differences

1291
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,967
Is between Chinese dog growth and Silicon Valley stop

1292
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,527
I think Chinese Worsham braless

1293
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,599
Some more like the numbers right number so users you know

1294
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,903
Number off of unity MVR

1295
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
Number Alpha

1296
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,535
I think not symptomatic Rose which means you use a science use data

1297
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
To grow efficiently

1298
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
I know you mad at your

1299
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,679
What part of life cycle you know smart play

1300
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,287
Percy of Fox on the Run maybe you and Eve he apologized become the part of my tooth

1301
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
If it stays you know finally retention

1302
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,127
Adeste to you should not

1303
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,967
The booster you know the number of Ross

1304
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,527
You know you'll figure out the channel fit

1305
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
And thank you

1306
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
You are saturated

1307
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,903
Across almost exactly what Lincoln did

1308
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,207
In the past 15 years right

1309
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
Stage by stage

1310
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,047
And harbin China

1311
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,351
Like it was answering the question he asked me

1312
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,191
Play

1313
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:52,959
Depot

1314
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
De nada

1315
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Time

1316
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,543
Do this is so classic

1317
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,895
I would have Saginaw Chinese market the folk song

1318
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
By using what I wrote it

1319
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:14,975
Right at the moment you said I'm the other bees them all.

1320
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,999
You know

1321
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,047
So

1322
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
