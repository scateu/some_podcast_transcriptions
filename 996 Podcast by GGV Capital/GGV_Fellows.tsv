EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:12,639	| GGV_Fellows |	Interesting
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,407	| GGV_Fellows |	Ideology
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,479	| GGV_Fellows |	So basically if you look hot the US elections

EDL	00:15:54,111	00:15:55,391	| GGV_Fellows |	And then there also the
EDL	00:15:55,391	00:15:56,927	| GGV_Fellows |	Ancient Enlightenment was
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:58,719	| GGV_Fellows |	The published statements

EDL	00:16:01,791	00:16:04,863	| GGV_Fellows |	Which candidate would give them a higher perceived utility
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:09,215	| GGV_Fellows |	Invigilator noises and people are irrational or misinformed

EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:17,919	| GGV_Fellows |	Fascinating
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:20,735	| GGV_Fellows |	So from there with his go next
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:23,551	| GGV_Fellows |	So from there I was one day given this report on Syria
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,599	| GGV_Fellows |	About to friend Ida logical group
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:26,367	| GGV_Fellows |	UPS in Syria

EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:31,487	| GGV_Fellows |	And I traced back to the author of that document
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:34,047	| GGV_Fellows |	Turn on Pandora.
EDL	00:16:34,047	00:16:35,583	| GGV_Fellows |	Practice was an alumni
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| GGV_Fellows |	And so with a minor present
EDL	00:16:36,863	00:16:37,375	| GGV_Fellows |	Once I reach home
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:39,679	| GGV_Fellows |	It's pretty cool

EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:49,151	| GGV_Fellows |	Meet you to tell them to go full-time offer Nashville
EDL	00:16:49,663	00:16:51,455	| GGV_Fellows |	And I joined the firm

EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,375	| GGV_Fellows |	And
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:09,887	| GGV_Fellows |	The general customer
EDL	00:17:10,399	00:17:12,191	| GGV_Fellows |	Horoscope from there too
EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,519	| GGV_Fellows |	I think it would help me to build a lot of more solid engineering
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,287	| GGV_Fellows |	Technical skills
EDL	00:17:16,287	00:17:17,823	| GGV_Fellows |	And I felt
EDL	00:17:17,823	00:17:20,127	| GGV_Fellows |	It was this insufficiency for me personally
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:21,151	| GGV_Fellows |	In terms of
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:24,223	| GGV_Fellows |	And actually have a couple of offers
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:24,735	| GGV_Fellows |	At the same time
EDL	00:17:25,247	00:17:26,527	| GGV_Fellows |	I wanted them I still remember when
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,295	| GGV_Fellows |	Br
EDL	00:17:27,295	00:17:28,063	| GGV_Fellows |	Content strategy
EDL	00:17:28,063	00:17:28,831	| GGV_Fellows |	She manager for Coursera

EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:35,743	| GGV_Fellows |	But my argument myself is that
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:37,791	| GGV_Fellows |	I think it's easier to
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:40,351	| GGV_Fellows |	Go with the technical track and Adrian track
EDL	00:17:40,351	00:17:41,375	| GGV_Fellows |	When you're younger because
EDL	00:17:41,887	00:17:44,191	| GGV_Fellows |	Everything faster in the morning verses
EDL	00:17:44,703	00:17:47,007	| GGV_Fellows |	If I go for managerial Consulting tracking
EDL	00:17:47,519	00:17:48,799	| GGV_Fellows |	Do an MBA I think it's
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:50,079	| GGV_Fellows |	Much more difficult to
EDL	00:17:50,079	00:17:51,359	| GGV_Fellows |	Come back to
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:53,407	| GGV_Fellows |	Mechanical field because the pace of
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:54,431	| GGV_Fellows |	Innovation
EDL	00:17:54,431	00:17:55,455	| GGV_Fellows |	Ana peso
EDL	00:17:55,455	00:17:57,503	| GGV_Fellows |	Change in the type what is just so fast
EDL	00:17:58,015	00:17:59,807	| GGV_Fellows |	And I want to stay tuned
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,319	| GGV_Fellows |	Until I'm ready
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:06,463	| GGV_Fellows |	So you were in school at UPenn a retile operating about his research
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:07,743	| GGV_Fellows |	And ends up working for monitor
EDL	00:18:08,255	00:18:10,815	| GGV_Fellows |	And so does the internet become full-time
EDL	00:18:11,327	00:18:13,631	| GGV_Fellows |	Then how did you go from monitor to
EDL	00:18:14,399	00:18:17,983	| GGV_Fellows |	Swear words what city were you in for monitors lanzhou
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:22,079	| GGV_Fellows |	There's three are former
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,591	| GGV_Fellows |	Kumon

EDL	00:18:24,383	00:18:25,151	| GGV_Fellows |	Okay
EDL	00:18:25,151	00:18:28,479	| GGV_Fellows |	And then nothing for the barrier then how'd it go for monitor 2
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,319	| GGV_Fellows |	I realized that
EDL	00:18:32,831	00:18:33,343	| GGV_Fellows |	I would
EDL	00:18:33,855	00:18:35,391	| GGV_Fellows |	Not sufficiently trained
EDL	00:18:35,391	00:18:36,927	| GGV_Fellows |	And and Technical and Engineering background
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:39,999	| GGV_Fellows |	For me I basically Middleton
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:40,767	| GGV_Fellows |	Concord has to be better
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:42,047	| GGV_Fellows |	A young age
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,815	| GGV_Fellows |	To concentrate
EDL	00:18:43,583	00:18:45,119	| GGV_Fellows |	On a technical track until I'm ready to mate
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| GGV_Fellows |	The jump entirely

EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| GGV_Fellows |	At a time
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:57,151	| GGV_Fellows |	Until the end of Seventeen
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:58,687	| GGV_Fellows |	And I got a call from recruiter

EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:32,479	| GGV_Fellows |	If you feel that by doing this theme
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:34,783	| GGV_Fellows |	Prove your technical background and experience
EDL	00:19:34,783	00:19:36,063	| GGV_Fellows |	I think it does
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:38,367	| GGV_Fellows |	And I think one of the things I did not realize

EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,951	| GGV_Fellows |	There's an inherent

EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:48,607	| GGV_Fellows |	So when I was a monitor
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,911	| GGV_Fellows |	Our clients are we looking at

EDL	00:19:56,031	00:19:57,311	| GGV_Fellows |	This kind of probing questions
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:19:59,871	| GGV_Fellows |	But an apple whenever we doubled neighbors and relatives

EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,711	| GGV_Fellows |	We're serving in hundreds of millions a day
EDL	00:20:03,711	00:20:05,759	| GGV_Fellows |	So I think that's really valuable
EDL	00:20:05,759	00:20:08,575	| GGV_Fellows |	Burns and then also really helps you in and almost
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:09,087	| GGV_Fellows |	Fortitude
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:10,367	| GGV_Fellows |	To sing

EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,999	| GGV_Fellows |	And then when you are at Applebee's you ever
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:17,535	| GGV_Fellows |	See anyone around you do a startup
EDL	00:20:18,047	00:20:20,607	| GGV_Fellows |	How did you come to know about innovation in a

EDL	00:20:22,655	00:20:23,935	| GGV_Fellows |	Sure I think

EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:36,223	| GGV_Fellows |	Late for him to
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,015	| GGV_Fellows |	But anyways
EDL	00:20:38,015	00:20:40,831	| GGV_Fellows |	As an entrepreneurship I have always
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,599	| GGV_Fellows |	In a firm believer
EDL	00:20:42,879	00:20:44,415	| GGV_Fellows |	Startup life
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:45,439	| GGV_Fellows |	In order to
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:46,719	| GGV_Fellows |	To do great things
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:48,511	| GGV_Fellows |	And I would say for anyone
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:49,535	| GGV_Fellows |	With a mission
EDL	00:20:49,535	00:20:51,327	| GGV_Fellows |	To realize their dreams they should
EDL	00:20:51,327	00:20:52,607	| GGV_Fellows |	Try to work for themselves

EDL	00:20:54,655	00:20:56,191	| GGV_Fellows |	Or at least appear to Fairlife
EDL	00:20:56,703	00:20:57,471	| GGV_Fellows |	To at least
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:58,495	| GGV_Fellows |	1
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:00,799	| GGV_Fellows |	To build something they believe in
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,591	| GGV_Fellows |	And that's my
EDL	00:21:02,591	00:21:04,383	| GGV_Fellows |	Personal credle so to speak
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,687	| GGV_Fellows |	And I've always been seeking opportunities to do so
EDL	00:21:06,687	00:21:08,479	| GGV_Fellows |	I have done
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:09,503	| GGV_Fellows |	One side of back
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,527	| GGV_Fellows |	When I was in grad school
EDL	00:21:10,527	00:21:13,599	| GGV_Fellows |	And my last social apps that after you start funding
EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:14,623	| GGV_Fellows |	But in the same time I realized
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:15,903	| GGV_Fellows |	Dongguan
EDL	00:21:15,903	00:21:16,928	| GGV_Fellows |	Fashion
EDL	00:21:16,928	00:21:18,720	| GGV_Fellows |	And we had a very competitive
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,256	| GGV_Fellows |	Competitor
EDL	00:21:20,256	00:21:22,560	| GGV_Fellows |	By the time we launched and didn't go quite well
EDL	00:21:24,352	00:21:25,376	| GGV_Fellows |	Persisted to me
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:27,168	| GGV_Fellows |	Truckin personally for me at this stage
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:29,216	| GGV_Fellows |	I think I'm trying to be
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:29,984	| GGV_Fellows |	Much
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:32,800	| GGV_Fellows |	Technical background as I can but and also
EDL	00:21:33,312	00:21:34,592	| GGV_Fellows |	Nepeta important actions
EDL	00:21:34,592	00:21:35,616	| GGV_Fellows |	That will become you
EDL	00:21:36,640	00:21:37,664	| GGV_Fellows |	When I do decide
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,688	| GGV_Fellows |	And find out what I meant
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,736	| GGV_Fellows |	I say you can race
EDL	00:21:41,248	00:21:42,016	| GGV_Fellows |	$5000000
EDL	00:21:42,784	00:21:44,064	| GGV_Fellows |	What will be your
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,344	| GGV_Fellows |	Startup idea
EDL	00:21:45,856	00:21:46,368	| GGV_Fellows |	That you will
EDL	00:21:46,880	00:21:47,392	| GGV_Fellows |	Tailspin
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:50,720	| GGV_Fellows |	I think there are two considerations hours
EDL	00:21:51,232	00:21:51,744	| GGV_Fellows |	When I want to do start
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:53,280	| GGV_Fellows |	1 East Howe
EDL	00:21:54,048	00:21:54,816	| GGV_Fellows |	Confident I am
EDL	00:21:54,816	00:21:55,840	| GGV_Fellows |	To realize
EDL	00:21:56,352	00:21:57,120	| GGV_Fellows |	And secondly how
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:58,144	| GGV_Fellows |	Image of a possum
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:00,192	| GGV_Fellows |	I
EDL	00:22:00,192	00:22:01,216	| GGV_Fellows |	I've always been
EDL	00:22:01,216	00:22:02,752	| GGV_Fellows |	Actually don't be thinking about
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,032	| GGV_Fellows |	In the area of
EDL	00:22:04,032	00:22:04,800	| GGV_Fellows |	Strong
EDL	00:22:04,800	00:22:05,312	| GGV_Fellows |	In general
EDL	00:22:05,824	00:22:06,592	| GGV_Fellows |	Halogens
EDL	00:22:06,592	00:22:07,872	| GGV_Fellows |	And language understanding
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:09,408	| GGV_Fellows |	I think this will be
EDL	00:22:09,920	00:22:11,200	| GGV_Fellows |	Critical trend
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:12,224	| GGV_Fellows |	The next
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:13,760	| GGV_Fellows |	4 reasons
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:15,040	| GGV_Fellows |	That almost obvious
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,624	| GGV_Fellows |	Number one there will be a new form and much more efficient
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,904	| GGV_Fellows |	A natural form
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| GGV_Fellows |	Of human computer interfacing
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:27,584	| GGV_Fellows |	So wouldn't using clicking and typing as major form of making with computer systems
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:29,120	| GGV_Fellows |	Ever since the invention of
EDL	00:22:29,120	00:22:31,168	| GGV_Fellows |	Mustafa Centre now
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:31,936	| GGV_Fellows |	But
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| GGV_Fellows |	Don't cut program to
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:35,520	| GGV_Fellows |	Just use our fingers going
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:39,360	| GGV_Fellows |	Natural form of communication for anyone as we're doing right now
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:40,384	| GGV_Fellows |	Aswetalk
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:42,688	| GGV_Fellows |	And this really requires
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:43,968	| GGV_Fellows |	This computer system
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:45,248	| GGV_Fellows |	How to say
EDL	00:22:45,248	00:22:46,016	| GGV_Fellows |	Capability
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:48,576	| GGV_Fellows |	To fully understand and take in
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,856	| GGV_Fellows |	What's our intent are
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,160	| GGV_Fellows |	A language system would help bridge the gap
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:55,744	| GGV_Fellows |	And I think it has two very important applications for 1
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:22:57,280	| GGV_Fellows |	If you think in terms of human
EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,304	| GGV_Fellows |	Computer interface
EDL	00:22:58,304	00:22:59,584	| GGV_Fellows |	This will help
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:00,096	| GGV_Fellows |	To bring
EDL	00:23:00,608	00:23:02,400	| GGV_Fellows |	Technology so much more personal
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,960	| GGV_Fellows |	And Incredibly easy to use
EDL	00:23:04,960	00:23:08,032	| GGV_Fellows |	Even people who have no computer skills at all
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,824	| GGV_Fellows |	And now I believe there are plenty
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:13,664	| GGV_Fellows |	And secondly their massive shows of data
EDL	00:23:13,664	00:23:14,944	| GGV_Fellows |	Existing
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:16,224	| GGV_Fellows |	In the anticipation
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:17,760	| GGV_Fellows |	In a broader public domain
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:19,040	| GGV_Fellows |	Star in text
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,576	| GGV_Fellows |	And and not
EDL	00:23:20,576	00:23:22,112	| GGV_Fellows |	In any other form
EDL	00:23:22,112	00:23:24,416	| GGV_Fellows |	Anhui country of still doing
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:25,952	| GGV_Fellows |	Streamwood matching
EDL	00:23:25,952	00:23:30,816	| GGV_Fellows |	Define information and we have hummus reading analyst reading through
EDL	00:23:30,816	00:23:32,864	| GGV_Fellows |	Pages of Shopkins from Prospectors
EDL	00:23:32,864	00:23:35,680	| GGV_Fellows |	To due diligence documents to files and in Shreveport
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:38,240	| GGV_Fellows |	To get maybe one or two
EDL	00:23:38,240	00:23:40,032	| GGV_Fellows |	Useful pieces animation right
EDL	00:23:40,032	00:23:41,824	| GGV_Fellows |	But what if the computer had
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,592	| GGV_Fellows |	Speakability
EDL	00:23:42,592	00:23:43,360	| GGV_Fellows |	To read
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:44,128	| GGV_Fellows |	Thomas 10
EDL	00:23:44,128	00:23:44,640	| GGV_Fellows |	To summarize
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:46,176	| GGV_Fellows |	And also to
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,944	| GGV_Fellows |	Do the Cure
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:47,712	| GGV_Fellows |	In
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:49,248	| GGV_Fellows |	An ear or superhuman
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:50,016	| GGV_Fellows |	Level
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:52,576	| GGV_Fellows |	I think there have been some sort of stew in the area
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:58,208	| GGV_Fellows |	And some vertical Industries during this already but I think it's still a relatively underdeveloped field
EDL	00:23:58,208	00:23:59,488	| GGV_Fellows |	That is inherently challenging
EDL	00:24:00,000	00:24:00,768	| GGV_Fellows |	Ana procedure
EDL	00:24:00,768	00:24:01,792	| GGV_Fellows |	Like challenging
EDL	00:24:01,792	00:24:05,376	| GGV_Fellows |	Is natural language processing a very specific domain
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:06,400	| GGV_Fellows |	Vertical use
EDL	00:24:06,400	00:24:08,448	| GGV_Fellows |	People pay a premium for it
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,216	| GGV_Fellows |	The benefits
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:09,984	| GGV_Fellows |	Garden rakes
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:13,824	| GGV_Fellows |	That's a good idea
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:18,176	| GGV_Fellows |	So now you're at Apple Cupertino in the new campus amazing
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,456	| GGV_Fellows |	Is very easy to
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:21,504	| GGV_Fellows |	Just working for the rest of your life
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:22,272	| GGV_Fellows |	Never leave
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:24,832	| GGV_Fellows |	It's so beautiful and so self-sufficient
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,648	| GGV_Fellows |	What prompt you to decide to apply for today
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:28,160	| GGV_Fellows |	Movie Palace
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:29,952	| GGV_Fellows |	The first of all about apples
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:30,976	| GGV_Fellows |	Campuses in
EDL	00:24:31,744	00:24:32,256	| GGV_Fellows |	Amazing
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:33,536	| GGV_Fellows |	But
EDL	00:24:33,536	00:24:34,816	| GGV_Fellows |	In terms of why I wanted
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:36,096	| GGV_Fellows |	Apply for Lowe's
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,888	| GGV_Fellows |	Obviously I do have
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:38,912	| GGV_Fellows |	The dreaming long-term
EDL	00:24:39,424	00:24:40,448	| GGV_Fellows |	To do something
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,984	| GGV_Fellows |	And to be good at it
EDL	00:24:41,984	00:24:42,752	| GGV_Fellows |	And make an impact
EDL	00:24:43,264	00:24:44,800	| GGV_Fellows |	That's very tangible and personal
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,080	| GGV_Fellows |	I don't believe
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:47,104	| GGV_Fellows |	You can quite do that
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,640	| GGV_Fellows |	And I normally
EDL	00:24:49,152	00:24:49,664	| GGV_Fellows |	Organization
EDL	00:24:50,176	00:24:50,944	| GGV_Fellows |	In any

EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:53,504	| GGV_Fellows |	Secondly
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,808	| GGV_Fellows |	I think we study current economic
EDL	00:24:55,808	00:24:56,320	| GGV_Fellows |	Google trend
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:25:00,160	| GGV_Fellows |	China is taking an Advil increasingly important bro
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:01,184	| GGV_Fellows |	On what stage
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,952	| GGV_Fellows |	Economically
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,744	| GGV_Fellows |	It'll be a natural thing to do
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,792	| GGV_Fellows |	To be in those environment
EDL	00:25:06,304	00:25:08,096	| GGV_Fellows |	Just like an old-time she would have wanted

EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:45,120	| GGV_Fellows |	And I lived in Hawaii for about 7 years
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:49,728	| GGV_Fellows |	9 move to Connecticut my first stop in the mainland live there for a year
EDL	00:34:50,240	00:34:53,056	| GGV_Fellows |	And I went to middle school and high school in Indiana
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:54,848	| GGV_Fellows |	I went to college at Harvard
EDL	00:34:54,848	00:34:57,920	| GGV_Fellows |	And then lived in San Francisco and Los Angeles
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,712	| GGV_Fellows |	And then last year in
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:01,504	| GGV_Fellows |	July I came back to Beijing
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:07,392	| GGV_Fellows |	Why so I'm a co-founder and CTO at a tech startup with my cousin
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:12,000	| GGV_Fellows |	And we're focusing on English education for the 0 to 6 age range
EDL	00:35:12,512	00:35:18,400	| GGV_Fellows |	And currently most of our development happens on WeChat specifically WeChat mini programs or Sceptile
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:21,728	| GGV_Fellows |	Why did you apply to Jadoo fellows
EDL	00:35:22,240	00:35:26,848	| GGV_Fellows |	So before most of my life and work experience has been in the US
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:31,456	| GGV_Fellows |	So I thought it was a really good opportunity to learn more about Chinese Tech
EDL	00:35:31,456	00:35:34,784	| GGV_Fellows |	And also previously listened to the GV
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:35,808	| GGV_Fellows |	Podcast a lot
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:36,832	| GGV_Fellows |	Got a lot of that
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:40,672	| GGV_Fellows |	I think you're quite special because I have a lot of friends
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:42,720	| GGV_Fellows |	Who spend the vast majority of
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:47,584	| GGV_Fellows |	Their life in the US even though they were born in China and they identify with the term ABC
EDL	00:35:48,096	00:35:50,912	| GGV_Fellows |	American Born Chinese even though they were born in China
EDL	00:35:50,912	00:35:52,192	| GGV_Fellows |	And they may not even
EDL	00:35:52,192	00:35:53,728	| GGV_Fellows |	Speak Chinese
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:58,592	| GGV_Fellows |	Even though you left China at H3 you're still extremely connected with
EDL	00:35:59,104	00:36:03,968	| GGV_Fellows |	Chinese language and culture and still identify as like a Chinese person so
EDL	00:36:03,968	00:36:05,760	| GGV_Fellows |	Could you talk about why that's
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:07,552	| GGV_Fellows |	The case yes I think
EDL	00:36:07,552	00:36:11,392	| GGV_Fellows |	Most of us are very influenced by our parents
EDL	00:36:11,392	00:36:14,720	| GGV_Fellows |	Then my parents I think are pretty different from most
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:19,840	| GGV_Fellows |	You know ABCs parents they study the humanities so my dad is a history professor
EDL	00:36:20,352	00:36:22,656	| GGV_Fellows |	My mom study Chinese in college
EDL	00:36:23,168	00:36:24,192	| GGV_Fellows |	So
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:29,568	| GGV_Fellows |	From a very young age they really cared about me learning about Chinese history in Chinese language
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:32,896	| GGV_Fellows |	I remember as a kid my mom pretty much everyday wood
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:33,664	| GGV_Fellows |	Read
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:36,224	| GGV_Fellows |	Like the Yuan like textbooks
EDL	00:36:36,224	00:36:36,736	| GGV_Fellows |	With me
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,296	| GGV_Fellows |	Even though it was at a slower Pace than
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:40,576	| GGV_Fellows |	Black eye normal
EDL	00:36:40,576	00:36:41,344	| GGV_Fellows |	What Chinese
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:42,112	| GGV_Fellows |	Kid
EDL	00:36:42,112	00:36:43,904	| GGV_Fellows |	But I think even
EDL	00:36:43,904	00:36:45,440	| GGV_Fellows |	With all of that
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:46,976	| GGV_Fellows |	After coming to China
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:49,536	| GGV_Fellows |	I've had to downgrade my
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:55,168	| GGV_Fellows |	Sense of my own Chinese ability so before in the US out consider myself like a
EDL	00:36:55,168	00:36:59,264	| GGV_Fellows |	Supposed native speaker coming to China I feel like
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,032	| GGV_Fellows |	I'm more of
EDL	00:37:00,544	00:37:02,080	| GGV_Fellows |	At most like a middle school
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:03,360	| GGV_Fellows |	A level Chinese
EDL	00:37:03,872	00:37:07,456	| GGV_Fellows |	I think you're extremely fluent but I think a lot of it is
EDL	00:37:07,968	00:37:09,504	| GGV_Fellows |	Not language but the
EDL	00:37:10,272	00:37:12,064	| GGV_Fellows |	The nuances of the culture
EDL	00:37:12,576	00:37:13,088	| GGV_Fellows |	Society
EDL	00:37:13,600	00:37:14,624	| GGV_Fellows |	You can't get
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:15,648	| GGV_Fellows |	In textbooks
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:19,744	| GGV_Fellows |	Also the tongue use their married if so how has the adjustment
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,280	| GGV_Fellows |	How long have you been
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:24,608	| GGV_Fellows |	Been here so I've been here for about half a year
EDL	00:37:24,608	00:37:27,168	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah I think the adjustment has been
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:28,448	| GGV_Fellows |	Free easy
EDL	00:37:28,448	00:37:34,592	| GGV_Fellows |	I think mostly it comes down to the attitude where I'm very interested in Chinese culture and Chinese Tech
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:36,640	| GGV_Fellows |	Changes that have been happening
EDL	00:37:36,640	00:37:37,664	| GGV_Fellows |	In society
EDL	00:37:37,664	00:37:40,480	| GGV_Fellows |	I think living in the US for so long I
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,016	| GGV_Fellows |	I'm just so familiar with
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:44,064	| GGV_Fellows |	Us society and US culture
EDL	00:37:44,576	00:37:47,392	| GGV_Fellows |	That it's just really interesting to learn more about
EDL	00:37:47,392	00:37:49,952	| GGV_Fellows |	A different culture but also
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:53,280	| GGV_Fellows |	I feel like it's my own culture so out of connecting with my own
EDL	00:37:53,280	00:37:53,792	| GGV_Fellows |	Roots
EDL	00:37:54,304	00:37:56,352	| GGV_Fellows |	So can you talk about your experience with
EDL	00:37:56,352	00:37:57,632	| GGV_Fellows |	Did you get fellows like
EDL	00:37:57,632	00:38:01,472	| GGV_Fellows |	After you came and lower your expectations and how did the program
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:03,264	| GGV_Fellows |	Yasso
EDL	00:38:03,264	00:38:04,032	| GGV_Fellows |	I think
EDL	00:38:04,032	00:38:08,640	| GGV_Fellows |	Even before ggv fellows I felt slightly overwhelmed because
EDL	00:38:08,640	00:38:14,784	| GGV_Fellows |	In the group chat you sent like five or six different books in Chinese enough heck
EDL	00:38:15,296	00:38:16,832	| GGV_Fellows |	I read like this
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:19,904	| GGV_Fellows |	Book list
EDL	00:38:19,904	00:38:21,184	| GGV_Fellows |	I started
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,744	| GGV_Fellows |	I started reading a one of them
EDL	00:38:23,744	00:38:24,768	| GGV_Fellows |	It's like
EDL	00:38:24,768	00:38:29,376	| GGV_Fellows |	An overview of like 2008 to 2000
EDL	00:38:29,376	00:38:35,776	| GGV_Fellows |	And then I started kind of timing myself so you know I've read one chapter like how long would it take for
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,568	| GGV_Fellows |	Finish this book
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:41,152	| GGV_Fellows |	That I realize that I couldn't actually finish the five or six flags
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:44,480	| GGV_Fellows |	I meant I didn't actually finish that book by the time the event started
EDL	00:38:44,992	00:38:46,528	| GGV_Fellows |	But I think after
EDL	00:38:46,528	00:38:48,832	| GGV_Fellows |	Going into like going into the event
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:51,904	| GGV_Fellows |	I realize that you know I could follow along and then
EDL	00:38:51,904	00:38:53,696	| GGV_Fellows |	Everyday was really action-packed
EDL	00:38:54,208	00:39:00,352	| GGV_Fellows |	But it was kind of like a fire hose of just fire hose style learning really just got to
EDL	00:39:01,120	00:39:05,984	| GGV_Fellows |	Overview of a lot of different Industries and then also companies at various stages even though
EDL	00:39:06,496	00:39:07,264	| GGV_Fellows |	I think the
EDL	00:39:08,032	00:39:12,384	| GGV_Fellows |	Early stage company was still pretty large like series series
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:14,176	| GGV_Fellows |	Possibly
EDL	00:39:14,176	00:39:18,528	| GGV_Fellows |	The companies we interact with Warrior course but there were a few that were morally
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:20,832	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,136	| GGV_Fellows |	So what was something I left
EDL	00:39:23,136	00:39:24,160	| GGV_Fellows |	The most impressionable
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:27,488	| GGV_Fellows |	Yes I think there's two aspects one is the
EDL	00:39:28,000	00:39:29,280	| GGV_Fellows |	The actual companies
EDL	00:39:29,280	00:39:30,816	| GGV_Fellows |	That we learned about so I think
EDL	00:39:31,328	00:39:33,888	| GGV_Fellows |	One of the really interesting companies for me was mocha
EDL	00:39:33,888	00:39:35,168	| GGV_Fellows |	The co-founder
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:37,728	| GGV_Fellows |	He left China I think I was
EDL	00:39:37,728	00:39:38,240	| GGV_Fellows |	Dahlia
EDL	00:39:38,752	00:39:45,152	| GGV_Fellows |	So he went to Berkeley for college and then most of his work experience was also in the US but he came back to China
EDL	00:39:45,152	00:39:48,224	| GGV_Fellows |	I know I think when he was like 23 or 24 something like that
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:52,064	| GGV_Fellows |	And he decided to go into the 2v industries
EDL	00:39:52,576	00:39:53,600	| GGV_Fellows |	I thought was really
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:55,136	| GGV_Fellows |	Interesting
EDL	00:39:55,136	00:40:00,512	| GGV_Fellows |	Given that he didn't have a prior experience but it seems like he has a really good attitude toward
EDL	00:40:00,512	00:40:01,536	| GGV_Fellows |	Like learning
EDL	00:40:01,536	00:40:02,304	| GGV_Fellows |	Just talking
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:03,072	| GGV_Fellows |	A lot of different
EDL	00:40:03,072	00:40:04,864	| GGV_Fellows |	People I think that's a really good
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:05,376	| GGV_Fellows |	Skill set to
EDL	00:40:06,144	00:40:07,680	| GGV_Fellows |	So why did you identify with
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:10,240	| GGV_Fellows |	I think his Outlook is very
EDL	00:40:10,752	00:40:12,288	| GGV_Fellows |	Like Silicon Valley
EDL	00:40:12,288	00:40:16,384	| GGV_Fellows |	Inspired I think it's just inspiring how he managed to build a company
EDL	00:40:16,896	00:40:17,920	| GGV_Fellows |	Even though he didn't have like
EDL	00:40:18,688	00:40:19,712	| GGV_Fellows |	Prior experience
EDL	00:40:20,480	00:40:21,248	| GGV_Fellows |	Area or
EDL	00:40:22,016	00:40:22,528	| GGV_Fellows |	In China
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:27,392	| GGV_Fellows |	So you have worked in Google in Mountain View and also a startup in
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:28,160	| GGV_Fellows |	La
EDL	00:40:28,160	00:40:30,720	| GGV_Fellows |	How would you compare what you saw in the
EDL	00:40:30,720	00:40:32,768	| GGV_Fellows |	Us like the text-based there verses
EDL	00:40:33,280	00:40:35,072	| GGV_Fellows |	We're seeing here what are the
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:35,584	| GGV_Fellows |	Major
EDL	00:40:36,096	00:40:36,864	| GGV_Fellows |	Difference
EDL	00:40:36,864	00:40:39,680	| GGV_Fellows |	Both just people's attitude and work
EDL	00:40:40,192	00:40:42,240	| GGV_Fellows |	So I do think in general
EDL	00:40:42,240	00:40:42,752	| GGV_Fellows |	People
EDL	00:40:43,264	00:40:49,664	| GGV_Fellows |	Well there's there's two aspects to it so one aspect was listening to the ggv podcast I got the impression that
EDL	00:40:49,664	00:40:51,200	| GGV_Fellows |	Every company was very
EDL	00:40:51,200	00:40:54,784	| GGV_Fellows |	996 all the time all the employees were nine and six
EDL	00:40:54,784	00:40:58,368	| GGV_Fellows |	Had a little bit like Sweatshop like
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:04,512	| GGV_Fellows |	But I think after visiting the company's I've gotten a little more nuanced understanding or like to gvr
EDL	00:41:05,024	00:41:07,584	| GGV_Fellows |	Not judging you but not in sex is more of like a
EDL	00:41:08,096	00:41:09,120	| GGV_Fellows |	Mindset where
EDL	00:41:09,632	00:41:10,400	| GGV_Fellows |	People are
EDL	00:41:10,400	00:41:11,168	| GGV_Fellows |	Thinking about
EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:13,472	| GGV_Fellows |	Work more often then
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:15,008	| GGV_Fellows |	People evaluate I think that stuff
EDL	00:41:15,008	00:41:16,032	| GGV_Fellows |	Play true especially
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:16,800	| GGV_Fellows |	Within like
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:17,824	| GGV_Fellows |	Co-founders Earl
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:18,336	| GGV_Fellows |	Like higher level
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,640	| GGV_Fellows |	Companies
EDL	00:41:20,640	00:41:22,944	| GGV_Fellows |	They're kind of constantly thinking about
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:24,736	| GGV_Fellows |	You know how to run their company and I think
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:29,344	| GGV_Fellows |	Part of that possibly stems from the amount of competition that exist in China
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,112	| GGV_Fellows |	We're like
EDL	00:41:30,112	00:41:32,160	| GGV_Fellows |	Once you have someone success for
EDL	00:41:32,672	00:41:35,744	| GGV_Fellows |	Seemingly successful business model you'll have a lot of
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:36,512	| GGV_Fellows |	Competition
EDL	00:41:36,512	00:41:39,328	| GGV_Fellows |	That comes in and it seems less the case in soccer
EDL	00:41:39,328	00:41:40,096	| GGV_Fellows |	Valley
EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:41,376	| GGV_Fellows |	So what will be our biggest
EDL	00:41:41,888	00:41:42,656	| GGV_Fellows |	3
EDL	00:41:43,168	00:41:44,704	| GGV_Fellows |	Rough couple takeaways
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,472	| GGV_Fellows |	From Judith
EDL	00:41:46,496	00:41:49,312	| GGV_Fellows |	What are the interesting takeaways was
EDL	00:41:49,312	00:41:55,711	| GGV_Fellows |	The other fellows who would have very good job opportunities in the US there very seriously considering quitting
EDL	00:41:55,711	00:41:56,735	| GGV_Fellows |	China
EDL	00:41:56,735	00:41:58,783	| GGV_Fellows |	I think that really contrasts with
EDL	00:41:59,295	00:42:00,319	| GGV_Fellows |	A lot of the
EDL	00:42:00,319	00:42:02,367	| GGV_Fellows |	People who immigrated to the US in the
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:03,391	| GGV_Fellows |	In the early 90s
EDL	00:42:03,391	00:42:03,903	| GGV_Fellows |	Mason Lake
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:06,719	| GGV_Fellows |	Basically my parents generation
EDL	00:42:06,719	00:42:09,023	| GGV_Fellows |	I think the mindset back down was if you
EDL	00:42:09,023	00:42:12,607	| GGV_Fellows |	You could stay in the US
EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:13,631	| GGV_Fellows |	Say I think
EDL	00:42:13,631	00:42:15,167	| GGV_Fellows |	I think that's a really good sign
EDL	00:42:15,167	00:42:16,191	| GGV_Fellows |	Yuan for China that
EDL	00:42:16,703	00:42:17,727	| GGV_Fellows |	It's able to attract
EDL	00:42:18,239	00:42:19,007	| GGV_Fellows |	These people back
EDL	00:42:19,007	00:42:20,799	| GGV_Fellows |	Even better sinus
EDL	00:42:20,799	00:42:21,823	| GGV_Fellows |	If you're able to attract
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:23,103	| GGV_Fellows |	Completely
EDL	00:42:23,615	00:42:27,455	| GGV_Fellows |	Like completely different immigrants right think that's a sign of
EDL	00:42:27,455	00:42:28,223	| GGV_Fellows |	The health of a cup
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:30,783	| GGV_Fellows |	For you
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:32,063	| GGV_Fellows |	Do you feel
EDL	00:42:32,063	00:42:34,111	| GGV_Fellows |	You're welcome in China do you feel like it belongs
EDL	00:42:35,135	00:42:35,903	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah I think so
EDL	00:42:37,183	00:42:40,511	| GGV_Fellows |	Although the funny thing is in Beijing a lot of people
EDL	00:42:40,511	00:42:46,399	| GGV_Fellows |	Ask me like are you Japanese all right. Cuz they listen to my Chinese and they think it's like a little bit off
EDL	00:42:46,399	00:42:49,727	| GGV_Fellows |	But I haven't actually experienced that in southern China maybe it's because
EDL	00:42:52,287	00:42:54,335	| GGV_Fellows |	It's like you just have a different accent
EDL	00:42:54,335	00:42:55,103	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:43:00,223	| GGV_Fellows |	And I think the more someone has spent time in the US interacting with ABC's
EDL	00:43:00,223	00:43:03,039	| GGV_Fellows |	The more they're impressed with my level of
EDL	00:43:03,039	00:43:04,063	| GGV_Fellows |	Chinese
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:09,439	| GGV_Fellows |	And then the more someone is actually like completely native Chinese the less they're impressed
EDL	00:43:09,951	00:43:16,095	| GGV_Fellows |	Your Special K is for our fellow so almost everyone is what we call a highway or overseas return
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:21,215	| GGV_Fellows |	Cool probably left China from like 16 to 20 something
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:22,239	| GGV_Fellows |	To attend
EDL	00:43:22,239	00:43:25,311	| GGV_Fellows |	Palo Duro High School or grad school in the US or other countries
EDL	00:43:26,079	00:43:31,199	| GGV_Fellows |	And then they may have worked in the US for a couple years and now considering coming back but you laughed at it really
EDL	00:43:31,967	00:43:35,551	| GGV_Fellows |	So when you were speaking with the other fellows did you feel like
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:38,623	| GGV_Fellows |	You had a different perspective on certain things
EDL	00:43:38,623	00:43:40,159	| GGV_Fellows |	Then the rest of them
EDL	00:43:40,159	00:43:46,559	| GGV_Fellows |	I think so I mean I think for me even though I don't purposefully try to do it and I think so
EDL	00:43:46,559	00:43:51,167	| GGV_Fellows |	Consciously a lot of my thinking is still impacted by kind of American or like Western
EDL	00:43:51,679	00:43:52,703	| GGV_Fellows |	Ways of thinking
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:53,727	| GGV_Fellows |	But I think
EDL	00:43:53,727	00:44:00,127	| GGV_Fellows |	Having grown up in a Chinese household as well a lot of the I can understand
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:02,687	| GGV_Fellows |	And sympathize with a lot of like Chinese ways of thinking
EDL	00:44:02,687	00:44:03,455	| GGV_Fellows |	As well
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:08,831	| GGV_Fellows |	Things that came up that was interesting to me was when we visited face plus plus
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,367	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah so I think
EDL	00:44:10,367	00:44:11,135	| GGV_Fellows |	There was
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:12,159	| GGV_Fellows |	Or there were two
EDL	00:44:12,671	00:44:18,303	| GGV_Fellows |	Other Americans in the group so Fisher and bench and I think they brought up a 7
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:19,327	| GGV_Fellows |	Like privacy issues
EDL	00:44:19,839	00:44:20,607	| GGV_Fellows |	And
EDL	00:44:20,607	00:44:27,007	| GGV_Fellows |	I think listening to them talk about like privacy issues I could release some thighs with that as an America
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:28,031	| GGV_Fellows |	At the same time
EDL	00:44:28,543	00:44:34,943	| GGV_Fellows |	As a Chinese I could predict the Chinese response because I I think I live through that
EDL	00:44:34,943	00:44:36,479	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah yeah yeah
EDL	00:44:36,479	00:44:38,015	| GGV_Fellows |	I really think that's a gift
EDL	00:44:38,015	00:44:39,807	| GGV_Fellows |	I think most people
EDL	00:44:39,807	00:44:41,599	| GGV_Fellows |	Can only lift their life and
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:44,671	| GGV_Fellows |	B1 now the other but where
EDL	00:44:44,671	00:44:46,463	| GGV_Fellows |	Living in an age where you can actually
EDL	00:44:46,463	00:44:47,231	| GGV_Fellows |	Peoples
EDL	00:44:47,231	00:44:49,535	| GGV_Fellows |	Sympathize or empathize with
EDL	00:44:50,047	00:44:51,839	| GGV_Fellows |	Both sides of the story end
EDL	00:44:52,351	00:44:53,887	| GGV_Fellows |	Identify with
EDL	00:44:53,887	00:44:54,911	| GGV_Fellows |	A larger
EDL	00:44:54,911	00:44:59,263	| GGV_Fellows |	Set of people that was really one of the biggest
EDL	00:45:00,031	00:45:02,079	| GGV_Fellows |	Takeaways from living in Indiana
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:06,687	| GGV_Fellows |	So previously when I was living in the US in Hawaii like
EDL	00:45:07,199	00:45:12,063	| GGV_Fellows |	Hawaii is a very Asian state so like if you're Chinese you're just kind of part of the majority
EDL	00:45:12,063	00:45:12,831	| GGV_Fellows |	Culture
EDL	00:45:12,831	00:45:14,879	| GGV_Fellows |	And then after moving to Indiana I think
EDL	00:45:15,391	00:45:16,415	| GGV_Fellows |	Even though I
EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:23,583	| GGV_Fellows |	Grew up as an American people saw me as a Chinese so then I ended up you know having to explain
EDL	00:45:23,583	00:45:25,375	| GGV_Fellows |	A lot of like Chinese culture and like
EDL	00:45:25,887	00:45:29,471	| GGV_Fellows |	People would have preconceived notions of like what Chinese people are
EDL	00:45:29,471	00:45:35,871	| GGV_Fellows |	And then also like when the 2008 Olympics happened they would ask me oh yeah did you know like the Chinese gymnasts
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:39,711	| GGV_Fellows |	Taking their interview stuff like what do you think about that
EDL	00:45:39,711	00:45:42,271	| GGV_Fellows |	So yeah I think living in
EDL	00:45:42,271	00:45:48,671	| GGV_Fellows |	The Midwest actually really shaped my identity as well as a Chinese person I think it really reinforced
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:50,207	| GGV_Fellows |	My sense of
EDL	00:45:50,207	00:45:54,303	| GGV_Fellows |	Okay maybe I'm not completely American-made maybe if someone grew up in
EDL	00:45:54,815	00:45:58,399	| GGV_Fellows |	San Jose or the bay area where everyone else is an immigrant
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:46:02,495	| GGV_Fellows |	That maybe their understanding of what an American is would be very kind of emigrated
EDL	00:46:03,519	00:46:04,543	| GGV_Fellows |	So was it a difficult
EDL	00:46:05,055	00:46:06,079	| GGV_Fellows |	Decision for you to
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:06,591	| GGV_Fellows |	To move
EDL	00:46:07,103	00:46:08,895	| GGV_Fellows |	To Beijing because you have not left
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:09,407	| GGV_Fellows |	Care for life
EDL	00:46:09,919	00:46:10,431	| GGV_Fellows |	Over a decade
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:14,015	| GGV_Fellows |	No it wasn't it wasn't difficult at all
EDL	00:46:14,015	00:46:14,527	| GGV_Fellows |	I think
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:17,855	| GGV_Fellows |	What really helps was the fact that
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:20,159	| GGV_Fellows |	My parents had moved back to
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:22,463	| GGV_Fellows |	Or they move to Hong Kong in 2012
EDL	00:46:22,975	00:46:26,303	| GGV_Fellows |	So I no longer had any family are in the US
EDL	00:46:26,815	00:46:28,863	| GGV_Fellows |	And then also coming to Beijing
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:33,727	| GGV_Fellows |	I'm working on my startup with my cousin so I think just having that family support
EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:34,495	| GGV_Fellows |	Crossword help
EDL	00:46:34,495	00:46:37,823	| GGV_Fellows |	That also when I was working in the Barrios
EDL	00:46:37,823	00:46:44,223	| GGV_Fellows |	And La I was pretty Frugal so I like saved up some money so I think that helped with the risk
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:44,735	| GGV_Fellows |	Terrace Park
EDL	00:46:46,527	00:46:47,807	| GGV_Fellows |	And you see yourself here in
EDL	00:46:49,599	00:46:50,367	| GGV_Fellows |	At least a few more
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:53,695	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah yeah as long as I think you know
EDL	00:46:53,695	00:46:57,023	| GGV_Fellows |	Funding doesn't tryouts that's why
EDL	00:46:57,023	00:46:59,071	| GGV_Fellows |	Could you talk a little bit about the startup
EDL	00:47:00,095	00:47:04,191	| GGV_Fellows |	Yes so we're targeting a026 age range
EDL	00:47:04,191	00:47:05,215	| GGV_Fellows |	What's the name
EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:07,263	| GGV_Fellows |	Oh yeah it's called your mama
EDL	00:47:07,263	00:47:07,775	| GGV_Fellows |	Archery
EDL	00:47:08,287	00:47:08,799	| GGV_Fellows |	And
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:12,383	| GGV_Fellows |	So we're focused on the 0 to 6
EDL	00:47:12,383	00:47:13,151	| GGV_Fellows |	Age range
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:16,479	| GGV_Fellows |	And mostly developing mini programs that foe
EDL	00:47:16,479	00:47:17,503	| GGV_Fellows |	Focus on content
EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:18,271	| GGV_Fellows |	And then also
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:22,111	| GGV_Fellows |	Games that center around that contest
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:23,391	| GGV_Fellows |	So trying to
EDL	00:47:23,391	00:47:24,415	| GGV_Fellows |	Expose
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,695	| GGV_Fellows |	Chinese kids still like
EDL	00:47:25,695	00:47:27,231	| GGV_Fellows |	English content and then trying
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:28,255	| GGV_Fellows |	Air Force
EDL	00:47:28,255	00:47:28,767	| GGV_Fellows |	The concepts
EDL	00:47:30,559	00:47:32,607	| GGV_Fellows |	And you say you're mostly baoding
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:34,143	| GGV_Fellows |	The product around which how many
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,167	| GGV_Fellows |	Any program
EDL	00:47:35,167	00:47:39,519	| GGV_Fellows |	So that's quite different from what you're used to work on the states did you have to learn everything
EDL	00:47:40,287	00:47:41,055	| GGV_Fellows |	Again
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:41,823	| GGV_Fellows |	I think
EDL	00:47:41,823	00:47:44,895	| GGV_Fellows |	The fundamental programming aspects are
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:48,735	| GGV_Fellows |	Pretty much the same no matter what new framework
EDL	00:47:48,735	00:47:49,503	| GGV_Fellows |	Comes up
EDL	00:47:49,503	00:47:52,319	| GGV_Fellows |	But definitely the details of implementation are
EDL	00:47:52,319	00:47:54,623	| GGV_Fellows |	Are different I had to go through a lot of
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:56,415	| GGV_Fellows |	Documentation in Chinese
EDL	00:47:56,415	00:47:57,439	| GGV_Fellows |	Which
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,975	| GGV_Fellows |	Involved like looking up a lot of
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:01,535	| GGV_Fellows |	Words and then also going through like differ
EDL	00:48:01,535	00:48:05,119	| GGV_Fellows |	Tutorials and then also learning how developers in China kind of
EDL	00:48:05,887	00:48:08,447	| GGV_Fellows |	Works where do they go when they have questions
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:09,471	| GGV_Fellows |	News about bugs
EDL	00:48:10,239	00:48:11,007	| GGV_Fellows |	How to how to
EDL	00:48:11,007	00:48:11,519	| GGV_Fellows |	It's not something
EDL	00:48:12,287	00:48:16,127	| GGV_Fellows |	So as long as you're good smart engineer and you can read Chinese it's not a
EDL	00:48:16,639	00:48:18,175	| GGV_Fellows |	That difficult adjustment
EDL	00:48:18,175	00:48:20,223	| GGV_Fellows |	Because I think
EDL	00:48:20,223	00:48:23,039	| GGV_Fellows |	Fundamentally most programmers are
EDL	00:48:23,039	00:48:25,599	| GGV_Fellows |	Lazy which is a good thing so
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:31,999	| GGV_Fellows |	Whenever you hear this new completely new framework it's usually built around something that kind of exists
EDL	00:48:31,999	00:48:34,815	| GGV_Fellows |	Already because it it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel
EDL	00:48:34,815	00:48:35,583	| GGV_Fellows |	So like
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:36,863	| GGV_Fellows |	WeChat mini program it
EDL	00:48:36,863	00:48:39,935	| GGV_Fellows |	Kind of sounds like completely new but it's actually built on
EDL	00:48:39,935	00:48:41,215	| GGV_Fellows |	You know JavaScript
EDL	00:48:41,215	00:48:44,287	| GGV_Fellows |	Wxml which is similar to HTML
EDL	00:48:44,287	00:48:45,823	| GGV_Fellows |	And then also W
EDL	00:48:46,335	00:48:47,615	| GGV_Fellows |	Access
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:49,663	| GGV_Fellows |	As switches like CSS
EDL	00:48:49,663	00:48:53,247	| GGV_Fellows |	So like if you know if you're familiar with web programming it actually
EDL	00:48:53,247	00:48:54,271	| GGV_Fellows |	Is pretty familiar
EDL	00:48:55,039	00:48:56,063	| GGV_Fellows |	Cool so
EDL	00:48:56,063	00:48:58,879	| GGV_Fellows |	Is there any last words you want to say maybe
EDL	00:48:59,391	00:49:01,951	| GGV_Fellows |	To either or audience or perspective
EDL	00:49:01,951	00:49:03,999	| GGV_Fellows |	Gdb fellows applicants
EDL	00:49:04,511	00:49:07,583	| GGV_Fellows |	Yes I think given my background I really want to
EDL	00:49:07,583	00:49:09,375	| GGV_Fellows |	Encourage other
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:11,423	| GGV_Fellows |	You know Chinese Americans are
EDL	00:49:11,423	00:49:13,727	| GGV_Fellows |	Members of the Chinese diaspora to really
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:16,799	| GGV_Fellows |	Keep in touch with China you don't understand
EDL	00:49:16,799	00:49:23,199	| GGV_Fellows |	History especially recent history maybe like why your ancestors decided to go abroad
EDL	00:49:23,199	00:49:24,735	| GGV_Fellows |	I think that's really interesting
EDL	00:49:24,735	00:49:30,111	| GGV_Fellows |	I also think from a practical perspective it's really important to learn Chinese
EDL	00:49:30,111	00:49:31,135	| GGV_Fellows |	Yeah there's a lot of
EDL	00:49:31,647	00:49:32,927	| GGV_Fellows |	Unexpected
EDL	00:49:32,927	00:49:36,255	| GGV_Fellows |	Opportunities that you can get just from that
EDL	00:49:36,255	00:49:37,279	| GGV_Fellows |	Language ability
EDL	00:49:37,279	00:49:38,047	| GGV_Fellows |	I think like
EDL	00:49:38,559	00:49:39,839	| GGV_Fellows |	When I was in high school
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:43,679	| GGV_Fellows |	Never would have expected the Chinese tech industry to have grown
EDL	00:49:44,703	00:49:51,103	| GGV_Fellows |	This level and back then I would never have been able to predict that right now I would be in China like working
EDL	00:49:51,103	00:49:53,407	| GGV_Fellows |	In China it's possible because you
EDL	00:49:56,479	00:49:58,271	| GGV_Fellows |	Okay cool thank you
EDL	00:49:59,295	00:50:05,695	| GGV_Fellows |	So that's all we have for today's episode and if you're interested in applying to attend the next batch of ggv fellows
