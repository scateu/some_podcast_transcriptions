EDL	00:03:34,016	00:03:36,832	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	This is the first time I've been back in about 5 years
EDL	00:03:37,344	00:03:38,368	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And to see how much

EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:40,672	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Not just
EDL	00:03:40,672	00:03:43,488	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know copycatting in a lot of ways that you thought

EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:50,912	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:52,192	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know I think of
EDL	00:03:52,192	00:03:53,728	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	First-mover advantages
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:55,520	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I'll all the time when I when I invest
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,824	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But I also think of last mover advantage
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:04,992	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Truck right and if you think about China when you didn't have credit cards and there wasn't a lot of consumer credit and there was wasn't a lot

EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:13,440	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And create things that the world has never seen before
EDL	00:04:14,208	00:04:15,744	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's really exciting
EDL	00:04:15,744	00:04:18,303	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because we're not just taking old systems and innovate
EDL	00:04:18,815	00:04:21,375	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	For creating new things and new species of fish

EDL	00:07:16,991	00:07:18,015	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	More so than money
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:21,087	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And what I want to do is I want to really be able to
EDL	00:07:21,087	00:07:24,159	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Help entrepreneurs who are doing very hard things

EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,743	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Things that don't have revenues for a while
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,535	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But take many years to develop
EDL	00:07:30,559	00:07:33,375	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Before they can become really disruptive in an Indus
EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:36,191	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Help those entrepreneurs and Mentor them

EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:48,735	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So for me
EDL	00:07:48,735	00:07:49,503	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I was
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:55,903	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	A young entrepreneur when I went to Silicon Valley in 1991 and Beyond and I had lots of people who helped
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:08:00,767	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Helped me cuz they saw something in me and they said I want to help this kid and it wasn't always about money
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:07,679	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And so now that I'm older you know almost you know 25 Going on 30 years later since going to Silicon Valley in the fur
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:08,447	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	First place
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:09,727	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Now I think it's my time
EDL	00:08:10,239	00:08:12,543	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To be able to do what other people did for me
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:15,359	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And help those Innovations grow and now they we can do them
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,687	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	A lot of places and do many more meaningful things that we
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:19,199	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	We could have 30 years
EDL	00:08:19,711	00:08:20,735	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So for me that's what
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:23,039	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So exciting and it's not just about
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:25,087	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Consumer Hardware
EDL	00:08:25,087	00:08:28,159	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Building you know the next iPod or something or nest
EDL	00:08:28,671	00:08:30,207	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It's really about
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:32,767	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Technology be applied to new spaces
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:33,791	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	The things that
EDL	00:08:33,791	00:08:36,095	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	We know when we created our last 30 years
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:38,143	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Is not about you can innovate that shirt
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:42,751	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But it's about bringing that and that democratization of those those Technologies
EDL	00:08:43,263	00:08:44,287	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To agriculture
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:45,823	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To food

EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Ted Automotive
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:52,735	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If we look at it there's so many things that now need to be
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:56,831	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Either revolutionized by the software and Hardware evolution
EDL	00:08:57,343	00:08:59,647	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Or they need to actually
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:03,231	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Be created new things that we've never seen before to be created
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:04,255	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's what's interesting to me
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:08,351	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because I don't want to keep doing the same thing you know I left Apple because after
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:10,655	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	18 Generations the iPod or whatever
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:17,055	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	The 19th one you know it's pretty pretty predictable I think you can pretty much predict what the next cell phone waves
EDL	00:09:17,055	00:09:19,103	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Smartphone always going to look like or the one after that
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:22,175	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's not what you want to do is be on The Cutting Edge

EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,951	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And that's what the best thing is you going to do something
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:37,279	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You don't know anything about to come fresh dive you go
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:42,399	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Why don't they do it that way this is the way we've always done it so it's never going to change has come and go
EDL	00:09:42,399	00:09:44,447	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That doesn't make much sense what's the rethinking
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,983	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's what's fun

EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:41,439	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And we created a culture in a business
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:43,231	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To create more products
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:46,815	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's the kind of thing you want to talk to an entrepreneur about
EDL	00:11:46,815	00:11:49,375	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Not just this one idea and getting it to the market
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:51,167	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What is their big vision
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:55,775	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Where does it need to go in even if they don't know what it is they have to have like

EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:51,839	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Europe
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:54,655	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So you have to think about timing
EDL	00:12:54,655	00:12:55,679	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Not Justa
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,983	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What people are talking about in
EDL	00:12:57,983	00:12:58,751	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	The Press
EDL	00:12:58,751	00:13:00,543	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But what are customer saying that
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,615	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Just because you have a great idea
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,151	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And you're not
EDL	00:13:05,663	00:13:07,711	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Close enough to the market
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:08,223	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Need
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:11,295	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And it'll take a really big gap or leap
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:13,599	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	For them to understand what it is
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:14,879	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If it takes more than
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:17,439	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	2 minutes to sell your idea
EDL	00:13:17,439	00:13:18,975	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You're probably not
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:23,583	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Doing a good job either explaining it or you're too far Advanced from where they're thinking
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:24,095	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Redemptive
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:25,887	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Buyer purchase
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:26,399	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Sitting somewhere
EDL	00:13:27,167	00:13:29,983	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So I think about you know my time at General Magic
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:31,263	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	General Magic
EDL	00:13:31,775	00:13:35,103	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Most people don't know what it is but we are basically creating the iPhone
EDL	00:13:35,615	00:13:38,175	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	In 1991 to 1994
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:42,015	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	We had the best team in the best ever we had downloadable apps
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:42,783	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	We hadn't
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,855	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Games we had an email Wireless email me at everything
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:53,023	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's what used today it took us 15 years to get there any of the smartest people
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:56,607	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And so we were a total failure we obviously
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,399	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It showed up 15 years
EDL	00:13:58,399	00:13:59,167	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Later
EDL	00:13:59,167	00:14:00,703	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But we had the right idea
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:03,007	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So
EDL	00:14:03,007	00:14:04,799	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What is going on here in China
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,639	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And when I look at startups and thinking about the timing
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:11,199	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	There's things that the market needs now
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,271	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And things that'll get funded
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,319	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And there's something that usually
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:19,903	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Something pressing for like made in China 2025
EDL	00:14:19,903	00:14:24,255	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If you're doing something that needs to be done right now you're probably not innovatively
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:27,839	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You need to be building something that is going to be a hit
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	In 45 years
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:31,167	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	When the market wakes up
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:34,239	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because that means you're starting before anyone elses
EDL	00:14:34,239	00:14:35,775	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But you can't be so close
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:41,151	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Everyone else is doing it or it's pretty simple. Implement
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:43,199	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But you also can't be 10 years out
EDL	00:14:43,199	00:14:44,479	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because then business isn't happening
EDL	00:14:44,991	00:14:50,367	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Do you have to really be in if you're doing anything important I always say is it takes 10 years or

EDL	00:14:51,903	00:14:52,415	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Fruition
EDL	00:14:53,183	00:14:54,975	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know to come to full
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:57,023	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Ripeness in a way right

EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:58,975	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Vegetable based
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:00,255	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But it has
EDL	00:16:00,255	00:16:04,095	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Almost all the same or Better Properties than regular meat
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:04,863	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right
EDL	00:16:05,375	00:16:07,423	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	There's a lack of protein in the world

EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:56,063	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Kind of I think hopefully an example of what I you know

EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:56,096	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But the valuations a lot of these things are getting well out of hand

EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,752	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	The reality is we have to look at the egg
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:03,264	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Economics
EDL	00:22:03,776	00:22:04,544	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because

EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:16,064	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	There's all these other elements that have to happen to incentivize to make these things more
EDL	00:22:16,832	00:22:18,624	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And they're not today
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:19,136	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:24,512	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It's you have to really look at the numbers has anyone about all kinds of certain things
EDL	00:22:25,024	00:22:31,424	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But I always go back to not the sales numbers but the real hard unit economics
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:33,216	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You understand what are we really solving
EDL	00:22:33,728	00:22:37,824	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What are you betting on
EDL	00:22:37,824	00:22:39,360	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If you can't get the economics right
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:42,688	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Regardless of the kids you can't scale
EDL	00:22:42,688	00:22:46,016	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Nnnn I always look at the economics from a scale point of view
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:52,928	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Not just like it's going to be hard really making a thousand of them so it's really expensive so we'll never get to 100,000 likes

EDL	00:22:57,280	00:22:58,304	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	In the last 10 years
EDL	00:22:58,816	00:22:59,584	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:02,912	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because everyone's like we'll never scale I'm not worried about scale anymore
EDL	00:23:02,912	00:23:04,704	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If we figure out the unaka economics
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:08,288	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	China or another he's going to go off and figure out how to make
EDL	00:23:08,288	00:23:10,848	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Custom the cost out happens so much more quickly
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:15,712	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What's the what's the real fundamental reason why something should exist

EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:14,080	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And neither
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:16,640	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Do you know kind of a bit flips in their brain
EDL	00:24:18,432	00:24:23,808	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And literally within hours or days a week
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:25,088	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Or it's like
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,880	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Next month

EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,280	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I have all the ideas or anything
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,584	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But at least coming back to you
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,120	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	With a
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:39,680	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I thought about that and here's why I don't think it's going to work
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,216	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:42,240	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Or
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:45,312	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know or we rule it out right then and there like yeah I already thought about it
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:46,336	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Yeah that's not going to work
EDL	00:24:46,336	00:24:50,944	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So you can really understand in and I like to do that in the process of when
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:53,504	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	We're thinking about making the investment
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:58,368	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And challenging their to see if they're mensurable sure at the time of the investment
EDL	00:25:04,768	00:25:07,584	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Roll your roll the dice then and you have no Leverage
EDL	00:25:07,584	00:25:08,096	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	In a way
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:11,424	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And so you always want to have that kind of
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:12,704	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Too many times I
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:16,544	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because I'm not worried about missing the next deal
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:21,920	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	This is about fun and Indian meetings where it's about working with great people who really want to work together
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:25,504	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Write a lot of
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:28,320	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Investors are like they want to have their best fit
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:32,160	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Put forward they want to say I'm entrepreneur friendly and I'm not going to challenge
EDL	00:25:32,160	00:25:33,696	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To a certain extent
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,976	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	For me I gota
EDL	00:25:34,976	00:25:36,256	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	180 degrees out
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:42,400	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I challenge you from day one I'll send him a hundred questions.
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:48,032	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And I want to see how far until a break
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:54,944	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Not that I'm trying to like but it's there I want to see how far they're going to go and how deep and how fast they're going to respond
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:56,224	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Detailed response
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:59,040	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because that's going to tell you what their normal
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:02,880	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Kind of way they think about problems or how they communicate or whatever
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,160	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And if they can do that
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:07,744	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Then it's a great litmus test for what I think's going to happen over time
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:11,584	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I never thought about that
EDL	00:26:11,584	00:26:12,608	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	No we haven't gotten there
EDL	00:26:13,120	00:26:16,704	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	As opposed to someone who always says oh yeah we thought about that or
EDL	00:26:16,704	00:26:17,984	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Yeah we're going to do that too
EDL	00:26:19,264	00:26:21,056	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	They just have to say no we didn't think about
EDL	00:26:22,080	00:26:22,848	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And Hugo okay
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:25,408	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I know that they're real because they said
EDL	00:26:27,712	00:26:28,224	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right exactly
EDL	00:26:28,736	00:26:30,272	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So yeah so it's that kind of thing

EDL	00:26:33,856	00:26:35,136	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Attractive enough that
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:36,416	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You want to do it yourself
EDL	00:26:36,928	00:26:41,280	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Nephew
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,560	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	There a few moments
EDL	00:26:42,560	00:26:43,584	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know from me
EDL	00:26:44,608	00:26:51,008	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Did everyone that's ever going to get back in the game one day you're going to go back
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:54,336	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I was going to get back to it and Nest was something bad
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,384	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I thought of
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:58,432	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And I couldn't let it go it took nine months
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,200	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	For me
EDL	00:26:59,200	00:26:59,712	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To find leak
EDL	00:27:00,992	00:27:01,504	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To doing
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:03,040	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Cuz
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:04,832	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I had to look at it from every angle
EDL	00:27:04,832	00:27:06,624	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Cuz I really wanted it to be right
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,672	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I had been at that point
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,464	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Over 20 years
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:11,744	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Of
EDL	00:27:12,256	00:27:14,304	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know multiple startups that
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:16,352	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Failed or were marginally successful
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,632	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You nope
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,704	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Years and years at Apple running like crazy
EDL	00:27:20,704	00:27:25,824	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So to throw yourself into it again when you didn't have to you already financially on lsf
EDL	00:27:25,824	00:27:29,408	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To throw yourself into it you have to make sure all the variables there and let you know
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:31,712	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You don't not that I'm risk-averse
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:33,760	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But I like to risk mitigation
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:36,320	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But make sure I really understand what the real
EDL	00:27:37,088	00:27:39,392	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Opportunities but what are the real risks
EDL	00:27:39,392	00:27:40,416	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Before diving into
EDL	00:27:41,184	00:27:42,976	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And so when I look at these other businesses
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:46,816	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I have different calculus I use for when I'm going to be the CEO
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:50,656	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Verses when other people are the CEO and I think I can help them
EDL	00:27:50,656	00:27:56,032	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And investing get them around certain obstacles cuz I've been there before and I think it's a good business
EDL	00:27:56,032	00:27:58,592	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But is it something good enough that I would want to
EDL	00:27:58,592	00:27:59,104	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:03,200	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Tear myself away from my family and all I said since I already had been doing it for
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:05,248	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I effectively now
EDL	00:28:05,248	00:28:07,296	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	25 to 30 years depending on how you count
EDL	00:28:07,808	00:28:13,952	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So it's very hard for me to want to engage and say how I wish I could do that cuz I know how
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:15,744	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	End
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:18,048	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I have to tell you it's a Young Person's game
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:24,960	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	The real you have to be in your 30s you know 20 year olds
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:29,056	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Videos there are some of them but they're usually not successful
EDL	00:28:31,360	00:28:35,712	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Sometimes I get lucky but most of time it's in your mid-30s
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:38,016	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Early forties is where you're really sick
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:42,112	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So you really figured out you failed enough times you've learned
EDL	00:28:42,112	00:28:42,880	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:43,648	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And so
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:50,560	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I'm not in that category
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:55,424	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know that's where I can come back to Mentor so so my calculus for me to do something is very different
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:28:56,192	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So I
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,752	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So when I see something I can oh my God
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:29:03,616	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If I was 30 again would I be there
EDL	00:29:03,616	00:29:08,480	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Cuz I get to go have a fun ride with that entrepreneur
EDL	00:29:08,480	00:29:10,272	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And helping them
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:13,856	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	With their board and their investors everything else I get to be in a list
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:15,648	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I can have a lot of fun
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:21,024	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And and I get to be young again at the same time I get to help them
EDL	00:29:21,024	00:29:23,840	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And I get to almost be CEO without being CEO
EDL	00:29:23,840	00:29:27,936	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Cemeteries wife Kitty and I like
EDL	00:29:27,936	00:29:29,472	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	BBC
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:35,104	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know it's some point everyone has a different reason for when they going to get involved with the risk level you knowing
EDL	00:29:35,104	00:29:38,688	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I'd much rather take my time and help 200 on sugar
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:42,784	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Rights and then just one company with a lot of people but
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:43,552	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It's tough
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:44,320	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know how it is
EDL	00:29:44,832	00:29:51,232	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know I always would love to go back to college or High School inside

EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:32,287	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So what technology
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:34,847	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What things need to be built for that region
EDL	00:45:36,383	00:45:37,663	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That trading region
EDL	00:45:37,663	00:45:43,807	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It's not all going to come in and out of China

EDL	01:00:04,223	01:00:06,527	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	A lot of people who do well
EDL	01:00:06,527	01:00:08,063	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Morcheeba lot in life

EDL	01:00:16,511	01:00:20,863	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Saudi reconcile how do you reconcile that to get every move in the right direction
EDL	01:00:20,863	01:00:23,423	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Without burning a lot of them with his $0.11
EDL	01:00:23,935	01:00:27,263	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Well it's a really great question but it's all relative
EDL	01:00:27,263	01:00:28,031	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right
EDL	01:00:28,799	01:00:30,591	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Sometimes you can push too hard
EDL	01:00:31,103	01:00:32,383	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because that's what you want
EDL	01:00:32,383	01:00:34,175	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You also have to remember that
EDL	01:00:34,687	01:00:36,735	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Good decisions don't just happen
EDL	01:00:36,735	01:00:38,527	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Fast sure does take some time
EDL	01:00:38,527	01:00:40,575	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Analysis paralysis
EDL	01:00:41,087	01:00:42,367	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Would you also can't make
EDL	01:00:42,367	01:00:43,903	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Knee-jerk reactions
EDL	01:00:44,415	01:00:45,439	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Based on gut
EDL	01:00:45,439	01:00:46,719	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Like there is there are
EDL	01:00:46,719	01:00:47,487	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	There are
EDL	01:00:47,999	01:00:50,559	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Backbase decisions and opinion-based
EDL	01:00:51,071	01:00:52,607	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And leaders need to know the difference
EDL	01:00:53,631	01:01:00,031	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Opinion-based ones should be made by a core team or one person and continued that right
EDL	01:01:00,031	01:01:03,615	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And fact-based ones as long as you don't get in that now is paralysis
EDL	01:01:03,615	01:01:10,015	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It should be fast and so they make a good enough decision you know and you know what the bassist was making
EDL	01:01:10,015	01:01:11,551	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Undo it if the assumption
EDL	01:01:12,831	01:01:13,599	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So
EDL	01:01:13,599	01:01:14,879	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	There's there's a
EDL	01:01:15,903	01:01:17,183	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If you're working
EDL	01:01:17,183	01:01:18,207	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	100 hours a week
EDL	01:01:19,231	01:01:20,255	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	120 hours a week
EDL	01:01:21,791	01:01:22,303	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	No way
EDL	01:01:23,071	01:01:25,375	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Look it's not going to happen it's not sustainable
EDL	01:01:25,375	01:01:28,703	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's what happen when I was in my 20s and I
EDL	01:01:28,703	01:01:29,983	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I had to reboot my life because
EDL	01:01:30,495	01:01:32,543	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I think Elon Musk is learning that right
EDL	01:01:32,543	01:01:34,847	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Write the can't work that
EDL	01:01:34,847	01:01:35,615	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It just
EDL	01:01:35,615	01:01:36,383	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Do not get to make
EDL	01:01:37,663	01:01:39,967	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So your organization needs to move fast
EDL	01:01:41,503	01:01:42,527	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You need to
EDL	01:01:43,039	01:01:47,903	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Have them you set up the main goals they set up the sub goals
EDL	01:01:47,903	01:01:50,975	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And then they get back to you the tasks and the work product
EDL	01:01:51,743	01:01:54,303	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know that they're going to be in the deliverables in the timing
EDL	01:01:54,303	01:01:55,839	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And then you can negotiate over there
EDL	01:01:56,607	01:01:57,631	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right and you push
EDL	01:01:58,399	01:02:00,191	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And when hourly happens is is
EDL	01:02:00,191	01:02:01,215	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	1
EDL	01:02:01,215	01:02:06,847	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	One team says I can move this fast the other team says I can move that fast and they have to work together cuz I don't teams
EDL	01:02:06,847	01:02:11,711	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Do they normally push you pull me kind of experience as long as you have it laid out
EDL	01:02:12,223	01:02:15,295	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	See you but you have to agree on what the parameters are in
EDL	01:02:15,295	01:02:16,319	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And those things up front
EDL	01:02:16,319	01:02:17,087	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It sucks
EDL	01:02:17,087	01:02:19,903	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Not hat it's not fun and things change all the time
EDL	01:02:19,903	01:02:23,231	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But until people understand that relationship in that bonding
EDL	01:02:23,231	01:02:25,535	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And that they each have to work with each other
EDL	01:02:25,535	01:02:26,815	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And under some kind of
EDL	01:02:27,327	01:02:28,095	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know
EDL	01:02:28,095	01:02:30,655	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Schedule of deliverables
EDL	01:02:30,655	01:02:32,959	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's when the home thing gets moving
EDL	01:02:32,959	01:02:36,287	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It's your job as a leader to set the mission and set the major goals
EDL	01:02:37,311	01:02:38,591	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Let them come back
EDL	01:02:38,591	01:02:40,127	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	With the details
EDL	01:02:40,127	01:02:41,663	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And make sure you all agree
EDL	01:02:41,663	01:02:44,479	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But then each team's going to push each other and as soon as it comes up
EDL	01:02:44,991	01:02:45,503	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know it's like

EDL	01:02:50,623	01:02:53,439	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And if it happens enough times then you'll know you need to replace the fur
EDL	01:02:53,951	01:02:55,487	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Or sometimes they rise to the challenge
EDL	01:02:55,999	01:02:56,767	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But typically
EDL	01:02:57,279	01:02:59,583	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I see if you pired well enough
EDL	01:03:00,095	01:03:01,631	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	People will rise to the challenge
EDL	01:03:02,143	01:03:03,935	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	As long as you're not number one
EDL	01:03:03,935	01:03:06,239	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Overdoing it like going too fast
EDL	01:03:07,007	01:03:09,311	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right you can explain your decisions
EDL	01:03:09,311	01:03:14,687	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And that you set up some framework for a scheduling so that everybody understands their interdependencies
EDL	01:03:14,687	01:03:15,455	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So everything can Loop
EDL	01:03:16,479	01:03:16,991	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Right
EDL	01:03:17,759	01:03:18,783	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So you got to have
EDL	01:03:19,295	01:03:20,575	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Good tools to make that
EDL	01:03:22,111	01:03:24,927	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But if they all have two relatively be on the same page
EDL	01:03:24,927	01:03:25,695	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If not
EDL	01:03:25,695	01:03:27,231	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You're going to find out very quickly
EDL	01:03:27,231	01:03:28,767	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To trim off those

EDL	01:03:29,535	01:03:31,327	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And then the other one is when you're
EDL	01:03:31,327	01:03:34,399	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	At a certain enough sizes you make sure you have mentoring
EDL	01:03:34,399	01:03:34,911	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Inside the

EDL	01:05:00,927	01:05:01,951	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So that's just a
EDL	01:05:02,719	01:05:03,487	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know
EDL	01:05:03,487	01:05:04,511	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Lack of experience

EDL	01:05:10,655	01:05:12,447	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I was bleeding work-life balance
EDL	01:05:12,959	01:05:14,239	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And
EDL	01:05:14,239	01:05:18,079	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And also thought they had that you can we innovate you work the Chinese
EDL	01:05:18,847	01:05:19,871	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	At least not at 6
EDL	01:05:20,383	01:05:21,407	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What's the name of this podcast
EDL	01:05:22,943	01:05:23,711	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because we
EDL	01:05:23,711	01:05:26,015	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	That's impossible they think that
EDL	01:05:26,015	01:05:27,039	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To do innovation
EDL	01:05:27,039	01:05:28,063	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Indicted Armin
EDL	01:05:28,831	01:05:31,135	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Between the two kind of arguments
EDL	01:05:31,135	01:05:32,671	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	So what would you think truth lies
EDL	01:05:33,951	01:05:36,255	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	How could something move fast
EDL	01:05:36,255	01:05:37,535	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Work hard in Stoughton
EDL	01:05:38,559	01:05:40,095	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Well first they have to understand what
EDL	01:05:40,607	01:05:42,143	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Their true value in differentiate
EDL	01:05:43,167	01:05:45,471	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	If you understand what your true differentiation is
EDL	01:05:45,471	01:05:46,239	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Anna value
EDL	01:05:46,239	01:05:48,031	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Then you work really hard on that
EDL	01:05:48,031	01:05:50,335	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And you have to work double time to build it till I get
EDL	01:05:51,871	01:05:52,639	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Okay
EDL	01:05:52,639	01:05:53,407	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You can't
EDL	01:05:53,407	01:05:59,551	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	There's certain crunch periods when it's a week or two weeks were people all we're all shipping something or something's got to happen
EDL	01:05:59,551	01:06:02,879	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Yes there's going to be extra time and yeah I could be 996
EDL	01:06:02,879	01:06:03,903	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Chicopee 997
EDL	01:06:03,903	01:06:06,719	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Whatever it takes
EDL	01:06:06,719	01:06:08,511	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	They can't be that all the time
EDL	01:06:08,511	01:06:09,279	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Ripe
EDL	01:06:09,279	01:06:11,071	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because again
EDL	01:06:11,071	01:06:12,863	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Just like you can be in the
EDL	01:06:12,863	01:06:15,423	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Echo chamber of a Spate of a

EDL	01:06:17,983	01:06:19,519	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You can be the echo chamber of a
EDL	01:06:19,519	01:06:23,359	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	What company and you can never get to see what reality is like outside
EDL	01:06:23,871	01:06:28,223	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And know what real problems are cuz all you're doing a 7 coming for us you need to remember what your own problems
EDL	01:06:31,807	01:06:34,623	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Everybody needs time to process
EDL	01:06:35,391	01:06:37,183	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I always say sometimes
EDL	01:06:37,951	01:06:39,487	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You need to slow down
EDL	01:06:39,487	01:06:40,255	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Speed up
EDL	01:06:41,023	01:06:47,423	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And that means having the proper checkpoints product development checkpoints right proper board means the proper communication
EDL	01:06:47,423	01:06:49,983	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Patience doesn't mean it needs to be this you know
EDL	01:06:50,495	01:06:53,567	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Lots of red tape and tons of you know
EDL	01:06:53,567	01:06:54,335	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Processing
EDL	01:06:54,335	01:06:56,639	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	But you gotta slow down and you got
EDL	01:06:56,639	01:06:57,663	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Taking some cases
EDL	01:06:57,663	01:06:59,967	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	To be able to go faster so that you don't make
EDL	01:07:01,247	01:07:02,527	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And that's about
EDL	01:07:02,527	01:07:03,807	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	You know
EDL	01:07:03,807	01:07:05,343	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Again experience manager
EDL	01:07:05,343	01:07:08,671	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	As opposed to just work faster and harder and we'll get it solved
EDL	01:07:08,671	01:07:09,695	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It doesn't work
EDL	01:07:10,207	01:07:13,279	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Because you're going to do that and like you said you're going to end up burning
EDL	01:07:13,791	01:07:14,815	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It's just not

EDL	01:07:30,687	01:07:31,455	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	The step on the brakes
EDL	01:07:31,455	01:07:32,223	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Sometimes
EDL	01:07:32,223	01:07:32,991	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And you know what

EDL	01:07:43,743	01:07:46,047	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Don't go for whatever you know in
EDL	01:07:46,047	01:07:49,375	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	And be distracted cuz you're sitting there walking and you're still on your phone like

EDL	01:07:50,911	01:07:51,935	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Sleep
EDL	01:07:53,215	01:07:55,775	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	It doesn't mean you having another meeting and I was literally
EDL	01:07:56,287	01:08:01,407	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	I called Tony time

EDL	01:08:20,607	01:08:21,887	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	As being the hungry now
EDL	01:08:22,655	01:08:25,215	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Not not not be aware enough

EDL	01:08:29,567	01:08:30,335	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Ra

EDL	01:08:36,223	01:08:37,247	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	Silicon Valley
EDL	01:08:37,759	01:08:41,599	| Tony_Fadell_on_Finding_the_New_New_Thing |	After 25 years it's great and nothing wrong with it but I get to learn new ways
