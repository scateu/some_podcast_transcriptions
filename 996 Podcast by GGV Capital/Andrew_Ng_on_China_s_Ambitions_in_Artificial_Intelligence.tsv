EDL	00:03:38,624	00:03:39,648	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	And also
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,696	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Are there also over 500
EDL	00:03:41,696	00:03:44,768	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Companies and governments working directly with Coursera
EDL	00:03:44,768	00:03:48,096	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	They tried to educate that were forces or the citizens of these different countries
EDL	00:03:48,608	00:03:50,656	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	So I think that's a cool star has been a great
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,216	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Educational to
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:56,032	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	To reach lots of individuals as well as

EDL	00:03:57,312	00:04:00,128	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	So Andrew given that your last work at a Chinese checker
EDL	00:04:00,896	00:04:03,712	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	I wonder how China figures in your vision for AI
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:08,320	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Especially now that we're seeing a lot more research and experts coming out of town
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:10,880	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Are you seeing an increase in
EDL	00:04:10,880	00:04:13,440	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Interest from China in your courses and your project
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:20,351	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	If special the newly-announced government fight in China on a I didn't reason they are in China has always been
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:23,167	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	I think it's even harder in the last few months
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:27,263	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	So I planted grass with netezza in Chinese
EDL	00:04:27,263	00:04:33,407	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Supposed a lot of our educational content on their website in China to make it more easy accessible
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:34,943	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	But I think the China
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,759	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Ecosystem is just incredible
EDL	00:04:37,759	00:04:43,647	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Globally the two top incentives of innovation for here today are Silicon Valley in Beijing
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,951	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	The office Silicon Valley in Beijing I think
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:50,047	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	You know calendar London a few other places maybe New York also very good

EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:45,440	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Because China is a society move so quickly
EDL	00:28:45,952	00:28:52,352	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	I feel like consumer products seem to have the ability to just go from zero to a hundred much faster in China
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:53,632	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	The US
EDL	00:28:53,632	00:28:59,008	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	And a lot of reasons for this I guess for us to maybe a peanut
EDL	00:28:59,008	00:29:05,152	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Societies of their field market segments have to fight for one of the times you think the US is like a hundred more

EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,088	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	You know
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:13,856	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Maybe has
EDL	00:29:13,856	00:29:17,184	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	700 Moccasin Road I'm on making all of these numbers up
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:21,280	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	And so things seem able to drop faster in China
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:25,632	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Did I see that new products in your business model sometimes take off faster
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:27,680	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	China and the fact that China is
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:31,008	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Motor mobile for society ready for all the people in China
EDL	00:29:31,520	00:29:37,920	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	The cell phone was the first competition device rather than in the US would we most of us use a laptop order
EDL	00:29:37,920	00:29:40,224	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	Stop cell phone
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:44,064	| Andrew_Ng_on_China_s_Ambitions_in_Artificial_Intelligence |	So that also enables mobile products to take off pretty quickly
