EDL	00:09:05,023	00:09:08,095	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	It's not so much the ratio to Chinese

EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:31,167	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So if you think about
EDL	00:14:31,167	00:14:32,703	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	What the US is

EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,711	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	That so essentially
EDL	00:14:44,223	00:14:44,991	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	China sort of

EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:00,607	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	You know
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:04,959	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	AI companies drone company that DJI and
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:09,055	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Leather caning in terms of absolute advantages vis-a-vis the US

EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,871	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So the US is targeting those guy
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:15,455	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	And those are competing with the US companies
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,991	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Where's the Chinese

EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:26,207	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Now we're talkin about
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:32,607	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Soil
EDL	00:15:32,607	00:15:33,375	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Into
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,655	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	That's hopeful I guess that's
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:41,311	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Is that one of the application that maybe other applicants
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:54,367	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Essentially sorbian is the Upstream product

EDL	00:15:56,927	00:16:03,327	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So that's one so it is it is it is it is complementary and the other
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:04,863	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Effect on China is
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,935	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Agriculture is a part of the
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,959	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	The core inflation
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:11,263	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:12,543	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	China
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:13,311	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Henna
EDL	00:16:13,311	00:16:14,335	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Afford to have
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:17,407	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	You know inflation right right
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:23,551	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So it really does hurt us have more of an impact on the Chinese macroeconomic situation
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:27,903	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Then it does on the United States
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,183	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	China
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,975	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Depends on the US
EDL	00:16:31,743	00:16:32,767	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	In terms of the
EDL	00:16:33,535	00:16:34,815	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Much more than the other way around
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:36,863	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So if you're just
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:40,959	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	No us is losing 150 billion dollars
EDL	00:16:41,727	00:16:46,079	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	China is losing you know whatever y500 write something like that
EDL	00:16:46,079	00:16:49,919	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So it does have a bigger effect on China than it does
EDL	00:16:51,455	00:16:52,223	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Yeah I'm such a
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:55,807	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Play I think
EDL	00:16:56,319	00:16:58,623	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Lot of times trade war is about Paula
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,927	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So basically who is going to bring
EDL	00:17:02,207	00:17:06,303	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So there I don't really have a very good way of reading the situation
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,607	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	So they sent that I have to
EDL	00:17:09,631	00:17:12,447	| Yasheng_Huang_of_MIT_on_the_Future_of_U.S.-China_Trade_Relations |	Say something about it I will say the following which is
