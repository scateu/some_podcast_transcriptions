EDL	00:00:17,322	00:00:20,208	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU MILLER: Welcome to our HR exit interview.
EDL	00:00:20,208	00:00:21,488	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF NASSER: Welcome to the HR exit interview.
EDL	00:00:21,488	00:00:22,960	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL CUSICK: This is so silly. [laughs]
EDL	00:00:22,960	00:00:25,936	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: All your answers will be purely confidential.
EDL	00:00:25,936	00:00:26,640	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:00:26,640	00:00:29,317	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Except for the ones that we're gonna broadcast to millions of people.
EDL	00:00:29,317	00:00:31,547	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah. Yeah, this is very bad HR practices.
EDL	00:00:31,547	00:00:33,385	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Hey, everyone. This is Lulu.
EDL	00:00:33,385	00:00:34,330	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: And Latif.
EDL	00:00:34,330	00:00:37,035	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Okay, number five it says here on our official questionnaire ...
EDL	00:00:37,035	00:00:37,663	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: And today ...
EDL	00:00:37,663	00:00:41,952	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: ... what was your favorite bathroom to use for number two?
EDL	00:00:41,952	00:00:42,911	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: [laughs]
EDL	00:00:42,911	00:00:43,672	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Oh, I can tell you.
EDL	00:00:43,672	00:00:46,137	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: ... we are talking to Radiolab producer Rachael Cusick.
EDL	00:00:46,137	00:00:46,879	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: That's me.
EDL	00:00:46,879	00:00:48,970	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: In the actual physical live studio with us.
EDL	00:00:48,970	00:00:51,328	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: In the physical studio. Oh!
EDL	00:00:51,328	00:00:54,560	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Yeah. Rach has been a producer on the show for six years.
EDL	00:00:54,560	00:00:58,529	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Very uneventful six years. Totally normal six years.
EDL	00:00:58,529	00:00:59,157	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah, nothing happened.
EDL	00:00:59,157	00:01:12,959	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: She has made—I think of you—I mean, you worked on the G series, you've done—you know, you did The Queen of Dying, which totally blows up grief and these kind of emotionally intense stories. But you've also done some of the dumbest ...
EDL	00:01:12,959	00:01:13,396	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs]
EDL	00:01:13,396	00:01:18,910	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Like, "Look, airplane farts! What if the Earth was made of blueberries?"
EDL	00:01:18,910	00:01:21,237	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I contain multitudes, thank you very much. [laughs]
EDL	00:01:21,237	00:01:28,395	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: You do! And—and we have brought you in here because we're gonna play one of your all time bangers.
EDL	00:01:28,395	00:01:29,568	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs]
EDL	00:01:29,568	00:01:34,922	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: And I think it was the first episode that you really—like, it was a full episode that you'd done.
EDL	00:01:34,922	00:01:42,079	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah, it was the first one where I was like, here's this little nugget, and let's, like, spend a whole hour staring at this nugget.
EDL	00:01:42,079	00:01:42,633	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:01:42,633	00:01:45,631	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And then the whole team then made it like a chicken nugget pack, you know? [laughs]
EDL	00:01:45,631	00:01:47,830	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: And—and this episode is called what?
EDL	00:01:47,830	00:01:49,131	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Cataclysm Sentence.
EDL	00:01:49,131	00:01:53,204	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: And we're doing this one today because it's great, but also because we are—we are ...
EDL	00:01:53,204	00:01:55,488	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: We're suffering our own cataclysm over here.
EDL	00:01:55,488	00:01:56,106	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Yeah.
EDL	00:01:56,106	00:01:59,935	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Which is that Rachael is leaving us.
EDL	00:01:59,935	00:02:00,756	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:02:00,756	00:02:02,271	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Leaving all of us. You too, listener.
EDL	00:02:02,271	00:02:02,976	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Yeah.
EDL	00:02:02,976	00:02:20,118	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah, I know! Aah! I'm leaving my grandma, I'm leaving a lot of people right now, but I myself am feeling my cataclysm of losing you guys and leaving the show, stepping out into new things that I don't even know what is waiting for me, but mostly moving geographically across to the other side of the world.
EDL	00:02:20,118	00:02:20,479	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: To?
EDL	00:02:20,479	00:02:21,318	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Australia.
EDL	00:02:21,318	00:02:22,779	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Australia.
EDL	00:02:22,779	00:02:26,619	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs] Yeah. Boy, that's gonna be really annoying to everybody who actually lives there.
EDL	00:02:26,619	00:02:39,025	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: [laughs] So in just a quick little—before we play this episode, can you just talk a little bit about how—how it came to be and, like, what—what happened?
EDL	00:02:39,025	00:02:52,038	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah. So in the beginning of the episode, you'll hear, like, exactly why I bumped into the idea, but basically I ran into this question that then I brought to a meeting, and I was just like, "I don't know what it is about this, but I need us to think about it." 
EDL	00:02:52,038	00:02:57,187	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I was just like, I want to get question asked to as many people as we can. 
EDL	00:02:57,187	00:03:11,602	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And for some reason, the whole team decided let's throw all of our love and attention into this. And everybody is gonna take a little corner of it, they're gonna, like, follow it into their deepest heart's content and call up the people they admire. 
EDL	00:03:11,602	00:03:16,177	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Everybody rallied around it, like, dozens of phone calls over months. 
EDL	00:03:16,177	00:03:19,984	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, it just felt like the scene at the end of the movie where you get, like, lifted up. 
EDL	00:03:19,984	00:03:28,603	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	It's like, "Yeah, let's carry this through all the way!" And then it was like a whole year-long thing, and then it came out in 2020 so, like, early days of the pandemic.
EDL	00:03:28,603	00:03:31,689	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Well, should we—should we take a listen?
EDL	00:03:31,689	00:03:32,443	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah!
EDL	00:03:32,443	00:03:34,384	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: And then maybe we'll ask you one thing at the very end.
EDL	00:03:34,384	00:03:35,483	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah, let's do it.
EDL	00:03:35,483	00:03:40,208	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: All right, so here we go: The Cataclysm Sentence from 2020.
EDL	00:03:40,208	00:03:40,822	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Ah!
EDL	00:03:40,822	00:03:47,078	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD ABUMRAD: Before we begin, just want to let you know this episode contains a couple moments of explicit language.
EDL	00:03:47,078	00:04:07,271	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[RADIOLAB INTRO]
EDL	00:04:07,271	00:04:08,315	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL CUSICK: All right. Hello?
EDL	00:04:08,315	00:04:16,490	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay, so this episode took the entire staff to put together, but it really began with one of our producers, Rachael Cusick.
EDL	00:04:16,490	00:04:18,342	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: What's happening Rachael Cusick?
EDL	00:04:18,342	00:04:24,263	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Not much, Jad Abumrad. Just stretching. Watching you eat a sandwich. Living life.
EDL	00:04:24,263	00:04:25,255	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I'm sorry. Living life?
EDL	00:04:25,255	00:04:26,289	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs]
EDL	00:04:26,289	00:04:27,702	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: All right.
EDL	00:04:27,702	00:04:28,402	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Cool.
EDL	00:04:28,402	00:04:36,113	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: All right, now that I've made a mess of my sitting area, so how did you—maybe take me back to the moment you—you—how did you bump into this?
EDL	00:04:36,113	00:04:44,745	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay. So I bumped into this idea because of this book that is in my hand right now. It's called Eating the Sun. And basically, I got pulled into this book because I was like, okay, eating.
EDL	00:04:44,745	00:04:45,799	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Eating.
EDL	00:04:45,799	00:04:51,836	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: That's pretty much all I need. [laughs] Just have that title in anything and I'm like, I'm sold. Send me a copy.
EDL	00:04:51,836	00:04:53,063	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: You are the foodiest among us.
EDL	00:04:53,063	00:05:10,247	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I am the foodiest. I love food so much. And so I thought this was gonna be about food. And this book comes, and each page is a different musing on science. Wonky wonky. But I'll just read a few: Planetary Motion; What is Heat? Milky Solar Galaxy System. So they're all kind of like universe-y reflections. 
EDL	00:05:10,247	00:05:25,472	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Anyway, pretty early on I'm flipping these pages and on, like, page 17, I come across this thing with Richard Feynman and this prompt that he gave in this lecture series back in the 1960s. And I was like, "Wow. That is perhaps the, like, coolest question I've ever seen this year."
EDL	00:05:25,472	00:05:28,305	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Okay, ready? Ready? Hold on, hold on.
EDL	00:05:28,305	00:05:32,295	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Wait, wait. Before you do that, maybe just set up, like, who Richard Feynman is?
EDL	00:05:32,295	00:05:44,625	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay. So Richard Feynman, this famous physicist. At the time, he was like a whippersnapper of Cal Tech. I imagine there was like a soundtrack, it's like Stayin' Alive, Stayin' Alive every time he, like, walked onto campus. He was like the hotshot. I think he had ...
EDL	00:05:44,625	00:05:45,723	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: He was pretty attractive, too.
EDL	00:05:45,723	00:05:46,748	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: He was! He was a handsome guy.
EDL	00:05:46,748	00:05:47,488	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah.
EDL	00:05:47,488	00:05:54,442	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Slicked back hair. So he was famous. He had not yet won the Nobel Prize, but he was, like, on his way to do it. He had just worked on the atomic bomb. 
EDL	00:05:54,442	00:06:03,824	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Everyone kind of knew who he was. But at the same time he was exploding on Cal Tech's campus, Cal Tech was having a problem because physics was so boring at the time. 
EDL	00:06:03,824	00:06:13,829	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, they could not get anyone to, like, come into an introductory physics class and get excited about it. So they tapped Richard Feynman to redo the physics curriculum for Physics 101.
EDL	00:06:13,829	00:06:19,350	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And so he was like, "Fine, I'll do it once but, like, that's it. You, like, take notes because I'm done after this." 
EDL	00:06:19,350	00:06:24,725	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And so he just, like, took at redefining what physics should be as an introductory thing. 
EDL	00:06:25,738	00:06:28,536	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So I actually went and found audio of this lecture.
EDL	00:06:28,536	00:06:33,523	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh, I think I've actually seen photos of this. Black and white. He's at the front of a classroom in front of a chalkboard.
EDL	00:06:33,523	00:06:34,181	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:06:34,181	00:06:40,665	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: For two years, I'm gonna lecture you on physics. I'm gonna lecture from the point of view that you are all going to be physicists. 
EDL	00:06:40,665	00:06:48,517	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	It's not the case of course, but that's what every professor in every subject does. So assuming that you're going to be physicists, you're going to have a lot to study.]
EDL	00:06:48,517	00:06:51,813	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Now, typically the way that Physics 101 used to be taught ...
EDL	00:06:51,813	00:06:56,234	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: There's 200 years of the most rapidly-developing batch of knowledge that there is.]
EDL	00:06:56,234	00:07:01,114	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... People spent, like, an entire semester of physics learning about, like, the history of physics.
EDL	00:07:01,114	00:07:09,104	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: There's so much in fact, that you might think that you can't learn all of it in four years. And you can't. You have to go to graduate school, too.]
EDL	00:07:09,104	00:07:11,242	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: They didn't learn anything kind of like poetic.
EDL	00:07:11,242	00:07:12,184	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:07:12,184	00:07:14,330	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So Feynman, before he launches into his lecture, he's like ...
EDL	00:07:14,330	00:07:17,409	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: Well, what should we teach first, if we're going to teach?]
EDL	00:07:17,409	00:07:21,701	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: "Look, I could teach you about the history of these equations and the formulas."
EDL	00:07:21,701	00:07:24,464	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: And then just showing how they work in all the various circumstances.]
EDL	00:07:24,464	00:07:27,216	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: But he doesn't. Instead ...
EDL	00:07:27,216	00:07:27,973	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: Now ...]
EDL	00:07:27,973	00:07:29,615	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... Feynman opens his entire lecture ...
EDL	00:07:29,615	00:07:30,682	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: The first lecture ...]
EDL	00:07:30,682	00:07:32,825	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... with this question.
EDL	00:07:32,825	00:07:53,648	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: If in a certain cataclysm, where all of the scientific knowledge is to be destroyed, but only one sentence is to be passed down to the next generations of creatures, what would be the best thing? The thing that contains the most information in the least number of words?]
EDL	00:07:53,648	00:07:56,730	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So that is the question.
EDL	00:07:56,730	00:07:59,237	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So if the world ends and all information is gone?
EDL	00:07:59,237	00:08:03,256	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: But we can only pass on one sentence to the next generation.
EDL	00:08:03,256	00:08:06,971	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: There's a little scrap of paper fluttering in the post-apocalyptic breeze.
EDL	00:08:06,971	00:08:12,250	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yes, but it has to be the least amount of words with the most amount of information. So I can't give you, like, a textbook, you know?
EDL	00:08:12,250	00:08:12,672	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Hmm.
EDL	00:08:12,672	00:08:16,890	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: There has to be one thing that's concise and can unlock the universe.
EDL	00:08:16,890	00:08:18,095	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Like, what would you write on the paper?
EDL	00:08:18,095	00:08:25,285	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Well, yeah. What would you do to, like, pass the baton to the next generation with the simplest thing that you could possibly think up?
EDL	00:08:25,285	00:08:28,602	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh, that's such an interesting question. Did Feynman in that lecture have an answer?
EDL	00:08:28,602	00:08:29,883	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yes. He said ...
EDL	00:08:29,883	00:08:31,193	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: Our belief ...]
EDL	00:08:31,193	00:08:32,645	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... it is the atomic hypothesis ...
EDL	00:08:32,645	00:08:51,549	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: ... it is the atomic hypothesis or the atomic fact or whatever you want to call it, that all things are made out of atoms, little particles that move around, are in perpetual motion, attract each other when they're some distance apart but repel being squeezed into one another.]
EDL	00:08:51,549	00:08:52,549	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Period.
EDL	00:08:52,549	00:08:56,965	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So this is his sentence that would be on the paper fluttering in the breeze?
EDL	00:08:56,965	00:08:57,647	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yes.
EDL	00:08:57,647	00:09:03,600	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: That would land in the hand of a little alien child, and he would expect that to be the thing that they use to restart their civilization?
EDL	00:09:03,600	00:09:09,337	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yes. Which if you are, like, that little child, you're like, "What the hell am I supposed to do with this piece of paper?"
EDL	00:09:09,337	00:09:10,331	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I was like, "So what?"
EDL	00:09:10,331	00:09:22,069	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I just want to know how to build a fire, you know? [laughs] But the thing that I love about Feynman's answer is that once you begin to pick it apart, it just begins to grow.
EDL	00:09:22,069	00:09:23,058	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: You'll see.]
EDL	00:09:23,058	00:09:23,791	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And grow.
EDL	00:09:23,791	00:09:31,504	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: There's an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking is applied.]
EDL	00:09:31,504	00:09:34,822	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I've talked to a lot of physicists this week to understand what the hell the atomic hypothesis is.
EDL	00:09:34,822	00:09:35,136	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	00:09:35,136	00:09:35,771	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Come with me.
EDL	00:09:35,771	00:09:36,492	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah, please.
EDL	00:09:36,492	00:09:39,862	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay. So let's just take it part by part. First part ...
EDL	00:09:39,862	00:09:42,315	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: All things are made out of atoms.]
EDL	00:09:42,315	00:09:43,075	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Like ...
EDL	00:09:43,075	00:09:44,800	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Ships. Shoes. A computer!]
EDL	00:09:44,800	00:09:45,419	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... everything.
EDL	00:09:45,419	00:09:47,373	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: The air, the trees. And sealing wax.]
EDL	00:09:47,373	00:09:50,868	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: The, like, coffee/seltzer/sandwich.
EDL	00:09:50,868	00:09:51,689	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: That I just spilled all over my ...
EDL	00:09:51,689	00:09:52,612	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: That you're just spilling—yeah. You are atoms.
EDL	00:09:52,612	00:09:54,745	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: You, me and everything there is.]
EDL	00:09:54,745	00:09:56,939	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Atoms are the ingredients.
EDL	00:09:56,939	00:09:58,405	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: The building bricks of the whole universe.]
EDL	00:09:58,405	00:10:01,667	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: That's part one. Part two ...
EDL	00:10:01,667	00:10:02,478	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: Atoms.]
EDL	00:10:02,478	00:10:03,950	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Atoms are all moving all the time.
EDL	00:10:03,950	00:10:07,744	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: The continuous jiggling and bouncing, turning and twisting around one another.]
EDL	00:10:07,744	00:10:13,198	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: That's really important, because once you start to figure out that atoms are in motion, you begin to figure out things like ...
EDL	00:10:13,198	00:10:14,468	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Let's look at heat.]
EDL	00:10:14,468	00:10:15,076	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... temperature.
EDL	00:10:15,076	00:10:16,846	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: With an atomic eye, so to speak.]
EDL	00:10:16,846	00:10:17,838	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: There's also pressure.
EDL	00:10:17,838	00:10:20,217	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Electricity is a source of energy.]
EDL	00:10:20,217	00:10:29,593	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Electricity. All these things have to do with how fast atoms are moving, how many atoms are moving, what parts of atoms are moving. So from there you're, like, a hop and a skip away from, like ...
EDL	00:10:29,593	00:10:31,710	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: The power of steam.]
EDL	00:10:31,710	00:10:34,718	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... steam engines. Telephones. The electrical grid.]
EDL	00:10:34,718	00:10:36,632	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Gaseous pressure drives this plane forward.]
EDL	00:10:36,632	00:10:37,642	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Understanding flight.
EDL	00:10:37,642	00:10:38,607	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Good evening. We had a high today ...]
EDL	00:10:38,607	00:10:39,365	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Weather patterns.
EDL	00:10:39,365	00:10:41,690	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Barometric pressure, 30.04 at steady.]
EDL	00:10:41,690	00:10:43,439	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So that's part two.
EDL	00:10:43,439	00:10:44,069	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	00:10:44,069	00:10:48,645	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Part one tells you what matter is. Part two tells you basic things about that matter. Part three ...
EDL	00:10:48,645	00:10:54,697	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Richard Feynman: Atoms attract each other when they are some distance apart, but repel being squeezed into one another.]
EDL	00:10:54,697	00:11:02,751	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... is basically how atoms interact with each other. And once you understand that, it is huge.
EDL	00:11:05,849	00:11:17,843	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Because in this last part is basically all of chemistry. Once you start understanding how atoms come together to make molecules, you can start putting molecules together to make things like ...
EDL	00:11:17,843	00:11:18,546	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Penicillin.]
EDL	00:11:18,546	00:11:19,262	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... antibiotics.
EDL	00:11:19,262	00:11:20,425	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Polio vaccine.]
EDL	00:11:20,425	00:11:21,053	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Vaccines.

EDL	00:11:24,345	00:11:25,712	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: You can build things like a combustion engine.
EDL	00:11:25,712	00:11:26,919	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: The copper-top battery.]
EDL	00:11:26,919	00:11:28,144	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Batteries. All sorts of ...
EDL	00:11:28,144	00:11:28,891	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Plastics.]
EDL	00:11:28,891	00:11:29,494	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Rubbers.
EDL	00:11:29,494	00:11:30,774	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: This new super belt tire.]

EDL	00:11:35,038	00:11:37,150	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: But also, come on, balloons. Or ...

EDL	00:11:38,665	00:11:40,969	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... you can start to understand things like proteins.
EDL	00:11:40,969	00:11:41,989	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Amino acids.]
EDL	00:11:41,989	00:11:42,922	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Fatty acids.

EDL	00:11:45,588	00:11:48,527	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: To me, like, this is what makes this sentence so cool. Because ...
EDL	00:11:48,527	00:11:50,026	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Electricity is a source of ...]
EDL	00:11:50,026	00:11:57,652	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... everything is in there. Everything you need to know about the natural world and how to manipulate it.
EDL	00:12:00,314	00:12:03,963	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Hmm. But do you feel like ...
EDL	00:12:03,963	00:12:09,674	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Oh, sorry. Also, chocolate chip cookies. [laughs] Think about a world without chocolate chip cookies. You would not know ...
EDL	00:12:09,674	00:12:11,786	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Is there anything else on there because I ...
EDL	00:12:11,786	00:12:18,740	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: No. Chocolate cookie—chocolate chip cookies were the big finale. I don't think you really responded properly, but that was the finale. So ...
EDL	00:12:18,740	00:12:22,700	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Well, you know what? I'm gonna take your chocolate chip cookie inspiration and follow it.
EDL	00:12:22,700	00:12:23,252	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay. Great.
EDL	00:12:23,252	00:12:26,804	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Because what is a chocolate chip cookie? It is flavor.
EDL	00:12:26,804	00:12:27,404	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:12:27,404	00:12:37,177	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Which I'm sure we could sort of reduce to nothing but the sparking of electrons on a certain membrane in the tongue or something. 
EDL	00:12:37,177	00:12:46,605	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	But really what chocolate chip cookies are, I hope you'll agree, is the—that momentary ecstatic feeling you feel.
EDL	00:12:46,605	00:12:47,181	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:12:47,181	00:12:51,043	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: And the sense of joy and well-being, and then the subsequent crash, right?
EDL	00:12:51,043	00:12:51,491	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yes.
EDL	00:12:51,491	00:12:55,052	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So all of these things are—do you feel like they are reducible to atoms?
EDL	00:12:55,052	00:12:55,542	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yes.
EDL	00:12:55,542	00:13:02,406	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Do you feel like love is explained by the atomic hypothesis? Do you feel like the complexities of human interactions ...
EDL	00:13:02,406	00:13:03,350	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: No.
EDL	00:13:03,350	00:13:04,780	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Morality?
EDL	00:13:04,780	00:13:16,497	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: No. That is where it falls short. Everything that's physical in our world can be described by atoms. But, like, music? Like, you can't look at the atomic hypothesis and create, like, Mozart.
EDL	00:13:16,497	00:13:17,169	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Right.
EDL	00:13:17,169	00:13:21,873	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Or you can't, like, learn how to be a good partner with the atomic hypothesis, you know?
EDL	00:13:21,873	00:13:22,525	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Right.
EDL	00:13:22,525	00:13:25,244	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Like, there are these big gaps that you just are missing.
EDL	00:13:25,244	00:13:28,723	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I think that—and thus a door opens.
EDL	00:13:28,723	00:13:30,828	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. [laughs]
EDL	00:13:30,828	00:13:37,292	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Don't you want to hear—don't you wanna hear the—a musician answer—do Feynman's exercise?
EDL	00:13:37,292	00:13:37,783	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:13:37,783	00:13:43,992	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Or—I suddenly want to hear, who's the sort of great philosopher of chocolate chip cookies?
EDL	00:13:43,992	00:13:44,599	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And so ...
EDL	00:13:44,599	00:13:47,244	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Cue music.
EDL	00:13:47,244	00:13:50,584	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah, what's the music for a cataclysm?
EDL	00:13:50,584	00:13:51,703	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I don't know. I mean, it's ...
EDL	00:13:51,703	00:13:55,340	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Is it really loud? Or is it a little, like, dust bowl and it's quiet, you know?
EDL	00:13:55,340	00:14:09,093	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I think it starts small, like a tone. And then it's two tones, and then it's more. And then it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and it expands. And it feels kind of primal but also hopeful, maybe? I don't know.
EDL	00:14:09,093	00:14:13,958	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: As you were talking, that did remind me of a thought that I had when I came across this in the very first place, 
EDL	00:14:13,958	00:14:25,564	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	because it does—when I—I think I came across it, like, a year ago when I was feeling like everyone—like, the political conversation was just especially—what's the word when you think, like, the sky is falling? 
EDL	00:14:25,564	00:14:28,908	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, Chicken Little-esque. Where it's like everything is falling apart, like everything ...
EDL	00:14:28,908	00:14:29,851	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Apocalyptic?
EDL	00:14:29,851	00:14:39,478	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yes. It felt like everyone felt doomed. And I was like, if the world actually was falling apart around us, what would be the only thing that we have to show for it? 
EDL	00:14:39,478	00:14:47,349	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, what is a way to, like, bring what Feynman thought back in the '60s and bring it to today when it does kind of feel like everyone thinks the sky is falling?
EDL	00:14:47,349	00:14:48,024	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah.
EDL	00:14:48,024	00:14:54,700	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I should just say quick the two of us had this conversation many months ago back when the world was a very different place.
EDL	00:14:54,700	00:14:58,046	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: How does it resonate? I mean, tell me a little bit more how does it resonate with you personally?
EDL	00:14:58,046	00:15:04,278	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I mean, this is coming from a place that I think I'm, like, pretty lucky to have this thought because I'm definitely, like, very lucky in a lot of ways. 
EDL	00:15:04,278	00:15:06,551	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	But, like, I think I'm just like a hopeful person. 
EDL	00:15:06,551	00:15:16,134	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I often, like, love spending time with older people in my family and, like, feeling like before they go, I need to get, like, whatever wisdom they have 
EDL	00:15:16,134	00:15:24,262	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	because, like, once they're gone, it's gone, you know? And so when I think about that, I'm like, I just want to, like, pull all the goodness out before, like, something goes wrong.
EDL	00:15:24,262	00:15:24,672	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah.
EDL	00:15:24,672	00:15:25,582	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And preserve it.
EDL	00:15:25,582	00:15:29,035	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Whose brain—who are you talking about? Whose brains for you personally are you trying to do that with?
EDL	00:15:29,035	00:15:33,398	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I mean, I think about it—I was talking to my friend and they were like, "Why do you only hang out with old people?" 
EDL	00:15:33,398	00:15:39,851	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Because I was just like—I think most people—like, even if—because I'm 24. But, like, someone who's 30, I think they have seen more of the world than I have. 
EDL	00:15:39,851	00:15:42,465	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I would rather spend time with someone who's ...
EDL	00:15:42,465	00:15:45,526	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh my God, your 24-year-old friends are talking about 30-year-olds as if they're old people?
EDL	00:15:45,526	00:15:53,587	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Well I mean, a lot of my, like, young friends, like, don't want to look towards older people because they think, like, this is a mess and, like, we are the future and we need to do this. 
EDL	00:15:53,587	00:16:02,551	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I totally agree with that in a lot of ways, but I also think, like, why start from scratch if there could be something pulled out of the dumpster that, like, might be helpful? 
EDL	00:16:02,551	00:16:13,942	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And so, like, my grandma—like, my grandma and I, she's like the most important person to me in the world. So that's, like, one person. But, like, every like—like you or like Robert. Or, like, old people.
EDL	00:16:13,942	00:16:19,831	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Old people. Thanks. That's fine. I'll—I will take on that moniker. 
EDL	00:16:19,831	00:16:28,001	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	What do you—I mean, none of my business but I'm suddenly curious to know, what kinds of questions—do you sit with your grandma 
EDL	00:16:28,001	00:16:34,134	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	and you ask her just general questions or do you have more specific things you wonder about with someone of her age?
EDL	00:16:34,134	00:16:47,418	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Well, like, it's pretty—like I—so my mom died when I was six and so, like, one thing that seems to motivate I think a lot of that curiosity is, like, my older siblings—I was the youngest of—the youngest of five who lost her. 
EDL	00:16:47,418	00:17:02,006	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And they all have these, like, very concrete memories that, like, when I think about it it's like I arrived on the scene right after she left the scene. Like, when my memory finally started to kick in it's, like, right when she left.
EDL	00:17:02,006	00:17:03,702	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Do you remember anything about her?
EDL	00:17:03,702	00:17:12,385	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: There are a few memories I know for sure are mine. And then after those few, like, I think on one hand I can count the ones I know are mine. 
EDL	00:17:12,385	00:17:26,149	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And so a lot of the times when they talk about these things, like these birthday parties that she used to throw or, like, her laugh, or the, like, music she'd play in the minivan, I—like, I don't actually remember any of those things for myself.
EDL	00:17:26,149	00:17:32,235	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I mean how do you fill that then? Do you talk to your—do you try and just ply anecdotes from your older siblings?
EDL	00:17:32,235	00:17:39,264	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I don't know. Like, some of it I feel like a little sad that I have to ask for those things. And so sometimes I just, like, hang back and let them talk. 
EDL	00:17:39,264	00:17:45,452	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And then I feel a little bit jealous, but then I also do go searching for them, like, sometimes with my grandma. Like, I call my grandma once a week. 
EDL	00:17:45,452	00:17:49,868	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And, like, she told me this one story the other day that I just thought was so funny. 
EDL	00:17:49,868	00:17:54,433	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, it was this sense of humor of my mom that I, like, didn't even know existed. 
EDL	00:17:54,433	00:18:00,310	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And that just felt so—it was just like meeting a different side of her that I had no idea was there.
EDL	00:18:00,310	00:18:01,025	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah.
EDL	00:18:01,025	00:18:05,856	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: But it was just this, like, little angle of, like, a diamond gem, you know? 
EDL	00:18:05,856	00:18:11,990	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, there's some little surface that, like, I just felt my thumb go over, and I never knew it was there. 
EDL	00:18:11,990	00:18:15,830	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And, like, I don't know. I just kind of want to feel all the textures.
EDL	00:18:15,830	00:18:16,694	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah.
EDL	00:18:16,694	00:18:22,070	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And, like, memories of people because I know how easily they just go away.
EDL	00:18:22,070	00:18:22,785	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah.
EDL	00:18:24,246	00:18:28,032	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I think I, like, walk through the world collecting things. 
EDL	00:18:28,032	00:18:29,497	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, I'm like a little stick collector. 
EDL	00:18:29,497	00:18:32,118	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, I want to, like, collect all the sticks I can. 
EDL	00:18:32,118	00:18:35,145	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Because I know what it feels like to feel, like, empty-handed.

EDL	00:18:41,084	00:19:00,343	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So what began as that conversation with Rachael about the cataclysm sentence and what could you give—what's the simplest thing you could pass forward for the next person to hold onto, well what happened is that really as a staff we got interested in the idea. 
EDL	00:19:02,305	00:19:05,415	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Kind of got fixated on it, actually. And so what we did ...
EDL	00:19:05,415	00:19:07,601	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[PHONE MESSAGE: Call from private caller.]
EDL	00:19:07,601	00:19:08,806	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: ... we started calling people.
EDL	00:19:08,806	00:19:09,491	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	NICHOLSON BAKER: Hello?
EDL	00:19:09,491	00:19:11,419	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MATT KIELTY: Hello is this Mr. Nick Baker?
EDL	00:19:11,419	00:19:13,142	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	NICHOLSON BAKER: This is, indeed. Hang on one second.
EDL	00:19:13,142	00:19:13,611	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Dozens ...
EDL	00:19:13,611	00:19:14,368	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Hello, hello, can you hear me?
EDL	00:19:14,368	00:19:15,378	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	WOMAN: Yes, I can hear you.
EDL	00:19:15,378	00:19:16,588	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: ... and dozens of people.
EDL	00:19:16,588	00:19:17,195	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MATT: Hello, Merrill?
EDL	00:19:17,195	00:19:17,739	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MERRILL GARBUS: Yeah.
EDL	00:19:17,739	00:19:21,686	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Artists, writers, philosophers, historians, chefs, musicians.
EDL	00:19:21,686	00:19:22,951	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So I sent you an email.
EDL	00:19:22,951	00:19:24,245	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: And we asked them ...
EDL	00:19:24,245	00:19:25,505	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: That asked you a question.
EDL	00:19:25,505	00:19:40,320	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: ... Feynman's question. If hypothetically the world were to end and everything was lost, all our knowledge gone, what would be the most important information in the least amount of words that you would convey to the next set of people? 
EDL	00:19:40,320	00:19:45,279	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	What would be your sentence? We're gonna play you a bunch of the answers that we got. 
EDL	00:19:45,279	00:19:49,014	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We can't play all of them because that would take four hours, so we're just gonna play you a selection. 
EDL	00:19:49,014	00:19:51,882	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And that's coming up right after this break.
EDL	00:19:51,882	00:21:01,194	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[BREAK]; 69.312s
EDL	00:21:01,194	00:21:17,410	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. And today we are answering one question: if the world ends tomorrow, what would be the one sentence you would leave for the next generation of humans or creatures or aliens or whoever comes next? 
EDL	00:21:17,410	00:21:23,258	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	What would be your cataclysm sentence that would pass on the most amount of wisdom in the fewest number of words? 
EDL	00:21:23,258	00:21:28,182	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We asked this question to a bunch of artists and writers and scientists, all sorts of people. 
EDL	00:21:28,182	00:21:33,210	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We got all sorts of answers. We're gonna play you a selection of those answers now, starting with ...
EDL	00:21:33,210	00:21:38,853	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	CAITLIN DOUGHTY: For me, it's something like you will die, and that's the most important thing.
EDL	00:21:38,853	00:21:42,191	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: ... writer, mortician Caitlin Doughty.
EDL	00:21:42,191	00:21:54,500	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	CAITLIN DOUGHTY: And I think most people get that. I think most people get that they're gonna die, but I don't think what most people get is that the fact that they're going to die is the most important thing that will ever happen to them. 
EDL	00:21:54,500	00:22:08,421	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Humans are one of the few creatures that understand death, and understand—live—live their whole lives with the knowledge of their deaths. And so it's this conflict within us. 
EDL	00:22:08,421	00:22:18,519	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We live in these shitty, decaying bodies, but we feel so special and we feel so important. So how do you reconcile those two things? 
EDL	00:22:18,519	00:22:27,255	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	It's hard to reconcile them, so you have to create, you have to transcend. You have to have religion, you have to have communities, you have to have art. 
EDL	00:22:27,255	00:22:37,573	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Those are created by our—our fear and our strange, difficult, weird relationship with death.
EDL	00:22:42,300	00:22:43,955	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	ESPERANZA SPALDING: Okay. Oh, so let's talk about fear.
EDL	00:22:43,955	00:22:48,081	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Esperanza Spalding. Musician and wolf enthusiast.
EDL	00:22:48,081	00:22:50,715	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	ESPERANZA SPALDING: Okay, here we go. Here's your parallel from the ecosystem. 
EDL	00:22:50,715	00:23:00,748	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone Park, at first the thinking was we're just doing this because we don't fully understand yet all the ways that this species is important, 
EDL	00:23:00,748	00:23:05,313	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	but we know that it is and it's been absent and we finally have this opportunity to reintroduce them into Yellowstone. 
EDL	00:23:05,313	00:23:09,655	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So of course, all the biologists were studying this like crazy, conservation biologists. 
EDL	00:23:09,655	00:23:19,446	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And the first thing that happened was all the game who hadn't been subjected to any threats, they were—they were at the top of the food chain. 
EDL	00:23:19,446	00:23:23,532	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	All of a sudden, they all became more alert and more responsive. 
EDL	00:23:23,532	00:23:28,225	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And they stopped grazing constantly in the exact same part of the river. 
EDL	00:23:28,225	00:23:31,916	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	They had to move more because now there was this, like, threat of the wolf.
EDL	00:23:31,916	00:23:40,849	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So what happened is, they start moving more, they start grazing higher up in the hills where they're less likely to be just, you know, picked off in these low grasslands. 
EDL	00:23:40,849	00:23:49,878	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So what happens is the banks of the riverbank get firmer, which means the flow of the river becomes stronger, which means beavers can come in and start to build their dams. 
EDL	00:23:49,878	00:24:00,472	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Also because the—the game is not grazing in the same area, trees that previously had been chewed up in their early sapling stages start growing. So songbirds return. 
EDL	00:24:00,472	00:24:14,252	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	All these species of—of bird come back into Yellowstone that had been absent because it didn't have the right canopy cover. And because the beavers come in, that creates more pocket environments for other animals and that brings in more big predators who are eating what the beavers are attracting. 
EDL	00:24:14,252	00:24:24,991	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So basically, this one species who had become dominant and very comfortable and at the top of their food chain, 
EDL	00:24:24,991	00:24:41,252	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	just the presence of them having to confront regularly and respond creatively to a little fear completely changed the health and the landscape and the sustainability of the ecosystem. 
EDL	00:24:44,772	00:24:58,733	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So maybe it's like—maybe it's like just that: The willingness to respond creatively to fear, without trying to eradicate the source of the fear.

EDL	00:25:13,273	00:25:18,122	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	CORD JEFFERSON: My name is Cord Jefferson, and I'm a television writer and producer. 
EDL	00:25:18,122	00:25:27,618	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Okay, I wrote down a bunch of different things that I then erased, and then I sort of settled on one that I thought was definitely going to be my thing, which was about race and racism. 
EDL	00:25:27,618	00:25:37,950	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And, I—like, I had that sentence all prepared, which was, "Race isn't real unless you make it real, at which point it will become the biggest problem in the whole world." 
EDL	00:25:37,950	00:25:43,572	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And then I started thinking that, you know, what's—what's sort of even bigger than racism? 
EDL	00:25:43,572	00:25:47,520	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And to me, like, even bigger than racism is just general fear. 
EDL	00:25:47,520	00:25:55,898	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And my personal history is that my—my mother is a—a white woman who married my father, who's a Black man, and they disowned her. 
EDL	00:25:55,898	00:26:07,887	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And so I—I never—never met my grandparents. I would—I would send them letters which they would return until I stopped sending them when I was—I think when I was about 10 or 11. 
EDL	00:26:07,887	00:26:17,570	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I just—and I saw how much that devastated my mother, and how much it sort of ripped her family apart and it sort of estranged her from her brother for a while. 
EDL	00:26:17,570	00:26:24,548	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And it was—yeah, it was just sort of in a way that I remember thinking like, this is—this is so pointless. 
EDL	00:26:24,548	00:26:26,122	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, it's just so stupid. 
EDL	00:26:26,122	00:26:34,640	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, I remember—I remember think—thinking, like, what could anybody in my family do to—that would make me, you know, hate them forever? 
EDL	00:26:34,640	00:26:39,482	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And it's like, you know, the skin color was—was just so insignificant to me.
EDL	00:26:39,482	00:26:54,863	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	CORD JEFFERSON: And I think that fear shapes everything from geopolitics to just even people's unwillingness to try new things and to go new places and to travel and to—to ski and to go out and meet people. 
EDL	00:26:54,863	00:27:07,407	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And it causes so much conflict, and it causes so much aggression and hate that I think that, you know, I—I believe sort of racism is wrapped up in that, but fear I think is—is our—our bigger problem.
EDL	00:27:07,407	00:27:10,641	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MERRILL GARBUS: [humming]
EDL	00:27:10,641	00:27:12,198	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	CORD JEFFERSON: My sentence is ...
EDL	00:27:12,198	00:27:14,654	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MERRILL GARBUS: [humming]
EDL	00:27:14,654	00:27:19,682	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	CORD JEFFERSON: "The only things you're innately afraid of are falling and loud noises. 
EDL	00:27:19,682	00:27:23,848	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	The rest of your fears are learned and mostly negligible."
EDL	00:27:25,703	00:27:36,936	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MERRILL GARBUS: Merrill Garbus. I lead a band called Tune-Yards. Fear is very—what's that word? 
EDL	00:27:36,936	00:27:48,905	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Compelling, as a motivation. It's very essential to who we are, and it makes a lot of sense because we did have to run from things. 
EDL	00:27:48,905	00:27:57,755	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We needed to be vigilant, and if we weren't then we died. But I do think that it's a choice. 
EDL	00:27:57,755	00:28:05,703	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So I thought wanting to communicate as much as possible with this one sentence that it would be good to sing the sentence.
EDL	00:28:05,703	00:28:14,834	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MERRILL GARBUS: [singing] Evolving over millennia. We learn to fly. 
EDL	00:28:14,834	00:28:27,453	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We're nourished by the fruits of the Earth. Inspired by each other's music. But we failed as a species. 
EDL	00:28:27,453	00:28:39,742	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Injured the very hands that fed us, when we chose fear as our ruler. 
EDL	00:28:39,742	00:28:54,440	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	When we could not grasp being mere fractals in one collective being. In the end there was no "we."
EDL	00:29:06,271	00:29:21,087	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Masanobu Fukuoka: [speaking Japanese]]
EDL	00:29:21,087	00:29:29,779	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JENNY ODELL: It reminds me of this thing called "Do nothing farming" that a Japanese farmer named Masanobu Fukuoka came up with. 
EDL	00:29:29,779	00:29:40,300	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And he kind of went against all of the established customs of rice farming in Japan, and decided to just kind of like pay attention to how things work without any intervention. 
EDL	00:29:40,300	00:29:45,132	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So he said that he was inspired by an empty lot full of grasses and weeds and how productive that actually was. 
EDL	00:29:45,132	00:29:49,724	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And so he went about farming without flooding the fields. 
EDL	00:29:49,724	00:29:54,076	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	He just threw the seeds on the ground kind of when they would naturally fall on the ground in the fall. 
EDL	00:29:54,076	00:29:58,558	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	He didn't use fertilizer, he just grew kind of ground cover. 
EDL	00:29:58,558	00:30:05,557	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And then he threw the stalks back on top when he was done. And he just kind of had to do everything at exactly the right time that it would happen naturally. 
EDL	00:30:05,557	00:30:13,980	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	But this farm was more productive and more sustainable than neighboring farms. All of human effort is meaningless, as he puts it. 
EDL	00:30:13,980	00:30:24,262	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So he says humanity knows nothing at all. There's no intrinsic value in anything, and every action is a futile, meaningless effort.

EDL	00:30:44,955	00:30:52,483	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	immensities of thought and feeling, all deducible to electrical impulses coursing through us at 80 feet per second,
EDL	00:30:52,483	00:31:04,405	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	yet responsible for every love poem that has ever been written, every symphony ever composed, every scientific breakthrough measuring out nerve conduction and mapping out space-time. 
EDL	00:31:04,405	00:31:16,792	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	I mean, it's astonishing that we're not, you know, spending every day in marvel at the improbability that we even exist. 

EDL	00:31:22,556	00:31:26,965	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	You know, somehow we—we went from bacteria to Bach. 
EDL	00:31:26,965	00:31:37,708	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We—we learned to make fire and music and mathematics, and here we are now, these—these walking wildernesses of mossy feelings 
EDL	00:31:37,708	00:31:44,626	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	and brambled thoughts beneath this overstory of 100 trillion synapses 
EDL	00:31:49,719	00:31:55,418	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	that are just coruscating with these restless questions.
EDL	00:31:55,418	00:31:56,650	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	ALISON GOPNICK: Why?
EDL	00:31:56,650	00:31:57,974	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Professor Alison Gopnick.
EDL	00:31:57,974	00:32:02,262	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	ALISON GOPNICK: My sentence would be single word: Why?

EDL	00:32:21,000	00:32:24,434	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: I'd want to show that we loved it here, you know?
EDL	00:32:24,434	00:32:26,222	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Animator, Rebecca Sugar.
EDL	00:32:26,222	00:32:28,804	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: We have, you know, evidence, from Pompeii.
EDL	00:32:28,804	00:32:42,106	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Pompeii's place in history is quite unique in that in one day it was completely hermetically sealed. In other words, time stood still.]
EDL	00:32:42,106	00:32:45,284	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: We have all of these physical examples ...
EDL	00:32:45,284	00:32:50,107	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Horendeus the baker gave a party for his brother Neo, who was just elected magistrate.]
EDL	00:32:50,107	00:32:52,143	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: ... that humans have loved being here.
EDL	00:32:52,143	00:32:54,479	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Their friends came and drank all night.]
EDL	00:32:54,479	00:33:01,504	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: That we're having a great time. [laughs] So that may be the greatest message a person could leave is to just ...
EDL	00:33:01,504	00:33:06,273	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: This is the atrium of a typical Roman house.]
EDL	00:33:06,273	00:33:09,014	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: ... leave behind some record of how you were living.
EDL	00:33:09,014	00:33:11,870	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: The family life revolved around this area.]
EDL	00:33:11,870	00:33:17,807	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: You know, leave behind your nest and evidence of how you were in it with the people that you loved.
EDL	00:33:17,807	00:33:24,947	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: You will find that you will have small rooms, the cubicles, the triclinium or dining room, which we find back there.]
EDL	00:33:24,947	00:33:30,728	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: Maybe that will be the thing to leave is, you know, some evidence of my nest.
EDL	00:33:30,728	00:33:36,276	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: The father would have got up, and the servants would have gone into her cubicle and done her hair.]
EDL	00:33:36,276	00:33:45,768	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: And maybe the ultimate goal would be to just devote oneself fully to creating the life that feels the best on this world in the time that we have.
EDL	00:33:53,400	00:34:10,728	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: August 24. [explosion]]
EDL	00:34:10,728	00:34:24,636	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	REBECCA SUGAR: But actually, I think the greatest thing to come out of the ruins of Pompeii is that they had toilet stalls where two people could sit together next to one another so you can have a conversation. 
EDL	00:34:24,636	00:34:36,019	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	It's a fabulous idea. Why did we not learn from this? Why are we wasting time that we could be spending with our friends? Why are we wasting that time?
EDL	00:34:46,720	00:34:53,901	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: All right, bathroom break. We'll be back in a sec.
EDL	00:34:53,901	00:35:21,483	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[BREAK]
EDL	00:35:21,483	00:35:23,006	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	NICHOLSON BAKER: Feynman says again?
EDL	00:35:23,006	00:35:25,075	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: We pick back up with writer Nicholson Baker.
EDL	00:35:25,075	00:35:26,134	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	NICHOLSON BAKER: Oh, God.
EDL	00:35:26,134	00:35:27,827	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	SIMON ADLER: Okay, yeah. Here we are. Here we are. Okay.
EDL	00:35:27,827	00:35:29,342	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: And producer Simon Adler.
EDL	00:35:29,342	00:35:41,683	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	SIMON: All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.
EDL	00:35:41,683	00:36:00,500	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	NICHOLSON BAKER: I like it. I mean, I think it's got a certain lilt. But think if you—there was—the cataclysm happened, and the creature that inherited the Earth was a super-intelligent form of seal. 
EDL	00:36:00,500	00:36:13,096	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	You know, there—there's beaches and they're just covered with these seals and they're still making those strange seal noises, but they're actually intensely verbal creatures. 
EDL	00:36:13,096	00:36:33,012	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And somehow, some particular seal gets this thing that comes zapping down from the sky, which is a—which is a voice from the deep past or the recorded essence of brilliant scientific knowledge which is, 
EDL	00:36:33,012	00:36:39,092	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	"All things are made of little things and they—and they push against each other and they—sometimes they push back when they squeeze." 
EDL	00:36:39,092	00:36:58,094	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Well, what is that very bright seal going to do? I mean, what—what is that—how—it's gonna help them more quickly invent an atomic bomb, but is that where—is that where we want the seals to go really fast? 
EDL	00:36:58,094	00:37:14,680	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	No. We want them to—look, they're busy figuring out how to better get around the beach, get along with each other, maybe build some kind of nice slide so they can zoom down and fly off and have some fun. 
EDL	00:37:14,680	00:37:19,283	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	There's a lot these bright seals can do. They have a big future ahead of them.
EDL	00:37:19,283	00:37:31,703	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So what I would substitute is something that would maybe help them that was very helpful to me, which is that—that you know more than you can say. 
EDL	00:37:31,703	00:37:38,984	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	It's a—it's a crisp way of saying that language is great. 
EDL	00:37:38,984	00:37:52,222	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And—and, you know, I'm in the language business, and I try to create sentences that are momentarily diverting and all that, but language is a tiny, tiny part of the knowledge that we actually have. 
EDL	00:37:52,222	00:37:59,739	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And not just because there's musical knowledge and the knowledge of colors and fragrances and other things that are inarticulable, 
EDL	00:37:59,739	00:38:12,318	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	but because the knack of knowing how to put words together, the knack of knowing how to say in a condensed form a truth is something that involves a feel, 
EDL	00:38:12,318	00:38:21,940	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	a nimbleness, a sort of—a set of dance moves that nobody, no matter how good you are at slinging sentences, 
EDL	00:38:21,940	00:38:33,737	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	nobody can articulate step by step backwards into this world the under-structure of what allowed him or her to say this thing that involved words. 
EDL	00:38:33,737	00:38:45,642	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So look at what is around you and see who knows how to do things, and then learn from that. 
EDL	00:38:45,642	00:38:51,870	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And the way the person describes how he does things may actually be completely inadequate. 
EDL	00:38:51,870	00:38:55,137	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	You're gonna have to watch. 

EDL	00:39:00,239	00:39:13,862	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	We know more than we can say. That, I think, is the most useful piece of scientific helpfulness, I guess, that you could give.

EDL	00:39:39,152	00:39:44,901	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAMES GLEICK: The moon revolves around the Earth, which is not the center of the universe, far from it. 
EDL	00:39:44,901	00:40:00,538	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	But just one of many objects, large and small, that revolve around the sun which in turn, is one of countless stars mostly so far away that they're invisible, even on the clearest night. 
EDL	00:40:00,538	00:40:11,215	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	All traveling through space on paths obeying simple laws of nature that can be expressed in terms of mathematics. 
EDL	00:40:11,215	00:40:14,266	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Oh and by the way, there is no God.
EDL	00:40:14,266	00:40:16,314	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LADY PINK: [laughter]
EDL	00:40:16,314	00:40:19,892	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Writer James Gleick. And up next is the artist, Lady Pink.
EDL	00:40:19,892	00:40:26,693	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LADY PINK: Okay. So, I would like to say God is a female. 
EDL	00:40:26,693	00:40:43,760	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I would also love to leave behind a mural, something like one of Michelangelo's awesome depictions of God coming in, and a, you know, grandiose and glorious and absolutely gigantic mural, but as a female. 
EDL	00:40:43,760	00:40:49,137	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I think I would like to do her as one of the gray aliens. Do you know what I mean? 
EDL	00:40:49,137	00:40:55,990	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	One of the—the big-eyed aliens with those big, big heads and those big bug eyes like that, with real sexy lips and a little bit of eye lashes? 
EDL	00:40:55,990	00:41:06,581	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	With kind of looking like the Virgin Mary or the Virgin de Guadalupe, wearing the long gown and the blue veil thing and, you know, holding her hand up 
EDL	00:41:06,581	00:41:14,623	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	and a—and a little bleeding heart with worshipers at her feet, and—because she would be so gigantic, three, four stories. 
EDL	00:41:14,623	00:41:20,155	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	That's like at least like 40 feet, 30 feet. You know, very large figure. She would be looking down at you.
EDL	00:41:42,942	00:41:49,610	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Billy Graham: You never understand hell though, until first you understand the great love, mercy, and grace of ...]

EDL	00:42:03,472	00:42:11,978	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JENNY HOLLOWELL: I would say that a lot of my childhood, I was thinking a lot about surviving the apocalypse. You know, how could I do that? How could I be good enough?
EDL	00:42:11,978	00:42:13,729	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Writer Jenny Hollowell.
EDL	00:42:13,729	00:42:24,631	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JENNY HOLLOWELL: I liked the texture of life. I liked the idea of being in the back of the station wagon and driving down the street and seeing my neighbors mowing their lawns or riding their bicycles. 
EDL	00:42:24,631	00:42:38,769	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And the idea that they would all disappear or be—not be survivors of whatever that apocalyptic event might be was just jolting. 
EDL	00:42:38,769	00:42:53,699	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ Song: We'll meet again ]
EDL	00:42:53,699	00:43:03,502	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	I was also selfishly along the way hoping that I could maybe get past certain thresholds so that I could experience them before they were gone, like being able to drive. 
EDL	00:43:03,502	00:43:16,388	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Because I really wasn't sure whether cars were gonna be around later, so—I remember really hoping that I could make it to middle school so that I could have a locker because I thought lockers were really cool. 
EDL	00:43:16,388	00:43:33,231	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	I just thought, like, "Okay, if I can have a locker and then later drive, then those two things—like, if we can just get past those things then I'll be a little more relieved to see the end come. Maybe." 
EDL	00:43:33,231	00:43:45,167	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ Song: We'll meet again ]
EDL	00:43:45,167	00:43:59,938	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Everything is connected. To me, that feels like a sentence that contains an element of scientific truth but also inspires us to believe in it. 
EDL	00:43:59,938	00:44:08,135	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Because I do think that whatever we leave behind needs to contain something about it that would inspire the finder of it to believe in it.
EDL	00:45:25,297	00:45:28,273	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay, up next.
EDL	00:45:28,273	00:45:29,106	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Hello.

EDL	00:45:30,582	00:45:30,876	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Yeah.
EDL	00:45:30,876	00:45:31,334	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: Hey!
EDL	00:45:31,334	00:45:32,018	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Can you hear me?
EDL	00:45:32,018	00:45:33,021	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: Yes, I can.
EDL	00:45:33,021	00:45:37,697	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: We bring back Rachael Cusick. So you and producer Jeremy Bloom talked to someone.
EDL	00:45:37,697	00:45:37,982	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mm-hmm.
EDL	00:45:37,982	00:45:38,781	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Hi, Rachael.
EDL	00:45:38,781	00:45:41,021	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: We talked to this guy Jaron Lanier.
EDL	00:45:41,021	00:45:43,699	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Do you want to know anything about me, or is the name enough?
EDL	00:45:43,699	00:45:46,308	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: I would love to know about you. Give us—give us a fun fact.
EDL	00:45:46,308	00:45:47,774	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So Jaron ...
EDL	00:45:47,774	00:45:49,971	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: I'm a computer scientist.
EDL	00:45:49,971	00:45:56,046	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: He is basically, like, the godfather of virtual reality, and was pretty instrumental in getting the internet off the ground.
EDL	00:45:56,046	00:45:56,448	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh!
EDL	00:45:56,448	00:46:04,109	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: I also write books and I also play music, and most notably on a large variety of very unusual musical instruments.
EDL	00:46:04,109	00:46:06,114	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: Do you have any instruments near you right now?
EDL	00:46:06,114	00:46:07,050	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Oh, a couple thousand.
EDL	00:46:07,050	00:46:11,874	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs] JEREMY: [laughs] JARON LANIER: [laughs]
EDL	00:46:11,874	00:46:19,526	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So this—this whole project is, like, reach out to people you find inspiring and asking them if they have any inspiring things to say.
EDL	00:46:19,526	00:46:19,887	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Right.
EDL	00:46:19,887	00:46:30,885	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And the reason we reached out to Jaron is because he helped create these huge advances in technology. But the other reason we talked to him is because he actually knew Richard Feynman.
EDL	00:46:30,885	00:46:32,523	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Really? How did he know him?
EDL	00:46:32,523	00:46:33,559	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Well, so ...
EDL	00:46:33,559	00:46:35,163	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: How honest do you want this to be?
EDL	00:46:35,163	00:46:37,526	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I want it to be as honest as you want it to be.
EDL	00:46:37,526	00:46:38,529	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Well ...
EDL	00:46:38,529	00:46:40,982	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: He said this was back in the late '70s.
EDL	00:46:40,982	00:46:42,967	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: ... I was 16 or 17.
EDL	00:46:42,967	00:46:44,161	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Living in New Mexico.
EDL	00:46:44,161	00:46:50,276	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: And what happened is my first serious girlfriend was someone I met over a summer.
EDL	00:46:50,276	00:46:51,735	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: She was visiting from California.
EDL	00:46:51,735	00:47:01,143	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: And I followed her back to California where it turns out her dad was the head of the physics department at Cal Tech. And after a while she dumped me and there I was.
EDL	00:47:01,143	00:47:02,679	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Oh no!
EDL	00:47:02,679	00:47:08,051	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: What was I to do? I'm still there. And so I just hung out more and more with people in the physics department.
EDL	00:47:08,051	00:47:10,920	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Do you remember where you were when you first saw Richard Feynman?
EDL	00:47:10,920	00:47:30,536	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Sure. I was being walked down a hallway by my friend Cynthia, and he was in there explaining something to a small class of people with his hands, primarily. 
EDL	00:47:30,536	00:47:35,891	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	He talked with his hands a lot. And—and she said, "There's the famous Feynman." 
EDL	00:47:35,891	00:47:42,184	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And of course, my very first thought is, "Oh, damn. He's like the smartest person alive. 
EDL	00:47:42,184	00:47:47,339	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And he's also handsome and he's happy and he's graceful. Like, fuck him." Oh, I can't say that on the radio. I'm sorry.
EDL	00:47:47,339	00:47:48,021	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: You can say it.
EDL	00:47:48,021	00:47:53,254	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Like, I was like, "Oh my God, this guy's just—like, it's not fair. This guy just has too much going for him."
EDL	00:47:53,254	00:47:55,078	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: But Jaron says as he got to know him ...
EDL	00:47:55,078	00:47:57,147	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: He was just fun and funny.
EDL	00:47:57,147	00:48:00,016	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... the two of them would talk about physics and just about life.
EDL	00:48:00,016	00:48:02,442	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: He played percussion. He played drums.
EDL	00:48:02,442	00:48:03,622	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: They'd play music together.
EDL	00:48:03,622	00:48:08,749	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Which was great. His—his primary approach to life was to seek joy.
EDL	00:48:08,749	00:48:13,915	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: Do you remember him asking you about cataclysms ever?
EDL	00:48:13,915	00:48:25,616	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: I—I definitely remember that topic and that conversation, because remember in those days we were in the thick of the Cold War.
EDL	00:48:25,616	00:48:30,170	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: Duck and cover.]
EDL	00:48:30,170	00:48:40,326	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: And in school, you were trained to hide under your desk in case there would be a nuclear, you know, attack, and—which of course, everyone knew would be a futile gesture. 
EDL	00:48:40,326	00:48:50,203	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And so this question, it was like a little glimmer of hope, like, in the face of absolute annihilation, where hiding under your desk will not help, 
EDL	00:48:50,203	00:49:00,966	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	where hiding in some basement will not help, where you won't survive, this is at least—it's applying imagination towards what you possibly could do. 
EDL	00:49:00,966	00:49:02,790	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Maybe you could leave a message for the future.
EDL	00:49:02,790	00:49:13,659	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: We talked for a while about how much Jaron really loved this question because, like, he and Feynman and these other physicists, they'd hang out and kind of talk about this question for hours. 
EDL	00:49:13,659	00:49:17,393	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And they would debate about what was the best thing to write down on this piece of paper. 
EDL	00:49:17,393	00:49:22,408	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Partially because it was fun, but also because it felt important to have an answer. 
EDL	00:49:22,408	00:49:27,056	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	But then when we asked him what would he now would write down as his cataclysm sentence ...
EDL	00:49:27,056	00:49:30,428	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: You personally, Jaron, what would you do?
EDL	00:49:30,428	00:49:32,757	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Wow.
EDL	00:49:32,757	00:49:34,769	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... he took a deep breath. And then said ...
EDL	00:49:34,769	00:49:35,995	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: I would give them nothing.
EDL	00:49:37,610	00:49:39,551	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Huh. Like nothing, nothing?
EDL	00:49:39,551	00:49:40,138	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Zilch.
EDL	00:49:42,190	00:49:48,120	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Does he mean, like, the paper fluttering in the breeze that lands in the hand of the next person, it would have nothing written on it?
EDL	00:49:48,120	00:49:50,836	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: He means, like, there's just no piece of paper at all.
EDL	00:49:50,836	00:49:51,689	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Yeah.
EDL	00:49:51,689	00:49:56,340	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: That seems kind of sad to me. Like, why wouldn't you want to leave them something?
EDL	00:49:56,340	00:49:56,916	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Well ...
EDL	00:49:56,916	00:49:57,652	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: What is that?
EDL	00:49:57,652	00:49:58,324	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Let's see.
EDL	00:49:58,324	00:50:01,567	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Jaron's like, let's just say you do leave behind a sentence about ...
EDL	00:50:01,567	00:50:03,551	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: The basics of math and physics.
EDL	00:50:03,551	00:50:04,126	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Or ...
EDL	00:50:04,126	00:50:05,535	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Agriculture and medicine.
EDL	00:50:05,535	00:50:08,089	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Or some sentence about biology or public health.
EDL	00:50:08,089	00:50:16,532	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: That sort of thing. It's redundant. Like, all of that kind of information is just the stuff that's out there waiting to be discovered in nature anyway, so we don't have to do anything. 
EDL	00:50:16,532	00:50:22,082	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	If people apply themselves they'll rediscover all that stuff. So it's not like we're special. 
EDL	00:50:22,082	00:50:30,175	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Letting them get it in their own good time might be better for them, so what have we actually added? Perhaps we've only taken away.
EDL	00:50:30,175	00:50:41,278	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Taken away because giving some highly-evolved science fact kind of scared him because Jaron thinks, like, you never really know how those are gonna unfurl in another world. 
EDL	00:50:41,278	00:50:48,244	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	I mean, look at Feynman's sentence. It gave us all of these cool things that we talked about up at the beginning, but it also gave us ...
EDL	00:50:48,244	00:50:57,783	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ARCHIVE CLIP: The atomic bomb. Don't wait. Duck away from the windows fast. The glass may break and fly through the air and cut you.]
EDL	00:50:57,783	00:51:05,891	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: I mean, Feynman and others in his generation who'd come of age working in the Manhattan Project 
EDL	00:51:05,891	00:51:17,657	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	were put in an absolutely impossible moral puzzle where bringing the war to an end decisively was a great good, 
EDL	00:51:17,657	00:51:21,084	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	and the other side in the war had been the darkest evil. 
EDL	00:51:21,084	00:51:31,499	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	All of that was clear and yet in the big picture, it was just impossible to know if they'd done the right thing. And that cloud of doubt still hangs over science today.
EDL	00:51:31,499	00:51:33,631	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: For example, Jaron says ...
EDL	00:51:33,631	00:51:37,015	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Like, I was very involved in the birth of the internet.
EDL	00:51:37,015	00:51:45,506	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... look at the internet. That started as this amazing gift to people so that we could connect in this way that we never had before, but as we now know ...
EDL	00:51:45,506	00:51:49,869	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: It spreads disinformation. There's every economic incentive to be terrible. 
EDL	00:51:49,869	00:51:54,965	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And the incentives to be decent are far, far weaker. 
EDL	00:51:54,965	00:52:04,119	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I still have these incredible feelings of guilt and uncertainty about whether we just screwed things up terribly in a way that might take centuries or millennia to fix or something. 
EDL	00:52:04,119	00:52:09,986	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, there's just this haunting—this feeling of like, oh my God, what have we done, was it the right thing?
EDL	00:52:09,986	00:52:17,954	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So we suggested, like, what if it wasn't a piece of science but, like, a piece of wisdom? Something you would kind of like find inside of a fortune cookie?
EDL	00:52:17,954	00:52:21,750	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Well, that becomes a very interesting exercise. 
EDL	00:52:21,750	00:52:35,272	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And what you realize is whatever little words of wisdom you can pass along, because the whole terms of the game is that they'll be isolated, they'll take on this outsized preciousness. 
EDL	00:52:35,272	00:52:44,283	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	They won't be surrounded by context. And almost anything you can say will become distorted and somewhat useless if it's overemphasized in that way. 
EDL	00:52:44,283	00:52:50,192	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Which is to say nothing we could do is helpful. Let's just lay back. Let's be modest. Let's ...
EDL	00:52:50,192	00:52:58,001	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: What if you were on the other side of that? Like, what if you were on the other side of the cataclysm, and you discover that you're not gonna get anything at all?
EDL	00:52:58,001	00:53:02,515	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Well, I mean if—if there's nothing given, how would I even know that there was nothing given? 
EDL	00:53:02,515	00:53:05,414	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	I don't think I'd even be aware that there was something to have feelings about.
EDL	00:53:05,414	00:53:06,709	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: That's fair.
EDL	00:53:06,709	00:53:12,932	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I don't know. I feel like sometimes when you, like, walk into, like, an empty field or something, like, you're looking for something if you're kind of feeling lost.
EDL	00:53:12,932	00:53:23,942	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Okay, so there's people in the future and they find our ruins, and then there's some big plaque that says, "We have decided to leave you no information. You will learn nothing of us."
EDL	00:53:23,942	00:53:25,083	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs]
EDL	00:53:25,083	00:53:32,795	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: If—these next people might turn out to be wiser than us. Or if they don't and they extinguish themselves, then the next generation after that. 
EDL	00:53:32,795	00:53:46,390	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	At some point if some kind of cycle of cataclysm and civilization continues, at some point there'll be some civilization that's wiser than us and won't annihilate itself, and let's just not screw with these people. 
EDL	00:53:46,390	00:53:50,086	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Let's just give them a chance to come about naturally and they will eventually.
EDL	00:53:50,086	00:53:56,486	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: But that's an optimistic viewpoint too. Like, if we seem to keep, like, exploding ourselves, how do you have faith that we'll get there ever?
EDL	00:53:56,486	00:54:00,560	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Just because of the reality of randomness.
EDL	00:54:00,560	00:54:02,811	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs] What does that mean?
EDL	00:54:02,811	00:54:04,653	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: [laughs]
EDL	00:54:04,653	00:54:06,333	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I love that phrase, but I have no idea what it means.
EDL	00:54:06,333	00:54:09,362	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: It's a little bit—it's like a version of evolution. 
EDL	00:54:09,362	00:54:18,434	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, let's just assume that there's not just gonna be one cataclysm and another cycle, but we'll keep on going through these things until just through the grace of randomness, 
EDL	00:54:18,434	00:54:23,670	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	we get some civilization that comes up that's got its act together enough to not have another cataclysm. 
EDL	00:54:23,670	00:54:32,165	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I think there's something to be said for that. It's like some kind of faith in the far future that we'll finally get it together.
EDL	00:54:33,335	00:54:39,751	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So that was basically his answer. Like, say nothing. Have faith. Trust the math. But ...
EDL	00:54:39,751	00:54:43,092	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: If you today had to go back to you as a kid ...
EDL	00:54:43,092	00:54:44,060	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... we kept pushing him.
EDL	00:54:44,060	00:54:44,444	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Uh-huh.
EDL	00:54:44,444	00:54:47,762	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... would you have a specific sentence that you would share with a younger you?
EDL	00:54:47,762	00:54:50,129	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Oh gosh.
EDL	00:54:50,129	00:54:51,212	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And each time ...
EDL	00:54:51,212	00:54:56,160	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: Is there a sentence that you would say to start us in a more optimistic light?
EDL	00:54:56,160	00:54:57,697	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: ... he pretty much didn't budge.
EDL	00:54:57,697	00:54:59,681	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: [laughs] No, I just ...
EDL	00:54:59,681	00:55:03,925	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Except when Jeremy asked him this one question.
EDL	00:55:03,925	00:55:08,126	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: If you could leave music for the next society, would you?
EDL	00:55:08,126	00:55:19,084	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: Wow. That is a really interesting question. So, you know, one of the things about music is that it's an incredibly important part of our lives. 
EDL	00:55:19,084	00:55:22,893	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	It's part of every time we have a wedding or a funeral. 
EDL	00:55:22,893	00:55:35,562	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	It's incredibly important to us, and yet until very recently with the appearance of recording technologies, it was lost generation to generation. I play all these weird instruments ...
EDL	00:55:35,562	00:55:36,877	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: He demonstrated for us.
EDL	00:55:36,877	00:55:41,943	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: There's a kind of flute played by the Sami people of Finland.
EDL	00:55:45,057	00:55:55,117	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: And part of it is this feeling of being able to at least move and breathe like people did in the past.
EDL	00:55:55,117	00:55:57,926	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: This is an instrument from Laos.
EDL	00:55:57,926	00:56:02,193	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: So you get a little bit of connection with them. But of course, you don't really know.
EDL	00:56:09,058	00:56:11,440	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: This is a contrabass flute.
EDL	00:56:11,440	00:56:21,915	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: If you could leave an instrument for the next society that maybe could say something about our society, would you?
EDL	00:56:21,915	00:56:25,139	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: That was called a tarhu.
EDL	00:56:25,139	00:56:27,655	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: I don't know. That's a very hard question.
EDL	00:56:27,655	00:56:30,247	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: This is a kind of Turkish clarinet.
EDL	00:56:34,052	00:56:36,491	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: I'd have to think about that one a lot. I think I'd ...
EDL	00:56:36,491	00:56:44,222	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: The oud, a Middle Eastern instrument.
EDL	00:56:44,222	00:56:45,919	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: ... possibly choose the piano, I hate to say.
EDL	00:56:48,598	00:56:49,862	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Why the piano?
EDL	00:56:49,862	00:56:56,957	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JARON LANIER: The reason the piano fascinates me is it's kind of a digital button box like a computer, but it transcends being a button box. 
EDL	00:56:56,957	00:57:06,289	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Because on a piano you hit the key and then you send this hammer flying, and the only thing you can tell the hammer is how fast to fly. 
EDL	00:57:06,289	00:57:09,296	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So you would think it shouldn't be very expressive, and yet 
EDL	00:57:17,749	00:57:20,618	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	different pianists sit down and have touches on it that are distinguished. 
EDL	00:57:20,618	00:57:24,005	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ Piano playing ]
EDL	00:57:24,005	00:57:26,360	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	I believe there's a bit of a mystery left there.
EDL	00:57:26,360	00:57:39,551	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[ Piano playing ]
EDL	00:57:39,551	00:57:48,340	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay, to round things out, it just so happened that somebody that I had really wanted to talk to for this episode ...
EDL	00:57:48,340	00:57:51,036	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Hi! Long time no see!
EDL	00:57:51,036	00:57:51,666	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I know!
EDL	00:57:51,666	00:57:52,272	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: How are you?
EDL	00:57:52,272	00:57:54,747	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: ... is a composer who plays the piano.
EDL	00:57:54,747	00:57:55,975	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: You're, like, everywhere this month.
EDL	00:57:55,975	00:58:04,987	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Her name is Missy Mazzouli. She is very busy at the moment. She has two operas opening pretty much at the same time.
EDL	00:58:04,987	00:58:12,753	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Her work's been performed by orchestras all over the world. And we asked her to come down to our station at WNYC, where we have a piano.
EDL	00:58:12,753	00:58:14,001	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Do you want water or anything?
EDL	00:58:14,001	00:58:15,803	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Yeah, you—he was gonna get me water.
EDL	00:58:15,803	00:58:16,507	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay, great.
EDL	00:58:16,507	00:58:17,478	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Also, a Rachael.
EDL	00:58:17,478	00:58:18,677	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	00:58:18,677	00:58:30,928	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Because, you know, going back to the whole conceit of this thing, one of the questions that I had at the very start of this was, if we gave this Feynman cataclysm sentence challenge to a musician, what would happen?
EDL	00:58:30,928	00:58:35,089	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: We can start talking just in a—in a—in a—yeah, let's—we can just start.
EDL	00:58:35,089	00:58:35,760	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Ooh!
EDL	00:58:35,760	00:58:41,147	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So—so you—you came up with a musical answer to this question.
EDL	00:58:41,147	00:58:43,206	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Yeah. I call it the primordial chord.
EDL	00:58:43,206	00:58:44,684	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh, cool!
EDL	00:58:44,684	00:58:45,456	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Is my name for it.
EDL	00:58:45,456	00:58:46,128	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh, that's cool!
EDL	00:58:46,128	00:58:58,598	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: So going along with this idea of setting, you know, Humans 2.0 or the next version of creatures up for a better existence, I wanted to create something that would point them in that direction. 
EDL	00:58:58,598	00:59:06,928	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So I wanted—there's a couple things about this chord that I hope will do that. So this is a chord that has to be played by three people. 
EDL	00:59:06,928	00:59:16,151	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	You cannot play this chord by yourself unless you have six arms, which maybe these creatures will have. But, you know, you need three people to play it.
EDL	00:59:16,151	00:59:17,403	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And why did you pick three people?
EDL	00:59:17,403	00:59:22,773	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: That's a good question. I think that's what I felt could fit at a piano.
EDL	00:59:22,773	00:59:23,349	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Mmm.
EDL	00:59:23,349	00:59:32,544	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: And so—and I—and I chose the piano because it's generally the biggest instrument that we have general access to in New York City right now. 
EDL	00:59:32,544	00:59:38,427	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And I wanted it to—and it has the biggest range of musical instruments that we use every day. 
EDL	00:59:38,427	00:59:44,776	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	There's certain—there is music that is maybe higher and lower, but in general, like, most music you hear in the world fits into the range of a piano. 
EDL	00:59:44,776	00:59:57,894	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So this chord encompasses the whole range of the piano. We use the lowest note, we use the highest note, and it also has all 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale in it.
EDL	00:59:57,894	00:59:59,301	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh, interesting.
EDL	00:59:59,301	01:00:01,650	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: And there—also ...
EDL	01:00:01,650	01:00:02,982	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: That's gonna sound like chaos!
EDL	01:00:02,982	01:00:04,165	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: It's not, though!
EDL	01:00:04,165	01:00:05,285	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs]
EDL	01:00:05,285	01:00:15,155	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: This is—it's ordered. It's—I've ordered it so that—so that it hopefully does not sound like chaos. Anything could happen. I don't know.
EDL	01:00:15,155	01:00:16,348	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I so want to hear it now.
EDL	01:00:16,348	01:00:16,753	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: I know!
EDL	01:00:16,753	01:00:17,340	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So do I!
EDL	01:00:17,340	01:00:18,481	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Should we do it?
EDL	01:00:18,481	01:00:18,940	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Can we play it?
EDL	01:00:18,940	01:00:20,518	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Is it—let's go do it.
EDL	01:00:20,518	01:00:25,190	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So we had to get up and go over to the studio where the piano is.
EDL	01:00:25,190	01:00:34,621	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay, so we are here in CR-5 or as—as—as we like to think of it, John Schaefer's studio. There's the big grand piano to our left. We're gonna follow your lead here, Missy.
EDL	01:00:34,621	01:00:35,026	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Okay.
EDL	01:00:35,026	01:00:35,474	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	01:00:35,474	01:00:38,958	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So Missy pulled out the sheet music.
EDL	01:00:38,958	01:00:41,106	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: This is the primordial chord. [laughs]
EDL	01:00:41,106	01:00:42,013	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Oh my God. Okay.
EDL	01:00:42,013	01:00:52,488	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So if you imagine a page of orchestral score, we've all probably seen one at some point. You've got the lines running horizontally across the page. The page was mostly blank except for ...
EDL	01:00:52,488	01:00:54,018	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: One, two, three four ... MISSY MAZZOLI: And it looks insane.
EDL	01:00:54,018	01:00:56,851	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: ... five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen notes.
EDL	01:00:56,851	01:00:57,629	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Yes.
EDL	01:00:57,629	01:01:04,455	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: You got 13 little circles all stacked up in a vertical line looking kind of like a rocket about to take off.
EDL	01:01:04,455	01:01:09,438	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: And you have three clefs. So it's—each one is one—one human.
EDL	01:01:09,438	01:01:14,590	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Yes. So each—each grand staff is one human being playing one piano.
EDL	01:01:14,590	01:01:15,294	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Ooh!
EDL	01:01:15,294	01:01:17,512	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay. How long did it take you to come up with this?
EDL	01:01:17,512	01:01:21,148	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: It took me a shockingly long time. [laughs]
EDL	01:01:21,148	01:01:22,000	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: [laughs]
EDL	01:01:22,000	01:01:28,637	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Because I kept fiddling around with it, playing with the resonance. You know, sometimes I would come up with something and feel—I felt that it was too dissonant.
EDL	01:01:28,637	01:01:29,213	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Hmm.
EDL	01:01:29,213	01:01:33,320	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: It's also a challenge to come up with a chord that includes all 12 of these notes, you know? 
EDL	01:01:33,320	01:01:43,763	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	So, like [plays notes on piano]—so all 12 of those spread out over this huge range that still has a sort of, you know, consonant feeling to it.
EDL	01:01:43,763	01:01:57,144	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: It's interesting. When you look at the chord, this giant chord which contains all the notes in a scale, she's arranged it so that you can see in the chord all of these kind of musical molecules. 
EDL	01:01:57,144	01:02:04,008	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like oh, those three notes in hand number four, that's a major triad. 
EDL	01:02:04,008	01:02:09,898	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And these two notes in the bass, that's a tritone interval. 
EDL	01:02:09,898	01:02:14,015	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And then, okay, ooh look at that! In the upper register that is a diminished chord. 
EDL	01:02:14,015	01:02:16,225	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And if these words don't mean anything to you it's fine. 
EDL	01:02:16,225	01:02:24,229	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	The point is is if you zoom into this chord, you see all of these harmonic universes ready to spill out. 
EDL	01:02:24,229	01:02:26,864	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	That's why she calls it the primordial chord.
EDL	01:02:26,864	01:02:27,748	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Should we do it?
EDL	01:02:27,748	01:02:28,344	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Let's do it.
EDL	01:02:28,344	01:02:30,594	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah.
EDL	01:02:30,594	01:02:31,782	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: We can sit down, maybe.
EDL	01:02:31,782	01:02:32,259	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay.
EDL	01:02:32,259	01:02:32,872	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	01:02:32,872	01:02:33,719	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Is that okay?
EDL	01:02:33,719	01:02:37,107	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yeah. Well, you sit and then—and then maybe Rachael and I will get, like, half a cheek.
EDL	01:02:37,107	01:02:40,620	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: A half buttock, yeah. Together we'll be a whole butt. [laughs]
EDL	01:02:40,620	01:02:48,528	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: So Missy sat in the center of the piano bench, I was sort of hanging off the left side, half a cheek. Rachael was hanging off the right side, half a cheek.
EDL	01:02:48,528	01:02:48,869	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Okay.
EDL	01:02:48,869	01:02:49,114	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Cool.
EDL	01:02:49,114	01:02:52,555	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Perfect. So far so good. Okay, so Jad ...
EDL	01:02:52,555	01:02:52,939	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Yes.
EDL	01:02:52,939	01:02:58,000	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: ... I'm gonna set you up. So I'm gonna just play it for you. These are your four notes.
EDL	01:02:58,000	01:02:59,206	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Love it. Okay.
EDL	01:02:59,206	01:03:07,800	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Okay? Perfect. Perfect. And then these are your—you have five notes.
EDL	01:03:07,800	01:03:11,533	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: One, two, three, four, five.
EDL	01:03:11,533	01:03:12,734	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay. I'm gonna have to, like ...
EDL	01:03:12,734	01:03:15,098	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: He—is he rolling over there? Okay.
EDL	01:03:15,098	01:03:18,341	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JEREMY: It sounds pretty good here.
EDL	01:03:26,070	01:03:27,835	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay. Yeah.
EDL	01:03:27,835	01:03:30,358	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: So we'll just build it low to high.
EDL	01:03:30,358	01:03:33,482	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay. Should we build it sequentially or do we want to try, like, a ...
EDL	01:03:33,482	01:03:35,650	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Oh, let's try all together first.
EDL	01:03:35,650	01:03:35,917	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay.
EDL	01:03:35,917	01:03:37,555	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Try all together first, and then we'll build low to high.
EDL	01:03:37,555	01:03:39,859	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: So let's see if we can ...
EDL	01:03:39,859	01:03:40,478	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	01:03:40,478	01:03:44,840	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So there's, like, an upbeat and then there's one, two, three, four ...
EDL	01:03:44,840	01:03:45,416	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: Hit.
EDL	01:03:45,416	01:03:46,067	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Okay?
EDL	01:03:46,067	01:03:53,224	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: [whispering] One, two, three, four.
EDL	01:03:53,224	01:04:38,755	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[piano ringing]
EDL	01:04:38,755	01:04:40,353	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: [whispering] Isn't that—I don't know. It just keeps going.
EDL	01:04:40,353	01:04:41,160	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [whispering] Yeah.
EDL	01:04:41,160	01:04:42,138	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: It never stops. RACHAEL: Maybe forever. [laughs]
EDL	01:04:42,138	01:04:45,790	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: [laughs]
EDL	01:04:44,626	01:04:45,528	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: What if we have to go to the bathroom? [laughs]
EDL	01:04:45,528	01:04:51,160	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: God, this is it. This is—welcome to the rest of your life. Just stuck here holding this chord on the piano.
EDL	01:04:51,160	01:04:54,803	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: [laughs] I'm afraid to let go now.
EDL	01:04:54,803	01:04:57,763	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: This is a big responsibility. The weight of the world is on that pinkie.
EDL	01:04:57,763	01:05:01,293	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: All righty, and ... [sigh]
EDL	01:05:01,293	01:05:01,922	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[applause]
EDL	01:05:01,922	01:05:03,133	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: That was awesome, guys!
EDL	01:05:03,133	01:05:04,306	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: So cool!
EDL	01:05:04,306	01:05:05,308	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: That was so good!
EDL	01:05:05,308	01:05:06,282	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Oh my God!
EDL	01:05:06,282	01:05:06,930	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: That was so great.
EDL	01:05:06,930	01:05:07,644	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: I'm so proud of you.
EDL	01:05:07,644	01:05:09,846	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: It feels like the end of a movie, that—that feeling.
EDL	01:05:09,846	01:05:15,094	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: It really does. I feel like I got the best part. I got the bass, it just like—everything I do sounds good down here.
EDL	01:05:15,094	01:05:16,663	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: See, I like mine up here. It's really nice.
EDL	01:05:16,663	01:05:20,396	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: See, I feel totally safe between the two of you just, like, hanging out in the middle.
EDL	01:05:20,396	01:05:24,130	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: I feel like I'm the foundation of this new society.
EDL	01:05:24,130	01:05:25,150	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah, but I give us hope. [laughs]
EDL	01:05:25,150	01:05:29,569	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	MISSY MAZZOLI: I'm the glue. See? We all need each other. That's the point.
EDL	01:05:29,569	01:05:31,532	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: It is. It's like a full human being.
EDL	01:05:31,532	01:05:40,172	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	JAD: What if we can play it as quiet as possible? [whispers] Because we're humble. Our next humans are humble. Ready? One, two, three.
EDL	01:05:40,172	01:06:53,940	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	[music]
EDL	01:06:53,940	01:06:58,445	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Okay. Lulu, Latif and Rachael.
EDL	01:06:58,445	01:07:08,287	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: In the future now. Okay, so did you ever, like, do the prompt? Like, what would you write on this scrap of paper to toss into the post-apocalyptic winds?
EDL	01:07:08,287	01:07:17,172	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: There's so many times in the show where I'm like, "Thank God I'm not you!" Like, I call up these people and I, like, ask these things of them, and I would never feel like I had all this information and, like, knowledge that they have. 
EDL	01:07:17,172	01:07:23,341	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And especially this one. Like, I worked on it for an entire year, and I would constantly ask, like, what my sentence would be.
EDL	01:07:23,341	01:07:23,768	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Hmm.
EDL	01:07:23,768	01:07:25,652	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And I would not have an answer for you, and ...
EDL	01:07:25,652	01:07:33,193	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Well, good thing it's three years later and you've thought about it and now you have an answer, so we can put that question to you right now for this exact moment.
EDL	01:07:33,193	01:07:42,113	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Ah! Okay, I actually—so I was thinking about this sentence that I had heard that Ram Dass said, which is like, we're all just walking each other home.
EDL	01:07:42,113	01:07:42,817	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Mmm.
EDL	01:07:42,817	01:07:43,873	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: That's beautiful!
EDL	01:07:43,873	01:07:51,285	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Like, we're all headed towards the same grim place and we're all headed towards different places in our lives, but all we have is, like, 
EDL	01:07:51,285	01:08:01,455	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	each other in those moments and keeping each other company and, like, making us discover new things, and yeah, like, making us bump into ourselves. 
EDL	01:08:01,455	01:08:11,381	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And, you know, just thinking about, like, walking on, like, a quiet little road home from school or something and, like, every single person in your life has gotten you a little bit closer to that door.
EDL	01:08:11,381	01:08:13,856	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: That's really beautiful.
EDL	01:08:13,856	01:08:16,224	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: I've gotta take my head up out of my hands.
EDL	01:08:16,224	01:08:17,888	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: [laughs]
EDL	01:08:17,888	01:08:19,957	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: I feel throttled by that. That's so beautiful.
EDL	01:08:19,957	01:08:28,554	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And I think it's the most beautiful thing when I think about this team and, like, everything that it means, and also just like who we are to each other. 
EDL	01:08:28,554	01:08:35,402	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, it is engraved in my soul as if there's a tattoo of this exact feeling in me, but that moment in the episode early on when, 
EDL	01:08:35,402	01:08:42,939	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	like, I'm just talking about this feeling that I had as a kid and this, like, sense of loss, and then from there you go to, 
EDL	01:08:42,939	01:08:51,366	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	like, the sound of the phones being dialed up and this, like, cluster of, like, "Hello?" "Hi!" "Is this who? Da da da." And that feeling of, 
EDL	01:08:51,366	01:09:00,987	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	like, everybody just pitching in, it almost felt like all of those people transported back to, like, childhood me and were, like, giving me this beautiful gift.
EDL	01:09:00,987	01:09:01,627	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Hmm.
EDL	01:09:01,627	01:09:04,272	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And that's so special. [laughs]
EDL	01:09:04,272	01:09:07,648	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Hmm.
EDL	01:09:07,648	01:09:08,816	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: [sniffles] Whew!
EDL	01:09:08,816	01:09:26,616	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: I just think, like, this show is this, like, huge gift in my life. I think it's, like, so special to have a place just like bring you closer to yourself.
EDL	01:09:26,616	01:09:37,168	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Did—did you hear anything in particular listening on this second time around differently? Was there anything that stood out to you?
EDL	01:09:37,168	01:09:49,719	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah. It's funny that you ask that because I listened back to it for the first time in years, and I think about it when I—like, before I had listened I was like, "Okay, this is pandemic story, this is a grief story, this is about destruction." 
EDL	01:09:49,719	01:09:58,761	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And then I listened to it with the kind of mindset of leaving and moving and being like, "Oh, I'm—I'm the person on the other end of the cataclysm." 
EDL	01:09:58,761	01:10:08,193	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	Like, walking in—like, I think I had been before making the story, I was feeling the need to gather all the sentences, and now I feel like the person who's receiving all of them.
EDL	01:10:08,193	01:10:08,833	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Hmm.
EDL	01:10:08,833	01:10:11,607	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Like, the person picking it up on the other end of the cataclysm.
EDL	01:10:11,607	01:10:13,219	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: Hmm. LULU: [laughs]
EDL	01:10:13,219	01:10:22,520	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And, like, I was able to listen to it last week with just like, "Oh! Oh, this is, like, what I get to start a new life with, these—these sentences."
EDL	01:10:22,520	01:10:23,286	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Oh!
EDL	01:10:23,286	01:10:35,000	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: And the ones that stood out to me now are—like, I love all of them still, but the ones that stood out to me now are way different than the ones that I listened to with grief and loss in mind rather than, like, starting anew.
EDL	01:10:35,000	01:10:35,890	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: Whoa!
EDL	01:10:35,890	01:10:46,713	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Yeah. And now I'm like, "Wow, I have this, like, wealth of beauty and wisdom in this little episode for me to, like, start with." I'm, like, starting at the Monopoly, like, square one. I just got $200, like here we go!
EDL	01:10:46,713	01:10:50,104	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: [laughs] All right, I guess we just say ...
EDL	01:10:50,104	01:10:52,067	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: All right, well, you say—you say goodbye, Rachael.
EDL	01:10:52,067	01:11:02,414	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	RACHAEL: Oh. Goodbye! But yeah, I'm an Irish goodbyer. Can you just, like, cut this episode right here? Just drop it off the face of the Earth? [laughs]
EDL	01:11:19,567	01:11:24,489	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LULU: PS, this won't be the last time you hear Rach—she's got a great story coming down the pike.
EDL	01:11:24,489	01:11:31,849	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	LATIF: And if we're lucky, even more after that. Production this episode by the entire Radiolab team, with update help from Sarah Qari.

EDL	01:13:19,483	01:13:25,413	| radiolab_the_cataclysm_sentence |	And it ends with a really special little emotional dollop. So go check that out. You're Wrong About.
