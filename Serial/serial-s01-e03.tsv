EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:07,840	| serial-s01-e03 |	Wendover it's finally turned me down after 6 weeks of back-and-forth
EDL	00:01:07,840	00:01:09,120	| serial-s01-e03 |	He said he didn't see the point
EDL	00:01:09,632	00:01:10,912	| serial-s01-e03 |	The case has been adjudicated
EDL	00:01:11,680	00:01:12,448	| serial-s01-e03 |	What good would it do
EDL	00:01:13,728	00:01:16,800	| serial-s01-e03 |	I also spoke on the phone

EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:43,424	| serial-s01-e03 |	Before his body was found this is a missing person case
EDL	00:01:43,936	00:01:45,984	| serial-s01-e03 |	She disappeared January 13th
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:52,384	| serial-s01-e03 |	Investigation starts out a little slowly which makes sense to me she's not a small child she's 18 she's got a car because I

EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:14,400	| serial-s01-e03 |	You can see from the reports that they immediately hone in on the most time-worn explanation for such disappearances

EDL	00:04:54,911	00:04:56,959	| serial-s01-e03 |	Linkin Park is nowhere near the school

EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,199	| serial-s01-e03 |	When he was locked up I like
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:11,295	| serial-s01-e03 |	Lincoln Park MI where is that do you know where it is have you ever been there
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:14,111	| serial-s01-e03 |	And he's like I have never been there I don't even know where it is
EDL	00:05:14,623	00:05:17,951	| serial-s01-e03 |	So I mean living around here we don't know but it's somewhere in the Inner City
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:25,375	| serial-s01-e03 |	Is in fact less than three miles from where you are sitting right now

EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:39,711	| serial-s01-e03 |	I'm explaining all this just to say that the simple fact that he was found
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,783	| serial-s01-e03 |	A lot of people that alone made it
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,343	| serial-s01-e03 |	What's a nice boy like you doing a park like this
EDL	00:05:49,951	00:05:51,487	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mister s
EDL	00:05:51,487	00:05:57,375	| serial-s01-e03 |	He also told the cops he's never been to that part of Linkin Park before he did seem to know that people go fishing back there
EDL	00:05:58,143	00:05:59,167	| serial-s01-e03 |	Here's what he told the cops
EDL	00:05:59,935	00:06:03,007	| serial-s01-e03 |	At his job he got in a work order to shave down a door
EDL	00:06:03,775	00:06:06,079	| serial-s01-e03 |	But the school didn't have the tool he needed
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:06,591	| serial-s01-e03 |	A plane
EDL	00:06:07,103	00:06:08,639	| serial-s01-e03 |	He had one at home though
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:14,271	| serial-s01-e03 |	So during his lunch hour he said he drove his truck home got the plane from his basement and before you left
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:16,319	| serial-s01-e03 |	Grab some sustenance out of the fridge
EDL	00:06:16,319	00:06:19,647	| serial-s01-e03 |	I'd rather be unrefrigerated
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:23,999	| serial-s01-e03 |	On my way back
EDL	00:06:28,351	00:06:30,655	| serial-s01-e03 |	Feather-N-Fin
EDL	00:06:30,655	00:06:31,423	| serial-s01-e03 |	Jenny
EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:39,871	| serial-s01-e03 |	She's drinking this 22 oz Budweiser and he's heading back to work
EDL	00:06:40,383	00:06:42,687	| serial-s01-e03 |	And his route to the college is through leakin Park
EDL	00:06:46,015	00:06:48,063	| serial-s01-e03 |	He stops on franklintown Road
EDL	00:06:48,063	00:06:49,087	| serial-s01-e03 |	About three miles from work
EDL	00:06:49,599	00:06:55,743	| serial-s01-e03 |	There's a small pull off and some concrete barriers and he walks back in there quite a ways seems like for a guy who just has to pee
EDL	00:06:56,767	00:06:57,535	| serial-s01-e03 |	Later they measure
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,095	| serial-s01-e03 |	127 feet back into the woods
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,607	| serial-s01-e03 |	Legos
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:02,911	| serial-s01-e03 |	The next tape is a little upsetting
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:04,959	| serial-s01-e03 |	And I got that good way
EDL	00:07:18,527	00:07:20,063	| serial-s01-e03 |	Which were your attention
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:20,831	| serial-s01-e03 |	2
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:22,111	| serial-s01-e03 |	The area that you
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,951	| serial-s01-e03 |	There was something there it was open
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:26,719	| serial-s01-e03 |	An open area
EDL	00:07:27,999	00:07:30,815	| serial-s01-e03 |	But there was also a fallen tree
EDL	00:07:33,375	00:07:35,167	| serial-s01-e03 |	Did you go to that area for certain reason
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:44,127	| serial-s01-e03 |	Suspicious of Mr s who by this time as become a Cessna
EDL	00:07:44,127	00:07:50,271	| serial-s01-e03 |	The tape was made on February 18th 9 days after Mr as reported finding the body
EDL	00:07:50,783	00:07:57,183	| serial-s01-e03 |	They're going over the details carefully because there are parts of a story that are a little weird
EDL	00:07:57,183	00:08:01,279	| serial-s01-e03 |	Something about the fallen tree 127 feedback Into the Woods
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:06,399	| serial-s01-e03 |	It was a Fallen Tree essentially a 40-foot log lime or less parallel to the road
EDL	00:08:06,911	00:08:13,055	| serial-s01-e03 |	The other side of the name of dead run
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:17,151	| serial-s01-e03 |	His body was buried right behind this log on the Streamside
EDL	00:08:17,663	00:08:20,479	| serial-s01-e03 |	You're standing on the street side of the logs on the other side
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,295	| serial-s01-e03 |	It's not at all obvious that you notice her
EDL	00:08:23,295	00:08:27,647	| serial-s01-e03 |	Tell me a story about why he stopped where he stopped it doesn't quite seem right
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:31,999	| serial-s01-e03 |	When you're walking back
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:32,767	| serial-s01-e03 |	2
EDL	00:08:32,767	00:08:34,815	| serial-s01-e03 |	This area where you finally stop
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,119	| serial-s01-e03 |	Why did you pick that particular area
EDL	00:08:43,007	00:08:44,031	| serial-s01-e03 |	That's when I sing
EDL	00:08:48,639	00:08:50,175	| serial-s01-e03 |	You said you were going to actually go back further
EDL	00:08:51,711	00:08:55,551	| serial-s01-e03 |	In this part of the tape you get a sense of how Ritz and McGillivray operate together
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:58,111	| serial-s01-e03 |	Or at least what I've gathered in listening to a bunch of these interviews
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:02,719	| serial-s01-e03 |	Montgomery starts out on judgmental just tell me your story
EDL	00:09:04,767	00:09:07,327	| serial-s01-e03 |	Ben wittes comes in and says something like
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:09,119	| serial-s01-e03 |	Tell me understand here
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:11,423	| serial-s01-e03 |	Some harder questions
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| serial-s01-e03 |	Exposing weaknesses in the narrative
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,263	| serial-s01-e03 |	Then I will come back in
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:21,919	| serial-s01-e03 |	He's asking direct sometimes harsh questions it seemed like they'd be good at pushing someone off balance
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:24,479	| serial-s01-e03 |	But this one sort out of the blue
EDL	00:09:24,479	00:09:25,759	| serial-s01-e03 |	Have you ever been inside
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:28,063	| serial-s01-e03 |	Batgirl's carport
EDL	00:09:30,623	00:09:32,415	| serial-s01-e03 |	To the fallen tree
EDL	00:09:32,415	00:09:36,255	| serial-s01-e03 |	Purity saying wait I thought you told me
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:37,279	| serial-s01-e03 |	Stopped at the log.
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:40,607	| serial-s01-e03 |	And now you're saying you're on your way further back
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:41,375	| serial-s01-e03 |	Stop Larry
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:43,423	| serial-s01-e03 |	Getting ready to urinate
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,983	| serial-s01-e03 |	And then that's when you walked in and discovered the hair
EDL	00:09:46,751	00:09:49,311	| serial-s01-e03 |	Now you're saying you're going to actually go back further
EDL	00:09:51,615	00:09:52,383	| serial-s01-e03 |	Before you discovered
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:10:01,087	| serial-s01-e03 |	Maybe I'm a little bit confused as you're standing on the south side of the tree in a tree in the room
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:02,111	| serial-s01-e03 |	Minnesota Let It Go
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:04,159	| serial-s01-e03 |	A bunch of things are fishy
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:08,255	| serial-s01-e03 |	The path he takes back into the woods it doesn't really lead to the log
EDL	00:10:08,767	00:10:09,791	| serial-s01-e03 |	What is the end up there
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:14,399	| serial-s01-e03 |	He didn't need to find a hidden spot to pay there are so many other choices
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:20,031	| serial-s01-e03 |	And if you're walking through brush and brambles when you should have naturally avoid a big login into step over
EDL	00:10:21,055	00:10:22,591	| serial-s01-e03 |	What they're trying to get at is
EDL	00:10:22,591	00:10:25,151	| serial-s01-e03 |	Did you really just stumble on this body
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:26,943	| serial-s01-e03 |	Were you looking for this body
EDL	00:10:26,943	00:10:28,479	| serial-s01-e03 |	Because you already knew where it was
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:31,039	| serial-s01-e03 |	What is a reasonable question
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:33,599	| serial-s01-e03 |	Because his body wasn't just hard to spot
EDL	00:10:33,599	00:10:35,135	| serial-s01-e03 |	Impossible to spot
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:41,791	| serial-s01-e03 |	Right where in the State's Attorney's office we just got delivered the first box of what they're saying is
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:43,583	| serial-s01-e03 |	Disclosable under
EDL	00:10:44,607	00:10:46,399	| serial-s01-e03 |	Whatever Public Information Act
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:47,423	| serial-s01-e03 |	Can I attend
EDL	00:10:47,935	00:10:52,543	| serial-s01-e03 |	I didn't understand how camouflage body was until I saw photos of the crime scene
EDL	00:10:52,543	00:10:53,823	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mr s founded
EDL	00:10:53,823	00:10:55,103	| serial-s01-e03 |	Before they remove the body
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:58,431	| serial-s01-e03 |	State's Attorney's Office in Baltimore
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:02,271	| serial-s01-e03 |	I went through the crime reporter from The Baltimore Sun name is Justin George
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:04,063	| serial-s01-e03 |	I've been talking to Justin about the
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,623	| serial-s01-e03 |	The story and he's interested maybe writing about it too
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:09,183	| serial-s01-e03 |	Open a packet of photos together
EDL	00:11:09,695	00:11:11,743	| serial-s01-e03 |	Phone number awful to see if you'd imagine
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:15,583	| serial-s01-e03 |	There was one where you can make out a bit of black hair and the dirt and leaves
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:19,935	| serial-s01-e03 |	How did he notice that I don't understand that either
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:24,543	| serial-s01-e03 |	I mean it's it's pretty well covered
EDL	00:11:25,311	00:11:26,591	| serial-s01-e03 |	Yeah you there's barely any
EDL	00:11:27,103	00:11:28,639	| serial-s01-e03 |	I need a showing
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:31,455	| serial-s01-e03 |	But are we supposed to be looking at something there
EDL	00:11:31,455	00:11:31,967	| serial-s01-e03 |	What is that
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:36,575	| serial-s01-e03 |	Is that her that's her that's all he saw
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:37,087	| serial-s01-e03 |	Yeah that's
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,391	| serial-s01-e03 |	Looks to be part of the body
EDL	00:11:40,927	00:11:42,463	| serial-s01-e03 |	Yeah I expected it
EDL	00:11:42,463	00:11:43,487	| serial-s01-e03 |	To be more visible
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:51,167	| serial-s01-e03 |	Justin and I were the only ones who had this reaction
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:57,311	| serial-s01-e03 |	The city surveyor went out to the burial site to measure the distance from the road
EDL	00:11:57,311	00:11:59,103	| serial-s01-e03 |	This is before they disinterred her
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:01,919	| serial-s01-e03 |	Testifying at trial
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:04,735	| serial-s01-e03 |	When I arrived at the site where the body was
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:05,759	| serial-s01-e03 |	There was a log
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:08,831	| serial-s01-e03 |	Wunderground approximate 40 feet long
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| serial-s01-e03 |	Oki
EDL	00:12:10,111	00:12:16,511	| serial-s01-e03 |	Stuck on the log I walked along the edge of the log expecting to find a body real soon I never saw
EDL	00:12:16,511	00:12:17,023	| serial-s01-e03 |	Call one
EDL	00:12:17,535	00:12:18,815	| serial-s01-e03 |	How much time
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,863	| serial-s01-e03 |	I like taking one more step
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:24,191	| serial-s01-e03 |	I would have walked on the grave site where the body was
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:27,007	| serial-s01-e03 |	And at that point or others on the scene
EDL	00:12:27,775	00:12:29,567	| serial-s01-e03 |	Yes ma'am it was a lot of people there
EDL	00:12:29,567	00:12:35,711	| serial-s01-e03 |	Inception point to somebody point out these exact location yes ma'am detective pointed to the site
EDL	00:12:36,479	00:12:37,759	| serial-s01-e03 |	I look at the ground
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:40,831	| serial-s01-e03 |	And I also
EDL	00:12:41,599	00:12:45,439	| serial-s01-e03 |	It looked it wasn't rushing Disturbed
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:49,023	| serial-s01-e03 |	Yeah just Blended in with their natural surroundings of the ground
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:57,215	| serial-s01-e03 |	Who's looking for the body
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:13:00,799	| serial-s01-e03 |	Knows where it's supposed to be who can see that they're a bunch of people standing around it
EDL	00:13:01,311	00:13:02,591	| serial-s01-e03 |	And still you can't find it
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,175	| serial-s01-e03 |	Does it seem reasonable that Mr s
EDL	00:13:06,175	00:13:12,319	| serial-s01-e03 |	Apparently wasn't looking for anything except a secluded place to pee would have discovered it just like that
EDL	00:13:18,975	00:13:20,255	| serial-s01-e03 |	This business of having to pee
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:24,351	| serial-s01-e03 |	The spot where mr.ass stops is only a few miles from his house
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:26,143	| serial-s01-e03 |	Only a few more miles from its work
EDL	00:13:26,655	00:13:27,423	| serial-s01-e03 |	Kitty can't wait
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,495	| serial-s01-e03 |	Here's detective questioning mistress again
EDL	00:13:30,495	00:13:33,823	| serial-s01-e03 |	While you were at home did you have to urinate or use bathroom at all
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:40,223	| serial-s01-e03 |	So within 7 or 8 minutes how much is a 22 in your head
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:47,135	| serial-s01-e03 |	That 7/8 minute.
EDL	00:13:47,135	00:13:48,927	| serial-s01-e03 |	You had to go to the bathroom
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:57,631	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mr. Says he never actually does pee in the woods
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:13:59,679	| serial-s01-e03 |	So the ends of waiting till I get to work
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:01,983	| serial-s01-e03 |	Which okay maybe that makes sense you've had a shock
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,823	| serial-s01-e03 |	Find me walk so far in in the first place
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,359	| serial-s01-e03 |	He's just trying to have a quick pee
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| serial-s01-e03 |	Why was he studying the ground
EDL	00:14:10,175	00:14:11,455	| serial-s01-e03 |	Ask him about this
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:14,015	| serial-s01-e03 |	You got out of your vehicle Venture back
EDL	00:14:15,039	00:14:16,575	| serial-s01-e03 |	Into the Woods
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:22,975	| serial-s01-e03 |	What we're after we measured it was actually 127 feet off the roadway
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,583	| serial-s01-e03 |	As you're walking along why are you looking down at the ground
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:30,911	| serial-s01-e03 |	Are you looking every step you take
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:35,007	| serial-s01-e03 |	10
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,543	| serial-s01-e03 |	11
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:41,151	| serial-s01-e03 |	12 in February this year we went out to Linkin Park
EDL	00:14:41,919	00:14:45,503	| serial-s01-e03 |	We wanted to know whether it was strange that you done so far back into the woods
EDL	00:14:45,503	00:14:48,319	| serial-s01-e03 |	127 feet from the road look like
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:52,927	| serial-s01-e03 |	Producer Dana was with me and so is Justin George Baltimore Sun
EDL	00:14:53,695	00:14:57,023	| serial-s01-e03 |	The place where Mr acid entered the woods right at the road
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:14:58,303	| serial-s01-e03 |	Just a notice to sign
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:59,071	| serial-s01-e03 |	What's that
EDL	00:15:00,095	00:15:01,119	| serial-s01-e03 |	Just look at it I mean
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:03,167	| serial-s01-e03 |	The sign says a lot
EDL	00:15:03,167	00:15:04,959	| serial-s01-e03 |	This area patrolled
EDL	00:15:04,959	00:15:06,495	| serial-s01-e03 |	Dumper's will be prosecuted
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:08,287	| serial-s01-e03 |	They can barely read it
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:11,871	| serial-s01-e03 |	Charger redesign that's covered in graffiti and pierced with seven bullet holes
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:18,015	| serial-s01-e03 |	In fact the cops found 20 cartridge casings and right about the spot when they collected evidence in 1999
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,831	| serial-s01-e03 |	I thought the park itself was quite lovely
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:22,623	| serial-s01-e03 |	Rainbows and trees
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:24,415	| serial-s01-e03 |	It's rocking as a stream
EDL	00:15:24,415	00:15:27,231	| serial-s01-e03 |	Is uneven Transat hilly but not flat either
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,791	| serial-s01-e03 |	Not nearly as creepy as I imagined it
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:31,839	| serial-s01-e03 |	I think it is a nice
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:35,423	| serial-s01-e03 |	At night I think a dust gets it I think it is
EDL	00:15:36,447	00:15:37,215	| serial-s01-e03 |	Very bleak
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:40,287	| serial-s01-e03 |	21
EDL	00:15:40,287	00:15:40,799	| serial-s01-e03 |	22
EDL	00:15:42,079	00:15:45,151	| serial-s01-e03 |	3 we walked in what we figured is about 127 ft
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:47,199	| serial-s01-e03 |	Just in case it out by the yard
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| serial-s01-e03 |	42
EDL	00:15:49,247	00:15:50,527	| serial-s01-e03 |	Be right about there
EDL	00:15:51,039	00:15:54,111	| serial-s01-e03 |	We actually wander around for a while trying to find the right spot
EDL	00:15:54,879	00:15:59,999	| serial-s01-e03 |	Finally I remember that we have a hand-drawn map of the site from that survey or better Meyer testified
EDL	00:15:59,999	00:16:01,023	| serial-s01-e03 |	40 ft long
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:03,071	| serial-s01-e03 |	15 inch log on the ground
EDL	00:16:03,839	00:16:05,631	| serial-s01-e03 |	Once you get to the right location
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:07,167	| serial-s01-e03 |	It depends on all of us
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:10,239	| serial-s01-e03 |	127 feedback doesn't feel all that far
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:11,263	| serial-s01-e03 |	If you're looking for privacy
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:14,079	| serial-s01-e03 |	You can still see the cars on the road from where we're standing
EDL	00:16:15,103	00:16:15,871	| serial-s01-e03 |	.
EDL	00:16:15,871	00:16:16,639	| serial-s01-e03 |	If he's peeing
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:17,919	| serial-s01-e03 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:20,479	| serial-s01-e03 |	At least you want to come this far
EDL	00:16:23,039	00:16:24,063	| serial-s01-e03 |	There's nothing
EDL	00:16:24,063	00:16:25,343	| serial-s01-e03 |	Yeah I mean there's something
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:27,391	| serial-s01-e03 |	Some Dead Leaves or whatever but yeah you can totally see the cars
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:30,463	| serial-s01-e03 |	So actually that doesn't seem that weird to me
EDL	00:16:30,975	00:16:34,047	| serial-s01-e03 |	Emily Mister as a story seems eminently more believable
EDL	00:16:35,071	00:16:39,935	| serial-s01-e03 |	What were the woods I feel Justin in on the evidence they collected here
EDL	00:16:40,447	00:16:41,727	| serial-s01-e03 |	Was a liquor bottle
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:47,103	| serial-s01-e03 |	From which they got cellular material and never tested
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,639	| serial-s01-e03 |	And a rope
EDL	00:16:49,151	00:16:50,431	| serial-s01-e03 |	That was never tested
EDL	00:16:50,943	00:16:51,711	| serial-s01-e03 |	As far as I know
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,223	| serial-s01-e03 |	Personnel
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:53,759	| serial-s01-e03 |	And then

EDL	00:23:07,264	00:23:09,824	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mr. s about it on tape
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:11,616	| serial-s01-e03 |	But I figure he knew they knew
EDL	00:23:14,688	00:23:17,504	| serial-s01-e03 |	The same day they interview Monday February 18th
EDL	00:23:17,504	00:23:19,040	| serial-s01-e03 |	I also give him a polygraph test
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:20,320	| serial-s01-e03 |	Which he fails
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:23,136	| serial-s01-e03 |	Deception indicated as a conclusion
EDL	00:23:23,904	00:23:26,976	| serial-s01-e03 |	But the tester also said Mr s seem to be nervous
EDL	00:23:26,976	00:23:31,328	| serial-s01-e03 |	Cuz apparently had an important meeting with a realtor that day his wife is expecting him to pick her up
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,704	| serial-s01-e03 |	But a week later another polygraph

EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,872	| serial-s01-e03 |	I guess that's a thing
EDL	00:23:45,152	00:23:47,968	| serial-s01-e03 |	This time there is no deception indicated

EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:04,864	| serial-s01-e03 |	I didn't really think so maybe he did it maybe he killed her
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:08,960	| serial-s01-e03 |	Wonder if maybe heard something about the crime
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,240	| serial-s01-e03 |	In about where she was buried
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:14,848	| serial-s01-e03 |	Because it did seem a tad unbelievable to me that he spotted her the way he said he did
EDL	00:24:15,872	00:24:20,992	| serial-s01-e03 |	One Theory his step kids or a neighbor had told him about the body
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,040	| serial-s01-e03 |	It heard about it through other kids

EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:27,136	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mister as just as a Good Samaritan thought
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,184	| serial-s01-e03 |	Someone needs to go find this girl and tell the cops
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:34,048	| serial-s01-e03 |	I just want to say he's heard about it beforehand cuz you don't want to get anyone else in trouble
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,120	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mr. s didn't want to talk to me
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:40,704	| serial-s01-e03 |	After I made several requests he asked if I please leave him alone
EDL	00:24:40,704	00:24:41,216	| serial-s01-e03 |	Fair enough
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:48,640	| serial-s01-e03 |	I tried every witch way to figure out if he knew or anyone in his family knew Adnan or Jay or any of the people
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:49,920	| serial-s01-e03 |	I told about the murder
EDL	00:24:50,432	00:24:53,248	| serial-s01-e03 |	And vice-versa whether any of them had ever heard of mr. ass
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:54,784	| serial-s01-e03 |	Condo connection
EDL	00:24:55,552	00:24:56,832	| serial-s01-e03 |	The closest I got was
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,856	| serial-s01-e03 |	Bear with me
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:03,232	| serial-s01-e03 |	I found out the mister as his sister-in-law was a math teacher at Woodlawn back in 1999 when all this happened
EDL	00:25:05,024	00:25:06,560	| serial-s01-e03 |	He was her student she said
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,352	| serial-s01-e03 |	An excellent student top-of-the-line
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:12,448	| serial-s01-e03 |	But you didn't think this your ass knew anything about the crime before you found the body
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:15,520	| serial-s01-e03 |	She put her husband on the phone Mistresses younger half-brother
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:19,616	| serial-s01-e03 |	And he said you know what's crazy I used to live next door to the kid that did it
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,920	| serial-s01-e03 |	That's back when I was 9 or 10
EDL	00:25:22,432	00:25:26,016	| serial-s01-e03 |	Is it used to throw the football around with him anyway you seem like a nice kid
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:29,088	| serial-s01-e03 |	Again he said that his brother stumbled on the body by axe
EDL	00:25:29,088	00:25:30,624	| serial-s01-e03 |	Menopause
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,904	| serial-s01-e03 |	Chuckled and said
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:33,696	| serial-s01-e03 |	I think he was running through the woods
EDL	00:25:33,696	00:25:34,464	| serial-s01-e03 |	Streaking
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:35,488	| serial-s01-e03 |	That's how you found it
EDL	00:25:36,256	00:25:39,584	| serial-s01-e03 |	I told him that apparently had stopped to take a pee he said
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| serial-s01-e03 |	That's possible to
EDL	00:25:44,192	00:25:46,240	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mr s is telling the truth
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:51,104	| serial-s01-e03 |	After all why would a guy who's been in trouble repeatedly for indecent exposure
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:52,384	| serial-s01-e03 |	Take out a dead girl
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:56,224	| serial-s01-e03 |	But inevitably inviting more police contact to rain down upon him
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:04,416	| serial-s01-e03 |	Mr. s wasn't the detectives only lead in this case
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:05,696	| serial-s01-e03 |	We're also looking at the boyfriend
EDL	00:26:06,464	00:26:10,304	| serial-s01-e03 |	Exactly their suspicions about an on start to percolate
