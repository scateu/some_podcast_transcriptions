EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:22,432	| serial-s02-e09 |	Sabo gets picked up by Special Operations team in Afghanistan
EDL	00:01:23,968	00:01:25,504	| serial-s02-e09 |	He's quickly pulled onto a
EDL	00:01:26,784	00:01:28,320	| serial-s02-e09 |	Leaving the ground like that
EDL	00:01:28,320	00:01:30,112	| serial-s02-e09 |	We space suddenly all around him
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:32,160	| serial-s02-e09 |	After 5 years of being locked in rooms
EDL	00:01:32,928	00:01:34,208	| serial-s02-e09 |	He said it was like Crossing in Abyss
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:39,840	| serial-s02-e09 |	When they landed at a nearby base bow wanted to communicate with these guys who rescued him
EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:41,632	| serial-s02-e09 |	You couldn't talk yet
EDL	00:01:41,632	00:01:43,168	| serial-s02-e09 |	He hadn't spoken sentences
EDL	00:01:43,168	00:01:45,472	| serial-s02-e09 |	Has much less had a conversation in so long
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:47,264	| serial-s02-e09 |	He says you can think of the words
EDL	00:01:47,264	00:01:48,544	| serial-s02-e09 |	But he couldn't make them come out of his
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:55,456	| serial-s02-e09 |	What I ended up doing was asking for something real and at first thing I asked him was
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:02:01,600	| serial-s02-e09 |	Intel
EDL	00:02:04,672	00:02:06,976	| serial-s02-e09 |	They got me onto the plane
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:19,264	| serial-s02-e09 |	On the plane with the rest of the team
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,800	| serial-s02-e09 |	Background
EDL	00:02:21,568	00:02:23,616	| serial-s02-e09 |	And that was the last I saw them
EDL	00:02:24,640	00:02:25,920	| serial-s02-e09 |	I did mention
EDL	00:02:26,944	00:02:30,528	| serial-s02-e09 |	Wanted to say thank you and the other people around at the time
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:38,976	| serial-s02-e09 |	We got to get you some food in you and all that you know and I didn't want to
EDL	00:02:46,400	00:02:50,752	| serial-s02-e09 |	At that moment a military transport plane was standing by a Guantanamo Bay
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:53,056	| serial-s02-e09 |	Waiting to take 5 Taliban guys to Qatar
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:55,360	| serial-s02-e09 |	5 years worth of machination
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:59,456	| serial-s02-e09 |	High Hopes and false starts and politicking at secret meetings
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:02,272	| serial-s02-e09 |	Had gone into getting bow onto that helicopter
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:05,088	| serial-s02-e09 |	And the five Taliban prisoners onto a C-17
EDL	00:03:06,112	00:03:08,928	| serial-s02-e09 |	Response to this trade back home in the US buried
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:11,232	| serial-s02-e09 |	But probably the loudest response was
EDL	00:03:11,232	00:03:12,512	| serial-s02-e09 |	Can't believe I just did that
EDL	00:03:13,024	00:03:14,304	| serial-s02-e09 |	We negotiated with terrorists
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:15,840	| serial-s02-e09 |	To release some terrorists
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:17,376	| serial-s02-e09 |	To get back a deserter
EDL	00:03:18,400	00:03:21,472	| serial-s02-e09 |	It seems people also had questions in Afghanistan
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:24,288	| serial-s02-e09 |	Wait what was all of this about
EDL	00:03:24,288	00:03:25,824	| serial-s02-e09 |	Did they really just give up
EDL	00:03:26,336	00:03:30,176	| serial-s02-e09 |	Five leaders of the Taliban for one American Soldier
EDL	00:03:30,176	00:03:31,200	| serial-s02-e09 |	That's Hyder Akbar
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:32,736	| serial-s02-e09 |	He grew up in the US
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:34,784	| serial-s02-e09 |	Canales in Kabul
EDL	00:03:35,296	00:03:37,088	| serial-s02-e09 |	His father was governor of kunar province
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:40,672	| serial-s02-e09 |	How does a friend of This American Life he's done some stories for us
EDL	00:03:41,440	00:03:44,000	| serial-s02-e09 |	Spider was in Afghanistan when the trade happen
EDL	00:03:44,000	00:03:45,536	| serial-s02-e09 |	And he remembers the talk
EDL	00:03:45,536	00:03:46,304	| serial-s02-e09 |	The disbelief
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:53,984	| serial-s02-e09 |	This guy was definitely not if we see a general
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,264	| serial-s02-e09 |	No. She's just a soldier
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,824	| serial-s02-e09 |	Really they're going to let go of
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:04:04,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	5 there must be something greater at play here
EDL	00:04:04,224	00:04:07,040	| serial-s02-e09 |	I was supposed to be something much greater at play here
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:09,088	| serial-s02-e09 |	Something as big and Grand
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:10,624	| serial-s02-e09 |	The plan to end the war
EDL	00:04:11,136	00:04:12,672	| serial-s02-e09 |	What happened
EDL	00:04:13,184	00:04:16,000	| serial-s02-e09 |	How did this become the solution to getting Bo home
EDL	00:04:16,000	00:04:22,143	| serial-s02-e09 |	In 2009 was captured
EDL	00:04:22,143	00:04:25,215	| serial-s02-e09 |	The war in Afghanistan was going very badly for US troops
EDL	00:04:25,727	00:04:29,311	| serial-s02-e09 |	And a struggle was going on inside the Obama Administration
EDL	00:04:29,311	00:04:30,079	| serial-s02-e09 |	About what to do about it
EDL	00:04:31,103	00:04:34,943	| serial-s02-e09 |	The idea the president settled on was fully resource counterinsurgency
EDL	00:04:35,711	00:04:39,807	| serial-s02-e09 |	Peace talks meaning talking directly to the Taliban about ending the war
EDL	00:04:40,319	00:04:41,087	| serial-s02-e09 |	That was not part of the
EDL	00:04:41,855	00:04:42,367	| serial-s02-e09 |	Not yet
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:49,023	| serial-s02-e09 |	Person who argued the most forcefully for that to change who said we should start talking to the Taliban now
EDL	00:04:49,023	00:04:50,559	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Diplomat name Richard Holbrooke
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:53,375	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook had just been appointed a strap
EDL	00:04:53,887	00:04:56,191	| serial-s02-e09 |	Special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,031	| serial-s02-e09 |	Basically Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had hired him
EDL	00:05:00,031	00:05:00,799	| serial-s02-e09 |	To help in the war
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:04,127	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook was his legendary negotiator
EDL	00:05:04,127	00:05:05,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	Huge tenacious Talent
EDL	00:05:05,919	00:05:07,455	| serial-s02-e09 |	And also a huge personality
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:12,319	| serial-s02-e09 |	Her Memoir about being Secretary of State Clinton tells a story about how Relentless he was
EDL	00:05:12,319	00:05:15,135	| serial-s02-e09 |	I once followed her into a ladies room in Pakistan
EDL	00:05:15,647	00:05:16,927	| serial-s02-e09 |	So you can finish making his point
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:22,559	| serial-s02-e09 |	Rub some people in the administration the wrong way including Obama himself
EDL	00:05:23,327	00:05:26,655	| serial-s02-e09 |	Albert didn't stop lobbying for a political solution to the war
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,983	| serial-s02-e09 |	Well Richard did not think that
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:31,007	| serial-s02-e09 |	There was
EDL	00:05:31,007	00:05:32,799	| serial-s02-e09 |	A military solution
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	The war in Afghanistan
EDL	00:05:34,847	00:05:36,127	| serial-s02-e09 |	Biscotti Martin
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,151	| serial-s02-e09 |	A journalist and writer
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,455	| serial-s02-e09 |	She's also married to Richard Holbrooke
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:40,735	| serial-s02-e09 |	Who died in 2010
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:44,831	| serial-s02-e09 |	He did not think that you could
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:47,903	| serial-s02-e09 |	Just muscle your way to a solution
EDL	00:05:48,671	00:05:50,975	| serial-s02-e09 |	General Petraeus
EDL	00:05:50,975	00:05:53,023	| serial-s02-e09 |	Felt that doubling down
EDL	00:05:53,023	00:05:58,911	| serial-s02-e09 |	On the Taliban was the way to go Richard would have 10 second conversations with Petraeus
EDL	00:05:58,911	00:06:01,727	| serial-s02-e09 |	And at least the gist of that was
EDL	00:06:01,727	00:06:02,495	| serial-s02-e09 |	No
EDL	00:06:03,007	00:06:08,127	| serial-s02-e09 |	This is not the time for diplomacy and he's deeply
EDL	00:06:08,639	00:06:15,039	| serial-s02-e09 |	Resented Petraeus to with his friend referring to him repeatedly as his
EDL	00:06:15,039	00:06:19,135	| serial-s02-e09 |	Richard would Grumble to me since when did the Diplomat become
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:21,183	| serial-s02-e09 |	The military's wingman
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:26,047	| serial-s02-e09 |	How do you says it wasn't a personal slight Pebblebrook even care about that
EDL	00:06:26,047	00:06:27,071	| serial-s02-e09 |	It was a principal
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:29,887	| serial-s02-e09 |	Keep up the military had to much sway
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:32,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	It was dominating political strategy in these wars
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:36,031	| serial-s02-e09 |	Vale Nasser also work for Holbrook and a strap off
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:37,823	| serial-s02-e09 |	Does a special advisor
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:38,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is a Middle East scholar
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:44,479	| serial-s02-e09 |	Molly Nasser says in Holbrook view the whole military forces diplomacy debate was out of whack
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:48,063	| serial-s02-e09 |	In other words it was General Petraeus you should be holbrook's wingman
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:49,343	| serial-s02-e09 |	Or
EDL	00:06:49,343	00:06:50,111	| serial-s02-e09 |	Handmaiden
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:53,183	| serial-s02-e09 |	Military the handmaiden to diplomacy
EDL	00:06:53,951	00:06:56,767	| serial-s02-e09 |	And that balance has been lost during the bush years
EDL	00:06:57,279	00:07:03,679	| serial-s02-e09 |	And and and that's why I think he believed that that was fundamentally wrong and would find it and we get America into
EDL	00:07:03,679	00:07:04,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	Greater trouble
EDL	00:07:05,471	00:07:08,287	| serial-s02-e09 |	Call Brooksville with that you use the military
EDL	00:07:08,799	00:07:10,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	To get the Taliban to the table
EDL	00:07:10,847	00:07:13,151	| serial-s02-e09 |	But the goal is to get them to sign a document
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	Agreement
EDL	00:07:14,687	00:07:17,247	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook is being sidelined this whole time
EDL	00:07:17,759	00:07:20,063	| serial-s02-e09 |	People in the administration are trying to get him fired in
EDL	00:07:20,575	00:07:22,111	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hillary Clinton protected in
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:26,463	| serial-s02-e09 |	To make matters worse Holbrook had a crummy relationship with Hamid Karzai
EDL	00:07:26,975	00:07:29,023	| serial-s02-e09 |	Cars I thought Holbrook it undermined
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:31,839	| serial-s02-e09 |	And the Afghan presidential elections December of 2009
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:33,119	| serial-s02-e09 |	Cuz I was
EDL	00:07:33,119	00:07:33,887	| serial-s02-e09 |	Entirely wrong
EDL	00:07:34,911	00:07:37,215	| serial-s02-e09 |	Around Holbrook isn't so popular
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,543	| serial-s02-e09 |	And neither is the notion of the US sitting down with the Enemy
EDL	00:07:41,055	00:07:41,823	| serial-s02-e09 |	Taliban
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	But it seems the enemy was interested in talking to us
EDL	00:07:46,943	00:07:51,039	| serial-s02-e09 |	Diplomats in Germany have been meeting with a 30-something Afghan guy
EDL	00:07:51,039	00:07:52,319	| serial-s02-e09 |	It was close to miloma
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:53,343	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban leader
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:55,647	| serial-s02-e09 |	His name was Taya Baga
EDL	00:07:56,159	00:07:58,463	| serial-s02-e09 |	Back in Washington they didn't say his name out loud though
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| serial-s02-e09 |	These two codename
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:00,511	| serial-s02-e09 |	A-Rod
EDL	00:08:01,023	00:08:02,047	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook was a baseball fan

EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:10,495	| serial-s02-e09 |	A meeting with A-Rod would be risky
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:13,567	| serial-s02-e09 |	Turn off the guys for real whether you're being played
EDL	00:08:13,567	00:08:14,079	| serial-s02-e09 |	Neither side knows
EDL	00:08:15,103	00:08:16,639	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook wanted to try it
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:20,479	| serial-s02-e09 |	He took it to Hillary Clinton who was skeptical but gave the go-ahead
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:24,831	| serial-s02-e09 |	For a first face-to-face meeting between the Taliban and the United States government

EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,719	| serial-s02-e09 |	And it was to be secret
EDL	00:08:30,719	00:08:31,999	| serial-s02-e09 |	Paladin insisted it
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:33,023	| serial-s02-e09 |	A secret or else they walk
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:36,095	| serial-s02-e09 |	Pakistan didn't know the British didn't know
EDL	00:08:36,095	00:08:37,631	| serial-s02-e09 |	Do people in the US government now
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:39,935	| serial-s02-e09 |	Two people the Taliban new
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:45,311	| serial-s02-e09 |	They met in a small village in a safe house run by German intelligence
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:49,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	Although Thai about guy had one Western suits in his earlier meetings with the Germans
EDL	00:08:50,431	00:08:52,991	| serial-s02-e09 |	At this meeting he wore traditional Afghan clothes

EDL	00:08:54,527	00:08:59,391	| serial-s02-e09 |	Open by reading a formal propagandistic statement he knew the Americans wouldn't like
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:01,695	| serial-s02-e09 |	Americans don't have a set agenda
EDL	00:09:01,695	00:09:03,231	| serial-s02-e09 |	Are mostly there to listen
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:07,839	| serial-s02-e09 |	Weren't talking terms the US did have some non-negotiables
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:10,911	| serial-s02-e09 |	We wanted the Taliban to stop fighting
EDL	00:09:10,911	00:09:12,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	Break with Al-Qaeda
EDL	00:09:12,447	00:09:14,239	| serial-s02-e09 |	And support the Afghan Constitution
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:16,799	| serial-s02-e09 |	Including rice in there for women and girls
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:18,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	That was especially important to Hillary Clinton
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:23,967	| serial-s02-e09 |	The big goal was to get the Taliban to start talking to the cars I govern
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:26,783	| serial-s02-e09 |	Daddy has the state department put it
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:30,879	| serial-s02-e09 |	Afghans talking to other Afghans about the future of Afghanistan
EDL	00:09:30,879	00:09:32,159	| serial-s02-e09 |	So we could get out of the room
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,975	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban wanted a few things too
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:41,375	| serial-s02-e09 |	They wanted the US to distinguish between them and Al-Qaeda take their names off a un sanctions list
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,143	| serial-s02-e09 |	Paris
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:45,983	| serial-s02-e09 |	They wanted a political office outside of Pakistan they wanted it in Doha
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,287	| serial-s02-e09 |	And they wanted their prisoners
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:50,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	And that's where boat comes in
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:54,431	| serial-s02-e09 |	By that time the haqqanis have been holding him for almost a year-and-a-half
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,247	| serial-s02-e09 |	Now at this meeting his fate
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:10:00,063	| serial-s02-e09 |	Becomes tied to the fate of the peace process in Afghanistan
EDL	00:10:01,087	00:10:03,135	| serial-s02-e09 |	If us hands over some Taliban prisoners
EDL	00:10:03,647	00:10:05,183	| serial-s02-e09 |	They'll hand over the American Soldier
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,535	| serial-s02-e09 |	What would be part of water called confidence-building measures
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:11,327	| serial-s02-e09 |	That would pave the way for substantiv
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:11,839	| serial-s02-e09 |	Peace talks
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:16,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Americans weren't allowed to call it a prisoner exchange by the way
EDL	00:10:16,447	00:10:18,239	| serial-s02-e09 |	I had to call it a mutual release
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:23,359	| serial-s02-e09 |	Sobo is part of the discussion
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,895	| serial-s02-e09 |	That is not the point of these talks
EDL	00:10:24,895	00:10:25,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	Not the Crux of any
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,759	| serial-s02-e09 |	It's pretty clear when I've asked diplomats and State Department officials about it
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:31,807	| serial-s02-e09 |	Like a line item
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:33,343	| serial-s02-e09 |	An important line item
EDL	00:10:33,855	00:10:35,135	| serial-s02-e09 |	The line-item nonetheless
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:44,607	| serial-s02-e09 |	I've heard and read a number of different accounts now about what the Taliban initially asked for in exchange for Bo
EDL	00:10:45,119	00:10:49,471	| serial-s02-e09 |	One source told me it was always five particular guys at gitmo the Taliban wanted
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:51,007	| serial-s02-e09 |	Another source
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,031	| serial-s02-e09 |	Who was at the meeting
EDL	00:10:52,031	00:10:54,591	| serial-s02-e09 |	Tell me that it first it was a simpler to man
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:57,407	| serial-s02-e09 |	4 Taliban prisoners held at Bagram
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,175	| serial-s02-e09 |	In Afghanistan
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:01,247	| serial-s02-e09 |	Cuyahoga turned us down for an interview
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:04,063	| serial-s02-e09 |	So I haven't been able to definitively pin this down
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,927	| serial-s02-e09 |	In any case when the Munich meeting was over the Americans
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:10,975	| serial-s02-e09 |	A contingent from the White House
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:11,487	| serial-s02-e09 |	State Department
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:13,023	| serial-s02-e09 |	Defy home
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,047	| serial-s02-e09 |	Report back to their bosses
EDL	00:11:14,559	00:11:15,071	| serial-s02-e09 |	Thumbs up
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,095	| serial-s02-e09 |	It's on
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:20,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook Dr. To the airport to meet his guy he's so eager to hear how it went
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,007	| serial-s02-e09 |	Just a couple of weeks later
EDL	00:11:23,007	00:11:23,519	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook.
EDL	00:11:24,287	00:11:28,895	| serial-s02-e09 |	He was at work when his aorta ruptured is rushed to the hospital for surgery
EDL	00:11:28,895	00:11:30,943	| serial-s02-e09 |	Put on December 13th 2010
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:31,455	| serial-s02-e09 |	She died
EDL	00:11:32,735	00:11:34,271	| serial-s02-e09 |	Just a pause here for a minute
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:38,111	| serial-s02-e09 |	A bunch of people I talk to for the story we're sad about holbrook's death
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,135	| serial-s02-e09 |	Just for him
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:40,159	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Frack Anniston
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:44,511	| serial-s02-e09 |	They have this feeling that maybe if Holbrook hadn't died when he did
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:46,559	| serial-s02-e09 |	The talks with the Taliban could have worked out differently
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:49,375	| serial-s02-e09 |	That we wouldn't still be in this mess of War
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,655	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hayes Valley Nasser
EDL	00:11:51,423	00:11:56,799	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holbrook was the only I think Statesmen at that time in the United States who was willing
EDL	00:11:56,799	00:11:59,103	| serial-s02-e09 |	To take the risk of owning reconcile
EDL	00:12:00,895	00:12:02,943	| serial-s02-e09 |	That's that wasn't afraid of it wasn't afraid of it
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:08,063	| serial-s02-e09 |	He advocated what was a very very unpopular and and risky
EDL	00:12:08,063	00:12:09,343	| serial-s02-e09 |	At position
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:11,647	| serial-s02-e09 |	I don't think anybody else was willing to do it after
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:13,439	| serial-s02-e09 |	Nobody stood up and said
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:16,767	| serial-s02-e09 |	I'm not mister reconciliation I'm now the champion
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,095	| serial-s02-e09 |	And the irony of it was that
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:22,911	| serial-s02-e09 |	You know he was being
EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:25,983	| serial-s02-e09 |	So much effort was being put on marginalized
EDL	00:12:28,031	00:12:31,359	| serial-s02-e09 |	A dad that that that you know when you actually died
EDL	00:12:31,359	00:12:31,871	| serial-s02-e09 |	We realized
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:34,687	| serial-s02-e09 |	You know how much was he actually caring
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| serial-s02-e09 |	And how important
EDL	00:12:36,991	00:12:38,271	| serial-s02-e09 |	Right after Holbrook dies
EDL	00:12:38,783	00:12:43,135	| serial-s02-e09 |	That's when political reconciliation with the Taliban officially becomes us strategy
EDL	00:12:43,647	00:12:45,439	| serial-s02-e09 |	In February of 2011
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:48,255	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hillary Clinton gives a speech in honor of Holbrook
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,023	| serial-s02-e09 |	Actually
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:54,143	| serial-s02-e09 |	Which for the first time an American official speaks out loud in public about talking peace with
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:54,655	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:57,983	| serial-s02-e09 |	Still many people in the government aren't happy about it
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:03,871	| serial-s02-e09 |	Adversary that can be as brutal as the Taliban
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:05,151	| serial-s02-e09 |	Sounds
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:05,663	| serial-s02-e09 |	Distasteful
EDL	00:13:06,431	00:13:07,199	| serial-s02-e09 |	Even
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:07,711	| serial-s02-e09 |	Animash
EDL	00:13:08,991	00:13:10,271	| serial-s02-e09 |	And diplomacy would be
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:11,551	| serial-s02-e09 |	A lot easier
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:13,855	| serial-s02-e09 |	If we only had to talk to our friends
EDL	00:13:14,879	00:13:16,671	| serial-s02-e09 |	But that is not how one makes
EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:17,183	| serial-s02-e09 |	Peace
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:23,071	| serial-s02-e09 |	Where was the original Vision after Munich
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:25,119	| serial-s02-e09 |	Over the next 6 months
EDL	00:13:25,119	00:13:28,191	| serial-s02-e09 |	Everyone would agree to terms on the confidence-building measures
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:34,591	| serial-s02-e09 |	The office would happen trade including Bo what happened and then the goal was by December
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:40,991	| serial-s02-e09 |	7-Eleven at an International Conference plan in Bonn Germany cars I would be there and the talks Afghan to f
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:42,271	| serial-s02-e09 |	Afghan would be underway
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:44,319	| serial-s02-e09 |	Such an orderly vision
EDL	00:13:45,343	00:13:46,879	| serial-s02-e09 |	Instead what happens is
EDL	00:13:47,391	00:13:48,927	| serial-s02-e09 |	Football
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:50,975	| serial-s02-e09 |	Years of fits and starts
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:57,119	| serial-s02-e09 |	4 people in the diplomacy business the ping pong and trajectory of these taxes probably familiar
EDL	00:13:57,631	00:14:02,751	| serial-s02-e09 |	But to me as I was trying to figure out what happened with bow and his connection to these meetings with the Taliban
EDL	00:14:02,751	00:14:05,055	| serial-s02-e09 |	I just had no idea it would look like this
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:09,407	| serial-s02-e09 |	And I'm not going to take you through every step because we'd be here all week
EDL	00:14:09,407	00:14:15,807	| serial-s02-e09 |	But I just want to point out some of the moments of like only because they really bring home
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:18,111	| serial-s02-e09 |	How fraught and fragile diplomacy can be
EDL	00:14:19,391	00:14:22,463	| serial-s02-e09 |	So after Munich there's this brief moment of
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:22,975	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hopefulness
EDL	00:14:24,255	00:14:26,559	| serial-s02-e09 |	How many cars I had created a high peace Council
EDL	00:14:26,559	00:14:28,351	| serial-s02-e09 |	In anticipation of impending peace
EDL	00:14:28,863	00:14:32,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	The US had a couple more meetings with Ty abaga
EDL	00:14:32,447	00:14:32,959	| serial-s02-e09 |	And then
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:34,239	| serial-s02-e09 |	Stagnation
EDL	00:14:35,007	00:14:36,287	| serial-s02-e09 |	Nothing is fine
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| serial-s02-e09 |	Nothing is moving
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	Washington is wearing

EDL	00:14:53,439	00:14:53,951	| serial-s02-e09 |	Time
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:55,743	| serial-s02-e09 |	Enormous
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:57,535	| serial-s02-e09 |	Precious time after 1

EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:10,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	It took so damn long
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:14,687	| serial-s02-e09 |	I needed to show progress to his bosses
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:16,479	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban are getting antsy
EDL	00:15:17,247	00:15:20,831	| serial-s02-e09 |	In addition for tabaga it's no easy thing for him to get to these meetings
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:21,599	| serial-s02-e09 |	In secret
EDL	00:15:22,111	00:15:24,927	| serial-s02-e09 |	He worried understandably that his life might be in danger
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:26,719	| serial-s02-e09 |	Became public you was talkin to the US
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:29,535	| serial-s02-e09 |	Factions inside the Taliban didn't want peace
EDL	00:15:30,559	00:15:33,119	| serial-s02-e09 |	And no one had consulted Pakistan about any of this
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:35,423	| serial-s02-e09 |	Pakistan had long wanted to be a player and NEP
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:41,055	| serial-s02-e09 |	Karzai was perpetually worried that the US and Pakistan were up to something behind his back
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:43,103	| serial-s02-e09 |	It all had to stay quiet
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,967	| serial-s02-e09 |	2011 Ambassador Mark Grossman replaced Holbrook is Ezra
EDL	00:15:48,735	00:15:53,087	| serial-s02-e09 |	What was supposed to be secret it would have been better if it is
EDL	00:15:53,087	00:15:53,855	| serial-s02-e09 |	Been quiet
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,671	| serial-s02-e09 |	That as I as I know you know from doing your research
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,743	| serial-s02-e09 |	People just talk and talk and talk
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:00,255	| serial-s02-e09 |	They did
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,071	| serial-s02-e09 |	We suffered a lot of leaks from
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:04,863	| serial-s02-e09 |	Washington and also
EDL	00:16:04,863	00:16:06,399	| serial-s02-e09 |	And also from Cabo
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:10,495	| serial-s02-e09 |	And why well because you know it wasn't the most popular thing in the world to be doing
EDL	00:16:10,495	00:16:16,895	| serial-s02-e09 |	Result in May of 2011 The Washington Post and Der Spiegel in German
EDL	00:16:16,895	00:16:23,295	| serial-s02-e09 |	Post reported that the talks were happening and for the first time they named Cuyahoga the Taliban
EDL	00:16:23,295	00:16:25,599	| serial-s02-e09 |	Man walked away from the talks
EDL	00:16:25,599	00:16:28,927	| serial-s02-e09 |	Clinton rushed to Islamabad to smooth things over with Pakistan
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:35,327	| serial-s02-e09 |	Another state department official pleaded Doha to ask the Cuttery is to please please ask the Taliban to come back
EDL	00:16:35,327	00:16:36,607	| serial-s02-e09 |	Which a few months later they did
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:42,239	| serial-s02-e09 |	According to Michael Steiner the leaks meant the Taliban now had to Dig Inn on their demands
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,567	| serial-s02-e09 |	To reassure their own people they weren't selling out to the America
EDL	00:16:46,335	00:16:48,639	| serial-s02-e09 |	Price for the continuation
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:49,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	Of the process
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:54,783	| serial-s02-e09 |	Fire
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:16:57,599	| serial-s02-e09 |	Because the demand beckemeyer
EDL	00:16:58,367	00:16:59,391	| serial-s02-e09 |	Aunt
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,183	| serial-s02-e09 |	If you would have acted earlier
EDL	00:17:02,463	00:17:03,487	| serial-s02-e09 |	Could have been
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,767	| serial-s02-e09 |	To be paid
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:09,375	| serial-s02-e09 |	Steiner didn't specify but I believe he's talking about the gitmo detainees
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:11,679	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban now fixed on that demand
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:13,727	| serial-s02-e09 |	That made things harder
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:15,519	| serial-s02-e09 |	Because getting prisoners out of gitmo
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,031	| serial-s02-e09 |	NE prison
EDL	00:17:16,799	00:17:18,079	| serial-s02-e09 |	Just ask President Obama
EDL	00:17:18,079	00:17:19,103	| serial-s02-e09 |	That's not easy
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,639	| serial-s02-e09 |	Are laws about it
EDL	00:17:20,639	00:17:24,223	| serial-s02-e09 |	You have to tell Congress you have to get the Secretary of Defense to sign off on it
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:29,855	| serial-s02-e09 |	Someone in the office at the time told me when they discuss it at meetings the defense department just
EDL	00:17:29,855	00:17:31,647	| serial-s02-e09 |	Really really really
EDL	00:17:31,647	00:17:33,951	| serial-s02-e09 |	Opposed transferring anybody out of Guantanamo
EDL	00:17:35,231	00:17:38,303	| serial-s02-e09 |	Big picture Mark Grossman schools were the same as Holbrook
EDL	00:17:39,071	00:17:41,631	| serial-s02-e09 |	To create a stable Afghanistan inside a stable region
EDL	00:17:42,399	00:17:43,167	| serial-s02-e09 |	I need a plan
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,727	| serial-s02-e09 |	Series of international conferences and meetings
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,799	| serial-s02-e09 |	To get other countries to commit money and support
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,871	| serial-s02-e09 |	To help not only end the war in Afghanistan but sustained a piece
EDL	00:17:52,639	00:17:53,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	Explain all of this
EDL	00:17:53,919	00:17:55,455	| serial-s02-e09 |	The tie bar go when they finally met
EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:58,015	| serial-s02-e09 |	In what were
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| serial-s02-e09 |	What did he want
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,623	| serial-s02-e09 |	Like what what became clear to you was like
EDL	00:18:02,623	00:18:03,903	| serial-s02-e09 |	Why he was there
EDL	00:18:04,927	00:18:07,231	| serial-s02-e09 |	They wanted their prisoners out of Guantanamo
EDL	00:18:09,791	00:18:13,887	| serial-s02-e09 |	Grossman's at one point they did try to offer Ty about got prisoners from Bagram
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,167	| serial-s02-e09 |	But that was a no-go
EDL	00:18:15,167	00:18:21,567	| serial-s02-e09 |	The reporter David road that they tried to offer up for different Taliban guys from gitmo lesser figure tutorial
EDL	00:18:21,567	00:18:24,639	| serial-s02-e09 |	I've been cleared for transfer but that was also rejected
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,199	| serial-s02-e09 |	Calvin wanted these Five Guys
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:36,671	| serial-s02-e09 |	This point in the middle of 2011 there were 17 Afghans in Guantanamo
EDL	00:18:36,671	00:18:39,743	| serial-s02-e09 |	All of them accused of being tied to the Taliban or two terrorist groups
EDL	00:18:40,255	00:18:44,095	| serial-s02-e09 |	So why was Tyga asking for these 5 back
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:44,863	| serial-s02-e09 |	Can exchange for battle
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,215	| serial-s02-e09 |	You look especially two of the big he's on the list
EDL	00:18:49,215	00:18:51,775	| serial-s02-e09 |	Does a mullah Fazal an oriole and Nori
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:57,663	| serial-s02-e09 |	What happened with them is actually a really interesting window into what was going on with the war right in the beginning
EDL	00:18:57,663	00:18:58,687	| serial-s02-e09 |	2001
EDL	00:18:58,687	00:19:01,247	| serial-s02-e09 |	Because this is a surprise to me
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:05,087	| serial-s02-e09 |	About time late 2001 some Taliban commanders surrender
EDL	00:19:05,599	00:19:07,391	| serial-s02-e09 |	So there's this opportunity
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:10,207	| serial-s02-e09 |	People argue that we blew it it was a big missed opportunity
EDL	00:19:10,719	00:19:12,255	| serial-s02-e09 |	To get the Taliban to stop fighting
EDL	00:19:12,767	00:19:15,071	| serial-s02-e09 |	That we could have swooped in when they were weakest
EDL	00:19:15,071	00:19:16,095	| serial-s02-e09 |	Contain them
EDL	00:19:16,095	00:19:16,863	| serial-s02-e09 |	A piece
EDL	00:19:17,375	00:19:21,471	| serial-s02-e09 |	Another words all the things we'd still be struggling to do a decade-and-a-half later
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:25,311	| serial-s02-e09 |	I talked to Carlotta Gall about these guys
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:28,383	| serial-s02-e09 |	Fazal Inori coladas reporter for the New York Times
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:32,479	| serial-s02-e09 |	And she arrived in Afghanistan just a couple of weeks after the US started bombing
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:37,087	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban regime was unraveling and in the north where Colorado was
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,415	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hundreds of Taliban and Al-Qaeda Fighters had just been trapped
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:41,183	| serial-s02-e09 |	In the city of condos
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:43,999	| serial-s02-e09 |	Jordan newspaper story about what happened next
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:45,791	| serial-s02-e09 |	But never got published
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:47,583	| serial-s02-e09 |	So much else was going on that in
EDL	00:19:48,863	00:19:52,191	| serial-s02-e09 |	In retrospect what you saw with a singular moment in the war
EDL	00:19:53,471	00:19:55,263	| serial-s02-e09 |	I talked to Carlotta over Skype
EDL	00:19:55,263	00:19:57,567	| serial-s02-e09 |	Shoes at our office in Tunis she's in North Africa

EDL	00:19:58,591	00:19:59,615	| serial-s02-e09 |	The sound isn't great
EDL	00:20:00,127	00:20:01,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	But you told me the story of what she saw
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:03,967	| serial-s02-e09 |	She said she was up north
EDL	00:20:03,967	00:20:05,247	| serial-s02-e09 |	This big mud for it
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:06,783	| serial-s02-e09 |	Where General dostum also was
EDL	00:20:07,295	00:20:09,343	| serial-s02-e09 |	Dustin was his Infamous Commander
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,879	| serial-s02-e09 |	Who was fighting the Taliban
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:12,415	| serial-s02-e09 |	And the US was supporting him
EDL	00:20:12,927	00:20:14,463	| serial-s02-e09 |	So Dustin fair at this fort
EDL	00:20:14,975	00:20:17,535	| serial-s02-e09 |	And he he received the delegation of

EDL	00:21:01,823	00:21:03,615	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban would ask us to release

EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:12,896	| serial-s02-e09 |	Apparently the understanding was that fossils Fighters would be allowed safe passage back to where they came from
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:19,040	| serial-s02-e09 |	But it didn't happen instead many of them got killed at a now-infamous prison Uprising which lasted for days
EDL	00:23:19,552	00:23:22,880	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hundreds more got packed up in container trucks in asphyxiated
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:24,672	| serial-s02-e09 |	Whole other grizzley chain of events
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:31,072	| serial-s02-e09 |	As for fossil and Nori Justin kept them under house arrest for a while his own rather fancy guest house
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,632	| serial-s02-e09 |	But eventually he gave them up to the Americans
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:39,264	| serial-s02-e09 |	What we learned later was saying they were taken to one of the warships
EDL	00:23:39,264	00:23:41,056	| serial-s02-e09 |	In the Gulf I think
EDL	00:23:41,056	00:23:46,176	| serial-s02-e09 |	As quite a few PS4 at that time and then they later ended up in Guantanamo
EDL	00:23:47,712	00:23:51,040	| serial-s02-e09 |	They were in fact in that group of first arrivals at Guantanamo
EDL	00:23:51,040	00:23:52,832	| serial-s02-e09 |	On January 11th 2002
EDL	00:23:53,344	00:23:54,880	| serial-s02-e09 |	You seen the pictures from that day
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:55,904	| serial-s02-e09 |	Men on their knees
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:57,184	| serial-s02-e09 |	Orange jumpsuits barbed wire
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:00,512	| serial-s02-e09 |	As for the other guys on tabaka's list
EDL	00:24:01,280	00:24:03,072	| serial-s02-e09 |	They all seem to have been in contact with
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,120	| serial-s02-e09 |	If not cooperating with
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:07,168	| serial-s02-e09 |	Either the us or the Karzai government
EDL	00:24:07,168	00:24:09,216	| serial-s02-e09 |	When they were arrested and sent to Guantanamo
EDL	00:24:09,984	00:24:12,288	| serial-s02-e09 |	When was the Taliban is Deputy intelligence chief
EDL	00:24:12,288	00:24:14,336	| serial-s02-e09 |	I was at a meeting with CIA agent
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:14,848	| serial-s02-e09 |	That's when he was grabbed
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:18,688	| serial-s02-e09 |	And rolled up in a carpet right away like that in broad daylight
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:22,272	| serial-s02-e09 |	Another was a former Taliban interior minister
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:23,296	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hidden contacts
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:24,576	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Karzai about a job
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:26,880	| serial-s02-e09 |	And one was meeting an American
EDL	00:24:26,880	00:24:27,904	| serial-s02-e09 |	At the airport when he got a rash
EDL	00:24:29,184	00:24:30,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	So those are the five
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:33,792	| serial-s02-e09 |	Actually there was one other guy the Taliban wanted back
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:35,328	| serial-s02-e09 |	But he died at Guantanamo
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:39,168	| serial-s02-e09 |	Get a heart attack after exercising on an elliptical in early 2011
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:43,520	| serial-s02-e09 |	If the Taliban to get these guys out of gitmo
EDL	00:24:43,520	00:24:45,056	| serial-s02-e09 |	It would be symbolic and a bunch of ways
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:48,384	| serial-s02-e09 |	First off it's a hugely morale-boosting message
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| serial-s02-e09 |	Their own fighters
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:51,456	| serial-s02-e09 |	Look at the links will go
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:52,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	How to get our prisoners out
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,552	| serial-s02-e09 |	More than that it's a huge Public Relations Act
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:57,088	| serial-s02-e09 |	The United States
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:58,368	| serial-s02-e09 |	The highest levels
EDL	00:24:58,880	00:25:00,416	| serial-s02-e09 |	Would be recognizing them
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:01,184	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:02,720	| serial-s02-e09 |	As legitimate organization
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:05,536	| serial-s02-e09 |	Not treating them as a ragtag band of terrorists
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:10,400	| serial-s02-e09 |	I'm finally to them it's a victory for their understanding of Justice in this one
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:14,240	| serial-s02-e09 |	Since most of these guys say they weren't exactly fighting with America
EDL	00:25:14,240	00:25:15,520	| serial-s02-e09 |	When they were captured in the first place
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,848	| serial-s02-e09 |	Mufasa himself explains this line of
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,408	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is Military Tribunal at Guantanamo
EDL	00:25:21,920	00:25:24,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	He tells the tribunal about the meeting with dostum
EDL	00:25:24,224	00:25:24,992	| serial-s02-e09 |	Reporters
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,040	| serial-s02-e09 |	Derek ammerman in journalist
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:34,208	| serial-s02-e09 |	Meaning dostum he says there's 25 year war between person-to-person Village by Village City by City
EDL	00:25:34,720	00:25:36,768	| serial-s02-e09 |	Province by province and tribe against tribe
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:42,400	| serial-s02-e09 |	If you think this is crime than every single person in Afghanistan should be in prison or bring them here
EDL	00:25:43,168	00:25:48,288	| serial-s02-e09 |	I never ever fought against the new government I never fought against America and I didn't do anything wrong against
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:51,104	| serial-s02-e09 |	And why am I an enemy combatant
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:56,480	| serial-s02-e09 |	It does seem true that fossil was a brutal fighter
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:59,552	| serial-s02-e09 |	Powerful commander and possibly a war criminal
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:02,880	| serial-s02-e09 |	But you can argue the same is true of General dostum
EDL	00:26:02,880	00:26:04,928	| serial-s02-e09 |	Dustin has also been accused of war crimes
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:08,512	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is now first vice president of Afghanistan
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:09,024	| serial-s02-e09 |	Our Ally
EDL	00:26:10,304	00:26:13,632	| serial-s02-e09 |	And one last thing on this in 2001
EDL	00:26:13,632	00:26:17,728	| serial-s02-e09 |	Hamid Karzai had come to an agreement with Taliban commanders in the south
EDL	00:26:17,728	00:26:21,312	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban with hand over control of four provinces peacefully
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:23,360	| serial-s02-e09 |	And in return they did amnesty
EDL	00:26:23,360	00:26:26,176	| serial-s02-e09 |	But the US said no you can't do that
EDL	00:26:26,688	00:26:27,712	| serial-s02-e09 |	Wouldn't let it happen
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:32,064	| serial-s02-e09 |	Instead we proclaimed by a secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld
EDL	00:26:32,064	00:26:38,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	That because the Taliban harbored Osama Bin Laden we would be treating them the same way we treated International terrorist
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:40,768	| serial-s02-e09 |	We do not give amnesty to terrorists
EDL	00:26:41,280	00:26:42,304	| serial-s02-e09 |	We do not negotiate with her
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| serial-s02-e09 |	We hunt them down
EDL	00:26:47,424	00:26:53,824	| serial-s02-e09 |	The talks with the Taliban suffered so many setbacks over the years it's hard to even contain them all in
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:57,920	| serial-s02-e09 |	I had so many factors were in play in so many different countries
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:27:01,760	| serial-s02-e09 |	Some of the setbacks are pointed an intentional elytra
EDL	00:27:02,272	00:27:08,160	| serial-s02-e09 |	Some setbacks for immutable a simple case of bad timing and some setbacks were so human
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,208	| serial-s02-e09 |	Old fashioned screw-ups
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:15,072	| serial-s02-e09 |	Most obvious assault on the tops came in September of 2011
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:19,424	| serial-s02-e09 |	A guy came to the door of former Afghan president Brandon Rabbani
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:25,312	| serial-s02-e09 |	Rabbani was heading Afghanistan's High peace Council this guy said he had a message from the Taliban
EDL	00:27:25,312	00:27:26,592	| serial-s02-e09 |	Unglue app for Bonnie's house
EDL	00:27:27,360	00:27:30,176	| serial-s02-e09 |	Rabbani was killed as were four others from the council
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:33,248	| serial-s02-e09 |	Barney's assistant masoom stanekzai
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,016	| serial-s02-e09 |	Was badly injured
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:39,392	| serial-s02-e09 |	No one took responsibility for the attack but many people suspected Pakistan was behind it
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:46,816	| serial-s02-e09 |	Mark Roseman says losing the help of those guys and especially having Statics II out of commission for so many months
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,352	| serial-s02-e09 |	Was terrible
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:53,216	| serial-s02-e09 |	We talked about Afghans talking other Afghans about future Afghanistan they were the Afghans
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:53,728	| serial-s02-e09 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:54,240	00:27:56,544	| serial-s02-e09 |	They they would have been doing this work
EDL	00:27:56,544	00:27:58,592	| serial-s02-e09 |	And whoever did this
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,384	| serial-s02-e09 |	It was a very
EDL	00:28:02,176	00:28:03,712	| serial-s02-e09 |	It was a very strategic move
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:11,392	| serial-s02-e09 |	Rabbani assassination happened a couple months before the big international meeting and bond set for December 2000
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:14,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	11 the one that a year earlier had been something of a Finish Line
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,792	| serial-s02-e09 |	Now it felt like they were back to square one
EDL	00:28:18,560	00:28:20,352	| serial-s02-e09 |	And then a year-and-a-half later
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:21,632	| serial-s02-e09 |	Screw up
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,912	| serial-s02-e09 |	With some very bad results
EDL	00:28:23,680	00:28:27,008	| serial-s02-e09 |	Mid-2013 have been in captivity for 4 years
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:27,776	| serial-s02-e09 |	By then
EDL	00:28:27,776	00:28:32,128	| serial-s02-e09 |	After various arm-twisting in Washington and in Kabul and a Doha
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:35,200	| serial-s02-e09 |	It looks as if they really might be able to crank up the talks again
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,480	| serial-s02-e09 |	Things have shifted
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,552	| serial-s02-e09 |	Instead of the prisoner exchange first
EDL	00:28:39,552	00:28:40,832	| serial-s02-e09 |	They're going to do an office
EDL	00:28:41,856	00:28:43,648	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban wanted in office
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:44,416	| serial-s02-e09 |	In Doha
EDL	00:28:44,416	00:28:45,696	| serial-s02-e09 |	As a home base for political
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,768	| serial-s02-e09 |	It would show they were legitimate political actor
EDL	00:28:49,280	00:28:51,072	| serial-s02-e09 |	The office had become Issue Number 1 for the
EDL	00:28:51,840	00:28:54,656	| serial-s02-e09 |	And cars I was naturally cautious
EDL	00:28:54,656	00:28:55,680	| serial-s02-e09 |	About this
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:59,264	| serial-s02-e09 |	There's a new s Rap by now Ambassador James Dobbins
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:02,080	| serial-s02-e09 |	He's working with Karzai and Woodcutter
EDL	00:29:02,080	00:29:03,104	| serial-s02-e09 |	Who's the intermediary
EDL	00:29:03,872	00:29:06,688	| serial-s02-e09 |	Cautious is probably an understatement for cars on this day
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,736	| serial-s02-e09 |	He doesn't trust us
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:11,552	| serial-s02-e09 |	He doesn't trust our stated objectives in Afghanistan are for real
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,600	| serial-s02-e09 |	He's worried we're trying to cut him out of the
EDL	00:29:13,600	00:29:15,392	| serial-s02-e09 |	The talks make a side deal with
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:18,208	| serial-s02-e09 |	Pakistan maybe he obviously doesn't trust package
EDL	00:29:18,208	00:29:22,560	| serial-s02-e09 |	He thinks maybe this whole office deal is a Pakistani orchestrated plot
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,352	| serial-s02-e09 |	To get recognition for the Taliban
EDL	00:29:25,120	00:29:29,984	| serial-s02-e09 |	He's worried Cotter is essentially letting the Taliban set up a shadow government with this Doha office
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:32,800	| serial-s02-e09 |	So it's shaky to say the least
EDL	00:29:32,800	00:29:34,080	| serial-s02-e09 |	Car has cooperation here
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:38,432	| serial-s02-e09 |	The United States is trying to make sure everyone abides by the ground rules
EDL	00:29:38,432	00:29:39,456	| serial-s02-e09 |	Including the detail
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:46,368	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban cannot throw around the words Islamic Emirate in connection with this office very important
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,160	| serial-s02-e09 |	They have to call it something like
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	The political office of the Taliban movement
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:57,376	| serial-s02-e09 |	Not as representation of the Islamic Emirate which was what they
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:29:58,144	| serial-s02-e09 |	Call
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:03,776	| serial-s02-e09 |	Their government so they shouldn't present themselves in a fact as an alternative government
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,312	| serial-s02-e09 |	Afghanistan
EDL	00:30:06,080	00:30:11,968	| serial-s02-e09 |	So everyone's agreeing to the starter ground rules the Assumption was that
EDL	00:30:12,480	00:30:13,504	| serial-s02-e09 |	In June
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:21,440	| serial-s02-e09 |	The office would open and we would begin discussions and the detainee exchange would be
EDL	00:30:21,440	00:30:23,744	| serial-s02-e09 |	Most likely the first order of business
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:27,840	| serial-s02-e09 |	Meaning the exchange for both would be the first order of business
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:30,656	| serial-s02-e09 |	June 18th the office open
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:34,240	| serial-s02-e09 |	It's his new pretty elaborate multi-story building
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:35,264	| serial-s02-e09 |	The wall around it
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:41,664	| serial-s02-e09 |	An opening ceremony back in the US the time difference
EDL	00:30:41,664	00:30:44,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	Means it's something like three or four in the morning in Washington
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:49,088	| serial-s02-e09 |	Jeff Eggers who's in Afghanistan and Pakistan director for the National Security Council
EDL	00:30:49,600	00:30:52,672	| serial-s02-e09 |	Has David been up all night waiting for the opening on TV
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:56,000	| serial-s02-e09 |	The first indication that there was a problem with the flag
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:57,536	| serial-s02-e09 |	The flag
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,560	| serial-s02-e09 |	Of the Islamic Emirate
EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:00,352	| serial-s02-e09 |	They also had a sign outside the
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,400	| serial-s02-e09 |	It said Islamic Emirate
EDL	00:31:03,424	00:31:05,728	| serial-s02-e09 |	John Kerry was Secretary of State by then
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:08,032	| serial-s02-e09 |	Within minutes he calls the Emir of Qatar
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:11,104	| serial-s02-e09 |	Remember we're not communicating directly with the Taliban
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,384	| serial-s02-e09 |	The spine is all through the
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:12,896	| serial-s02-e09 |	Guitarist
EDL	00:31:13,920	00:31:16,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	So carry presumably impresses on the emir
EDL	00:31:16,736	00:31:19,040	| serial-s02-e09 |	It's not supposed to say Islamic Emirate
EDL	00:31:19,552	00:31:21,600	| serial-s02-e09 |	The one word you can't have on that flag
EDL	00:31:21,600	00:31:22,624	| serial-s02-e09 |	On that building
EDL	00:31:22,624	00:31:23,392	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is Emirate
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:25,440	| serial-s02-e09 |	We are upset
EDL	00:31:25,440	00:31:26,720	| serial-s02-e09 |	It's not what we agreed
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,024	| serial-s02-e09 |	And it's going to Karzai flip his lid
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:30,048	| serial-s02-e09 |	Exactly what he shared
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:33,120	| serial-s02-e09 |	Bernie Rubin works in the S rap off
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,168	| serial-s02-e09 |	An expert on Afghanistan and pay
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:37,216	| serial-s02-e09 |	And even hard by Holbrook
EDL	00:31:37,984	00:31:40,544	| serial-s02-e09 |	He was in the air when this happened flying to Doha
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,056	| serial-s02-e09 |	Dubai
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:42,848	| serial-s02-e09 |	So I got off the plane
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,920	| serial-s02-e09 |	And I seal my Blackberry oh my God
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:49,248	| serial-s02-e09 |	So I was I went directly to the
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:49,760	| serial-s02-e09 |	Embassy
EDL	00:31:50,528	00:31:52,576	| serial-s02-e09 |	The flag is lowered out of sight pretty fast
EDL	00:31:53,088	00:31:55,904	| serial-s02-e09 |	But the offending sign is still on the outside of the building
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:57,440	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is there all day
EDL	00:31:57,440	00:31:58,976	| serial-s02-e09 |	And a tomb is still up
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:02,816	| serial-s02-e09 |	Barney decides to go there to try to find someone to take down the sign
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:05,120	| serial-s02-e09 |	The embassy is short on cars
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:07,168	| serial-s02-e09 |	He gets a ride in some guys private
EDL	00:32:07,680	00:32:11,008	| serial-s02-e09 |	Arrived at the Taliban office building they're surrounded by armed
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,032	| serial-s02-e09 |	Qatari security
EDL	00:32:12,032	00:32:13,056	| serial-s02-e09 |	The whole thing for a while
EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:15,616	| serial-s02-e09 |	So they can figure out who Barney is
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:16,128	| serial-s02-e09 |	What he wants
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:19,456	| serial-s02-e09 |	But he is not leaving until someone shows up
EDL	00:32:19,456	00:32:20,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	With some tools base
EDL	00:32:20,736	00:32:22,272	| serial-s02-e09 |	I usually leave till August
EDL	00:32:22,272	00:32:25,344	| serial-s02-e09 |	Already you stay there and watch them take it down
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:28,672	| serial-s02-e09 |	And then I took a photograph of the
EDL	00:32:28,672	00:32:29,952	| serial-s02-e09 |	Wall without the sign
EDL	00:32:30,720	00:32:32,000	| serial-s02-e09 |	And we emailed it
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:34,304	| serial-s02-e09 |	To the US Embassy in Kabul only showed at the prison
EDL	00:32:38,400	00:32:40,448	| serial-s02-e09 |	But by that time it was too late
EDL	00:32:40,448	00:32:42,752	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is Jeff Eggers but all it took was
EDL	00:32:43,520	00:32:44,800	| serial-s02-e09 |	You know the Optics
EDL	00:32:44,800	00:32:47,872	| serial-s02-e09 |	That one flag being thrown in there
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:50,944	| serial-s02-e09 |	To really derail
EDL	00:32:51,968	00:32:53,760	| serial-s02-e09 |	At that point years of effort
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:56,576	| serial-s02-e09 |	Dobbins and secretary Kerry fly to Doha
EDL	00:32:57,088	00:32:59,392	| serial-s02-e09 |	Find out if there's any way to salvage the situation
EDL	00:32:59,904	00:33:01,440	| serial-s02-e09 |	And to find out why it happened
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:05,024	| serial-s02-e09 |	Dobbins learned is that it seems to be a genuine misunderstanding
EDL	00:33:05,792	00:33:08,864	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban thought it was fine for them to call themselves whatever they wanted
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:10,912	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Qatari said that
EDL	00:33:10,912	00:33:11,936	| serial-s02-e09 |	Discussions
EDL	00:33:12,448	00:33:14,752	| serial-s02-e09 |	Occurred in 2012 or 11
EDL	00:33:14,752	00:33:21,152	| serial-s02-e09 |	USS said we don't care what you call yourselves you just have to understand we won't call you that now I don't believe any us officials
EDL	00:33:21,152	00:33:21,664	| serial-s02-e09 |	Said that
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:24,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	But the guitar is believed it
EDL	00:33:25,248	00:33:27,808	| serial-s02-e09 |	And as I say I think it I think it was
EDL	00:33:27,808	00:33:30,112	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is a Taliban warrant
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,136	| serial-s02-e09 |	Trying to
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:32,928	| serial-s02-e09 |	Demonstrate bad faith
EDL	00:33:33,440	00:33:37,792	| serial-s02-e09 |	They genuinely believed what they were doing would be unexceptionable
EDL	00:33:38,304	00:33:40,352	| serial-s02-e09 |	And were I think
EDL	00:33:40,352	00:33:42,144	| serial-s02-e09 |	Surprised by the reaction
EDL	00:33:43,168	00:33:45,216	| serial-s02-e09 |	It all could have been avoided as what they
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,544	| serial-s02-e09 |	Simon says the arrangement had a whiff of amateurishness
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:52,640	| serial-s02-e09 |	It wasn't even being handled formally by the Qatari foreign minister
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:54,688	| serial-s02-e09 |	Davis Kind of B-Team on it
EDL	00:33:55,712	00:33:58,272	| serial-s02-e09 |	Bernie Rubin says the office agreement kept changing
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,808	| serial-s02-e09 |	To accommodate everyone's concerns
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:04,416	| serial-s02-e09 |	There was never a final document everyone signed off on line by line
EDL	00:34:05,184	00:34:06,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	Anyway now
EDL	00:34:06,464	00:34:07,232	| serial-s02-e09 |	The towel that have lost faith
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,280	| serial-s02-e09 |	They felt it once
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:13,632	| serial-s02-e09 |	They had been in effect humiliated by having to take down their flag and their sign
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,168	| serial-s02-e09 |	That I couldn't go forward
EDL	00:34:15,936	00:34:16,704	| serial-s02-e09 |	With the talks
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:19,776	| serial-s02-e09 |	So peace talks grind to a halt
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,336	| serial-s02-e09 |	I would stay in captivity for another year
EDL	00:34:28,992	00:34:31,808	| serial-s02-e09 |	And I like simple straightforward people do you want a deal or not
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:34,624	| serial-s02-e09 |	Naats sami yusuf side the afghan reporter
EDL	00:34:35,392	00:34:38,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	Sammy interviewed someone high up in the Taliban for us
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:39,744	| serial-s02-e09 |	We agreed not to say who it is
EDL	00:34:40,512	00:34:41,536	| serial-s02-e09 |	This guy told Sammy
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:43,328	| serial-s02-e09 |	After 4 years
EDL	00:34:43,328	00:34:44,352	| serial-s02-e09 |	1/2 years
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:45,376	| serial-s02-e09 |	Holding bow
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:51,776	| serial-s02-e09 |	They were getting fatigued but it was obvious I believe this was getting too much long did you hear that contain
EDL	00:34:51,776	00:34:57,664	| serial-s02-e09 |	Echo 2010 or 12 and 13 still nothing was
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:59,200	| serial-s02-e09 |	Cumming Kaiser result
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:06,368	| serial-s02-e09 |	Going to the American is just quiet slow and responding and they told him that we have to bring everything in the knowledge of proper
EDL	00:35:06,368	00:35:08,672	| serial-s02-e09 |	President Obama and his Nautica
EDL	00:35:09,440	00:35:10,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	Easy case
EDL	00:35:10,464	00:35:14,560	| serial-s02-e09 |	I understand so that's why there was like I'm in the kitchen while getting longer and longer
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,352	| serial-s02-e09 |	In 2013
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,632	| serial-s02-e09 |	The year before but was released
EDL	00:35:18,144	00:35:19,424	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban have a lot going on
EDL	00:35:19,936	00:35:23,776	| serial-s02-e09 |	We would know it for a couple of years but mullah Omar the Taliban leader
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,824	| serial-s02-e09 |	Who died in Spring of 2013
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:30,688	| serial-s02-e09 |	Melissa Holguin who was in charge of keeping both her most of his time as a prisoner
EDL	00:35:30,688	00:35:32,224	| serial-s02-e09 |	Was killed in a drone strike
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:33,760	| serial-s02-e09 |	In September of 2013
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:39,648	| serial-s02-e09 |	Sammy says he imagines the pakistanis were also pushing the Taliban to settle this prisoner.
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:42,208	| serial-s02-e09 |	Because they were getting pressure from The Americans
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:44,768	| serial-s02-e09 |	So they're all those reason
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:46,048	| serial-s02-e09 |	And
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:49,632	| serial-s02-e09 |	Ford Thunderbird David's I would say it in Pakistani army operation
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:54,240	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Pakistani army was gearing up to launch attacks in waziristan
EDL	00:35:54,752	00:35:56,288	| serial-s02-e09 |	Against the Pakistani Taliban
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:35:58,592	| serial-s02-e09 |	And so people there were on notice
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:00,640	| serial-s02-e09 |	Including the haqqanis for holding bow
EDL	00:36:01,152	00:36:02,688	| serial-s02-e09 |	You might want to get out of there
EDL	00:36:02,688	00:36:03,456	| serial-s02-e09 |	Before you get killed
EDL	00:36:04,224	00:36:08,320	| serial-s02-e09 |	But obviously you know the agony people was told that we are going to do application
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:11,904	| serial-s02-e09 |	So they always be totally abandoned Forest
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:13,440	| serial-s02-e09 |	All kind of medicines
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,720	| serial-s02-e09 |	Objectified

EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,912	| serial-s02-e09 |	Cuz American has access to
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:24,192	| serial-s02-e09 |	Anywhere they want
EDL	00:36:24,192	00:36:24,704	| serial-s02-e09 |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:25,728	| serial-s02-e09 |	Yeah
EDL	00:36:29,568	00:36:33,664	| serial-s02-e09 |	Early in 2014 the Taliban finally let the Americans know
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:34,688	| serial-s02-e09 |	They're ready to make a deal
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:36,992	| serial-s02-e09 |	But not on a peace plan
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,784	| serial-s02-e09 |	Instead they tell us
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,344	| serial-s02-e09 |	If you just want to swap for your prisoner
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:41,856	| serial-s02-e09 |	We're ready
EDL	00:36:42,880	00:36:46,208	| serial-s02-e09 |	How is now Cut Loose from the broader talks about reconciliation
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:47,232	| serial-s02-e09 |	He's free-floating
EDL	00:36:47,744	00:36:49,280	| serial-s02-e09 |	And it's up to us whether to grab him
EDL	00:36:49,792	00:36:51,584	| serial-s02-e09 |	Ultimately the White House would have to make the call
EDL	00:36:52,864	00:36:56,960	| serial-s02-e09 |	Jeff Eggers was working at the White House as a special assistant to the president for national
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:36:57,728	| serial-s02-e09 |	Security affairs
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:36:59,264	| serial-s02-e09 |	Dresses
EDL	00:36:59,264	00:37:00,544	| serial-s02-e09 |	They took stock of the situation
EDL	00:37:01,312	00:37:02,336	| serial-s02-e09 |	And
EDL	00:37:02,336	00:37:04,640	| serial-s02-e09 |	At around the same time there was
EDL	00:37:05,408	00:37:07,200	| serial-s02-e09 |	You have some sense that
EDL	00:37:08,480	00:37:09,504	| serial-s02-e09 |	We were
EDL	00:37:09,504	00:37:15,136	| serial-s02-e09 |	We were only going to lose opportunities to recover Bergdahl the the more the resources
EDL	00:37:15,648	00:37:18,720	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Western Coalition resources in Afghanistan decline
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:23,328	| serial-s02-e09 |	We're about to start withdrawing our troops transitioning out of there
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:26,912	| serial-s02-e09 |	This isn't going to get any easier to get him back
EDL	00:37:28,704	00:37:32,800	| serial-s02-e09 |	The United States and ask for proof of Life video of bow and in January it arrived
EDL	00:37:33,312	00:37:35,616	| serial-s02-e09 |	I haven't seen it but I've talked to a few people who have
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,920	| serial-s02-e09 |	And they said don't look to be in bad shape
EDL	00:37:38,944	00:37:40,480	| serial-s02-e09 |	Is movements for strange
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:41,760	| serial-s02-e09 |	The speech was incoherent
EDL	00:37:42,272	00:37:43,552	| serial-s02-e09 |	People told me it was alarming
EDL	00:37:44,320	00:37:47,136	| serial-s02-e09 |	Edgar says the White House wasn't wearing any other options

EDL	00:38:41,664	00:38:47,808	| serial-s02-e09 |	Maybe maybe one day someone would take down the rest of the big beautiful agreement to make p

EDL	00:40:30,464	00:40:33,024	| serial-s02-e09 |	Everything about this transfer was top secret
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:34,560	| serial-s02-e09 |	If it got out they were Ditka

EDL	00:40:45,056	00:40:47,360	| serial-s02-e09 |	The qataris talked to each of the Taliban guys
EDL	00:40:47,872	00:40:48,640	| serial-s02-e09 |	And then
EDL	00:40:48,640	00:40:49,152	| serial-s02-e09 |	A weight
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:52,992	| serial-s02-e09 |	The deal was that the US wouldn't release them
EDL	00:40:52,992	00:40:54,272	| serial-s02-e09 |	Until bow was in US
EDL	00:40:55,552	00:40:58,112	| serial-s02-e09 |	But the Taliban holding bow are taking much
EDL	00:40:58,112	00:40:59,392	| serial-s02-e09 |	Longer than anybody enter
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:03,232	| serial-s02-e09 |	8 hours later they realize this is not
EDL	00:41:03,232	00:41:04,000	| serial-s02-e09 |	Happening
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:06,816	| serial-s02-e09 |	At the house the Cutterys in nearby Naval Hotel
EDL	00:41:07,328	00:41:10,144	| serial-s02-e09 |	Taliban guys they put in a kind of holding cell near the airport
EDL	00:41:10,656	00:41:11,680	| serial-s02-e09 |	This is not supposed to have
EDL	00:41:12,960	00:41:15,520	| serial-s02-e09 |	Carol Rosenberg reporter from the Miami Herald
EDL	00:41:16,032	00:41:18,080	| serial-s02-e09 |	I've been looking out for the Taliban trade
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:18,848	| serial-s02-e09 |	4 years
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:22,432	| serial-s02-e09 |	Carol's been covering Guantanamo since the day it opened
EDL	00:41:22,944	00:41:25,248	| serial-s02-e09 |	She watched three of these Taliban guys arrive there
EDL	00:41:25,248	00:41:26,016	| serial-s02-e09 |	Monday 1
EDL	00:41:26,784	00:41:29,344	| serial-s02-e09 |	Carol was down at Guantanamo at the end of May
EDL	00:41:29,344	00:41:30,880	| serial-s02-e09 |	She said she noticed these big
EDL	00:41:30,880	00:41:32,928	| serial-s02-e09 |	Planes 2 C-17
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,464	| serial-s02-e09 |	Across the water from where she was
EDL	00:41:34,976	00:41:36,256	| serial-s02-e09 |	She can just make them out
EDL	00:41:36,768	00:41:42,144	| serial-s02-e09 |	Squinting across the bay seeing you know the airframes of
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:45,472	| serial-s02-e09 |	C-17s on the airstrip
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:48,032	| serial-s02-e09 |	I'm like why doesn't it leave
EDL	00:41:52,384	00:41:54,175	| serial-s02-e09 |	Another day goes by
EDL	00:41:54,175	00:41:55,967	| serial-s02-e09 |	The plans are still sitting there
EDL	00:41:55,967	00:41:57,247	| serial-s02-e09 |	Now it's May 30th
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:42:00,575	| serial-s02-e09 |	Girls asking people to base what is going on with these plans
EDL	00:42:01,087	00:42:02,367	| serial-s02-e09 |	They're saying stuff like
EDL	00:42:02,367	00:42:08,255	| serial-s02-e09 |	C-17
EDL	00:42:09,279	00:42:12,095	| serial-s02-e09 |	Finally the morning of Saturday May 31st
EDL	00:42:12,095	00:42:13,119	| serial-s02-e09 |	The US gets word
EDL	00:42:14,911	00:42:15,935	| serial-s02-e09 |	The plane leaves for Doha
EDL	00:42:16,959	00:42:18,239	| serial-s02-e09 |	On it are the qataris
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,031	| serial-s02-e09 |	The Taliban prisoners
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:21,311	| serial-s02-e09 |	And US security personnel
EDL	00:42:22,335	00:42:25,919	| serial-s02-e09 |	According to a congressional investigation when they were planning to transfer
EDL	00:42:25,919	00:42:29,759	| serial-s02-e09 |	Defense Department officials said he thought the US security would be a good idea
EDL	00:42:29,759	00:42:32,575	| serial-s02-e09 |	Because they're concerned about quote one of the knucklehead
EDL	00:42:32,575	00:42:33,087	| serial-s02-e09 |	Trying something
EDL	00:42:39,999	00:42:42,303	| serial-s02-e09 |	Jim Dobbin said to me about the trade
EDL	00:42:42,303	00:42:43,839	| serial-s02-e09 |	It wasn't a disaster
EDL	00:42:43,839	00:42:45,375	| serial-s02-e09 |	And it wasn't a brilliant achievement
EDL	00:42:45,887	00:42:48,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	It was a successful and necessary operation
EDL	00:42:48,959	00:42:50,239	| serial-s02-e09 |	It wasn't going to end the war
EDL	00:42:51,007	00:42:52,287	| serial-s02-e09 |	Which of course is disappointing
EDL	00:42:52,799	00:42:54,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	And also makes the steel hard to assess
EDL	00:42:55,359	00:42:59,967	| serial-s02-e09 |	You can easily say wow the Taliban really got a lot of bang for their Buck on this
EDL	00:43:00,991	00:43:05,343	| serial-s02-e09 |	You look back at the things they wanted at that first Munich meeting in 2010
EDL	00:43:05,343	00:43:05,855	| serial-s02-e09 |	Well
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:11,231	| serial-s02-e09 |	They got some of their names off the UN sanctions list
EDL	00:43:11,231	00:43:14,815	| serial-s02-e09 |	Their office isn't official but there is that building in Doha
EDL	00:43:15,327	00:43:16,607	| serial-s02-e09 |	And they got their prisoners back
EDL	00:43:17,375	00:43:18,399	| serial-s02-e09 |	From get mono last
EDL	00:43:19,167	00:43:20,703	| serial-s02-e09 |	And all they gave up with bow
EDL	00:43:21,215	00:43:23,263	| serial-s02-e09 |	I got a plan to give up all along
EDL	00:43:23,263	00:43:25,055	| serial-s02-e09 |	Gatherer tired of holding
EDL	00:43:25,055	00:43:27,615	| serial-s02-e09 |	On Alitalia victory
EDL	00:43:27,615	00:43:34,015	| serial-s02-e09 |	On the other hand we had to get bow back somehow nothing else had worked and there was no way the end
EDL	00:43:34,015	00:43:38,111	| serial-s02-e09 |	United States government was going to let an American Soldier died in captivity
EDL	00:43:38,111	00:43:40,415	| serial-s02-e09 |	Another country's trade all the time
EDL	00:43:40,415	00:43:41,439	| serial-s02-e09 |	Israel say
EDL	00:43:41,439	00:43:43,999	| serial-s02-e09 |	Dolce prisoners even for the remains of one of their Soldier
EDL	00:43:45,023	00:43:48,095	| serial-s02-e09 |	And they're now five fewer prisoners at Guantanamo
EDL	00:43:48,607	00:43:50,911	| serial-s02-e09 |	President Obama would like to close Guantanamo
EDL	00:43:52,703	00:43:59,103	| serial-s02-e09 |	Carol Rosenberg what are the things she pointed out was at these 5 Taliban guys hadn't had Intel van
EDL	00:43:59,103	00:44:05,503	| serial-s02-e09 |	Value for a long time Osama Bin Laden was already dead and also as prisoners they didn't do any
EDL	00:44:05,503	00:44:11,903	| serial-s02-e09 |	The things you sometimes hear about from getting officials they weren't hunger-striking or gathering up their bodily fluids and cup
EDL	00:44:11,903	00:44:13,183	| serial-s02-e09 |	Cops and flinging it at the guards
EDL	00:44:13,695	00:44:17,023	| serial-s02-e09 |	The exception of one they didn't even challenge their detention in federal court
EDL	00:44:17,535	00:44:18,303	| serial-s02-e09 |	So many others
EDL	00:44:18,303	00:44:18,815	| serial-s02-e09 |	Detainees have
EDL	00:44:19,327	00:44:20,607	| serial-s02-e09 |	These guys didn't none of that
EDL	00:44:21,119	00:44:24,447	| serial-s02-e09 |	They sat there in communal confinement
EDL	00:44:25,215	00:44:26,751	| serial-s02-e09 |	Following the directions
EDL	00:44:27,263	00:44:30,847	| serial-s02-e09 |	Praying when there was prayer time eating when it was food time
EDL	00:44:31,615	00:44:35,967	| serial-s02-e09 |	Sitting there sort of you know when I don't want to like boot up but you know sitting there
EDL	00:44:37,247	00:44:42,623	| serial-s02-e09 |	Following the rules and not being a problem they were what they would call them here highly compliant
EDL	00:44:43,135	00:44:44,927	| serial-s02-e09 |	And to me that sounds like
EDL	00:44:45,695	00:44:47,487	| serial-s02-e09 |	That's like a p o w Wright
EDL	00:44:47,999	00:44:51,583	| serial-s02-e09 |	There their they're thinking I'm a prisoner of this war and when
