EDL	00:16:40,959	00:16:44,287	| serial-s01-e10 |	I remember hearing that when you were deliberating one of the jurors
EDL	00:16:47,871	00:16:48,895	| serial-s01-e10 |	So

EDL	00:17:00,671	00:17:06,047	| serial-s01-e10 |	The first thing Christina Gutierrez announced trial lawyer said in her opening statement about her client
EDL	00:17:06,047	00:17:07,583	| serial-s01-e10 |	This isn't the first trial
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:11,167	| serial-s01-e10 |	Was quoted masud Syed is an American citizen
EDL	00:17:11,167	00:17:12,703	| serial-s01-e10 |	He was born in this country

EDL	00:17:18,335	00:17:22,431	| serial-s01-e10 |	That the jurors might be prone to anti-muslim anti-foreigner sentiment
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:27,551	| serial-s01-e10 |	Which probably explains why she spent what seemed to me a Nutty amount of time during her opening
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:33,951	| serial-s01-e10 |	Talking about what an immigrant is what a mosque is what Pakistan is quote a country formed in the

EDL	00:17:56,479	00:17:59,039	| serial-s01-e10 |	Earlier app
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:04,159	| serial-s01-e10 |	About whether she should have talked to Asia McClain or whether her style made of grated on jurors
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:06,975	| serial-s01-e10 |	But now I'm going to address this question head-on
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:08,255	| serial-s01-e10 |	Did she blow it
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:15,935	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina in terms of what happened at trial
EDL	00:18:15,935	00:18:17,727	| serial-s01-e10 |	Is it she never contacted Asia McClain
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:22,079	| serial-s01-e10 |	He thinks it wasn't deliberate on her part he just think she made a mistake
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:23,871	| serial-s01-e10 |	Like a Surgeon slip of the scalpel
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:27,711	| serial-s01-e10 |	I personally she was nothing but compassionate towards him he said
EDL	00:18:28,223	00:18:30,271	| serial-s01-e10 |	Always asking him how he was doing
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:33,599	| serial-s01-e10 |	To make sure he got the skin medication he needed the glasses he needed
EDL	00:18:34,111	00:18:34,879	| serial-s01-e10 |	She was his protector

EDL	00:18:49,983	00:18:52,799	| serial-s01-e10 |	Hopefully I mean
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:54,335	| serial-s01-e10 |	No one could explain
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:56,639	| serial-s01-e10 |	Standing there in that situation

EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:14,815	| serial-s01-e10 |	I mean
EDL	00:19:14,815	00:19:18,399	| serial-s01-e10 |	No she never really mentioned what her plan would be I never really knew what it would be
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:23,007	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina died in January of 2004
EDL	00:19:23,007	00:19:27,103	| serial-s01-e10 |	Play I can't ask her what her strategy was for Conjuring Reasonable Doubt
EDL	00:19:28,127	00:19:30,943	| serial-s01-e10 |	I have to go by what we seen in her notes and in the courtroom
EDL	00:19:31,711	00:19:35,551	| serial-s01-e10 |	And based on all that I can summarize her defense theory in four words
EDL	00:19:36,063	00:19:37,087	| serial-s01-e10 |	Someone else did it
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:42,463	| serial-s01-e10 |	Such as a or the new boyfriend or Mister as the guy who found the body
EDL	00:19:42,463	00:19:43,743	| serial-s01-e10 |	After all she argued
EDL	00:19:43,743	00:19:45,791	| serial-s01-e10 |	For sure when he died
EDL	00:19:45,791	00:19:46,303	| serial-s01-e10 |	What day
EDL	00:19:46,815	00:19:49,119	| serial-s01-e10 |	It could have been the 13th or 14th or 15th
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:53,727	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina wanted to show that once the cops zeroed in on an on
EDL	00:19:53,727	00:19:55,519	| serial-s01-e10 |	Ignored other viable suspects
EDL	00:19:56,287	00:19:58,591	| serial-s01-e10 |	Putting down an alibi for a.
EDL	00:19:59,103	00:20:02,431	| serial-s01-e10 |	She dumped as much suspicion as she could on to these other players
EDL	00:20:03,455	00:20:07,039	| serial-s01-e10 |	I mentioned before that announce first trial ended in a mistrial
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:07,807	| serial-s01-e10 |	Here's what happened
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:11,391	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina was what Chris floor described as a fighting person
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,695	| serial-s01-e10 |	Generally a good quality in an attorney
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:16,767	| serial-s01-e10 |	That's scratchy part of Christina though
EDL	00:20:16,767	00:20:20,351	| serial-s01-e10 |	Sometimes it could elicit a response shall we say in the courtroom
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:27,007	| serial-s01-e10 |	An adversarial situation both sides and announced case were suspicious that the other was playing fast and loose when they could
EDL	00:20:27,519	00:20:28,543	| serial-s01-e10 |	And it could get Presley
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:31,871	| serial-s01-e10 |	Prosecutor Casey Murphy during a bench conference
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:32,639	| serial-s01-e10 |	The first trial

EDL	00:20:34,943	00:20:40,319	| serial-s01-e10 |	I'm going to attempt to defense counsel calling my co-counsel on a****** at the trial table
EDL	00:20:42,367	00:20:43,391	| serial-s01-e10 |	I did not hear
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:47,743	| serial-s01-e10 |	I wish I could complain to a judge every time someone called me an a******
EDL	00:20:48,511	00:20:54,911	| serial-s01-e10 |	Coral says he knows Christina to be a pitbull on the pant leg of Justice unquote but an otherwise
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:57,983	| serial-s01-e10 |	This person and how about everybody just behaves themselves okay
EDL	00:20:58,751	00:21:02,847	| serial-s01-e10 |	Slater Quarles loses his patience with Christina
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:04,127	| serial-s01-e10 |	It's over something small
EDL	00:21:04,639	00:21:07,967	| serial-s01-e10 |	Kevin urick asks if he can show exhibit 31 to the jurors
EDL	00:21:08,479	00:21:10,783	| serial-s01-e10 |	AT&T call records Herman on phone
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:13,343	| serial-s01-e10 |	Train calls from January 12th 13th and 14th
EDL	00:21:14,623	00:21:16,416	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina says she hasn't seen it before

EDL	00:21:19,744	00:21:20,256	| serial-s01-e10 |	Call record
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:22,816	| serial-s01-e10 |	She says yeah but I hadn't actually looked at it
EDL	00:21:22,816	00:21:24,864	| serial-s01-e10 |	Before I haven't physically seen this exhibit
EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,912	| serial-s01-e10 |	Cross calls him up to the bench
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,448	| serial-s01-e10 |	Miss Gutierrez
EDL	00:21:29,216	00:21:32,032	| serial-s01-e10 |	You're going to stand there and lie to the jury about something that you agreed to
EDL	00:21:33,056	00:21:34,336	| serial-s01-e10 |	I'm not going to permit you to do that
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:37,920	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina says judge the fact that I
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:38,944	| serial-s01-e10 |	That was a lie
EDL	00:21:38,944	00:21:40,992	| serial-s01-e10 |	You told a lie I'm not going to permit you to do that
EDL	00:21:41,760	00:21:44,320	| serial-s01-e10 |	That's not a lie judge I resent the implication
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:45,600	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina starts getting heated now
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,928	| serial-s01-e10 |	Girl says please be quiet please be quiet
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:50,976	| serial-s01-e10 |	She says it's very hard to be quiet when a court has
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:52,000	| serial-s01-e10 |	Accusing me of lying
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:58,400	| serial-s01-e10 |	I don't want to overdo it here but it's possible that had this bench conference not happened
EDL	00:21:58,400	00:21:59,936	| serial-s01-e10 |	Announce whole life could have been different
EDL	00:22:00,960	00:22:06,080	| serial-s01-e10 |	That first trial according to Adnan to Kristina's colleagues to people who are watching it
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:07,872	| serial-s01-e10 |	Seem to be going well for Adnan Syed
EDL	00:22:08,384	00:22:11,200	| serial-s01-e10 |	It was moving fast and Jason to be more on the defensive
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:12,736	| serial-s01-e10 |	Then this happened
EDL	00:22:13,248	00:22:15,040	| serial-s01-e10 |	And of course jurors overheard it
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:18,624	| serial-s01-e10 |	Despite the White Noise they turn on during bench conferences to muffle the sound
EDL	00:22:19,136	00:22:20,160	| serial-s01-e10 |	After a break
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:21,696	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina asks for a mistrial
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:22,976	| serial-s01-e10 |	Coral says
EDL	00:22:22,976	00:22:24,768	| serial-s01-e10 |	He's got a note from alternate number for
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:29,632	| serial-s01-e10 |	Infused the fact that you determine that Miss Gutierrez is a liar will she be removed
EDL	00:22:29,632	00:22:30,656	| serial-s01-e10 |	Will we start over
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:32,704	| serial-s01-e10 |	Call Sister Christina
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:34,752	| serial-s01-e10 |	Your motion for mistrial

EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,344	| serial-s01-e10 |	16 at this time
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:52,928	| serial-s01-e10 |	She said moving into trial number to Christina was confident
EDL	00:22:53,696	00:22:54,720	| serial-s01-e10 |	I mean look you know
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:23:01,120	| serial-s01-e10 |	Are the jury cold after the first incident of the state kitzies case and they're giving me indications are going to
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:03,936	| serial-s01-e10 |	Quit and then you turn around and tried
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:05,728	| serial-s01-e10 |	Different jewelry and it comes out
EDL	00:23:05,728	00:23:06,240	| serial-s01-e10 |	Completely
EDL	00:23:06,752	00:23:10,080	| serial-s01-e10 |	You know the opposite you guys pulled the jury after the mistrial
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:12,896	| serial-s01-e10 |	I wasn't part of it but I know the jury was polled
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,688	| serial-s01-e10 |	After the mistress
EDL	00:23:15,200	00:23:16,224	| serial-s01-e10 |	By her and I believe
EDL	00:23:16,992	00:23:17,760	| serial-s01-e10 |	Lockhart
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:19,808	| serial-s01-e10 |	Okay I'm not sure
EDL	00:23:19,808	00:23:21,344	| serial-s01-e10 |	But the jury was polled
EDL	00:23:21,344	00:23:22,880	| serial-s01-e10 |	And it was a fan of the state's case
EDL	00:23:23,392	00:23:25,696	| serial-s01-e10 |	The interview the duration and they gave
EDL	00:23:26,464	00:23:27,744	| serial-s01-e10 |	Every indication that they were
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:29,280	| serial-s01-e10 |	Heading toward acquittal
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:32,608	| serial-s01-e10 |	In fact it wasn't quite at the end of the state's case
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:36,448	| serial-s01-e10 |	AT&T expert hadn't testified about the cell tower technology
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:39,520	| serial-s01-e10 |	Engen hadn't taken the stand either which is significant
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:43,360	| serial-s01-e10 |	But it's true the jury had heard the bulk of the state's case
EDL	00:23:43,360	00:23:47,456	| serial-s01-e10 |	Used to have that information you got to feel pretty good about that you knows the defense attorney
EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:51,296	| serial-s01-e10 |	I would expect him being at the trial tree myself that you would come
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:52,320	| serial-s01-e10 |	What is coursing
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,928	| serial-s01-e10 |	Keep doing the same thing get the same kind of results
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:04,864	| serial-s01-e10 |	True different jury but also different judge slightly different arguments
EDL	00:24:04,864	00:24:08,192	| serial-s01-e10 |	Weather for all we know winds blowing slightly more this way or that
EDL	00:24:08,704	00:24:10,496	| serial-s01-e10 |	There's so many factors
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:11,264	| serial-s01-e10 |	Including chance
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,336	| serial-s01-e10 |	Which no one wants to think about in a first-degree murder case
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,640	| serial-s01-e10 |	The Corrs black is part of it too
EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:25,856	| serial-s01-e10 |	About a month later they start all over
EDL	00:24:25,856	00:24:26,880	| serial-s01-e10 |	Trial 2
EDL	00:24:28,160	00:24:29,952	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina strategies the same
EDL	00:24:29,952	00:24:31,744	| serial-s01-e10 |	Try to show that someone else killed Hae
EDL	00:24:32,256	00:24:35,072	| serial-s01-e10 |	She did a lot of research and hopes it blinking mr. s
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,376	| serial-s01-e10 |	The crime or at least trying to link him to J
EDL	00:24:37,888	00:24:40,192	| serial-s01-e10 |	Patronize the video store where they worked
EDL	00:24:40,192	00:24:41,984	| serial-s01-e10 |	But you never succeeded
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:47,104	| serial-s01-e10 |	During that second trial it take some doing but she finally gets mr. s on the stand
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:49,408	| serial-s01-e10 |	He's so desperately didn't want to be there
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:52,480	| serial-s01-e10 |	The courthouse staff basically to prevent him from leaving the building
EDL	00:24:53,248	00:24:55,808	| serial-s01-e10 |	So even though he's her witness he's a hostile witness
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:25:00,416	| serial-s01-e10 |	Who's Christina trying to get him to explain how work orders at his job got filled
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:04,512	| serial-s01-e10 |	If you could get to the epicenter job will do it at the time we can't do it at the time we do it
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:05,536	| serial-s01-e10 |	Want to get you
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,560	| serial-s01-e10 |	That's my ass off
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:08,096	| serial-s01-e10 |	Which month is the next day
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,632	| serial-s01-e10 |	Whenever
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:12,960	| serial-s01-e10 |	When your work day Within
EDL	00:25:12,960	00:25:14,240	| serial-s01-e10 |	You were going to leave
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:16,544	| serial-s01-e10 |	I guess so
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:22,176	| serial-s01-e10 |	You wouldn't get well sir is that a yes or no I'm not asking so yes when your workday don't you leave
EDL	00:25:25,504	00:25:27,552	| serial-s01-e10 |	Of course mr. s was more of a side dish
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:30,112	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina's main prey with j
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:31,392	| serial-s01-e10 |	She tells the judge
EDL	00:25:31,904	00:25:36,256	| serial-s01-e10 |	Judge am I just like to be heard it is our entire defense. To make
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:39,584	| serial-s01-e10 |	James the person who committed this crime
EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:44,960	| serial-s01-e10 |	I'm with all the ways in which he acted guilty and
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:51,104	| serial-s01-e10 |	Describing words and thanking when she acted with consciousness of guilt by concealing
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:51,872	| serial-s01-e10 |	Evidence
EDL	00:25:52,384	00:25:54,176	| serial-s01-e10 |	His clothes his boots
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,480	| serial-s01-e10 |	Is powder coat
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:59,040	| serial-s01-e10 |	His shop was wiping shovels
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:01,856	| serial-s01-e10 |	To conceal evidence as he said
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:04,160	| serial-s01-e10 |	Wealthiness David Anton
EDL	00:26:04,160	00:26:08,256	| serial-s01-e10 |	I'm crossed to conceal evidence of his involvement
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:12,096	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina cross-examined J on five different days
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,400	| serial-s01-e10 |	Choose exhaustive and exhausting
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,472	| serial-s01-e10 |	Her questions are detailed and deliberate
EDL	00:26:17,984	00:26:23,104	| serial-s01-e10 |	She questioned them and maybe it was the half speed pacing or the sing-songy aggression
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:26,432	| serial-s01-e10 |	It added up to something less than effective
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:29,760	| serial-s01-e10 |	Her punches and there were many many punches
EDL	00:26:29,760	00:26:31,040	| serial-s01-e10 |	Don't always appear to land
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:35,904	| serial-s01-e10 |	A masterful job of presenting the facts
EDL	00:26:36,672	00:26:40,000	| serial-s01-e10 |	Announces Christina actually he calls her Miss Gutierrez
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:42,304	| serial-s01-e10 |	Let me do some great things for him
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:47,168	| serial-s01-e10 |	True successful and barring the school nurse from testifying in a second trial for instance
EDL	00:26:47,168	00:26:50,240	| serial-s01-e10 |	I was a woman who said she thought a non was faking his reaction
EDL	00:26:50,240	00:26:50,752	| serial-s01-e10 |	Lester Hayes death
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:54,592	| serial-s01-e10 |	But he says he wishes some of her arguments had been clear
EDL	00:26:57,408	00:26:58,688	| serial-s01-e10 |	It was at least linear
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:03,808	| serial-s01-e10 |	Officials confusing things but
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:06,880	| serial-s01-e10 |	It wasn't like a clear outline
EDL	00:27:06,880	00:27:11,744	| serial-s01-e10 |	Like the prosecution had everything was kind of jumbled I took so long
EDL	00:27:14,304	00:27:15,072	| serial-s01-e10 |	It was just like
EDL	00:27:22,240	00:27:22,752	| serial-s01-e10 |	Right
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,800	| serial-s01-e10 |	To give you an idea
EDL	00:27:24,800	00:27:27,616	| serial-s01-e10 |	Andrea's first and second tape statements to Detectives
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:31,968	| serial-s01-e10 |	He tells them different stories about when Adnan first told him he was going to
EDL	00:27:31,968	00:27:32,480	| serial-s01-e10 |	Kill hay
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:37,344	| serial-s01-e10 |	In the first statement he says it not mentions it that same day January 13th
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:38,880	| serial-s01-e10 |	Weather driving Anand
EDL	00:27:38,880	00:27:39,648	| serial-s01-e10 |	School at lunch time
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:41,952	| serial-s01-e10 |	In the second tape statement
EDL	00:27:41,952	00:27:44,256	| serial-s01-e10 |	He says a Nan told him the night before
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:47,584	| serial-s01-e10 |	And also that has been talking about it for four or five days already
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:50,400	| serial-s01-e10 |	When you testify as a child
EDL	00:27:50,400	00:27:51,936	| serial-s01-e10 |	He goes back to the first version
EDL	00:27:51,936	00:27:54,240	| serial-s01-e10 |	That he first heard about it from a non on the 13th
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,824	| serial-s01-e10 |	So obviously Christina questions about all this
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,616	| serial-s01-e10 |	It's fertile territory for her side
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:01,664	| serial-s01-e10 |	Listen to how she does it
EDL	00:28:01,664	00:28:04,992	| serial-s01-e10 |	This tape goes on for awhile by the way but I want you to get the full effect
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,808	| serial-s01-e10 |	Another occasion
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:10,112	| serial-s01-e10 |	You told them
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,208	| serial-s01-e10 |	All the conversations I had with
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:17,792	| serial-s01-e10 |	For 5 days early
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:19,328	| serial-s01-e10 |	Jasmine
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:24,192	| serial-s01-e10 |	How do you make sure because now there are new
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:28,032	| serial-s01-e10 |	The first very first
EDL	00:28:28,032	00:28:28,544	| serial-s01-e10 |	Interest
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:33,152	| serial-s01-e10 |	Occur at a time
EDL	00:28:34,688	00:28:36,480	| serial-s01-e10 |	But never starts
EDL	00:28:38,528	00:28:41,088	| serial-s01-e10 |	And I'm sad agitation
EDL	00:28:43,648	00:28:45,696	| serial-s01-e10 |	Did you tell me the Crouton 13
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:54,400	| serial-s01-e10 |	Then your second interview after the tape recorder
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:55,424	| serial-s01-e10 |	Scott's room
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,776	| serial-s01-e10 |	It's at our maker level 30
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:01,056	| serial-s01-e10 |	Snowman
EDL	00:29:01,056	00:29:01,568	| serial-s01-e10 |	Is
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:07,456	| serial-s01-e10 |	15th of March
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:12,064	| serial-s01-e10 |	You tell me her number
EDL	00:29:12,832	00:29:13,600	| serial-s01-e10 |	I believe so
EDL	00:29:14,624	00:29:18,976	| serial-s01-e10 |	Closer to you recall the 15th of March
EDL	00:29:19,488	00:29:23,072	| serial-s01-e10 |	You told them that Adnan
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:27,168	| serial-s01-e10 |	Told you he was going to kill that b****
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,568	| serial-s01-e10 |	You actually told them
EDL	00:29:33,568	00:29:34,848	| serial-s01-e10 |	But you knew
EDL	00:29:34,848	00:29:37,664	| serial-s01-e10 |	A whole day ahead of time
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,712	| serial-s01-e10 |	Good Adams
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,088	| serial-s01-e10 |	This evening it spoke to me
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:47,904	| serial-s01-e10 |	No
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:51,488	| serial-s01-e10 |	Something just happened
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:58,144	| serial-s01-e10 |	Just admitted something or didn't admit something but I honestly can't tell if it's a point for the defense
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:29:58,912	| serial-s01-e10 |	Or for the process
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:29:59,680	| serial-s01-e10 |	Iqushion
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:00,448	| serial-s01-e10 |	Or if it's a draw
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:03,008	| serial-s01-e10 |	Stretches like this
EDL	00:30:03,520	00:30:09,920	| serial-s01-e10 |	14 dozen for cross-examination went so far into the weeds it was hard even for me reading it years later
EDL	00:30:09,920	00:30:11,712	| serial-s01-e10 |	The hack back to the main trail
EDL	00:30:12,224	00:30:15,040	| serial-s01-e10 |	A juror that Dana interviewed a guy named Sue.
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:18,624	| serial-s01-e10 |	Said Christina strategy was a little lost on them to
EDL	00:30:19,136	00:30:20,672	| serial-s01-e10 |	50 Frontage Rd
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:24,256	| serial-s01-e10 |	Everybody has been a long time ago but everybody was
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:28,096	| serial-s01-e10 |	Disco Converse
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,960	| serial-s01-e10 |	Startup making a point
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:34,240	| serial-s01-e10 |	So they were just like a lot of words
EDL	00:30:35,264	00:30:36,032	| serial-s01-e10 |	Bright
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:38,592	| serial-s01-e10 |	He talked and talked and didn't prove anything
EDL	00:30:39,872	00:30:44,480	| serial-s01-e10 |	I think there's a good chance though that Christina leaves these threads hanging for a reason
EDL	00:30:44,992	00:30:46,784	| serial-s01-e10 |	Was another defense attorney explain to me
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:52,160	| serial-s01-e10 |	During cross-examination you don't want a tie each point up in a bow in the moment
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:53,952	| serial-s01-e10 |	You don't want to tip your hand
EDL	00:30:53,952	00:30:59,584	| serial-s01-e10 |	Because any other side might come back with questions on redirect examination that could undo what you've just laid out
EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,632	| serial-s01-e10 |	So you save all the threads
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:03,936	| serial-s01-e10 |	And then tie them up in a nice
EDL	00:31:03,936	00:31:05,984	| serial-s01-e10 |	Fat unassailable
EDL	00:31:05,984	00:31:08,288	| serial-s01-e10 |	Closing after all the testifying is over
EDL	00:31:09,312	00:31:12,640	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina does revisit J's testimony at her closing
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:14,176	| serial-s01-e10 |	The gist of which is
EDL	00:31:14,176	00:31:17,504	| serial-s01-e10 |	The detectives arrested in on because of what Jay told them
EDL	00:31:17,504	00:31:19,296	| serial-s01-e10 |	And what was it
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:19,808	| serial-s01-e10 |	True
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,880	| serial-s01-e10 |	And you lied to them about many many things
EDL	00:31:23,392	00:31:26,208	| serial-s01-e10 |	It wasn't just that things didn't match up they were lies
EDL	00:31:26,208	00:31:27,488	| serial-s01-e10 |	They called them lies
EDL	00:31:27,488	00:31:28,512	| serial-s01-e10 |	Call demise
EDL	00:31:29,024	00:31:31,584	| serial-s01-e10 |	On the 15th of March on the 18th of March
EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:34,400	| serial-s01-e10 |	On the 13th of April every single time lies
EDL	00:31:34,912	00:31:35,424	| serial-s01-e10 |	Unquote
EDL	00:31:36,448	00:31:40,032	| serial-s01-e10 |	Clearly Christina put a ton of time and effort into discrediting J
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,824	| serial-s01-e10 |	But the fact is
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:42,848	| serial-s01-e10 |	The jurors believed him
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:45,664	| serial-s01-e10 |	Didn't think you'd be sitting there talking about this if it weren't true
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:48,480	| serial-s01-e10 |	She was less rigorous on other ask
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:49,504	| serial-s01-e10 |	McKay's
EDL	00:31:50,016	00:31:51,040	| serial-s01-e10 |	The cell phone wreck

EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:19,264	| serial-s01-e10 |	He says he called the office of the public defender to try to see if he could get himself a lawyer
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:22,080	| serial-s01-e10 |	And they told him unless you've been charged we can't help you

EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:27,712	| serial-s01-e10 |	So Jay says the next thing that happens is the cops come to see him on September 6th
EDL	00:34:27,712	00:34:30,784	| serial-s01-e10 |	And tell him he's about to be charged with accessory after the fact

EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:54,592	| serial-s01-e10 |	Talk privately for a while then they sign a plea agreement
EDL	00:34:54,592	00:34:59,712	| serial-s01-e10 |	That same day they all go across the street to the courthouse and resent the signed plea to a judge

EDL	00:35:35,552	00:35:38,880	| serial-s01-e10 |	To the state Christina argues that's what's called a benefit
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:39,904	| serial-s01-e10 |	It's worth money
EDL	00:35:39,904	00:35:46,304	| serial-s01-e10 |	And it could look like JS being paid by the state for his testimony
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:47,072	| serial-s01-e10 |	Tennis benefits
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:48,864	| serial-s01-e10 |	And therefore might lie to please them
EDL	00:35:49,632	00:35:51,936	| serial-s01-e10 |	And if it could look like that she says
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:57,056	| serial-s01-e10 |	The defense was entitled to know about it before the second trial or the first trial began
EDL	00:35:57,824	00:36:00,128	| serial-s01-e10 |	And here she was learning about it at this late date
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:03,712	| serial-s01-e10 |	That she said was a violation of the rules of discovery
EDL	00:36:04,736	00:36:05,504	| serial-s01-e10 |	She sounds
EDL	00:36:05,504	00:36:06,528	| serial-s01-e10 |	So mad
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,832	| serial-s01-e10 |	The jury is not present for this ranting by the way
EDL	00:36:08,832	00:36:12,160	| serial-s01-e10 |	But probably she was also giddy with Gaucho excitement
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:15,232	| serial-s01-e10 |	She told the judge this is so patently improper
EDL	00:36:15,232	00:36:20,864	| serial-s01-e10 |	Jehovah Witness who has this benefit and they feel indebted
EDL	00:36:21,632	00:36:27,520	| serial-s01-e10 |	In a way that may affect what are you trying to fight to provide a lawyer

EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:34,432	| serial-s01-e10 |	Once you getting into this Christina did not let go
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:36,992	| serial-s01-e10 |	She wanted to rest from it everything she could
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,040	| serial-s01-e10 |	Maybe a mistrial maybe some other relief
EDL	00:36:39,552	00:36:42,368	| serial-s01-e10 |	They spent hours on this issue over several days of
EDL	00:36:42,368	00:36:44,928	| serial-s01-e10 |	The trial sometimes in front of the jury sometimes not
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:47,232	| serial-s01-e10 |	I called Benaroya about this
EDL	00:36:47,232	00:36:53,376	| serial-s01-e10 |	To find out if it was true that your exhaust her out and that the first time she met Jay was in eurex office
EDL	00:36:53,376	00:36:55,168	| serial-s01-e10 |	On the same day to sign the plea agreement
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:59,008	| serial-s01-e10 |	She said no it could not have happened that way absolutely not

EDL	00:37:17,184	00:37:19,744	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina that this Arrangement looked fishy at Bass
EDL	00:37:20,512	00:37:21,792	| serial-s01-e10 |	She was not happy about it
EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:23,328	| serial-s01-e10 |	But she also said
EDL	00:37:23,840	00:37:25,120	| serial-s01-e10 |	The witness in question
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:25,888	| serial-s01-e10 |	What is Jay

EDL	00:40:59,648	00:41:06,048	| serial-s01-e10 |	Despite her Stellar reputation though it does seem as if something not right was happening with Christina around this

EDL	00:41:31,904	00:41:36,000	| serial-s01-e10 |	Kristina's bedside manner at least with them lacked a certain Delica
EDL	00:41:36,000	00:41:38,304	| serial-s01-e10 |	She said they were both intimidated by her
EDL	00:41:38,816	00:41:42,400	| serial-s01-e10 |	And they could never get her to talk to them about another case or what was going on
EDL	00:41:42,912	00:41:47,520	| serial-s01-e10 |	And she said she thought Christina had lost some of her magic in the courtroom by the second trial
EDL	00:41:48,032	00:41:49,312	| serial-s01-e10 |	But you seem sort of agitated
EDL	00:41:50,336	00:41:56,223	| serial-s01-e10 |	So another time she would be smoking in and out in and she was very nervous kind of person before she wasn't like that the first try
EDL	00:41:57,247	00:42:00,831	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina initially asked for $50,000 to represent of non

EDL	00:42:12,607	00:42:15,679	| serial-s01-e10 |	If they managed to get Christina on the phone or in a meeting
EDL	00:42:15,679	00:42:17,471	| serial-s01-e10 |	Jim said the only topic would be money
EDL	00:42:17,983	00:42:18,495	| serial-s01-e10 |	Money money
EDL	00:42:20,031	00:42:25,919	| serial-s01-e10 |	At one point she says Christina told her parents she needed them to bring her $10,000 cash.

EDL	00:42:37,951	00:42:41,535	| serial-s01-e10 |	How could you even fit $10,000

EDL	00:42:44,351	00:42:47,935	| serial-s01-e10 |	This supposed to take the chick like you know but you said no bring you the cash already
EDL	00:42:48,447	00:42:51,263	| serial-s01-e10 |	Was that the only time that she asked for cash
EDL	00:42:51,263	00:42:52,287	| serial-s01-e10 |	Yes yes butterfish
EDL	00:42:53,823	00:42:54,335	| serial-s01-e10 |	Yes
EDL	00:42:55,103	00:42:56,895	| serial-s01-e10 |	She never hire the expert
EDL	00:42:57,663	00:43:04,063	| serial-s01-e10 |	Stream sister came another time for the end when Christina insisted in on parents owed her money and that you could take their house
EDL	00:43:04,063	00:43:05,087	| serial-s01-e10 |	House if they didn't pay up
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:07,647	| serial-s01-e10 |	They said they had paid her for everything
EDL	00:43:08,159	00:43:11,231	| serial-s01-e10 |	They're so scared they transfer their house into their oldest son's name
EDL	00:43:12,511	00:43:17,631	| serial-s01-e10 |	I bring all this up because my parents were not the only ones who had dealings like this with Christina
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:21,471	| serial-s01-e10 |	I spoke to another couple Ron and Sue Whitman

EDL	00:43:47,327	00:43:51,935	| serial-s01-e10 |	I can't even begin to imagine but anyway they seek out Christina because she's been recommended to them
EDL	00:43:52,447	00:43:54,239	| serial-s01-e10 |	And they write about her Defense work in the paper
EDL	00:43:55,263	00:43:56,799	| serial-s01-e10 |	The first was great they said
EDL	00:43:56,799	00:43:59,871	| serial-s01-e10 |	She successfully argued a couple of important pretrial motions
EDL	00:44:00,383	00:44:02,687	| serial-s01-e10 |	Ron Whitman said she was magnificent in the courtroom
EDL	00:44:03,455	00:44:05,759	| serial-s01-e10 |	That is timing on singstar to get weird
EDL	00:44:06,271	00:44:08,831	| serial-s01-e10 |	This is around the same time she was working on a Nas case

EDL	00:44:46,207	00:44:47,999	| serial-s01-e10 |	Didn't even have time to park the car
EDL	00:44:53,375	00:44:56,191	| serial-s01-e10 |	The women's talk about many of the same things to me and told me
EDL	00:44:56,703	00:44:58,495	| serial-s01-e10 |	But they couldn't get a hold of Christina
EDL	00:44:59,007	00:45:02,591	| serial-s01-e10 |	Or saw that things were getting done but when they ask people who're
EDL	00:45:02,591	00:45:04,127	| serial-s01-e10 |	They were told don't push it
EDL	00:45:04,127	00:45:04,895	| serial-s01-e10 |	It'll be fine
EDL	00:45:05,663	00:45:06,431	| serial-s01-e10 |	Here's to women

EDL	00:45:17,183	00:45:17,951	| serial-s01-e10 |	Don't worry about it
EDL	00:45:18,719	00:45:19,487	| serial-s01-e10 |	So

EDL	00:45:25,631	00:45:27,423	| serial-s01-e10 |	Then you think that this is just your way
EDL	00:45:28,191	00:45:29,727	| serial-s01-e10 |	Has it got worse and worse
EDL	00:45:30,751	00:45:33,567	| serial-s01-e10 |	Announce trial ended in late February of 2000
EDL	00:45:34,079	00:45:37,151	| serial-s01-e10 |	By the end of that same year Christina had been hospitalized

EDL	00:45:45,087	00:45:47,647	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina would sneak cigarettes in the bathroom
EDL	00:45:48,671	00:45:49,439	| serial-s01-e10 |	Another words
EDL	00:45:49,439	00:45:50,207	| serial-s01-e10 |	She was still at it
EDL	00:45:50,719	00:45:52,255	| serial-s01-e10 |	And maybe she shouldn't have been
EDL	00:45:53,535	00:45:58,399	| serial-s01-e10 |	Robin says it should have been clear to everyone around her that Christina couldn't keep up with her cases
EDL	00:45:58,399	00:45:59,679	| serial-s01-e10 |	But no one cried uncle
EDL	00:46:00,447	00:46:01,727	| serial-s01-e10 |	Ultimately in
EDL	00:46:01,727	00:46:05,055	| serial-s01-e10 |	January of 2001 if I have my ears correct
EDL	00:46:06,079	00:46:07,615	| serial-s01-e10 |	We had a

EDL	00:46:23,231	00:46:23,999	| serial-s01-e10 |	I called him
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,303	| serial-s01-e10 |	And he said I am
EDL	00:46:26,303	00:46:28,351	| serial-s01-e10 |	Talk to Tina about your son's case for urine

EDL	00:46:33,727	00:46:39,871	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina asked them for an additional $65,000 for work she had to know full well she couldn't do
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:43,711	| serial-s01-e10 |	That they gave her $25,000 for an expert
EDL	00:46:43,711	00:46:44,991	| serial-s01-e10 |	The Christina never paid the guy
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:46,527	| serial-s01-e10 |	So he came to them for the money
EDL	00:46:47,295	00:46:49,855	| serial-s01-e10 |	They said it happened with a second expert 2 for $2,000
EDL	00:46:50,879	00:46:54,463	| serial-s01-e10 |	If she was too sick why didn't she tell them why did she leave them hanging
EDL	00:46:55,999	00:47:00,607	| serial-s01-e10 |	Kristina's career had collapsed by the spring of 2001 A year after announced trial ended

EDL	00:47:05,215	00:47:08,543	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina got in trouble with the attorney grievance Commission of Maryland
EDL	00:47:09,311	00:47:15,199	| serial-s01-e10 |	Clients were complaining that you taken their money ahead not done the work she promised or not used it the way she said she would
EDL	00:47:15,967	00:47:19,807	| serial-s01-e10 |	The state fund that compensates people when their lawyers will choose their money
EDL	00:47:19,807	00:47:24,415	| serial-s01-e10 |	Total of $282,328
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:26,207	| serial-s01-e10 |	128 claims against
EDL	00:47:26,207	00:47:26,719	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina
EDL	00:47:27,231	00:47:28,767	| serial-s01-e10 |	The largest payout was to the Whitman
EDL	00:47:31,583	00:47:33,631	| serial-s01-e10 |	So she was lying to them
EDL	00:47:34,143	00:47:35,935	| serial-s01-e10 |	Try to get as much money out of them as she could
EDL	00:47:36,447	00:47:40,287	| serial-s01-e10 |	More generous assessment would be that Christina was in denial about how sick she was
EDL	00:47:41,055	00:47:45,151	| serial-s01-e10 |	They're told me she was never much interested in the business side of things
EDL	00:47:45,151	00:47:46,175	| serial-s01-e10 |	Wasn't her forte
EDL	00:47:47,199	00:47:52,319	| serial-s01-e10 |	One former law partner of Christina's told the Whitman's that Christina had been slipping for a while
EDL	00:47:52,831	00:47:54,111	| serial-s01-e10 |	The past 5 years
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:54,623	| serial-s01-e10 |	This event
EDL	00:48:02,303	00:48:06,143	| serial-s01-e10 |	There's been a lot of news stories this week that it has gotten an appeal
EDL	00:48:06,143	00:48:07,679	| serial-s01-e10 |	That's not quite true
EDL	00:48:07,679	00:48:09,983	| serial-s01-e10 |	He had an initial appeal which was denied
EDL	00:48:10,495	00:48:12,799	| serial-s01-e10 |	And he had a hearing for post-conviction relief
EDL	00:48:13,311	00:48:14,079	| serial-s01-e10 |	Also denied
EDL	00:48:14,591	00:48:18,943	| serial-s01-e10 |	But he appealed to a higher Court the Maryland Court of special Appeals
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:23,551	| serial-s01-e10 |	Recently. Court order the states responded to one aspect of a nun's petition
EDL	00:48:24,063	00:48:25,087	| serial-s01-e10 |	By January 14th
EDL	00:48:25,599	00:48:27,391	| serial-s01-e10 |	So it is still alive
EDL	00:48:27,391	00:48:28,159	| serial-s01-e10 |	Buy thread
EDL	00:48:29,439	00:48:33,535	| serial-s01-e10 |	Announce petition is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel
EDL	00:48:33,535	00:48:35,327	| serial-s01-e10 |	Meaning Christina Gutierrez screwed up
EDL	00:48:35,839	00:48:37,887	| serial-s01-e10 |	The front of the claim is about Asia McClain
EDL	00:48:38,399	00:48:41,471	| serial-s01-e10 |	But she might have provided an alibi for a. At trial if
EDL	00:48:41,471	00:48:41,983	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina had talked
EDL	00:48:43,263	00:48:48,383	| serial-s01-e10 |	But the part of petition that the higher Court wants the state to answer is actually about a different complaint
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:52,991	| serial-s01-e10 |	Had to ask Christina to seek a plea deal
EDL	00:48:52,991	00:48:54,015	| serial-s01-e10 |	Twice he.
EDL	00:48:54,015	00:48:55,295	| serial-s01-e10 |	Christina never did it
EDL	00:48:56,319	00:48:59,135	| serial-s01-e10 |	Prosecutors in an ounce case said they never made an offer
EDL	00:48:59,647	00:49:01,695	| serial-s01-e10 |	Kristina also didn't sequin
EDL	00:49:01,695	00:49:03,231	| serial-s01-e10 |	Even though Adnan says he asked
EDL	00:49:03,231	00:49:03,999	| serial-s01-e10 |	Assertive
EDL	00:49:03,999	00:49:06,559	| serial-s01-e10 |	Once before his first trial and was before the second
EDL	00:49:08,351	00:49:10,143	| serial-s01-e10 |	When I first read his petition
EDL	00:49:10,143	00:49:12,703	| serial-s01-e10 |	I told him that I found it hard to believe he'd asked
EDL	00:49:12,703	00:49:13,215	| serial-s01-e10 |	Cordial
EDL	00:49:13,727	00:49:16,287	| serial-s01-e10 |	He's been so unshakable for 15 years
EDL	00:49:16,287	00:49:17,311	| serial-s01-e10 |	What is anacin
EDL	00:49:17,311	00:49:19,103	| serial-s01-e10 |	Nothing to do with his death
EDL	00:49:19,615	00:49:22,431	| serial-s01-e10 |	It also seemed to me as if he trusted back then
EDL	00:49:22,431	00:49:24,223	| serial-s01-e10 |	That the system was sort all this out
EDL	00:49:24,223	00:49:24,991	| serial-s01-e10 |	He go home
EDL	00:49:26,271	00:49:27,039	| serial-s01-e10 |	Renown told me
EDL	00:49:27,551	00:49:29,343	| serial-s01-e10 |	There were times when he was really scared
EDL	00:49:29,855	00:49:31,647	| serial-s01-e10 |	He was trying to be brave for his family
EDL	00:49:32,159	00:49:37,279	| serial-s01-e10 |	But then keep your stories or watch guys he knew get 50 year 70 year life sentence
EDL	00:49:38,047	00:49:39,071	| serial-s01-e10 |	And it would hit him
EDL	00:49:39,071	00:49:40,863	| serial-s01-e10 |	I could be in prison for the rest of my life
EDL	00:49:42,655	00:49:44,959	| serial-s01-e10 |	It is so difficult
EDL	00:49:44,959	00:49:45,983	| serial-s01-e10 |	Not ever having
EDL	00:49:45,983	00:49:47,007	| serial-s01-e10 |	Been in that situation
EDL	00:49:47,519	00:49:50,079	| serial-s01-e10 |	Like I would always think before I ever came to jail
EDL	00:49:52,127	00:49:53,407	| serial-s01-e10 |	Because they did it
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:55,199	| serial-s01-e10 |	You know no way would a person ever plead guilty
EDL	00:49:56,223	00:49:57,503	| serial-s01-e10 |	What you coming to like
EDL	00:49:57,503	00:49:58,271	| serial-s01-e10 |	This whole system
EDL	00:49:59,039	00:50:00,319	| serial-s01-e10 |	What time does she really learned is that
EDL	00:50:02,367	00:50:04,927	| serial-s01-e10 |	1st degree Murder cases
EDL	00:50:04,927	00:50:06,463	| serial-s01-e10 |	It's almost impossible
EDL	00:50:06,975	00:50:11,071	| serial-s01-e10 |	I can pick an all years in prison I can fly think of a handful of people
EDL	00:50:11,071	00:50:12,863	| serial-s01-e10 |	Whoever beat the first-degree murder case
EDL	00:50:13,375	00:50:16,191	| serial-s01-e10 |	Against you
EDL	00:50:17,215	00:50:18,751	| serial-s01-e10 |	Are people that like I've met
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:21,055	| serial-s01-e10 |	I know and I'm so jealous of them
EDL	00:50:21,567	00:50:25,663	| serial-s01-e10 |	In a good way because when we were over the jail or city jail
EDL	00:50:26,175	00:50:28,735	| serial-s01-e10 |	A lawyer's advice and looking at you taking a life
EDL	00:50:28,735	00:50:32,831	| serial-s01-e10 |	Dependable 30 years life suspended for 20 years whether you did it or not
EDL	00:50:32,831	00:50:34,879	| serial-s01-e10 |	Because the way the elements of the case are
EDL	00:50:34,879	00:50:35,647	| serial-s01-e10 |	You know
EDL	00:50:35,647	00:50:37,951	| serial-s01-e10 |	You don't have like a strong alibi
EDL	00:50:37,951	00:50:42,047	| serial-s01-e10 |	Could you have someone coming to court saying that you did it whether you did it or not
EDL	00:50:42,047	00:50:46,911	| serial-s01-e10 |	You going to go in front of a jury and tell people to panic because they have never sat in your shoes before
EDL	00:50:46,911	00:50:48,959	| serial-s01-e10 |	So it's really important that you have in a life sentence
EDL	00:50:49,471	00:50:51,007	| serial-s01-e10 |	First choice if you have in my life
EDL	00:50:51,519	00:50:55,615	| serial-s01-e10 |	Because now I still communicate with some of these guys are actually getting ready to go home
EDL	00:50:55,615	00:50:57,151	| serial-s01-e10 |	1516 years later
EDL	00:50:58,687	00:51:03,551	| serial-s01-e10 |	Annonces when he seen younger guys come in on parole violations or for whatever reason
EDL	00:51:04,063	00:51:05,087	| serial-s01-e10 |	He tells them
EDL	00:51:05,087	00:51:06,111	| serial-s01-e10 |	Take the deal
EDL	00:51:06,111	00:51:07,903	| serial-s01-e10 |	Regardless of whether you did it
EDL	00:51:07,903	00:51:08,671	| serial-s01-e10 |	Take the deal
EDL	00:51:11,231	00:51:13,791	| serial-s01-e10 |	Because of non has maintained his innocence
EDL	00:51:13,791	00:51:16,863	| serial-s01-e10 |	He's got no hope of getting out or very little hope
EDL	00:51:17,375	00:51:18,399	| serial-s01-e10 |	That's how the system works
EDL	00:51:18,911	00:51:20,191	| serial-s01-e10 |	I understand that now
EDL	00:51:22,751	00:51:23,519	| serial-s01-e10 |	Parole
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:28,383	| serial-s01-e10 |	But the chances of getting it are so slim for anyone with a life sentence for first-degree murder
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:30,687	| serial-s01-e10 |	But especially if you don't show remorse
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:32,735	| serial-s01-e10 |	Because
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:34,783	| serial-s01-e10 |	You know what is a psychopath right
