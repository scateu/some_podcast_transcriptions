EDL	00:00:54,784	00:00:55,552	| serial-s03-e05 |	Okay
EDL	00:00:56,064	00:00:59,904	| serial-s03-e05 |	Previously on serial
EDL	00:00:59,904	00:01:04,768	| serial-s03-e05 |	The tallest jury shot this little boy and not be afraid anymore sir
EDL	00:01:04,768	00:01:08,608	| serial-s03-e05 |	The defense attorney came to me at the first pre-trial that you're going to dismiss this
EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:10,656	| serial-s03-e05 |	You sir are going to be looking
EDL	00:01:12,704	00:01:19,104	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is me all the way up like every time I go outside I just look at everybody diff
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:21,664	| serial-s03-e05 |	But you know what happened but you won't say nothing
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:24,224	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't think that's what happened
EDL	00:01:24,224	00:01:27,040	| serial-s03-e05 |	He said that's why you're getting out
EDL	00:01:29,088	00:01:35,488	| serial-s03-e05 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago
EDL	00:01:35,488	00:01:41,888	| serial-s03-e05 |	Serial one Courthouse told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig this is one of those cases
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:47,008	| serial-s03-e05 |	That is so puzzling because so many people are so certain of
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:51,360	| serial-s03-e05 |	What is our who is involved and we just have no way of knowing
EDL	00:01:51,872	00:01:54,688	| serial-s03-e05 |	What it is and what it isn't in
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:58,272	| serial-s03-e05 |	Yeah one breakage and all that one break a change at all
EDL	00:01:59,040	00:02:01,088	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is a prosecutor named Brian Radigan
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:05,696	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's talking about the aavielle Wakefield case the one where the baby was shot in the car
EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:12,608	| serial-s03-e05 |	Get another prosecutor in charge of that case they're the ones who saw 13 count indictment against Avon homes
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:15,680	| serial-s03-e05 |	They're the ones who argued a year later to let him go
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,984	| serial-s03-e05 |	Eddie Cibrian
EDL	00:02:17,984	00:02:21,312	| serial-s03-e05 |	But they haven't solved it like why why does it have to be this one
EDL	00:02:22,080	00:02:23,872	| serial-s03-e05 |	Why does it have to be the five
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,384	| serial-s03-e05 |	Gold
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:27,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	When I asked to interview someone about ivl's case
EDL	00:02:27,968	00:02:30,528	| serial-s03-e05 |	The County prosecutor's office easily could have said
EDL	00:02:30,528	00:02:33,088	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is still an open investigation we can't comment
EDL	00:02:33,856	00:02:34,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	But they did not do that
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:37,184	| serial-s03-e05 |	Instead they give me Bryan
EDL	00:02:37,184	00:02:38,720	| serial-s03-e05 |	And Brian told me a lot
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:42,560	| serial-s03-e05 |	I went to Brian chiefly to find out why the case fell apart
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:45,120	| serial-s03-e05 |	Did they release Davon Holmes because of Sumter
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:45,888	| serial-s03-e05 |	Kalaty
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:48,192	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or did they release him because wrong guy
EDL	00:02:48,960	00:02:52,032	| serial-s03-e05 |	First responder the reasons they thought it was Davon to begin with
EDL	00:02:52,800	00:02:55,360	| serial-s03-e05 |	Initially they had anonymous tips that it was Davon
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:58,688	| serial-s03-e05 |	People who said this is what I know but you didn't hear from me
EDL	00:02:59,200	00:02:59,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	Just said
EDL	00:02:59,968	00:03:06,112	| serial-s03-e05 |	Now this my information you'll never find me if you bring me in a court or if you try to put me on paper record me I'll deny that I ever
EDL	00:03:07,648	00:03:10,208	| serial-s03-e05 |	But you don't meet me in this park at
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:11,488	| serial-s03-e05 |	And I'll tell you
EDL	00:03:11,488	00:03:13,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean really like the stuff you see in the movies
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:15,328	| serial-s03-e05 |	In the movies that's exciting
EDL	00:03:15,840	00:03:16,608	| serial-s03-e05 |	In real life
EDL	00:03:16,608	00:03:17,120	| serial-s03-e05 |	Not so great
EDL	00:03:17,888	00:03:23,264	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian said he was hoping to persuade one or two of those people to become Witnesses by the time the trial rolled around
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:30,688	| serial-s03-e05 |	They have the jailhouse statement from that guy who I'm calling John the guy who'd known Davon since he was little brothers were friends
EDL	00:03:31,200	00:03:35,808	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian told me more about what John said he also told me they didn't really find it credible
EDL	00:03:35,808	00:03:41,184	| serial-s03-e05 |	Since some of the other people John had mentioned in his statement didn't seem to have a connection to Davon
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:42,720	| serial-s03-e05 |	Are older one thing
EDL	00:03:42,720	00:03:48,352	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian's office was also looking into the guy obvious father thought was responsible for the shooting
EDL	00:03:48,864	00:03:51,168	| serial-s03-e05 |	But they didn't have enough evidence to charge him with anything
EDL	00:03:51,680	00:03:56,800	| serial-s03-e05 |	And Avon they also had his cell phone records putting in the neighborhood at the time
EDL	00:03:56,800	00:04:03,200	| serial-s03-e05 |	His own neighborhood they also had a statement to the detective sandwich he said he'd been up the street at the Family Dollar when it has
EDL	00:04:03,200	00:04:06,272	| serial-s03-e05 |	Davon told me he'd never made
EDL	00:04:06,272	00:04:07,808	| serial-s03-e05 |	I didn't add up to much
EDL	00:04:08,832	00:04:10,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	But then they got the landscapers ID
EDL	00:04:11,392	00:04:16,256	| serial-s03-e05 |	The landscaper remember was the guy who finally chose de Vons picture out of a photo array
EDL	00:04:16,256	00:04:19,071	| serial-s03-e05 |	Third time around almost two months after the shooting
EDL	00:04:19,839	00:04:23,423	| serial-s03-e05 |	As I thought it was the landscapers ID that made the prosecutors
EDL	00:04:23,423	00:04:24,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	Feel comfortable
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:26,751	| serial-s03-e05 |	Like they're looking at the right person
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:30,079	| serial-s03-e05 |	Landscaper came off as genuine believable
EDL	00:04:30,079	00:04:33,151	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian told me the landscaper he came to them
EDL	00:04:33,151	00:04:35,199	| serial-s03-e05 |	He showed up one day at the Justice Center
EDL	00:04:35,199	00:04:37,247	| serial-s03-e05 |	For the elevator up to the 9th floor
EDL	00:04:37,247	00:04:38,783	| serial-s03-e05 |	Tilapia the prosecutor's office
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:41,087	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian gets a call at his desk
EDL	00:04:41,087	00:04:43,135	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is a guy says he wants to talk to you
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:50,047	| serial-s03-e05 |	So I show up to the front I say Hi how are you in on the interviews myself and he says I've got some information I want to talk to somebody about
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:53,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	So I call the homicide unit I didn't talk to him again
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:57,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	We want to be Witnesses so I call the homicide unit they come over here they pick him up
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:58,239	| serial-s03-e05 |	And they talked to him
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,055	| serial-s03-e05 |	And when they're talking to him
EDL	00:05:02,591	00:05:04,383	| serial-s03-e05 |	There was
EDL	00:05:04,383	00:05:06,431	| serial-s03-e05 |	There was a belief at the beginning
EDL	00:05:06,943	00:05:07,455	| serial-s03-e05 |	From
EDL	00:05:07,967	00:05:11,807	| serial-s03-e05 |	The officers handling the case that this guy knows who it is but
EDL	00:05:11,807	00:05:12,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's not going to pick him up
EDL	00:05:13,599	00:05:16,159	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian says this guy it was like a lot of witnesses they deal with
EDL	00:05:16,671	00:05:18,207	| serial-s03-e05 |	Wanting to do the right thing
EDL	00:05:18,207	00:05:19,487	| serial-s03-e05 |	Afraid to do the right thing
EDL	00:05:20,255	00:05:20,767	| serial-s03-e05 |	Waffling
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:22,303	| serial-s03-e05 |	She came down here
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:26,655	| serial-s03-e05 |	A number of times and contacted the homicide unit or number of time saying
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:28,191	| serial-s03-e05 |	Listen I'm
EDL	00:05:28,191	00:05:32,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	I wanted to do this I wanted to come forward but I do not want to come to court
EDL	00:05:32,031	00:05:34,079	| serial-s03-e05 |	I do not want to testify
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:37,919	| serial-s03-e05 |	I got kids he talked to us he wanted us to move them out of
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:44,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	Where he was living because he was afraid of living in the neighborhood Evelyn and
EDL	00:05:44,831	00:05:48,671	| serial-s03-e05 |	But he wasn't but he still was working in that neighborhood afterwards and in those have been so he had
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,719	| serial-s03-e05 |	Kid his own concerns
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:51,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	But I think if
EDL	00:05:52,511	00:05:55,071	| serial-s03-e05 |	If you ask him again he would still believe that
EDL	00:05:55,071	00:05:56,351	| serial-s03-e05 |	Devon Holmes was the one
EDL	00:05:56,351	00:05:58,655	| serial-s03-e05 |	And do you think David Holmes is the one
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:00,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	I I think that there was
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:02,751	| serial-s03-e05 |	Pretty strong evidence
EDL	00:06:02,751	00:06:03,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	That we found
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,079	| serial-s03-e05 |	During the course of this and
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	That he was not
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:08,895	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's not
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:12,991	| serial-s03-e05 |	Now we turn to part two of our conversation
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,807	| serial-s03-e05 |	What made the case against Davon collapse
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:20,159	| serial-s03-e05 |	No I just want to know the amount of evidence Brian had laid out
EDL	00:06:20,159	00:06:22,719	| serial-s03-e05 |	Does not seem like it should be enough to take a person to
EDL	00:06:22,719	00:06:23,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	Trial for aggravated murder
EDL	00:06:24,511	00:06:26,559	| serial-s03-e05 |	Much less convince a jury to convict
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,839	| serial-s03-e05 |	A person of aggravated murder
EDL	00:06:28,607	00:06:29,631	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it is enough
EDL	00:06:30,143	00:06:32,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	Nothing would have been a slam dunk for the state but
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:35,519	| serial-s03-e05 |	Assuming a landscaper showed up to court and testify
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:38,847	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's not far-fetched to think Davon might have been convicted
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:41,151	| serial-s03-e05 |	Easily could have gone down for this murder
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:44,223	| serial-s03-e05 |	What about a month before the trial was supposed to
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:44,991	| serial-s03-e05 |	Start
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:50,623	| serial-s03-e05 |	They were made aware he doesn't want to say exactly how but they were made aware of a phone call
EDL	00:06:51,135	00:06:52,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	And exonerating phone call
EDL	00:06:53,183	00:06:57,535	| serial-s03-e05 |	We had some evidence of somebody else that we believe is involved in the case
EDL	00:06:58,047	00:07:00,095	| serial-s03-e05 |	On a recording that they didn't know
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:01,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	Was being recorded
EDL	00:07:01,631	00:07:02,399	| serial-s03-e05 |	Saying that
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	Devon was not there
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:08,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	Was it because I asked him to get a job
EDL	00:07:08,543	00:07:09,311	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was not
EDL	00:07:09,823	00:07:10,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was not
EDL	00:07:12,383	00:07:15,455	| serial-s03-e05 |	Again Brian didn't want to divulge too much about this recording
EDL	00:07:15,967	00:07:19,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	He thinks that if this case is ever going to be solved this call might be the key
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,599	| serial-s03-e05 |	Didn't want to say too much about it
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,647	| serial-s03-e05 |	But what surprised me was
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:25,183	| serial-s03-e05 |	It didn't come from the detectives
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:26,975	| serial-s03-e05 |	It didn't come from their side
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:28,511	| serial-s03-e05 |	The most I can say is
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:30,559	| serial-s03-e05 |	The recording came to them
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:35,167	| serial-s03-e05 |	Once it did they all sat down in a conference room in the prosecutor's office
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| serial-s03-e05 |	Defense attorneys Brian the cops
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:39,007	| serial-s03-e05 |	And they listen to this
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:39,519	| serial-s03-e05 |	Call
EDL	00:07:40,287	00:07:43,359	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was between someone who knows and cares for Davon
EDL	00:07:43,359	00:07:45,151	| serial-s03-e05 |	And the young man I'm not going to name
EDL	00:07:45,663	00:07:48,223	| serial-s03-e05 |	In the call nobody identifies the shooter
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:52,063	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it was pretty clear the young man knew what had happened the day I'll be always killed
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:55,647	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian says he understood right away that he had to take it serious
EDL	00:07:56,415	00:07:58,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	When you actually hear somebody say it
EDL	00:07:59,231	00:08:01,535	| serial-s03-e05 |	When they don't know that they're being recorded
EDL	00:08:01,535	00:08:02,815	| serial-s03-e05 |	And that
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:05,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	That changes things
EDL	00:08:06,143	00:08:08,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	They're only a few weeks from trial at this point
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:09,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	Now they scrambled
EDL	00:08:10,495	00:08:13,055	| serial-s03-e05 |	They needed to verify that the recording was real
EDL	00:08:13,055	00:08:15,359	| serial-s03-e05 |	But the people in the car were who they said they were
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:17,151	| serial-s03-e05 |	Not the call itself wasn't theater
EDL	00:08:17,151	00:08:18,687	| serial-s03-e05 |	Manufactured to Spring Davon
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:21,247	| serial-s03-e05 |	Once I did all that they reassess
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:24,063	| serial-s03-e05 |	Do we still think Davon Holmes is the guy
EDL	00:08:24,831	00:08:25,855	| serial-s03-e05 |	They weren't sure
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,623	| serial-s03-e05 |	Maybe not
EDL	00:08:27,391	00:08:28,927	| serial-s03-e05 |	They decided they couldn't proceed
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:30,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	Filed a motion to dismiss
EDL	00:08:31,999	00:08:34,303	| serial-s03-e05 |	The phone call ended the case against Avon
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it also gave Brian new evidence to work
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:39,167	| serial-s03-e05 |	The young man in the recording
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	He sounded involved in some way
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:44,799	| serial-s03-e05 |	Call the detectives he knew in the 4th District
EDL	00:08:44,799	00:08:46,335	| serial-s03-e05 |	Do you know anything about this guy
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:50,175	| serial-s03-e05 |	Funny thing they said is matter of fact we're looking at him for a carjacking
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,711	| serial-s03-e05 |	Also for shooting
EDL	00:08:52,479	00:08:55,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian says can you hurry it up chop chop and they do
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,855	| serial-s03-e05 |	Pretty soon that got him in custody
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,647	| serial-s03-e05 |	They charging for the carjacking
EDL	00:08:59,647	00:09:00,927	| serial-s03-e05 |	And for the other shooting
EDL	00:09:00,927	00:09:05,535	| serial-s03-e05 |	Even though these wouldn't normally be cases for Bryan's unit since nobody died
EDL	00:09:05,535	00:09:08,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian prosecute someone tries to get the guy to cooperate
EDL	00:09:09,119	00:09:09,887	| serial-s03-e05 |	Start squeezing it
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:13,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'll help you out on a plea if you help us on the Ave Wakefield case
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:15,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	12 years is better than tape
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:16,799	| serial-s03-e05 |	30 years right
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:18,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	The guy won't talk
EDL	00:09:18,591	00:09:19,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	Don't talk won't talk
EDL	00:09:20,383	00:09:21,663	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian tried for months
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:22,175	| serial-s03-e05 |	Nothing
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	Last fall the guy pleaded guilty in those cases
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:30,111	| serial-s03-e05 |	Tag robbery and attempted murder and was sentenced to 17 years
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:36,511	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian knows that this guy serving time for something entirely else might be the closest Belk
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:38,559	| serial-s03-e05 |	Creep towards Justice and ovules case
EDL	00:09:38,559	00:09:40,095	| serial-s03-e05 |	Kind of sideways Justice
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:46,751	| serial-s03-e05 |	Will Al Capone embrion headset which is a funny thing from to say because Brian looks a lot like a young Al Capone
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:49,567	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's unsatisfying I know
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:52,895	| serial-s03-e05 |	Crime isn't solved that's unsatisfying obviously
EDL	00:09:53,663	00:09:56,735	| serial-s03-e05 |	But also Dave onset accused for a year
EDL	00:09:56,735	00:09:57,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	That shouldn't have happened
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:04,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	The Justice Center about it people said yeah that's a shame at least I corrected it
EDL	00:10:04,415	00:10:10,815	| serial-s03-e05 |	No one was demanding an inquiry into what went wrong or yelling for reform no hand-wringing
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	Bismarck resignation
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:19,007	| serial-s03-e05 |	What you going to do judges say they can't control what cases are prosecutors bring to them prosecutor
EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:25,407	| serial-s03-e05 |	You say they're relying on the detectives detective say their information is only as good as what the public cost up can they help it
EDL	00:10:25,407	00:10:27,711	| serial-s03-e05 |	People lie or withhold
EDL	00:10:27,711	00:10:28,223	| serial-s03-e05 |	I got it
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:31,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	When no one feels fully responsible for the outcome
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:33,599	| serial-s03-e05 |	When blame is spread out and diluted
EDL	00:10:34,111	00:10:36,671	| serial-s03-e05 |	A situation like avons becomes easier to shrug off
EDL	00:10:37,695	00:10:38,719	| serial-s03-e05 |	What are you going to do
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:39,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	Starts to feel like an answer
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:42,047	| serial-s03-e05 |	Rather than an urgent question
EDL	00:10:50,239	00:10:54,335	| serial-s03-e05 |	I ended up spending a bunch of Time with Brian ratigan hanging around while he did his job
EDL	00:10:54,847	00:10:56,383	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because I like them right away
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:00,991	| serial-s03-e05 |	And also because he is one of the most powerful people in the Justice Center
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:02,527	| serial-s03-e05 |	He'd never admit that
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:03,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	Police seized it
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it's true
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:08,159	| serial-s03-e05 |	Prosecutors are the most powerful people in any Courthouse
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:13,023	| serial-s03-e05 |	Defense attorneys will tell you they'd rather have a fair prosecutor and an unfair judge
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:14,815	| serial-s03-e05 |	Been a fair judge and an unfair Prosecco
EDL	00:11:15,839	00:11:20,191	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because of all the people who shape a criminal case the prosecutor has the most discretion
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:24,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	Especially at The crucial beginning when the thing is still germinating
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:27,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	The prosecutors deciding home to charge and with what crimes
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,687	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is also deciding what the plea deal is going to look like
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:36,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	And don't tell the judges in the building but often the prosecutor is more less deciding the sentences people get
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,647	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because of this big Power they hold
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:43,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	Prosecutors of late have been the focus of blame for a lot of the problems in our system
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:45,535	| serial-s03-e05 |	And the focus of Reform effort
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,327	| serial-s03-e05 |	And that's not undeserved
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:49,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	What is incomplete
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:55,263	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mostly prosecutors I've talked to it's not that they're gunning for cheap assembly-line Justice
EDL	00:11:55,263	00:12:00,383	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or for unprecedented discriminatory devastatingly High rates of incarceration
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's that
EDL	00:12:01,407	00:12:02,943	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's the job we've given them
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:07,295	| serial-s03-e05 |	I feel like I can't explain this without telling you some history of how we got here
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:08,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	I want to explain it
EDL	00:12:08,831	00:12:09,599	| serial-s03-e05 |	So here goes
EDL	00:12:11,647	00:12:15,231	| serial-s03-e05 |	Our worst modern era of crime in the US if you look at the FBI stats
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:17,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	Began in the 1960s and 70s
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:22,143	| serial-s03-e05 |	Most people now agree we were under policing and also under incarcerating
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:25,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	And we swanway way the other way
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:29,055	| serial-s03-e05 |	Cops made more arrest which meant more prosecutions
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:35,711	| serial-s03-e05 |	But the huge increase in arrests and charges did not respond to a commensurate increase in the number of prosecutors
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:38,015	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or the number of cops but that's another story
EDL	00:12:39,039	00:12:41,087	| serial-s03-e05 |	This one statistic really hit me
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:42,623	| serial-s03-e05 |	In 1974
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:48,255	| serial-s03-e05 |	They're around 17,000 local prosecutors dealing with around 300,000 felony process
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:49,023	| serial-s03-e05 |	Secretions
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:50,815	| serial-s03-e05 |	By 2007
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:53,887	| serial-s03-e05 |	The number of prosecutors had jumped to about 32000
EDL	00:12:54,399	00:12:59,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	A significant increase but they were dealing with nearly 3 million felony prosecution
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:02,847	| serial-s03-e05 |	A tenfold increase from 1974
EDL	00:13:02,847	00:13:04,127	| serial-s03-e05 |	The upshot
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:11,039	| serial-s03-e05 |	Vastly more prosecutions handled by relatively fewer prosecutors the only way for them to
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:12,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	Keep afloat plea bargains
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:15,391	| serial-s03-e05 |	As1 Cleveland judge said to me
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:19,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	Plea bargaining isn't part of the Criminal Justice System it is the criminal justice system
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:21,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	Kaiser Chiefs
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:24,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	Balita more convictions and to more incarceration
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:32,287	| serial-s03-e05 |	And we've given prosecutors many tools to negotiate these please lots of Forces help this push toward
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,823	| serial-s03-e05 |	Harsher criminal justice
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:37,663	| serial-s03-e05 |	Economic forces the forces of racism and discrimination
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:42,271	| serial-s03-e05 |	Unfortunate US Supreme Court decisions politics and more politics
EDL	00:13:42,783	00:13:45,599	| serial-s03-e05 |	For the one you don't always hear about his legislation
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	In the decades post 1970
EDL	00:13:48,415	00:13:52,767	| serial-s03-e05 |	Most states began revamping their sentencing guidelines and their criminal codes
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:57,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	A lot of crimes are being defined both more broadly and more specifically
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:01,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	Theft fraud burglary robbery assault sexual assault kidnapping
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:03,263	| serial-s03-e05 |	They're definitions expanded
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,311	| serial-s03-e05 |	Which made them harder to defend against
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:09,663	| serial-s03-e05 |	And They Carried more serious penalties same with laws about guns
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:15,807	| serial-s03-e05 |	Especially about drugs expensive criminal codes allow prosecutors to expansively charge
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:22,719	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because a single criminal act doesn't have to be singly charged you can pile on as many charges you want doesn't matter if
EDL	00:14:22,719	00:14:26,559	| serial-s03-e05 |	They overlap so long as each one requires you to prove something slightly different
EDL	00:14:27,071	00:14:31,679	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's how an armed robbery can end up charged S8 felonies
EDL	00:14:31,679	00:14:33,983	| serial-s03-e05 |	It sounds like Echoes bouncing around a canyon
EDL	00:14:34,495	00:14:36,543	| serial-s03-e05 |	Committed theft while having a deadly weapon
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:42,431	| serial-s03-e05 |	Committed theft while having a deadly weapon and either display the weapon brandished it indicated that he possessed it or used it
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:48,063	| serial-s03-e05 |	On top of all that you've got sentence enhancement what are known in Cleveland is Speck
EDL	00:14:48,575	00:14:51,391	| serial-s03-e05 |	You can tuck inside particular charges
EDL	00:14:51,391	00:14:52,927	| serial-s03-e05 |	Repeat offenders facts
EDL	00:14:52,927	00:14:56,511	| serial-s03-e05 |	Gang specs guns back to the most in Cuyahoga County
EDL	00:14:57,023	00:15:01,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	Usually one and three-year mandatory prison time for the use of a gun
EDL	00:15:01,119	00:15:05,983	| serial-s03-e05 |	Even though the use of a gun is baked into the definition of many charges already
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:08,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	The result
EDL	00:15:08,031	00:15:11,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is it kind of indictment shock and awe
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,199	| serial-s03-e05 |	Charging like this
EDL	00:15:15,199	00:15:17,503	| serial-s03-e05 |	What's known as stacking charges or just
EDL	00:15:17,503	00:15:18,271	| serial-s03-e05 |	Overcharging
EDL	00:15:18,783	00:15:19,807	| serial-s03-e05 |	Induces please
EDL	00:15:20,575	00:15:21,087	| serial-s03-e05 |	Of course it does
EDL	00:15:21,599	00:15:24,927	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because the prosecutor can accordion the indictment however he needs
EDL	00:15:25,695	00:15:27,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	If you play will drop everything but the felonious assault
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:31,839	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or you go to trial on the phone formidable indictment
EDL	00:15:32,351	00:15:36,191	| serial-s03-e05 |	And chances are if you go to trial you're going to get convicted of something
EDL	00:15:36,703	00:15:40,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	Just a visual of a long indictment is a signal to the jury
EDL	00:15:40,543	00:15:41,567	| serial-s03-e05 |	Look at this list
EDL	00:15:41,567	00:15:42,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	He must have done
EDL	00:15:42,591	00:15:43,103	| serial-s03-e05 |	Something
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,455	| serial-s03-e05 |	I want some charges probably are going to merge at sentencing
EDL	00:15:47,455	00:15:49,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	As a rule the more stuff you're convicted of
EDL	00:15:49,759	00:15:51,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	The longer your sentence is going to be
EDL	00:15:52,319	00:15:52,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	So yeah
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:54,111	| serial-s03-e05 |	You played
EDL	00:15:55,135	00:16:00,767	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's why the prevailing practice in most Prosecutor's offices is to charge crimes as harshly as they can
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:03,583	| serial-s03-e05 |	They might swell prisons and eviscerate entire neighborhoods
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,375	| serial-s03-e05 |	It is efficient
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:09,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	All of this brought me to Brian ratigan
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:11,263	| serial-s03-e05 |	I wanted to know something very basic
EDL	00:16:11,775	00:16:13,311	| serial-s03-e05 |	How does he make his decisions
EDL	00:16:14,079	00:16:16,639	| serial-s03-e05 |	How much of what Brian's doing is coming from Brian
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:17,919	| serial-s03-e05 |	His own sense of what's right
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| serial-s03-e05 |	How much is beyond his control
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,015	| serial-s03-e05 |	The job we've given him
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:22,783	| serial-s03-e05 |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:25,855	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian works in the major trial unit

EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	He never knows when he might be pulled into a courtroom
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:52,991	| serial-s03-e05 |	By the way his beard stubble scrapes against his collar you understand he's enduring the costume not enjoying it
EDL	00:16:53,503	00:16:55,295	| serial-s03-e05 |	He doesn't appear to Revel in his power
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:58,111	| serial-s03-e05 |	He favors the aw shucks variety of dominance
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:03,231	| serial-s03-e05 |	From what I can tell Brian is universally respected in the Justice Center
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:04,255	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's forthright
EDL	00:17:04,255	00:17:06,047	| serial-s03-e05 |	His compassion you can't take a joke

EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:09,023	| serial-s03-e05 |	He was with the defendant and we've been trying to get him to come in and then do an interview and every time he says he's coming in heat
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:11,071	| serial-s03-e05 |	Cancel Zoraida never ride or
EDL	00:18:11,071	00:18:13,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	Weed shop in his house and he's not there
EDL	00:18:13,119	00:18:17,215	| serial-s03-e05 |	So we last week I print out a subpoena for the two homicide detectives
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:20,543	| serial-s03-e05 |	They want serve them and so he just called and said he's going to be here today so
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:22,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is excellent timing
EDL	00:18:22,591	00:18:24,895	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian has a pre-trial on that case this afternoon
EDL	00:18:25,663	00:18:29,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	Right now. He's about to have a meeting with two other detectives on another case
EDL	00:18:30,271	00:18:31,039	| serial-s03-e05 |	They just walked in
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:32,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	AR
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:32,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	Harada
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,183	| serial-s03-e05 |	Articles and Rhonda Gray
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:38,719	| serial-s03-e05 |	The same one from Dave on the case
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:39,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	I know
EDL	00:18:39,999	00:18:41,279	| serial-s03-e05 |	They wouldn't let me record them
EDL	00:18:42,559	00:18:44,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	They were there to talk about a case that it made the news
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:47,679	| serial-s03-e05 |	Wasn't kind of shooting you usually hear about in Cleveland
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:51,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	It started as a squabble between strangers on a city bus
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:53,055	| serial-s03-e05 |	Then spilled onto the sidewalk
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:56,127	| serial-s03-e05 |	When older man had shot and killed a younger man
EDL	00:18:56,895	00:19:03,295	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian explain to me that this case was unusual for them because the entire episode was recorded by
EDL	00:19:03,295	00:19:04,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	Security cameras on the bus
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:07,903	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is one of those rare cases where you
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,951	| serial-s03-e05 |	You see the whole story
EDL	00:19:09,951	00:19:13,023	| serial-s03-e05 |	90% of our cases were not watching them
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:14,303	| serial-s03-e05 |	Unfold
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:17,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	The answer for if something is caught on
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:24,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know my camera whatever usually it's from a distance and you don't care the dialogue and you don't get to see everybody's reaction you don't
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:26,847	| serial-s03-e05 |	Have seven different angles are nine different angles of it
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,663	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know this is like the the outlier
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:33,503	| serial-s03-e05 |	Crazy I can't believe I have to watch this whole thing and see
EDL	00:19:33,503	00:19:35,807	| serial-s03-e05 |	All the decisions that were made that led to this guy dying
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:37,087	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is your watch
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:40,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	You're watching like God just didn't you want to tell him what to stay out the bus
EDL	00:19:40,415	00:19:40,927	| serial-s03-e05 |	Stop the bus
EDL	00:19:41,951	00:19:44,511	| serial-s03-e05 |	This incident happened three and a half weeks earlier
EDL	00:19:44,511	00:19:46,047	| serial-s03-e05 |	The older guy was in jail
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,327	| serial-s03-e05 |	But he hadn't been indicted yet
EDL	00:19:47,839	00:19:51,935	| serial-s03-e05 |	The meeting with detectives this morning is to figure out how they're going to handle it
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:54,239	| serial-s03-e05 |	What charges Brian should present to the grand jury
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:56,799	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is a tricky one now
EDL	00:19:57,311	00:20:01,919	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because Brian can see how the whole thing unspooled now he's not sure a crime even occurred
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:08,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	The stories in the newspaper had quoted police as saying that the older guy the shooter had been harassing passengers on the bus
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,391	| serial-s03-e05 |	But the bus videos for the opposite
EDL	00:20:11,903	00:20:13,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	The older guy the shooter
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:14,719	| serial-s03-e05 |	He was the one being provoked
EDL	00:20:15,487	00:20:17,279	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's possible this was self-defense
EDL	00:20:18,303	00:20:19,839	| serial-s03-e05 |	We got a conference room
EDL	00:20:19,839	00:20:22,655	| serial-s03-e05 |	Does big screen set up so they can watch the footage from the bus
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:26,751	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian had mentioned something about 7 or 9 camera angles
EDL	00:20:26,751	00:20:28,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	I thought he was joking
EDL	00:20:28,031	00:20:28,543	| serial-s03-e05 |	He wasn't
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	For exactly this reason
EDL	00:20:31,103	00:20:34,431	| serial-s03-e05 |	Crime city buses in Cleveland or wired up like itinerant Bank Falls
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:37,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	The British were watching starts from before the beginning
EDL	00:20:38,271	00:20:39,295	| serial-s03-e05 |	When everything was calm
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:42,623	| serial-s03-e05 |	Okay what happened when they thank you thank you
EDL	00:20:43,391	00:20:44,927	| serial-s03-e05 |	The older guy the shooter
EDL	00:20:44,927	00:20:46,207	| serial-s03-e05 |	His name is Abdul Rahman
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:49,023	| serial-s03-e05 |	I gotten on the bus at Public Square
EDL	00:20:49,023	00:20:50,047	| serial-s03-e05 |	Right near the Justice Center
EDL	00:20:50,815	00:20:52,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's in his early 60s but he looks older
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:55,679	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is that a long grey beard a loose sweatshirt
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:20:56,447	| serial-s03-e05 |	A scruffy
EDL	00:20:56,959	00:20:59,519	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's not homeless but he might have been mistaken for homeless
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:05,407	| serial-s03-e05 |	You see mr. Rahman sitting in a window seat by the rear doors of the bus minding his own business
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:09,247	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's holding what looks like a folded newspaper or magazine in his hand
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:12,063	| serial-s03-e05 |	Any younger guy sits down next to him
EDL	00:21:12,063	00:21:13,343	| serial-s03-e05 |	They don't know each other
EDL	00:21:13,343	00:21:16,672	| serial-s03-e05 |	But evidently the younger guy starts insulting mr. rahkman
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:22,816	| serial-s03-e05 |	You can't make out what he saying but other passengers told the cops later that he was complaining to mr. Rahman that he smelled that
EDL	00:21:23,584	00:21:25,888	| serial-s03-e05 |	The younger guy is not the one who gets shot by the way
EDL	00:21:26,912	00:21:28,448	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mr. Rahman gets up
EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,472	| serial-s03-e05 |	I still leave a seat
EDL	00:21:30,240	00:21:31,264	| serial-s03-e05 |	Younger man blocks him
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:36,384	| serial-s03-e05 |	Ryan's watched all this before but he can't help wishing it won't go the way it's going to go
EDL	00:21:36,896	00:21:37,920	| serial-s03-e05 |	Skechers keepsake
EDL	00:21:37,920	00:21:39,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	John Adam
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:43,552	| serial-s03-e05 |	Skip said there's an open spot right up there just go sit there
EDL	00:21:44,320	00:21:46,112	| serial-s03-e05 |	The younger guy is being an a******
EDL	00:21:46,624	00:21:47,904	| serial-s03-e05 |	Ginning up a confrontation
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:51,744	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is Brian pointed out assholery is not a criminal offense
EDL	00:21:52,768	00:21:54,560	| serial-s03-e05 |	He finally lets mr. Rock montage
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,632	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mr. Rahman stands by the bus doors
EDL	00:21:57,632	00:21:59,936	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it doesn't move to a different part of the bus
EDL	00:22:00,448	00:22:02,496	| serial-s03-e05 |	You still arguing with the younger guy
EDL	00:22:02,496	00:22:04,032	| serial-s03-e05 |	Who started get physical now

EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:10,688	| serial-s03-e05 |	Fix it up
EDL	00:22:11,712	00:22:15,552	| serial-s03-e05 |	You say you're going to get shot
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:18,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's not clear but you can hear mr. Rock monse
EDL	00:22:19,392	00:22:20,416	| serial-s03-e05 |	I like my freedom

EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:35,264	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's familiar this scene

EDL	00:22:38,848	00:22:41,920	| serial-s03-e05 |	And the whole time you're doing the bystanders trigonometry
EDL	00:22:41,920	00:22:43,456	| serial-s03-e05 |	How long till I stop
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:44,992	| serial-s03-e05 |	Should I say something
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:46,016	| serial-s03-e05 |	Where are we
EDL	00:22:46,016	00:22:47,552	| serial-s03-e05 |	Should I move seats
EDL	00:22:47,552	00:22:53,952	| serial-s03-e05 |	At this point a woman named Rachel asked the men to Canna she's sitting nearby with a few other people
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:23:00,096	| serial-s03-e05 |	Including her boyfriend Andrew Easley the man who's going to get killed in about 2 minutes
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:06,496	| serial-s03-e05 |	Rachel says to the guys arguing hey can't you see my niece is sitting right here
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:12,896	| serial-s03-e05 |	Get your ass off the bus and come down and he does this Rock Mine gets off at the next stop
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:15,712	| serial-s03-e05 |	Then he lingers on the sidewalk
EDL	00:23:16,224	00:23:18,016	| serial-s03-e05 |	You just want to scream walk
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:23,648	| serial-s03-e05 |	Walk the extra 5 blocks for god sakes but he gets back on the bus
EDL	00:23:24,416	00:23:26,976	| serial-s03-e05 |	10 seconds later the younger guy says this
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:30,048	| serial-s03-e05 |	It is especially hard to hear but it's important
EDL	00:23:30,048	00:23:36,448	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because it's possible this is what jacked up the situation
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:39,264	| serial-s03-e05 |	He says I got a CCW
EDL	00:23:40,288	00:23:43,104	| serial-s03-e05 |	CCW stands for carrying a concealed weapon
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:43,616	| serial-s03-e05 |	Gun license
EDL	00:23:44,384	00:23:46,176	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's implying that he's armed right now
EDL	00:23:46,176	00:23:46,688	| serial-s03-e05 |	Legally
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:50,272	| serial-s03-e05 |	He does not have a gun but presumably mr. Rahman doesn't know that
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:54,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	Then the younger guy pulls the cord to single he wants to get off at the next stop
EDL	00:23:54,880	00:23:56,928	| serial-s03-e05 |	He says to mr. Rahman
EDL	00:23:56,928	00:23:57,440	| serial-s03-e05 |	Get off the bus
EDL	00:23:57,952	00:24:01,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	Let's Take It Outside you and me
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:03,584	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's up in Mister rachmones face
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,864	| serial-s03-e05 |	Sex laughing at him
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,680	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mr. Rothman pulls a gun
EDL	00:24:07,680	00:24:08,448	| serial-s03-e05 |	His own gun
EDL	00:24:09,216	00:24:11,008	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's got it in his right hand
EDL	00:24:11,008	00:24:12,800	| serial-s03-e05 |	And he pointed at the younger guys head
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:15,104	| serial-s03-e05 |	Rachel and the other people in the bus
EDL	00:24:15,104	00:24:16,128	| serial-s03-e05 |	Start freaking out
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:20,992	| serial-s03-e05 |	The bus pulls up to the stop
EDL	00:24:20,992	00:24:23,552	| serial-s03-e05 |	Rachel muscles her way to where Mr Rock MineZ
EDL	00:24:23,552	00:24:24,576	| serial-s03-e05 |	The doors open
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:27,392	| serial-s03-e05 |	And then she kicks him Square in the butt
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:28,672	| serial-s03-e05 |	Straight off the bus
EDL	00:24:28,672	00:24:33,280	| serial-s03-e05 |	Onto the sidewalk
EDL	00:24:33,280	00:24:36,608	| serial-s03-e05 |	Her boyfriend Andrew Easley is right behind her now
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| serial-s03-e05 |	He steps off the bus
EDL	00:24:38,912	00:24:39,936	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is tall and lanky
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:41,216	| serial-s03-e05 |	Dressed all in white
EDL	00:24:41,728	00:24:43,008	| serial-s03-e05 |	Long white shorts
EDL	00:24:43,008	00:24:44,800	| serial-s03-e05 |	White shirt white hat white sneakers
EDL	00:24:45,824	00:24:47,616	| serial-s03-e05 |	He strides toward Mr Rahman
EDL	00:24:47,616	00:24:48,896	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is walking backwards now
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is Rahman holds up his gun again
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:53,504	| serial-s03-e05 |	Waves it around a little
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:56,064	| serial-s03-e05 |	Andrew easily Retreats quickly back onto the bus
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:59,648	| serial-s03-e05 |	Were the younger guy who started all this is hovering by the open doors
EDL	00:25:00,416	00:25:05,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	Then you hear Rachel and someone else say something you especially wish they had not said
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,304	| serial-s03-e05 |	Which is
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:10,144	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's a water gun
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:12,704	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mr. Rahman is walking away now
EDL	00:25:12,704	00:25:15,264	| serial-s03-e05 |	But Andrew and the younger guy go after him again
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:18,592	| serial-s03-e05 |	Finally right as someone on the bus says something like
EDL	00:25:18,592	00:25:20,640	| serial-s03-e05 |	Why do you all go to beat up on this old man
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:25,760	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mr. Rahman shoots Andrew Easley in the Torso
EDL	00:25:26,784	00:25:27,296	| serial-s03-e05 |	He falls
EDL	00:25:28,320	00:25:29,344	| serial-s03-e05 |	Someone starts screaming
EDL	00:25:30,624	00:25:32,160	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mr. Rahman jobs away
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:54,944	| serial-s03-e05 |	The police have statements from some of the people inside the bus but the statements aren't as reliable as the Myriad recordings we
EDL	00:25:54,944	00:25:55,712	| serial-s03-e05 |	You just watched
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:26:00,576	| serial-s03-e05 |	The detectives can see for themselves how the thing cranked up emotionally block by block
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,624	| serial-s03-e05 |	As a bus traveled East on Superior Avenue
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:09,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	I miss rockman's house they found a gun it fell out onto detective Ackles his foot when he was looking through mr. Rock men's clothes
EDL	00:26:10,048	00:26:13,632	| serial-s03-e05 |	They don't have casings but they're 99% sure it's the same gun from the bus
EDL	00:26:15,168	00:26:16,960	| serial-s03-e05 |	Through question what happened here
EDL	00:26:17,472	00:26:20,544	| serial-s03-e05 |	Abdul-rahman used his own gun to shoot Andrew Easley
EDL	00:26:21,312	00:26:21,824	| serial-s03-e05 |	The question is
EDL	00:26:22,336	00:26:23,104	| serial-s03-e05 |	Was it a crime
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:27,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	Okay princess so really the issue is did he have a choice
EDL	00:26:27,968	00:26:29,248	| serial-s03-e05 |	Are these two guys coming after
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,576	| serial-s03-e05 |	What are the detectives nudges back says
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:34,112	| serial-s03-e05 |	I feel that argument won't work
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:38,720	| serial-s03-e05 |	I promise Rahman could have made other choices he could have gotten off the bus earlier
EDL	00:26:39,488	00:26:40,512	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian says
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:43,072	| serial-s03-e05 |	When he gets off the bus the last time he's walking away
EDL	00:26:43,584	00:26:45,120	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's not re-engaging
EDL	00:26:45,120	00:26:46,144	| serial-s03-e05 |	And he's got you guys have
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:53,056	| serial-s03-e05 |	One of the detectives suggests Brian might change his mind when he sees this one last video
EDL	00:26:53,824	00:26:55,104	| serial-s03-e05 |	We watched it later
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,896	| serial-s03-e05 |	One more camera angle
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:26:59,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	The part that detectives wanted Brian to see
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,760	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is mr. rockmont posture
EDL	00:27:01,760	00:27:02,528	| serial-s03-e05 |	Right at the end
EDL	00:27:03,552	00:27:06,624	| serial-s03-e05 |	Nobel point is I mean he's going backwards
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:10,464	| serial-s03-e05 |	But he is doing that we're boxing Shuffle
EDL	00:27:11,232	00:27:13,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's true he's doing a boxing Shuffle
EDL	00:27:13,536	00:27:14,560	| serial-s03-e05 |	Like he's fixing a fight
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:18,656	| serial-s03-e05 |	I learned mr. Rahman wasn't always called mr. Rahman
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:21,984	| serial-s03-e05 |	Decades ago he was called Ricardo Spain
EDL	00:27:22,496	00:27:23,776	| serial-s03-e05 |	And he was a heavyweight fighter
EDL	00:27:24,544	00:27:28,128	| serial-s03-e05 |	He mostly lost his professional bouts 23 losses at a 26 ft
EDL	00:27:28,896	00:27:29,920	| serial-s03-e05 |	One of them
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:35,040	| serial-s03-e05 |	And Now ladies and gentlemen man your battle station with against Mike Tyson
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,832	| serial-s03-e05 |	Atlantic City
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:42,976	| serial-s03-e05 |	1985
EDL	00:27:42,976	00:27:46,304	| serial-s03-e05 |	Auto believe that that's actually where inside a minute
EDL	00:27:46,816	00:27:48,096	| serial-s03-e05 |	Yes it is
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,120	| serial-s03-e05 |	38 seconds
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,192	| serial-s03-e05 |	Which is not the fastest Tyson ever knocked a guy out
EDL	00:27:53,472	00:27:57,312	| serial-s03-e05 |	Now I understand why the detective wanted to be sure Brian saw that last video
EDL	00:27:57,824	00:27:59,360	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because it does make you wonder
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:01,408	| serial-s03-e05 |	Was a former heavyweight
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,944	| serial-s03-e05 |	Who can still muster a boxing show
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:05,504	| serial-s03-e05 |	Really afraid of those two guys on the bus
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,576	| serial-s03-e05 |	After the meeting with the detectives
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:11,392	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'd say Brian was leaning slightly self-defense
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:13,696	| serial-s03-e05 |	But he's still not sure
EDL	00:28:14,464	00:28:15,744	| serial-s03-e05 |	And because he's not sure
EDL	00:28:15,744	00:28:18,304	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's going to let the grand jury make that call tomorrow
EDL	00:28:18,304	00:28:19,840	| serial-s03-e05 |	When they present the case for indictment
EDL	00:28:21,120	00:28:24,448	| serial-s03-e05 |	Technically of course the grand jury is always supposed to make that call
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:28,032	| serial-s03-e05 |	They're the ones who vote on whether there's probable cause to charge someone with a crime
EDL	00:28:28,544	00:28:30,848	| serial-s03-e05 |	But well for you lawyers and Legal Eagles
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:32,384	| serial-s03-e05 |	Ham sandwich I know
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:35,200	| serial-s03-e05 |	For the rest of you I will spare you the ham sandwich cliche and just
EDL	00:28:35,200	00:28:35,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	Explain
EDL	00:28:35,968	00:28:39,296	| serial-s03-e05 |	The grand jury is supposed to be a Citizens check on government power
EDL	00:28:40,064	00:28:43,392	| serial-s03-e05 |	But in practice grand juries usually vote the way prosecutors want them to vote
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:49,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	Probable cause is a Lolo standard you just have to show that it's logical to believe this person might have committed this
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:50,048	| serial-s03-e05 |	Describe
EDL	00:28:50,560	00:28:54,656	| serial-s03-e05 |	A grand jury presentation there's no judge no cross-examination no defense
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:29:01,824	| serial-s03-e05 |	In fact in Ohio according to the State Bar quote even if a prosecutor knows of information which would help show that they could
EDL	00:29:01,824	00:29:03,360	| serial-s03-e05 |	Cute person is innocent
EDL	00:29:03,360	00:29:05,664	| serial-s03-e05 |	He is not required to present it to the Grand Jury
EDL	00:29:06,688	00:29:11,040	| serial-s03-e05 |	How weird is that the cops in the prosecutor tell the grand jurors what they think happened
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:14,368	| serial-s03-e05 |	The prosecutor presents them with a proposed indictment
EDL	00:29:14,368	00:29:16,672	| serial-s03-e05 |	Hear all the charges We Believe fit this crime
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,464	| serial-s03-e05 |	If you guys agree
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:18,976	| serial-s03-e05 |	Sign right here
EDL	00:29:20,512	00:29:21,792	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian's got to figure out
EDL	00:29:21,792	00:29:24,352	| serial-s03-e05 |	What charges is he going to ask them to vote on tomorrow
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:28,960	| serial-s03-e05 |	Like what will you write up in the indictment in terms of the charges to think
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,800	| serial-s03-e05 |	Murder I think is the high-end that it would be and
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:39,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	Below that is voluntary manslaughter and I think it goes between those two and involuntary manslaughter is basically like heater
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:46,368	| serial-s03-e05 |	The energy of passion or I are you being provoked it's it's it's a crime that's that's provoked but
EDL	00:29:46,368	00:29:48,160	| serial-s03-e05 |	And that's your
EDL	00:29:48,160	00:29:50,720	| serial-s03-e05 |	You're deciding on This Is Us
EDL	00:29:50,720	00:29:56,608	| serial-s03-e05 |	No I'm not the decider I am not the designer I don't decide anything except for what see what I'm going to wear today
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:57,376	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:04,288	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'm sure he has to run stuff by the bosses down the hall usually saw at Wadala who supervises unit
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:07,360	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brother MO is also in the major trials unit
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:09,920	| serial-s03-e05 |	But the idea that Brian's not deciding anything
EDL	00:30:10,432	00:30:15,040	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because he could play this various ways
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:18,368	| serial-s03-e05 |	Find could show the jurors One camera angle
EDL	00:30:18,368	00:30:19,392	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or 7 camera angle
EDL	00:30:19,904	00:30:26,048	| serial-s03-e05 |	He could present all the statements from the people on the bus or just the ones that say mr. Rahman was the aggressor
EDL	00:30:27,072	00:30:29,376	| serial-s03-e05 |	He could put murder on the proposed indictment
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:31,424	| serial-s03-e05 |	And never mention the word self defense
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:35,520	| serial-s03-e05 |	But this one he tells me he really can see it either way
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,824	| serial-s03-e05 |	Crime or no crime
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:40,640	| serial-s03-e05 |	So his plan is to put the whole megillah in their laps
EDL	00:30:41,152	00:30:42,176	| serial-s03-e05 |	Let the grand jurors decide
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:45,248	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's going to show them all the camera footage
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,296	| serial-s03-e05 |	Read them all the witness statement
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,344	| serial-s03-e05 |	He talks at 3 with a paralegal
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:50,112	| serial-s03-e05 |	Nida
EDL	00:30:50,112	00:30:54,464	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's preparing the materials for the grand jury
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:59,328	| serial-s03-e05 |	Should we do the video before we talk about what each one says or play the movie
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:30:59,840	| serial-s03-e05 |	What do you think
EDL	00:31:02,656	00:31:04,704	| serial-s03-e05 |	I think I want to play the video first
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:09,056	| serial-s03-e05 |	See that he doesn't want the camera footage to be colored by the statement
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:11,360	| serial-s03-e05 |	So it's going to be footage first
EDL	00:31:11,872	00:31:13,408	| serial-s03-e05 |	And he decides
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:15,712	| serial-s03-e05 |	He is not only going to mention self-defense
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,760	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's going to explain self-defense
EDL	00:31:18,272	00:31:19,808	| serial-s03-e05 |	Tell them what the legal elements are
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:23,648	| serial-s03-e05 |	I might have you throw something together for me real quick on self-defense
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:27,744	| serial-s03-e05 |	Stuff
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:30,560	| serial-s03-e05 |	He goes and gets the pages
EDL	00:31:31,328	00:31:36,960	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's whatever self-defense the following elements must be shown in this is out of a hot spring court case
EDL	00:31:36,960	00:31:40,032	| serial-s03-e05 |	Slayer was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise the
EDL	00:31:40,544	00:31:41,312	| serial-s03-e05 |	Two situation
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:45,920	| serial-s03-e05 |	So you're had a Bonafide believe that he was imminent danger of death or great bodily harm
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:47,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	You didn't instigate it
EDL	00:31:47,968	00:31:51,040	| serial-s03-e05 |	You had a genuine fear that you'd be killed or badly hurt
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:53,344	| serial-s03-e05 |	Duty to retreat
EDL	00:31:53,856	00:31:54,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	And you tried to get away
EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:57,952	| serial-s03-e05 |	But if you just want to add in those two things
EDL	00:31:59,232	00:32:00,768	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'm going to give it to you and then you can
EDL	00:32:02,304	00:32:04,096	| serial-s03-e05 |	Why later Brian tells me
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:06,400	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's thinking he's not going to put murder on there
EDL	00:32:06,912	00:32:08,192	| serial-s03-e05 |	Just the voluntary manslaughter
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:12,800	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is not set in stone yet but I believe it's just going to be voluntary manslaughter
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:14,080	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't think there's going to be a murder charge
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:19,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	When did Becca decided I think that that's what it's what it's going to be
EDL	00:32:20,992	00:32:25,856	| serial-s03-e05 |	There's clearly some education here there's clearly some you know he's being prodded
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:28,416	| serial-s03-e05 |	All right I mean I think you can see that in the video it's
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:28,928	| serial-s03-e05 |	And it's
EDL	00:32:29,440	00:32:33,280	| serial-s03-e05 |	Clear from the beginning the guy the kid wanted to let him get out of the seat
EDL	00:32:33,280	00:32:34,048	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean there's some
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:38,144	| serial-s03-e05 |	She didn't start this so
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:39,936	| serial-s03-e05 |	Nnnn it could be
EDL	00:32:40,704	00:32:44,288	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean here and in really for my perspectives like it's not it if
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:49,920	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's not so much matter what I think right now it's it's kind of what
EDL	00:32:49,920	00:32:51,200	| serial-s03-e05 |	What the grand jury is going to think
EDL	00:32:51,200	00:32:52,736	| serial-s03-e05 |	I can also I'll play for them in
EDL	00:32:55,040	00:32:58,112	| serial-s03-e05 |	You have a point of view that you're going that's going to come across for sure
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,928	| serial-s03-e05 |	How you present things how you
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:08,096	| serial-s03-e05 |	What you stress what I mean it's probably hugely influential I don't mean it in a creepy way I just mean like
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:12,192	| serial-s03-e05 |	Yeah I think so but I also try to be fair to the process you know I mean I don't want
EDL	00:33:12,704	00:33:13,728	| serial-s03-e05 |	Down to just say
EDL	00:33:15,520	00:33:17,312	| serial-s03-e05 |	What do you think what do you think
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,616	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know because I know what what's the point I might as well just
EDL	00:33:20,128	00:33:22,944	| serial-s03-e05 |	If it was if I was going to do that way
EDL	00:33:23,456	00:33:26,016	| serial-s03-e05 |	Why even do the whole thing why
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:27,552	| serial-s03-e05 |	Wiper the video from y
EDL	00:33:28,064	00:33:32,672	| serial-s03-e05 |	Talk about what each witness in their size why talk about where they are in the bus I could just go in there and say
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,720	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know we shot them you should have shot them
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,024	| serial-s03-e05 |	Indictable murder
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:38,048	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know if
EDL	00:33:38,560	00:33:41,632	| serial-s03-e05 |	In a case like this I think it is so important to
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,656	| serial-s03-e05 |	Give the full picture
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:43,424	| serial-s03-e05 |	And
EDL	00:33:43,424	00:33:44,704	| serial-s03-e05 |	If they have the full picture
EDL	00:33:45,216	00:33:47,776	| serial-s03-e05 |	They should be able to make the decision based on that
EDL	00:33:47,776	00:33:49,056	| serial-s03-e05 |	Not not on what I say
EDL	00:33:50,336	00:33:53,408	| serial-s03-e05 |	Afterwards I went down to the first floor Atrium to get a snack
EDL	00:33:53,920	00:34:00,064	| serial-s03-e05 |	Bedroom has a little cafe and tables and chairs that you have to choose carefully because they are frequently sprinkled with bird poop
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:01,344	| serial-s03-e05 |	Now you know
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:07,232	| serial-s03-e05 |	I was chatting with the manual and then we started talking to these three defense attorneys we knew at a nearby table
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:09,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	I told him about the rocmon case
EDL	00:34:09,536	00:34:12,608	| serial-s03-e05 |	About how much material Brian ratigan was going to show the grand jury
EDL	00:34:13,120	00:34:14,144	| serial-s03-e05 |	Interfaces
EDL	00:34:14,912	00:34:15,680	| serial-s03-e05 |	Onelook
EDL	00:34:15,680	00:34:16,192	| serial-s03-e05 |	Furious
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:17,728	| serial-s03-e05 |	Another was smirking
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:20,800	| serial-s03-e05 |	One of them rolled his eyes at me but I might be making that up
EDL	00:34:21,568	00:34:23,104	| serial-s03-e05 |	Regardless the chest was clear
EDL	00:34:23,616	00:34:26,944	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's putting on a show for you it's never like that they said
EDL	00:34:27,456	00:34:30,272	| serial-s03-e05 |	They never have that much evidence before they go to the grand jury
EDL	00:34:31,040	00:34:33,344	| serial-s03-e05 |	People get indicted for stuff in 90 seconds
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:34,112	| serial-s03-e05 |	No discussion
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,648	| serial-s03-e05 |	I knew you were coming
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:36,928	| serial-s03-e05 |	Sucker
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:40,768	| serial-s03-e05 |	Are all people who know Brian rattigan
EDL	00:34:40,768	00:34:41,536	| serial-s03-e05 |	Who respect them
EDL	00:34:42,048	00:34:45,632	| serial-s03-e05 |	But such was their disbelief that actual fairness could be at work upstairs
EDL	00:34:46,144	00:34:47,936	| serial-s03-e05 |	That was kind of loud as possible
EDL	00:34:49,216	00:34:51,520	| serial-s03-e05 |	I told Brian about this conversation
EDL	00:34:51,520	00:34:53,056	| serial-s03-e05 |	A little awkwardly
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:57,408	| serial-s03-e05 |	Hebrews just like all you got played sister
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:57,920	| serial-s03-e05 |	Why
EDL	00:34:58,432	00:35:00,992	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because then I'll be busted
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:03,296	| serial-s03-e05 |	Ted
EDL	00:35:03,296	00:35:04,576	| serial-s03-e05 |	Jack Bob
EDL	00:35:04,576	00:35:06,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	Your secret's safe with me I did not tell
EDL	00:35:07,392	00:35:08,672	| serial-s03-e05 |	But I did want to know
EDL	00:35:08,672	00:35:11,488	| serial-s03-e05 |	What did Brian think of what the defense attorneys were saying
EDL	00:35:12,256	00:35:17,632	| serial-s03-e05 |	The prosecutors and cops are taking cases before the grand jury office seeking severe charges
EDL	00:35:17,632	00:35:19,168	| serial-s03-e05 |	Based on thin information
EDL	00:35:19,680	00:35:22,496	| serial-s03-e05 |	Before the crime has been investigated in any real way
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:25,056	| serial-s03-e05 |	His answer was
EDL	00:35:25,056	00:35:26,080	| serial-s03-e05 |	Yeah that does happen
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,176	| serial-s03-e05 |	Sometimes you do get cases that are solid right from the get-go
EDL	00:35:30,176	00:35:32,480	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or maybe get lucky with evidence I put this rock monkey
EDL	00:35:33,248	00:35:35,296	| serial-s03-e05 |	And again sometimes there's just not
EDL	00:35:35,296	00:35:36,832	| serial-s03-e05 |	There's just not enough there
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:37,600	| serial-s03-e05 |	And
EDL	00:35:38,112	00:35:44,512	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or we we think we have enough and then you learn information on later on I'm going to get remember a lot of times to your underwear
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:45,024	| serial-s03-e05 |	Time crunch
EDL	00:35:45,536	00:35:48,096	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's talking about speedy trial rights for defendants
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:51,424	| serial-s03-e05 |	Also if they don't indict within 10 days
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:55,520	| serial-s03-e05 |	The defendant get a preliminary hearing before a judge to determine probable cause
EDL	00:35:56,032	00:35:58,080	| serial-s03-e05 |	What's the prosecution does not want
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:36:02,944	| serial-s03-e05 |	That is a whole procedural nonsense that you do not want me to get into right now I promise
EDL	00:36:03,456	00:36:07,040	| serial-s03-e05 |	But what it all means is that they are in a hurry to get cases to the grand jury
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:10,112	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian told me it's all about speed
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:10,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	Unfortunately
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:16,512	| serial-s03-e05 |	Again speed might not be a problem if you didn't have 13,000 felonies to process
EDL	00:36:17,280	00:36:17,792	| serial-s03-e05 |	But you do
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:21,888	| serial-s03-e05 |	So yeah it's obviously not ideal when investigations aren't fully cooked
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:23,424	| serial-s03-e05 |	But Brian said
EDL	00:36:23,424	00:36:25,728	| serial-s03-e05 |	Sometimes you've got a major crime in front of you
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:28,032	| serial-s03-e05 |	If somebody is arrested for it and
EDL	00:36:28,800	00:36:30,848	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'm going to make a determination I mean
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:34,176	| serial-s03-e05 |	What you going to do if you if you really think that you have the guy
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:35,968	| serial-s03-e05 |	That you have the right guy
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,040	| serial-s03-e05 |	Do you want them out on the street to
EDL	00:36:39,808	00:36:41,344	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know say it's murder
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:43,392	| serial-s03-e05 |	You want on the street to go do another one or
EDL	00:36:44,416	00:36:46,464	| serial-s03-e05 |	Just so you know I think we've got enough here
EDL	00:36:46,976	00:36:48,512	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know it sounds so
EDL	00:36:49,536	00:36:50,304	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's not perfect
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:54,144	| serial-s03-e05 |	And sometimes because of that he said they make mistakes
EDL	00:36:54,912	00:37:00,544	| serial-s03-e05 |	And sometimes because of that this is me talking now with cases like Dave on
EDL	00:37:01,568	00:37:03,616	| serial-s03-e05 |	But what are you going to do
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,688	| serial-s03-e05 |	More after the break
EDL	00:37:13,088	00:37:14,880	| serial-s03-e05 |	This is the road to hired
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:16,416	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brought to you by ZipRecruiter
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:21,024	| serial-s03-e05 |	Gretchen heebner is the co-founder of kodable
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:25,120	| serial-s03-e05 |	Take me to computer game starring little aliens exploring the galaxies
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:29,984	| serial-s03-e05 |	Family
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:31,776	| serial-s03-e05 |	The buses are fun
EDL	00:37:31,776	00:37:34,848	| serial-s03-e05 |	But secretly they're helping kids learn to code
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:37,664	| serial-s03-e05 |	By teaching them everything from algorithms to JavaScript
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:39,712	| serial-s03-e05 |	The game work so well
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:45,088	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it's now the center of a computer science curriculum that's in tens of thousands of elementary schools across the u.s.
EDL	00:37:45,600	00:37:47,648	| serial-s03-e05 |	Does the game became more successful
EDL	00:37:47,648	00:37:48,672	| serial-s03-e05 |	Gretchen.
EDL	00:37:48,672	00:37:49,440	| serial-s03-e05 |	Okay
EDL	00:37:49,440	00:37:51,488	| serial-s03-e05 |	We need to step up our graphics
EDL	00:37:51,488	00:37:54,560	| serial-s03-e05 |	I actually did all of our artwork up until
EDL	00:37:54,560	00:37:56,864	| serial-s03-e05 |	Three months ago are you trained artist
EDL	00:37:56,864	00:37:58,144	| serial-s03-e05 |	No

EDL	00:45:06,431	00:45:08,223	| serial-s03-e05 |	Which come with a raft of gun specs
EDL	00:45:08,991	00:45:10,271	| serial-s03-e05 |	If you get a life Tale
EDL	00:45:10,271	00:45:11,039	| serial-s03-e05 |	Se22 life
EDL	00:45:11,551	00:45:14,879	| serial-s03-e05 |	Means you have to serve 20 years before you can apply for parole
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:17,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	Which you're not likely to get at least not the first time around
EDL	00:45:18,207	00:45:20,767	| serial-s03-e05 |	So 22 life could mean 20 years
EDL	00:45:20,767	00:45:23,839	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or it could mean you spend the rest of your life in prison
EDL	00:45:24,607	00:45:26,655	| serial-s03-e05 |	Dominique Williams is 27 years old
EDL	00:45:27,167	00:45:28,959	| serial-s03-e05 |	Understandably he wants flat time
EDL	00:45:30,239	00:45:33,823	| serial-s03-e05 |	For that to work they're going to need to reduce the charges to some kind of manslaughter
EDL	00:45:34,591	00:45:35,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	What do you think
EDL	00:45:35,871	00:45:36,895	| serial-s03-e05 |	Realistically
EDL	00:45:37,407	00:45:39,455	| serial-s03-e05 |	Centanni's I mean it's not twenties
EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:44,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	That was before
EDL	00:45:44,319	00:45:49,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	The other guy said yeah he's the one that shot them and I watch them yeah it's not so it's not a good fact
EDL	00:45:50,975	00:45:53,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean I really think it could be a manslaughter with
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:56,095	| serial-s03-e05 |	Are range of maybe
EDL	00:45:56,607	00:45:58,399	| serial-s03-e05 |	14 to 20
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:01,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	Potentially
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:06,847	| serial-s03-e05 |	But Peter is May I forgot I've got I have a police officer I got to worry about 2
EDL	00:46:08,383	00:46:10,431	| serial-s03-e05 |	So keep that in mind I mean that's you know that's
EDL	00:46:10,943	00:46:13,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	Where you're talkin if you if you want to range you're talkin
EDL	00:46:15,039	00:46:16,831	| serial-s03-e05 |	High twenties in the mid thirties probably
EDL	00:46:16,831	00:46:17,855	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or he just
EDL	00:46:18,623	00:46:20,159	| serial-s03-e05 |	Takes it on the Shenandoah murder
EDL	00:46:21,439	00:46:22,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	I got the light tail
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:26,047	| serial-s03-e05 |	Alright let's figure it out you
EDL	00:46:27,327	00:46:28,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	Whatever number they settle on
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:30,399	| serial-s03-e05 |	They're confident the judge will go for it
EDL	00:46:31,935	00:46:36,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	By the time we get back to Brian's office the detectives on the Williams case or waiting for him
EDL	00:46:36,031	00:46:37,823	| serial-s03-e05 |	To tell me more about the witness interview
EDL	00:46:38,335	00:46:41,151	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is Ray Diaz and also detective Jody Remington
EDL	00:46:41,663	00:46:45,503	| serial-s03-e05 |	Tourneau
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:46,783	| serial-s03-e05 |	Something
EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:47,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	Yeah
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:49,855	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian and the detectives are easy with each other
EDL	00:46:49,855	00:46:51,391	| serial-s03-e05 |	No errors are formalities
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,951	| serial-s03-e05 |	You can tell they were together a long time
EDL	00:46:53,951	00:46:55,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	Did you know
EDL	00:46:57,279	00:46:58,815	| serial-s03-e05 |	He said that he tried to eat
EDL	00:46:59,327	00:47:00,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	People been talkin but
EDL	00:47:04,447	00:47:07,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	Watching how closely Brian works with detectives all day
EDL	00:47:07,775	00:47:11,103	| serial-s03-e05 |	Give me an appreciation for why the system finds Prosecuting a
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:12,639	| serial-s03-e05 |	Cop so excruciating
EDL	00:47:13,663	00:47:14,943	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian is had to do it
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:20,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	Just a month-and-a-half ago he prosecuted a Cleveland officer after he shot and killed the teenager 18
EDL	00:47:20,319	00:47:21,599	| serial-s03-e05 |	The broken into a store
EDL	00:47:22,111	00:47:24,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	The cop was charged with negligent homicide
EDL	00:47:24,415	00:47:25,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	A misdemeanor
EDL	00:47:25,439	00:47:26,975	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian took it to trial
EDL	00:47:26,975	00:47:27,999	| serial-s03-e05 |	Not with relish
EDL	00:47:28,511	00:47:29,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	You're Nobody wants to do them
EDL	00:47:30,815	00:47:32,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	Let me know what if judges don't want them
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:37,215	| serial-s03-e05 |	Costumes on defense attorneys a lot of the police that are asking him don't want them
EDL	00:47:39,263	00:47:40,287	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because they're hard
EDL	00:47:41,567	00:47:43,359	| serial-s03-e05 |	Legally there complicated
EDL	00:47:43,359	00:47:46,175	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because cops are allowed to kill people in certain circumstances
EDL	00:47:46,943	00:47:49,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	But also for Brian they're morally complicated
EDL	00:47:50,783	00:47:52,575	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian supports police officers
EDL	00:47:52,575	00:47:54,623	| serial-s03-e05 |	He knows how many guns are on the street
EDL	00:47:54,623	00:47:56,927	| serial-s03-e05 |	He thinks their job is harder than it's ever been
EDL	00:47:57,951	00:48:00,767	| serial-s03-e05 |	We also doesn't think that eighteen-year-old deserve to die that night
EDL	00:48:01,279	00:48:04,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	By Prosecuting the officer brydon feel like he was taking a side
EDL	00:48:05,119	00:48:06,399	| serial-s03-e05 |	He felt like he was doing his job
EDL	00:48:07,423	00:48:08,447	| serial-s03-e05 |	But at the trial
EDL	00:48:08,447	00:48:11,519	| serial-s03-e05 |	The police made it obvious they did not feel the same way
EDL	00:48:13,567	00:48:14,847	| serial-s03-e05 |	You were in that room
EDL	00:48:14,847	00:48:17,151	| serial-s03-e05 |	What was the thing that seemed the weirdest U&I
EDL	00:48:18,431	00:48:22,015	| serial-s03-e05 |	Me at the table by myself and like 40 police officers on the other side
EDL	00:48:22,527	00:48:25,343	| serial-s03-e05 |	Wasn't it I mean it it was weird
EDL	00:48:25,855	00:48:27,903	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was strange you know and then I had
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:29,951	| serial-s03-e05 |	One detective they came and sat with me
EDL	00:48:31,231	00:48:32,255	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know that's weird
EDL	00:48:32,255	00:48:33,279	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean I know
EDL	00:48:34,559	00:48:35,071	| serial-s03-e05 |	I know that
EDL	00:48:36,607	00:48:40,191	| serial-s03-e05 |	But that's you see what I mean know how easy it can turn into
EDL	00:48:40,959	00:48:41,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	Us vs them
EDL	00:48:42,495	00:48:43,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	How they can
EDL	00:48:43,775	00:48:44,543	| serial-s03-e05 |	Alex
EDL	00:48:44,543	00:48:46,335	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it looks like we've turned on them
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:49,407	| serial-s03-e05 |	The all-around discomfort of that
EDL	00:48:49,407	00:48:50,943	| serial-s03-e05 |	The police feeling attacked
EDL	00:48:50,943	00:48:53,503	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian feeling is a glaring at him like he's a traitor
EDL	00:48:54,271	00:49:00,159	| serial-s03-e05 |	Plus the public perception that the government suits on the 9th floor will never really give their all to Prosecuting their Pals and blue
EDL	00:49:00,671	00:49:07,071	| serial-s03-e05 |	Cuyahoga County recently changed its policy local cases of police shootings are now farmed out to
EDL	00:49:07,071	00:49:08,351	| serial-s03-e05 |	Prosecutors from another County
EDL	00:49:09,375	00:49:12,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	Incidentally the judge in that case found the officer not guilty
EDL	00:49:13,471	00:49:17,311	| serial-s03-e05 |	And the judge was endorsed for re-election by the police union soon after
EDL	00:49:18,335	00:49:24,479	| serial-s03-e05 |	Neither outcome surprise Bryan
EDL	00:49:31,135	00:49:37,535	| serial-s03-e05 |	Back to the Dominique Williams case nightclub shooting
EDL	00:49:37,535	00:49:39,839	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's what they think Williams is sentence should be
EDL	00:49:40,351	00:49:42,399	| serial-s03-e05 |	I know you guys usually don't give a s*** but
EDL	00:49:43,679	00:49:46,751	| serial-s03-e05 |	What are you guys thinking for a number for Williams
EDL	00:49:53,407	00:49:55,455	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'm always open when I come to that
EDL	00:50:01,343	00:50:03,903	| serial-s03-e05 |	Our victim did something before this to
EDL	00:50:03,903	00:50:04,671	| serial-s03-e05 |	Bring us about
EDL	00:50:05,695	00:50:07,743	| serial-s03-e05 |	He may have I think the problem that
EDL	00:50:08,255	00:50:09,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	Dominique Casas
EDL	00:50:10,559	00:50:13,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean shoot some five times he's not armed
EDL	00:50:13,631	00:50:14,655	| serial-s03-e05 |	And then
EDL	00:50:14,655	00:50:19,263	| serial-s03-e05 |	He knowingly run from a police officer who's identifying himself and he has to
EDL	00:50:19,263	00:50:21,567	| serial-s03-e05 |	Audacity to turn and shoot a policeman
EDL	00:50:22,847	00:50:25,407	| serial-s03-e05 |	They're talking flat time and I I mean
EDL	00:50:25,407	00:50:25,919	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't know
EDL	00:50:26,431	00:50:27,711	| serial-s03-e05 |	A mile baseball saying
EDL	00:50:28,223	00:50:30,015	| serial-s03-e05 |	Twenties is a no-go I mean your
EDL	00:50:30,783	00:50:34,367	| serial-s03-e05 |	And now that the one witness has identified him and said he's the shooter
EDL	00:50:35,135	00:50:36,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	So I mean
EDL	00:50:36,415	00:50:39,743	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'm not on the case so I don't know if it's my place to speak but yeah 20 seems low
EDL	00:50:40,255	00:50:42,559	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's Chris Schroeder another prosecutor
EDL	00:50:42,559	00:50:44,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	I was waiting to talk to Brian about a different murder case
EDL	00:50:46,399	00:50:49,983	| serial-s03-e05 |	Executed this guy outside and then he shot the cop as he was fully
EDL	00:50:50,495	00:50:51,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	Then shoot twice at the officer
EDL	00:50:53,055	00:50:57,663	| serial-s03-e05 |	Find to Casey's on that side but I know the policeman thought he shot nor
EDL	00:50:58,175	00:51:00,735	| serial-s03-e05 |	But even even this
EDL	00:51:01,503	00:51:02,783	| serial-s03-e05 |	We brought in today
EDL	00:51:03,551	00:51:04,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	Chat history over
EDL	00:51:05,343	00:51:07,135	| serial-s03-e05 |	In traffic
EDL	00:51:09,183	00:51:11,487	| serial-s03-e05 |	So it's it's if you want flat time it says
EDL	00:51:11,999	00:51:12,767	| serial-s03-e05 |	At least 30
EDL	00:51:14,047	00:51:15,071	| serial-s03-e05 |	Right I mean
EDL	00:51:16,863	00:51:17,375	| serial-s03-e05 |	I would
EDL	00:51:20,959	00:51:21,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	Okay
EDL	00:51:23,519	00:51:25,311	| serial-s03-e05 |	After the detective left
EDL	00:51:25,311	00:51:27,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian and Chris Schroeder discussed a double homicide
EDL	00:51:28,383	00:51:30,175	| serial-s03-e05 |	Is that guy wants to plead
EDL	00:51:30,175	00:51:31,967	| serial-s03-e05 |	Chris said it'd have to be something like
EDL	00:51:31,967	00:51:32,735	| serial-s03-e05 |	40 to life
EDL	00:51:32,735	00:51:33,503	| serial-s03-e05 |	50 to life
EDL	00:51:34,271	00:51:36,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's going to have to be a high Highmark he said
EDL	00:51:37,599	00:51:40,159	| serial-s03-e05 |	I found these huge numbers shocking
EDL	00:51:40,159	00:51:41,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	I'm not even sure why
EDL	00:51:42,207	00:51:46,559	| serial-s03-e05 |	Obviously I know people get multi-decade sentences life sentences all the time
EDL	00:51:47,327	00:51:50,655	| serial-s03-e05 |	Maybe it was because I just been reading about Germany's sentencing practices
EDL	00:51:51,167	00:51:53,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	We're sentence for the very worst crimes
EDL	00:51:53,471	00:51:56,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	Usually last about 15 years at most
EDL	00:51:56,799	00:52:00,127	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or maybe because I've now seen and talked to people
EDL	00:52:00,127	00:52:01,919	| serial-s03-e05 |	Young young people
EDL	00:52:01,919	00:52:04,223	| serial-s03-e05 |	We were staring at the prospect of 10 years
EDL	00:52:04,223	00:52:05,247	| serial-s03-e05 |	14 years
EDL	00:52:05,247	00:52:06,783	| serial-s03-e05 |	Never desperate
EDL	00:52:08,063	00:52:10,111	| serial-s03-e05 |	And I talked about this for a while
EDL	00:52:10,879	00:52:13,951	| serial-s03-e05 |	I told him about my conversation with Charles Wakefield
EDL	00:52:13,951	00:52:14,975	| serial-s03-e05 |	Ariel's father
EDL	00:52:14,975	00:52:18,303	| serial-s03-e05 |	He wanted the person who killed aavielle to be punished
EDL	00:52:19,071	00:52:22,911	| serial-s03-e05 |	He also considered what happened to his daughter a quote-unquote accident
EDL	00:52:23,423	00:52:26,495	| serial-s03-e05 |	He knows whoever shot her didn't set out that day to murder a baby
EDL	00:52:27,007	00:52:27,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was a mistake
EDL	00:52:28,799	00:52:31,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	By Justice Center standards his Vengeance was very conservative
EDL	00:52:32,383	00:52:35,967	| serial-s03-e05 |	I can't remember how it came up at so she's kind of throughout the number like 10 years
EDL	00:52:36,735	00:52:40,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	And I was really surprised cuz I was like you don't person get convicted for that murder
EDL	00:52:40,831	00:52:43,135	| serial-s03-e05 |	There's no way 10 years is coming out the other end like
EDL	00:52:43,647	00:52:46,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know anybody who's interested in me like that that seemed
EDL	00:52:47,231	00:52:49,535	| serial-s03-e05 |	She could balance the scales in his head
EDL	00:52:50,047	00:52:52,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	With that with a ten year sentence like that seemed about right to
EDL	00:52:52,863	00:52:55,679	| serial-s03-e05 |	Do you think I'm 10 years for a little for killing
EDL	00:52:55,679	00:52:56,191	| serial-s03-e05 |	Kelly kid
EDL	00:52:57,983	00:52:58,751	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean
EDL	00:53:05,151	00:53:07,455	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't know what the fair is such a weird
EDL	00:53:07,455	00:53:11,807	| serial-s03-e05 |	Saying cuz I feel like I'm a person right to like me
EDL	00:53:11,807	00:53:12,319	| serial-s03-e05 |	Say it
EDL	00:53:13,855	00:53:15,391	| serial-s03-e05 |	An 18 year old or 7
EDL	00:53:15,391	00:53:16,159	| serial-s03-e05 |	18 year old
EDL	00:53:16,159	00:53:19,231	| serial-s03-e05 |	Maybe 10 years is fair Because by the time that person is
EDL	00:53:19,743	00:53:22,047	| serial-s03-e05 |	Closing in on 30 years old
EDL	00:53:22,047	00:53:24,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	Totally changed and matured and like realize like
EDL	00:53:24,607	00:53:27,679	| serial-s03-e05 |	Woohoo I'm a lot of horrible choices
EDL	00:53:27,679	00:53:28,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't know that
EDL	00:53:28,703	00:53:29,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	You're going to
EDL	00:53:29,471	00:53:30,751	| serial-s03-e05 |	Have a difference between
EDL	00:53:30,751	00:53:35,615	| serial-s03-e05 |	30 and 50 or 30 and 60 or 30 and 70 in terms of a danger to the
EDL	00:53:35,615	00:53:36,383	| serial-s03-e05 |	Republic
EDL	00:53:36,383	00:53:38,431	| serial-s03-e05 |	I did that but that shouldn't be some aspect of
EDL	00:53:38,431	00:53:39,199	| serial-s03-e05 |	Of
EDL	00:53:39,199	00:53:40,479	| serial-s03-e05 |	A significant part
EDL	00:53:40,479	00:53:40,991	| serial-s03-e05 |	Report to
EDL	00:53:41,759	00:53:42,783	| serial-s03-e05 |	And I don't know that
EDL	00:53:42,783	00:53:47,135	| serial-s03-e05 |	Ten years after taking a life of somebody is a not I just don't I mean
EDL	00:53:48,415	00:53:50,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	I understand that there's going to be
EDL	00:53:50,463	00:53:56,095	| serial-s03-e05 |	There is going to be that change and hopefully there is there's that real late realization like in your late twenties or something like holyshit I
EDL	00:53:56,607	00:53:57,631	| serial-s03-e05 |	F***** up
EDL	00:53:57,631	00:53:58,399	| serial-s03-e05 |	Yeah I f***** up
EDL	00:53:59,167	00:53:59,679	| serial-s03-e05 |	But
EDL	00:54:00,447	00:54:01,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't know that that's
EDL	00:54:01,727	00:54:07,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	Just because you have that realization then you should be able to get out there should be some aspect of a punishment with the Punisher
EDL	00:54:08,383	00:54:11,199	| serial-s03-e05 |	For I don't know any years and years for like
EDL	00:54:12,735	00:54:14,783	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's not just that it was a baby
EDL	00:54:14,783	00:54:15,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	Okay
EDL	00:54:15,551	00:54:16,575	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was a
EDL	00:54:17,087	00:54:20,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	Blatant disregard for everybody's safety on that street
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:21,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	Thank God we all sing
EDL	00:54:21,439	00:54:22,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	Make a chat okay
EDL	00:54:23,487	00:54:25,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	At this point I feel like even I need a reminder
EDL	00:54:26,303	00:54:28,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	It is not Ryan's job to sentence anyone
EDL	00:54:28,607	00:54:29,375	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's for the judge
EDL	00:54:30,143	00:54:33,215	| serial-s03-e05 |	But certainly Brian is teeing up the sentences people get
EDL	00:54:33,727	00:54:35,775	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's thinking about sentences
EDL	00:54:35,775	00:54:38,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was also striking to learn what Brian was not thinking about
EDL	00:54:39,103	00:54:39,871	| serial-s03-e05 |	Deterring crime
EDL	00:54:40,639	00:54:42,431	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or who exactly is getting locked up
EDL	00:54:43,199	00:54:46,271	| serial-s03-e05 |	He doesn't come to work every day thinking about criminal justice policy
EDL	00:54:47,039	00:54:48,063	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's not what's guiding him
EDL	00:54:50,367	00:54:51,135	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know
EDL	00:54:51,135	00:54:56,511	| serial-s03-e05 |	Deterrence and laws and how to fix communities and all that type of stuff like
EDL	00:54:57,023	00:54:57,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	I try not to
EDL	00:54:58,303	00:55:03,167	| serial-s03-e05 |	I kind of think of it that way I think it's just we're better off worrying about our
EDL	00:55:03,167	00:55:04,447	| serial-s03-e05 |	Are victims here
EDL	00:55:04,447	00:55:05,215	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because
EDL	00:55:05,215	00:55:05,983	| serial-s03-e05 |	When I'm
EDL	00:55:06,495	00:55:08,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	Talking to somebody that
EDL	00:55:08,031	00:55:12,895	| serial-s03-e05 |	They had their son killed or their daughter killed her mother raped and murdered
EDL	00:55:12,895	00:55:14,175	| serial-s03-e05 |	They don't care about the deterrent
EDL	00:55:14,943	00:55:16,479	| serial-s03-e05 |	They don't give a s*** about
EDL	00:55:16,479	00:55:18,015	| serial-s03-e05 |	Somebody else's kid or whatever
EDL	00:55:18,527	00:55:20,063	| serial-s03-e05 |	They care about what am I doing for them
EDL	00:55:20,575	00:55:21,343	| serial-s03-e05 |	And
EDL	00:55:21,343	00:55:22,879	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's what I that's how I try to keep it
EDL	00:55:23,903	00:55:25,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	So I try to think of what can I
EDL	00:55:25,951	00:55:30,303	| serial-s03-e05 |	The best thing I can do for these people you know sometimes it's a play sometimes going to try whatever
EDL	00:55:31,839	00:55:32,607	| serial-s03-e05 |	Hit some
EDL	00:55:34,911	00:55:39,263	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't know that we ever if we deter people we hope we do I mean that's why
EDL	00:55:39,263	00:55:41,823	| serial-s03-e05 |	We have some of these sentences and things like that but
EDL	00:55:42,335	00:55:47,455	| serial-s03-e05 |	And we've got gun specs now for people that if you commit a crime with a gun you're going away from our prison
EDL	00:55:47,967	00:55:52,063	| serial-s03-e05 |	And we have one of your guns back some 3 year and 5 year and 8 year specs and
EDL	00:55:52,831	00:55:57,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	I think they're great but I don't know if it's a limited amount of guns that are on the streets you know I mean
EDL	00:55:58,719	00:56:01,279	| serial-s03-e05 |	But isn't the touring the night sky from picking up a gun I don't know
EDL	00:56:02,303	00:56:06,143	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian is using all the legal and procedural tools at his disposal
EDL	00:56:06,143	00:56:07,423	| serial-s03-e05 |	All the tools we've given him
EDL	00:56:07,935	00:56:08,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	Resolve case
EDL	00:56:09,215	00:56:10,495	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mostly through please
EDL	00:56:11,263	00:56:14,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	But he doesn't know if what he's doing is making Cleveland any safer
EDL	00:56:15,615	00:56:19,199	| serial-s03-e05 |	You can't consult research that'll tell him what sentences equal what result
EDL	00:56:19,711	00:56:24,575	| serial-s03-e05 |	Or a Statewide database showing whether sentences are being applied equally without racial bias
EDL	00:56:25,087	00:56:31,487	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because and I know I mentioned this before but it Bears repeating because it is a massive black hole in our own understanding of
EDL	00:56:31,487	00:56:33,279	| serial-s03-e05 |	Marrone criminal justice system
EDL	00:56:33,279	00:56:37,631	| serial-s03-e05 |	But there is no comprehensive data on sentencing we don't keep track
EDL	00:56:38,399	00:56:44,799	| serial-s03-e05 |	What we do know is that overall more and more prosecution's longer and longer prison sentences
EDL	00:56:44,799	00:56:47,615	| serial-s03-e05 |	Well they do have some effect on crime
EDL	00:56:47,615	00:56:48,895	| serial-s03-e05 |	But not that much
EDL	00:56:48,895	00:56:51,711	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's very little bang for such a huge box
EDL	00:56:52,735	00:56:57,087	| serial-s03-e05 |	That's why Brian concentrates on the only result he can really see day today
EDL	00:56:57,599	00:57:00,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	We just want some measure of Peace descends on a crushed family
EDL	00:57:00,927	00:57:02,975	| serial-s03-e05 |	So that's what he aims for
EDL	00:57:02,975	00:57:06,815	| serial-s03-e05 |	A punishment big enough to trigger the healing power of Retribution
EDL	00:57:07,583	00:57:10,143	| serial-s03-e05 |	I mean that's the way you have to look at it he said
EDL	00:57:10,655	00:57:12,703	| serial-s03-e05 |	Because if you look at it any other way
EDL	00:57:12,703	00:57:17,055	| serial-s03-e05 |	Did lose your mind
EDL	00:57:23,711	00:57:30,111	| serial-s03-e05 |	Dominique Williams wasn't going to agree to 30 years flat time he also rejected an offer of 20
EDL	00:57:30,111	00:57:30,879	| serial-s03-e05 |	Need a life
EDL	00:57:30,879	00:57:33,183	| serial-s03-e05 |	Instead he took it to trial
EDL	00:57:33,183	00:57:34,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	He was convicted easily
EDL	00:57:35,231	00:57:36,511	| serial-s03-e05 |	He's now serving sentence
EDL	00:57:36,511	00:57:37,535	| serial-s03-e05 |	35 years to life
EDL	00:57:39,327	00:57:41,375	| serial-s03-e05 |	And the grand jury vote on the abdul-rahman case
EDL	00:57:41,887	00:57:43,935	| serial-s03-e05 |	They know build the voluntary manslaughter
EDL	00:57:44,447	00:57:48,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	They did not think he should be charged with a crime for shooting and you're easily
EDL	00:57:48,799	00:57:50,079	| serial-s03-e05 |	Seems they decided
EDL	00:57:50,079	00:57:50,847	| serial-s03-e05 |	It was self-defense
EDL	00:57:52,383	00:57:57,247	| serial-s03-e05 |	After spending about 7 weeks in jail this rahkman pleaded guilty to illegally having a gun
EDL	00:57:57,247	00:57:59,039	| serial-s03-e05 |	He was sentenced to two years probation
EDL	00:58:00,319	00:58:03,903	| serial-s03-e05 |	Brian met with Andrew Easley family to tell them about the grand jury vote
EDL	00:58:04,671	00:58:06,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	He said they were unhappy about it
EDL	00:58:06,463	00:58:07,743	| serial-s03-e05 |	But that he thought they understood it
EDL	00:58:09,279	00:58:12,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	Many months later I interviewed and release older sister Jacqueline
EDL	00:58:13,375	00:58:14,399	| serial-s03-e05 |	She did not understand it
EDL	00:58:15,423	00:58:17,471	| serial-s03-e05 |	Should watch the security tapes from the bus
EDL	00:58:17,983	00:58:22,591	| serial-s03-e05 |	She didn't understand why the prosecutors didn't charge the two people whom she thought inside of the thing
EDL	00:58:23,359	00:58:26,431	| serial-s03-e05 |	Andrew's girlfriend Rachel who kicked Mr Rahman off the bus
EDL	00:58:26,943	00:58:29,759	| serial-s03-e05 |	And the younger man who'd initially believed Mr rahkman
EDL	00:58:30,783	00:58:33,343	| serial-s03-e05 |	And she didn't understand why mr. Rahman himself wasn't charged
EDL	00:58:34,367	00:58:37,439	| serial-s03-e05 |	She didn't think he was acting in self-defense when he shot her brother
EDL	00:58:37,951	00:58:41,279	| serial-s03-e05 |	The two people that did put their hands on their shoes
EDL	00:58:42,303	00:58:44,095	| serial-s03-e05 |	So you had every reason to shoot
EDL	00:58:44,607	00:58:45,631	| serial-s03-e05 |	If it was self-defense
EDL	00:58:46,911	00:58:49,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	You know they come to Peyton you slapping you kicking you
EDL	00:58:50,495	00:58:52,031	| serial-s03-e05 |	Okay yes offense
EDL	00:58:52,031	00:58:53,055	| serial-s03-e05 |	Running touch
EDL	00:58:53,567	00:58:55,103	| serial-s03-e05 |	My brother and say one word to you
EDL	00:58:55,871	00:59:01,503	| serial-s03-e05 |	Could you understand how a grand jury could watch those same tapes and come to a
EDL	00:59:02,271	00:59:03,807	| serial-s03-e05 |	Different conclusion than you did
EDL	00:59:04,831	00:59:05,343	| serial-s03-e05 |	Nope
EDL	00:59:06,879	00:59:09,183	| serial-s03-e05 |	We didn't ask what how you know
EDL	00:59:09,183	00:59:10,975	| serial-s03-e05 |	Why but you know they really that
EDL	00:59:11,487	00:59:13,791	| serial-s03-e05 |	Give me an answer ASAP now all we do is present
EDL	00:59:14,303	00:59:15,583	| serial-s03-e05 |	And it's up to the grand jury
EDL	00:59:16,607	00:59:17,119	| serial-s03-e05 |	It's all I got
EDL	00:59:20,959	00:59:21,727	| serial-s03-e05 |	Now
EDL	00:59:22,495	00:59:24,287	| serial-s03-e05 |	I don't know I mean I know a lot
EDL	00:59:24,287	00:59:25,311	| serial-s03-e05 |	A lot about
EDL	00:59:25,823	00:59:28,127	| serial-s03-e05 |	Did you justice system politics
EDL	00:59:28,127	00:59:28,895	| serial-s03-e05 |	But now
EDL	00:59:31,199	00:59:34,015	| serial-s03-e05 |	I asked Jackie what would have been different for her family
EDL	00:59:34,015	00:59:35,551	| serial-s03-e05 |	What would have felt different
EDL	00:59:35,551	00:59:38,367	| serial-s03-e05 |	Mr. Rahman had been indicted for murder or manslaughter
EDL	00:59:38,879	00:59:39,903	| serial-s03-e05 |	She couldn't say exactly
EDL	00:59:40,927	00:59:42,463	| serial-s03-e05 |	It might have helped some she said
EDL	00:59:42,975	00:59:44,511	| serial-s03-e05 |	But it wouldn't have helped a great lot
EDL	00:59:45,791	00:59:47,583	| serial-s03-e05 |	Either way her brother would still be gone
EDL	00:59:48,095	00:59:50,911	| serial-s03-e05 |	The pain of that would still be radiating through her family
EDL	00:59:51,935	00:59:53,215	| serial-s03-e05 |	Even so she said
EDL	00:59:53,727	00:59:54,239	| serial-s03-e05 |	She wanted it
EDL	01:00:06,527	01:00:12,415	| serial-s03-e05 |	The best outcome you can hope for when a crime happens to you is that your pain is acknowledged
EDL	01:00:12,415	01:00:14,975	| serial-s03-e05 |	But the person who harmed you is punished
EDL	01:00:14,975	01:00:20,863	| serial-s03-e05 |	That you get some reparation and believe it or not. Trifecta does happen
EDL	01:00:20,863	01:00:23,423	| serial-s03-e05 |	We met someone next time
