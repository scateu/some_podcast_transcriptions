EDL	00:01:08,608	00:01:14,752	| serial-s02-e10 |	In the old days deserters Rashad
EDL	00:01:18,080	00:01:22,432	| serial-s02-e10 |	Ever since I've been reporting this story when I've asked people people on all sides of this thing
EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:25,248	| serial-s02-e10 |	What bothers them the most about those case
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:26,272	| serial-s02-e10 |	Gosei
EDL	00:01:26,272	00:01:28,064	| serial-s02-e10 |	I wish it hadn't gotten so political
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,856	| serial-s02-e10 |	Sucks that I got so political
EDL	00:01:30,880	00:01:33,184	| serial-s02-e10 |	Usually I just know I'd like in politics
EDL	00:01:33,696	00:01:37,280	| serial-s02-e10 |	Strafer bows just one more thing for Democrats and Republicans to yell at each other about
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:41,888	| serial-s02-e10 |	Then when I really looked at it
EDL	00:01:42,400	00:01:43,680	| serial-s02-e10 |	I like wait a minute
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,728	| serial-s02-e10 |	Was it inevitable
EDL	00:01:45,728	00:01:47,264	| serial-s02-e10 |	I got this combative
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because
EDL	00:01:48,800	00:01:50,848	| serial-s02-e10 |	Maybe it could have gone another way
EDL	00:01:57,760	00:02:01,600	| serial-s02-e10 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:03,136	| serial-s02-e10 |	One story told week by week
EDL	00:02:03,136	00:02:03,648	| serial-s02-e10 |	I'm Sarah Kane
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,024	| serial-s02-e10 |	David trade

EDL	00:02:15,424	00:02:17,728	| serial-s02-e10 |	And even though the president never called bow a hero
EDL	00:02:18,240	00:02:21,312	| serial-s02-e10 |	The heft of announcing it at the White House in the Rose Garden
EDL	00:02:21,824	00:02:23,616	| serial-s02-e10 |	Pump of it has cameras
EDL	00:02:24,128	00:02:27,712	| serial-s02-e10 |	It felt like the president was communicating something heroic
EDL	00:02:27,712	00:02:28,480	| serial-s02-e10 |	Triumph
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:31,296	| serial-s02-e10 |	Which if you're someone who served in the military
EDL	00:02:31,808	00:02:33,856	| serial-s02-e10 |	Maybe someone who went looking for Bose
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:35,904	| serial-s02-e10 |	That message was bad enough
EDL	00:02:36,928	00:02:37,696	| serial-s02-e10 |	But then
EDL	00:02:37,696	00:02:38,464	| serial-s02-e10 |	Very next
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:39,232	| serial-s02-e10 |	Day

EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:44,096	| serial-s02-e10 |	She was on one of the Sunday news shows
EDL	00:02:44,608	00:02:46,144	| serial-s02-e10 |	The host George Stephanopoulos
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,424	| serial-s02-e10 |	Ask her about though
EDL	00:02:47,936	00:02:54,336	| serial-s02-e10 |	Finally on this point I start charging for a lot of questions about how we originally was capturing whether or not he had a deserted have left
EDL	00:02:54,336	00:03:00,736	| serial-s02-e10 |	I his post is that going to be investigated and it was found that he did indeed I leave his post will he be discipline
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,016	| serial-s02-e10 |	Lindor's already paid the price
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:06,368	| serial-s02-e10 |	Certainly anybody who's been held
EDL	00:03:06,368	00:03:12,768	| serial-s02-e10 |	In those conditions in captivity for 5 years is paid and extraordinary price but that that is really
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,560	| serial-s02-e10 |	Not the point the point is that he's back
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:20,960	| serial-s02-e10 |	He's going to be safely reunited with his family he served the United States with honor and distinction
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:21,984	| serial-s02-e10 |	And we'll have a map

EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:31,456	| serial-s02-e10 |	Talati military people it was like the administration had reached out of their televisions and giving them the finger
EDL	00:03:31,456	00:03:32,480	| serial-s02-e10 |	Right in our living room
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:39,136	| serial-s02-e10 |	And then it became this like oh he's a hero who served with honor and distinction it what what really made me angry
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:39,904	| serial-s02-e10 |	Facts about
EDL	00:03:40,928	00:03:42,208	| serial-s02-e10 |	Lester's Auto distinction
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,256	| serial-s02-e10 |	That I hit pretty hard
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:45,792	| serial-s02-e10 |	I was irate it's just like
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:47,328	| serial-s02-e10 |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:03:48,352	00:03:53,984	| serial-s02-e10 |	Some government officials were saying
EDL	00:03:53,984	00:03:55,264	| serial-s02-e10 |	At the circumstances
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:57,056	| serial-s02-e10 |	Sergeant Bergdahl capture weren't clear
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:59,104	| serial-s02-e10 |	And the soldiers were like

EDL	00:04:39,807	00:04:42,879	| serial-s02-e10 |	Jessie's work for some big-name Republicans json Grinnell work together
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	And they said if you want to go on TV

EDL	00:04:53,375	00:04:54,911	| serial-s02-e10 |	First stop was Fox News
EDL	00:04:55,423	00:04:58,239	| serial-s02-e10 |	Cody let me start with you do you believe that Bowe Bergdahl
EDL	00:04:58,751	00:04:59,263	| serial-s02-e10 |	Deserted
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,543	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yes
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,591	| serial-s02-e10 |	I do believe he deserted without a doubt in my mind
EDL	00:05:03,359	00:05:06,175	| serial-s02-e10 |	The other guy on TV with Cody that day was Gerald Sutton
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:08,223	| serial-s02-e10 |	He was also in Bozeman
EDL	00:05:08,223	00:05:08,991	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is friends with bow
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:12,831	| serial-s02-e10 |	He told me Cody had contacted him and said we had to do something
EDL	00:05:12,831	00:05:13,599	| serial-s02-e10 |	We help me
EDL	00:05:14,879	00:05:17,951	| serial-s02-e10 |	Use before jail said he had tried to tell people would have gone down
EDL	00:05:17,951	00:05:18,975	| serial-s02-e10 |	About walked away
EDL	00:05:19,487	00:05:20,767	| serial-s02-e10 |	He wrote something on the Internet
EDL	00:05:20,767	00:05:21,791	| serial-s02-e10 |	Two others had to
EDL	00:05:22,303	00:05:24,351	| serial-s02-e10 |	He said nobody seem to pay much attention back then
EDL	00:05:24,863	00:05:26,655	| serial-s02-e10 |	And he worried the same thing would happen now
EDL	00:05:27,679	00:05:29,471	| serial-s02-e10 |	I didn't think anyone could take a seriously
EDL	00:05:33,055	00:05:35,871	| serial-s02-e10 |	I guess the reason why we had so many people behind us
EDL	00:05:36,383	00:05:38,943	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is that if one of us just came out and said it then
EDL	00:05:39,455	00:05:42,527	| serial-s02-e10 |	People just Glycol used to describe a person so maybe if
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,063	| serial-s02-e10 |	The entire platoon came out
EDL	00:05:44,575	00:05:48,159	| serial-s02-e10 |	And said they aren't that maybe it would be taken seriously for once
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:55,071	| serial-s02-e10 |	By 6 members of Bowe Bergdahl Splatoon guys thank you all so much for being here

EDL	00:06:04,543	00:06:06,335	| serial-s02-e10 |	ABC MSNBC
EDL	00:06:06,335	00:06:07,615	| serial-s02-e10 |	We're hearing a lot about him
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:10,175	| serial-s02-e10 |	From his fellow platoon members
EDL	00:06:10,175	00:06:13,503	| serial-s02-e10 |	Would you like to see a dishonorable discharge for him
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,551	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yes yes he needs to be held
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:21,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	100% accountable for what he did with him in Afghanistan
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:23,743	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is he deserted us
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:27,327	| serial-s02-e10 |	In the middle of Afghanistan Taliban
EDL	00:06:27,327	00:06:29,375	| serial-s02-e10 |	Among the latest they were a lot more
EDL	00:06:29,887	00:06:31,679	| serial-s02-e10 |	Like to say
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:32,703	| serial-s02-e10 |	Fitzgerald something again
EDL	00:06:33,215	00:06:35,263	| serial-s02-e10 |	And more precise and
EDL	00:06:35,263	00:06:36,543	| serial-s02-e10 |	They seem more entertaining to
EDL	00:06:37,055	00:06:40,127	| serial-s02-e10 |	With me I'm very Bland
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,943	| serial-s02-e10 |	Gerald didn't want to go on any more shows
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:43,967	| serial-s02-e10 |	Anyways limits
EDL	00:06:43,967	00:06:45,247	| serial-s02-e10 |	And he wanted to stick to the facts
EDL	00:06:45,759	00:06:47,551	| serial-s02-e10 |	No pinyin no speculation
EDL	00:06:47,551	00:06:49,087	| serial-s02-e10 |	And I don't want to
EDL	00:06:49,087	00:06:55,231	| serial-s02-e10 |	Even though it's like 30 seconds Snippets or whatever here in there like I don't want someone just to be like what the fuc
EDL	00:06:59,327	00:07:04,703	| serial-s02-e10 |	The problem was that maybe Gerald was like Bo a fact-based dude
EDL	00:07:04,703	00:07:07,519	| serial-s02-e10 |	But he was just no match for the Juggernaut that was now up and rolling
EDL	00:07:08,287	00:07:10,591	| serial-s02-e10 |	Fox News especially with all over it
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:13,663	| serial-s02-e10 |	In fact just before they had that panel of six guys from seconds
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:21,087	| serial-s02-e10 |	They dared an exclusive report breaking tonight we are learning exclusive and dramatic new details about sergeant
EDL	00:07:23,647	00:07:30,047	| serial-s02-e10 |	Including reports that he became a Muslim and declared himself a warrior for
EDL	00:07:30,047	00:07:30,559	| serial-s02-e10 |	For Islam
EDL	00:07:31,327	00:07:35,679	| serial-s02-e10 |	The story was based on frankly bulshit Intel from a discredited source
EDL	00:07:35,679	00:07:37,215	| serial-s02-e10 |	But now it was out there

EDL	00:07:39,775	00:07:41,823	| serial-s02-e10 |	Next the politics of it all.
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:42,335	| serial-s02-e10 |	Became the story
EDL	00:07:43,103	00:07:45,919	| serial-s02-e10 |	The Obama Administration was using Bose trade
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:46,687	| serial-s02-e10 |	Political purposes
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,759	| serial-s02-e10 |	Note the right was using this for political
EDL	00:07:50,527	00:07:52,831	| serial-s02-e10 |	Using these former platoon mates for political
EDL	00:07:52,831	00:07:57,439	| serial-s02-e10 |	After all Ric grenell the media guy helping them he was a big Republican strategist
EDL	00:07:58,207	00:07:59,743	| serial-s02-e10 |	Again for guys like Gerald
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,767	| serial-s02-e10 |	None of that was the point
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,583	| serial-s02-e10 |	They weren't trying to attack the president
EDL	00:08:03,583	00:08:04,863	| serial-s02-e10 |	Weren't even trying to attack me
EDL	00:08:05,887	00:08:09,983	| serial-s02-e10 |	Even Cody full and often on the topic of bow
EDL	00:08:09,983	00:08:12,031	| serial-s02-e10 |	He testified at a congressional hearing
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:14,847	| serial-s02-e10 |	You want to make sure bow was held accountable for what he did
EDL	00:08:15,359	00:08:18,943	| serial-s02-e10 |	But even he resisted Obama bathing by Republican congressman
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:24,063	| serial-s02-e10 |	If you could say anything to President Obama regarding this trade what would you say
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:31,487	| serial-s02-e10 |	Fair enough mr. Wallace you're forewarned same question
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:34,815	| serial-s02-e10 |	You say that same hearing Mike Wallace also test
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:39,423	| serial-s02-e10 |	He told the committee he was there before them in part because of the Rose Garden
EDL	00:08:40,447	00:08:42,751	| serial-s02-e10 |	Mike's a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,519	| serial-s02-e10 |	Former Green Beret
EDL	00:08:44,031	00:08:46,335	| serial-s02-e10 |	Cuban commander of army Special Forces
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,639	| serial-s02-e10 |	He said what I'm lots of missions looking for bow
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:51,199	| serial-s02-e10 |	For that he worked in the bush White House
EDL	00:08:51,199	00:08:54,271	| serial-s02-e10 |	The special advisor to Dick Cheney on South Asia and counterterrorism
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:08:57,599	| serial-s02-e10 |	What are red Mike's testimony and Cody
EDL	00:08:58,111	00:09:01,951	| serial-s02-e10 |	I like all this is because of a 5-minute ceremony in the Rose Garden
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:03,487	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because of how it looked
EDL	00:09:04,511	00:09:05,791	| serial-s02-e10 |	Ask Mike about that
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:06,815	| serial-s02-e10 |	And kind of schooled me
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:08,863	| serial-s02-e10 |	Are you saying like
EDL	00:09:10,143	00:09:12,703	| serial-s02-e10 |	But none of us would even be talking about this if
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:13,727	| serial-s02-e10 |	Basically
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:14,239	| serial-s02-e10 |	Do you know
EDL	00:09:14,751	00:09:15,775	| serial-s02-e10 |	The president hadn't
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:19,359	| serial-s02-e10 |	Done that Rose Garden thing and imma try to politicize it
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:25,247	| serial-s02-e10 |	I will answer I will yeah I mean I mean
EDL	00:09:26,015	00:09:28,319	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's all about the Optics
EDL	00:09:28,319	00:09:32,671	| serial-s02-e10 |	Another words or is this like what I mean are you just saying like I wouldn't even be
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:34,207	| serial-s02-e10 |	I wouldn't got in my legs
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,743	| serial-s02-e10 |	Feathers ruffled about this if
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:43,167	| serial-s02-e10 |	There had I don't think I can I don't want to speak for anyone else I don't believe that
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:44,191	| serial-s02-e10 |	I would have been
EDL	00:09:44,191	00:09:44,703	| serial-s02-e10 |	Asvogue
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,775	| serial-s02-e10 |	That was that was a
EDL	00:09:47,775	00:09:54,175	| serial-s02-e10 |	Justin a incredibly tone-deaf move on the part of the White House I think it shows at the it how disconnected they
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:54,687	| serial-s02-e10 |	They are from
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:10:00,063	| serial-s02-e10 |	Both the Pentagon and I think it is truly lacking understanding the military culture
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:02,367	| serial-s02-e10 |	When you have the National Security advisor
EDL	00:10:02,367	00:10:06,719	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yoanna civil-military system or them who the military has to listen to
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:09,535	| serial-s02-e10 |	Essentially knife handing on National Television
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:12,351	| serial-s02-e10 |	Sending the signal that this man was honorable
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:19,263	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yo I was afraid that it would all be forgotten in that this was going to be politically swept under the
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:19,775	| serial-s02-e10 |	Carpet
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:23,359	| serial-s02-e10 |	Mike and to a lot of people watching and listening to the president that
EDL	00:10:24,127	00:10:25,407	| serial-s02-e10 |	It wasn't just what he said
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,199	| serial-s02-e10 |	I'm glad those back
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:28,735	| serial-s02-e10 |	We're committed to ending this war
EDL	00:10:28,735	00:10:30,783	| serial-s02-e10 |	We support reconciliation
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:32,575	| serial-s02-e10 |	We're committed to closing gitmo
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:34,367	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's not just that he said all that
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,415	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's what the president didn't say
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,719	| serial-s02-e10 |	That's what was glaring
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:42,047	| serial-s02-e10 |	No recognition or even mention of
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:47,679	| serial-s02-e10 |	We understand there were some irregularities or some question about his disappearance
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:50,495	| serial-s02-e10 |	And I want to assure all veterans
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:57,407	| serial-s02-e10 |	All former pows and everyone involved with a search that we will objectively in Fairly get to the bottom of
EDL	00:10:57,407	00:10:58,431	| serial-s02-e10 |	What happened at a time
EDL	00:10:59,711	00:11:02,527	| serial-s02-e10 |	Daylight I felt that Justice
EDL	00:11:02,527	00:11:04,063	| serial-s02-e10 |	Was not going to even be a
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:04,575	| serial-s02-e10 |	Attempted
EDL	00:11:11,999	00:11:15,839	| serial-s02-e10 |	I've asked many people Lo these many months in other parts of government
EDL	00:11:16,351	00:11:17,631	| serial-s02-e10 |	What was the White House thank you
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:19,167	| serial-s02-e10 |	Why they do it
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:20,959	| serial-s02-e10 |	And everyone I've asked
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:25,055	| serial-s02-e10 |	I don't know what happened over there that day but
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,335	| serial-s02-e10 |	I'm sure they regret it now
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:28,383	| serial-s02-e10 |	I do regret it
EDL	00:11:28,383	00:11:30,943	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because this Rose Garden event
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:33,247	| serial-s02-e10 |	Picked up so much anger and resentment
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:36,319	| serial-s02-e10 |	Apparently it was put together kind of spur-of-the-moment
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:39,391	| serial-s02-e10 |	What are those things where you like I know let's have a party at the Great
EDL	00:11:40,159	00:11:41,439	| serial-s02-e10 |	Except big
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,207	| serial-s02-e10 |	That mistake
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| serial-s02-e10 |	None of it
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,023	| serial-s02-e10 |	President speech
EDL	00:11:45,023	00:11:46,559	| serial-s02-e10 |	The podium the Rose Garden
EDL	00:11:46,559	00:11:49,375	| serial-s02-e10 |	None of it was the original plan for how to announce his trade
EDL	00:11:50,143	00:11:52,447	| serial-s02-e10 |	The original plan was a much quieter affair
EDL	00:11:54,239	00:11:59,615	| serial-s02-e10 |	Don't we talk to me on tape about this but off tape I talked to several people who worked in the White House at the
EDL	00:11:59,615	00:12:02,687	| serial-s02-e10 |	Time they also very similar stories about what happened that day
EDL	00:12:03,455	00:12:04,479	| serial-s02-e10 |	So this is their version
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:05,503	| serial-s02-e10 |	Haircuts
EDL	00:12:06,783	00:12:09,855	| serial-s02-e10 |	Rose rescue operation was touch-and-go for several days
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:13,183	| serial-s02-e10 |	Amber the C-17 sitting and sitting at Guantanamo
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:15,487	| serial-s02-e10 |	It was high wire the whole thing
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:17,023	| serial-s02-e10 |	It all went smoothly in the end
EDL	00:12:17,023	00:12:20,351	| serial-s02-e10 |	But leading up to it you don't know if the Special Operations guys
EDL	00:12:20,351	00:12:23,679	| serial-s02-e10 |	Are helicopters going to crash if they're going to get into a firefight
EDL	00:12:23,679	00:12:26,239	| serial-s02-e10 |	Turn off Bose going to get hurt or killed during the rescue
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:29,311	| serial-s02-e10 |	How to be Stone secret the whole time
EDL	00:12:29,311	00:12:32,895	| serial-s02-e10 |	The qataris have made it clear that even a word of this gets out beforehand
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:33,919	| serial-s02-e10 |	The deal is off
EDL	00:12:34,943	00:12:38,271	| serial-s02-e10 |	People in the White House said this might be the last real chance to get bow back
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:42,623	| serial-s02-e10 |	How much of the week before the trade inside the White House
EDL	00:12:42,623	00:12:43,903	| serial-s02-e10 |	What's the national security offices
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	They've been working around the clock
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:49,535	| serial-s02-e10 |	If I see the scene in the movie what is it like
EDL	00:12:49,535	00:12:53,375	| serial-s02-e10 |	Mostly I was sleeping under my desk for 4 days
EDL	00:12:53,375	00:12:54,655	| serial-s02-e10 |	Chicken curry
EDL	00:12:55,423	00:12:56,447	| serial-s02-e10 |	That's Jeff Eggers
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,727	| serial-s02-e10 |	He was a special assistant
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,775	| serial-s02-e10 |	The president for National Security affairs
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:03,871	| serial-s02-e10 |	He's also a retired Navy SEAL he deployed to Iraq he works in Afghanistan
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:07,711	| serial-s02-e10 |	Even helping coordinate those recovery with the dod and the state of
EDL	00:13:08,735	00:13:10,015	| serial-s02-e10 |	Cuz it started to gain
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:17,183	| serial-s02-e10 |	Momentum that week and it was your are you are you being euphemistic you're sleeping under your desk or you're actually sitting on
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:17,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	On your desk
EDL	00:13:18,207	00:13:21,023	| serial-s02-e10 |	No I was actually sleeping under my desk will actually is next to my desk
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:23,327	| serial-s02-e10 |	For 4 days
EDL	00:13:23,839	00:13:24,351	| serial-s02-e10 |	I think
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:27,167	| serial-s02-e10 |	That was also the week that the president made some
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,447	| serial-s02-e10 |	Significant
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,775	| serial-s02-e10 |	Announcements about trip decisions in Afghanistan that was actually a big week
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,591	| serial-s02-e10 |	It was a timing of that just coincidental
EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,639	| serial-s02-e10 |	Those two really Continental
EDL	00:13:37,663	00:13:41,503	| serial-s02-e10 |	President Obama had already done a more solemn Rose Garden event that we
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:43,807	| serial-s02-e10 |	May 27th 2014
EDL	00:13:44,319	00:13:50,463	| serial-s02-e10 |	Announce the big drawdown of troops by the end of the year and a plan to get out of Afghanistan fully by the end of 26
EDL	00:13:51,487	00:13:52,255	| serial-s02-e10 |	Quotes
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:55,839	| serial-s02-e10 |	Americans have learned it is harder to end Wars than it is to begin them
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:13:59,679	| serial-s02-e10 |	And now a few days later May 31st
EDL	00:14:00,191	00:14:03,519	| serial-s02-e10 |	They just gotten word the operation to rescue bowhead work
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,567	| serial-s02-e10 |	He was alive he was safe
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:09,151	| serial-s02-e10 |	The National Security folks and the White House Press folks
EDL	00:14:09,151	00:14:10,687	| serial-s02-e10 |	Knew it was going to be
EDL	00:14:11,199	00:14:11,967	| serial-s02-e10 |	Lumpy
EDL	00:14:11,967	00:14:12,479	| serial-s02-e10 |	The snooze
EDL	00:14:12,991	00:14:14,783	| serial-s02-e10 |	A trading 5 Taliban
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:16,063	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's going to be controversial
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:19,391	| serial-s02-e10 |	But the circumstances of both capture we're going to be a topic
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:20,927	| serial-s02-e10 |	A nail
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:25,023	| serial-s02-e10 |	The people I talk to you in the White House weren't strangers to military culture
EDL	00:14:25,791	00:14:28,351	| serial-s02-e10 |	How many people who worked on this exchange had been in the military
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,375	| serial-s02-e10 |	Carry such as Jeff Eggers
EDL	00:14:29,887	00:14:32,703	| serial-s02-e10 |	Or had worked closely with military force in war zones
EDL	00:14:33,471	00:14:37,311	| serial-s02-e10 |	They thought it was important that the president own the decision to make this trade
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:39,103	| serial-s02-e10 |	That explain the policy behind it
EDL	00:14:40,127	00:14:42,175	| serial-s02-e10 |	So the original plan for how to announce it
EDL	00:14:43,455	00:14:45,503	| serial-s02-e10 |	Release a written statement from the president
EDL	00:14:46,015	00:14:47,551	| serial-s02-e10 |	The Pentagon would also release written
EDL	00:14:48,319	00:14:48,831	| serial-s02-e10 |	At the same time
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:50,111	| serial-s02-e10 |	Done
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:55,231	| serial-s02-e10 |	Well Bob and Jani Bergdahl happened to be in town
EDL	00:14:55,743	00:14:59,839	| serial-s02-e10 |	They come to DC for some meetings have been scheduled long before with the administration
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:05,727	| serial-s02-e10 |	No one told them this is about to take place their visit to DC was not planned to coincide with those return
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,567	| serial-s02-e10 |	Urbana Park playing with some friends little children when they got the call
EDL	00:15:10,591	00:15:11,871	| serial-s02-e10 |	And it seemed to make sense
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,919	| serial-s02-e10 |	They're in town already
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,991	| serial-s02-e10 |	Instead of just a phone call the president will see them in person
EDL	00:15:18,271	00:15:23,135	| serial-s02-e10 |	And now here's where I'd argue there was a blind spot about how all this would look
EDL	00:15:23,647	00:15:24,927	| serial-s02-e10 |	And that no one in the White House
EDL	00:15:24,927	00:15:25,439	| serial-s02-e10 |	Catch it
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:29,279	| serial-s02-e10 |	I've been working on this for years
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:32,095	| serial-s02-e10 |	First the talks with the Taliban then the operation.
EDL	00:15:32,095	00:15:32,863	| serial-s02-e10 |	Well
EDL	00:15:32,863	00:15:34,911	| serial-s02-e10 |	They met with both parents before some of them
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:38,751	| serial-s02-e10 |	And so what people told me is that for them it's not that they were oblivious
EDL	00:15:39,519	00:15:43,103	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's just that that day that moment they felt so
EDL	00:15:43,615	00:15:44,127	| serial-s02-e10 |	Happy
EDL	00:15:44,639	00:15:50,527	| serial-s02-e10 |	They've been on tenterhooks for days weeks even and now this horrible Saga had come to an unknown and gotten hurt
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:54,367	| serial-s02-e10 |	And you got both parents right there you can see their faces crying
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:54,879	| serial-s02-e10 |	Defecting
EDL	00:15:56,415	00:15:59,487	| serial-s02-e10 |	Meanwhile there are some very good reporters in Washington
EDL	00:15:59,487	00:16:01,535	| serial-s02-e10 |	And it Guantanamo as I mentioned
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:04,095	| serial-s02-e10 |	If you have them had known this was going to go down
EDL	00:16:04,095	00:16:05,119	| serial-s02-e10 |	Butthead held off
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:05,631	| serial-s02-e10 |	Reporting it
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:08,447	| serial-s02-e10 |	Turn out the White House Press people thought
EDL	00:16:08,447	00:16:09,727	| serial-s02-e10 |	Well we need to placate them
EDL	00:16:10,239	00:16:10,751	| serial-s02-e10 |	Please.
EDL	00:16:11,519	00:16:13,823	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because if we have the bergdahl's here with the president
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:16,127	| serial-s02-e10 |	We don't let some photographers catch that scene
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,687	| serial-s02-e10 |	Give them was called camera spray
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:19,455	| serial-s02-e10 |	I'm going to be pissed
EDL	00:16:19,967	00:16:21,759	| serial-s02-e10 |	Terminate let's arrange at least for that
EDL	00:16:22,271	00:16:24,831	| serial-s02-e10 |	Maybe a shot of President walking and talking with the bird dolls
EDL	00:16:26,111	00:16:26,879	| serial-s02-e10 |	Man
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:29,439	| serial-s02-e10 |	It was such a sunny day
EDL	00:16:29,439	00:16:30,719	| serial-s02-e10 |	Such good news for once
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| serial-s02-e10 |	Why not
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:34,047	| serial-s02-e10 |	Do the whole thing in the Rose Garden
EDL	00:16:35,583	00:16:37,375	| serial-s02-e10 |	So in the space of a few hours
EDL	00:16:37,375	00:16:39,167	| serial-s02-e10 |	It went from a simple statement
EDL	00:16:39,167	00:16:40,447	| serial-s02-e10 |	To a Rose Garden ceremony
EDL	00:16:41,471	00:16:44,287	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nedrebo's parents talking at all from the podium
EDL	00:16:44,287	00:16:46,847	| serial-s02-e10 |	How much was Bob speaking some words in Pashto in Arabic
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:48,383	| serial-s02-e10 |	Does utterly impromptu
EDL	00:16:50,175	00:16:51,967	| serial-s02-e10 |	As for the Susan Rice thing
EDL	00:16:51,967	00:16:55,295	| serial-s02-e10 |	Ambassador rice politely decline to talk to me for this story
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:57,855	| serial-s02-e10 |	People I talked to told me
EDL	00:16:57,855	00:16:59,135	| serial-s02-e10 |	A cringed when she said it
EDL	00:16:59,647	00:17:03,231	| serial-s02-e10 |	This is talking to the Press is not her forte she got a little defensive
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,279	| serial-s02-e10 |	And this cliche tumbledown
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,815	| serial-s02-e10 |	Honor and distinction
EDL	00:17:07,583	00:17:09,887	| serial-s02-e10 |	2 Days Later rice explain herself
EDL	00:17:09,887	00:17:15,007	| serial-s02-e10 |	Thanks you just meant that volunteering to serve his country in a time of war was an honorable thing to do
EDL	00:17:15,519	00:17:16,543	| serial-s02-e10 |	By then
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:19,103	| serial-s02-e10 |	Honor and distinction was already caught in Amber
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:21,407	| serial-s02-e10 |	It was going to be any shaking it loose
EDL	00:17:26,783	00:17:29,087	| serial-s02-e10 |	You're pretty isolated when you work in The West Wing
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,391	| serial-s02-e10 |	The one person used to work there told me
EDL	00:17:31,391	00:17:33,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	You're pretty cut off from the normal workaday world
EDL	00:17:33,695	00:17:35,999	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's easy to forget how iconic it all is
EDL	00:17:36,511	00:17:37,279	| serial-s02-e10 |	Columns
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:39,071	| serial-s02-e10 |	Podium with presidential seal
EDL	00:17:39,583	00:17:43,167	| serial-s02-e10 |	They told me there wasn't a concerted effort to make Bowe Bergdahl into a hero
EDL	00:17:43,679	00:17:45,215	| serial-s02-e10 |	To whitewash what happened in Afghanistan
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:48,287	| serial-s02-e10 |	I know it looks that way but there really wasn't
EDL	00:17:48,287	00:17:49,567	| serial-s02-e10 |	Grand political calculus
EDL	00:17:50,335	00:17:52,895	| serial-s02-e10 |	They were just tired and abuzz with relief
EDL	00:17:52,895	00:17:53,663	| serial-s02-e10 |	And I thought
EDL	00:17:53,663	00:17:55,455	| serial-s02-e10 |	Everyone will feel This Joy right
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:56,735	| serial-s02-e10 |	I got carried away
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:18:00,063	| serial-s02-e10 |	In hindsight one former staffer told me
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,087	| serial-s02-e10 |	We should have thought about it more
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:03,135	| serial-s02-e10 |	But there were other audiences
EDL	00:18:03,135	00:18:03,647	| serial-s02-e10 |	What's worth watching
EDL	00:18:04,159	00:18:04,671	| serial-s02-e10 |	People who suffer
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:07,743	| serial-s02-e10 |	The Rose Garden put a Target on her back
EDL	00:18:09,535	00:18:11,327	| serial-s02-e10 |	And this is me talking
EDL	00:18:11,839	00:18:13,887	| serial-s02-e10 |	I think it also put a Target on Bose back
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:21,311	| serial-s02-e10 |	Just walk with me now
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:22,847	| serial-s02-e10 |	Along this path from the White House
EDL	00:18:23,359	00:18:24,639	| serial-s02-e10 |	Up the street a ways
EDL	00:18:24,639	00:18:25,407	| serial-s02-e10 |	Capitol Hill
EDL	00:18:25,407	00:18:27,455	| serial-s02-e10 |	I swear we won't stay there too long
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:31,039	| serial-s02-e10 |	But this is the next place where the politics of this trade Harden
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| serial-s02-e10 |	An intense
EDL	00:18:31,807	00:18:32,319	| serial-s02-e10 |	Certified
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,879	| serial-s02-e10 |	I get it it's Congress
EDL	00:18:34,879	00:18:38,719	| serial-s02-e10 |	They're in a constant state of Readiness to hate anything President Obama comes up with
EDL	00:18:39,487	00:18:40,511	| serial-s02-e10 |	But this time
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:46,911	| serial-s02-e10 |	First off no one from the White House or DOD or the state department no one
EDL	00:18:46,911	00:18:48,959	| serial-s02-e10 |	Told Congress this trade was about to go down
EDL	00:18:49,727	00:18:52,031	| serial-s02-e10 |	So members heard about it on the news Bass
EDL	00:18:52,031	00:18:52,799	| serial-s02-e10 |	Basically like everyone else
EDL	00:18:53,823	00:18:57,151	| serial-s02-e10 |	By law the administration was supposed to notify Congress
EDL	00:18:57,151	00:18:57,919	| serial-s02-e10 |	30 days
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:00,223	| serial-s02-e10 |	Before any detainee was transferred out of Guantanamo
EDL	00:19:00,991	00:19:02,271	| serial-s02-e10 |	This time they didn't
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:03,807	| serial-s02-e10 |	And that was on purpose
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:06,623	| serial-s02-e10 |	The White House didn't want members to get mad
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,415	| serial-s02-e10 |	And to try to stop the deal from taking place
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:09,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	I hope we can get to the Press
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:12,767	| serial-s02-e10 |	Why did they think Congress would get mad
EDL	00:19:13,535	00:19:17,119	| serial-s02-e10 |	Well because the administration already knew that Congress. It stunk this
EDL	00:19:18,911	00:19:20,191	| serial-s02-e10 |	Back in 2012
EDL	00:19:20,191	00:19:21,471	| serial-s02-e10 |	When the trade was still linked
EDL	00:19:21,471	00:19:22,239	| serial-s02-e10 |	Peace talks
EDL	00:19:22,239	00:19:24,543	| serial-s02-e10 |	The Taliban and it really seems like it might go forward
EDL	00:19:25,055	00:19:27,359	| serial-s02-e10 |	The White House and arrange some classified briefings in
EDL	00:19:27,359	00:19:29,407	| serial-s02-e10 |	Special rooms on Capitol Hill
EDL	00:19:29,407	00:19:31,199	| serial-s02-e10 |	Stuff happens barely
EDL	00:19:31,199	00:19:34,015	| serial-s02-e10 |	And members had made themselves pretty clear at the time
EDL	00:19:34,015	00:19:37,343	| serial-s02-e10 |	The reactions to a proposed trade 5 Taliban guys
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:39,391	| serial-s02-e10 |	Range from skeptical
EDL	00:19:39,391	00:19:40,159	| serial-s02-e10 |	Horrified
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,487	| serial-s02-e10 |	Princeton's then Senator Saxby chambliss
EDL	00:19:43,487	00:19:49,887	| serial-s02-e10 |	Republican from Georgia and a briefing of the Senate intelligence committee on January of 2012 almost two-and-a-half
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,935	| serial-s02-e10 |	Years before it actually took place
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:53,727	| serial-s02-e10 |	Talking about trading the stylebender
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:57,823	| serial-s02-e10 |	I want to State publicly as strongly as I can
EDL	00:19:58,335	00:20:03,199	| serial-s02-e10 |	That we should not transfer these detainees from Guantanamo
EDL	00:20:03,199	00:20:06,015	| serial-s02-e10 |	Sobe ministration worried understandably
EDL	00:20:06,015	00:20:08,319	| serial-s02-e10 |	That if they brought it up again it'll get crushed
EDL	00:20:08,319	00:20:11,135	| serial-s02-e10 |	We might not be able to get bow back at all
EDL	00:20:11,135	00:20:12,159	| serial-s02-e10 |	Decision was made
EDL	00:20:12,159	00:20:13,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	Don't say anything
EDL	00:20:14,207	00:20:20,607	| serial-s02-e10 |	So by 2014 a lot of people in Congress assume the deal was dead which was a reasonable thing to think
EDL	00:20:20,607	00:20:22,655	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is that more or less what they've been told over the years
EDL	00:20:23,935	00:20:24,959	| serial-s02-e10 |	You can see in
EDL	00:20:24,959	00:20:25,983	| serial-s02-e10 |	State Department memos
EDL	00:20:26,495	00:20:31,359	| serial-s02-e10 |	In January and February of 2014 even as a ministration was working to revive the deal
EDL	00:20:31,871	00:20:36,735	| serial-s02-e10 |	Officials called around a certain offices on Capitol Hill to update certain members of Congress
EDL	00:20:36,735	00:20:38,527	| serial-s02-e10 |	About the Bergdahl situation
EDL	00:20:38,527	00:20:39,807	| serial-s02-e10 |	The calls ended with
EDL	00:20:39,807	00:20:44,415	| serial-s02-e10 |	Quote we told them we would keep them updated and continue to consult before taking any action
EDL	00:20:45,439	00:20:47,487	| serial-s02-e10 |	But they didn't consult Congress
EDL	00:20:47,487	00:20:49,791	| serial-s02-e10 |	Cuz your Converse was hearing it on the news
EDL	00:20:50,559	00:20:52,863	| serial-s02-e10 |	All of that was it was a surprise
EDL	00:20:53,375	00:20:54,399	| serial-s02-e10 |	Giselle blatant
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:20:59,007	| serial-s02-e10 |	A blatant and intentional
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,847	| serial-s02-e10 |	That's Mac Thornberry Texas Republican
EDL	00:21:02,847	00:21:06,175	| serial-s02-e10 |	The time of the trade he was a member of the House armed services committee
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:07,199	| serial-s02-e10 |	Notus High School
EDL	00:21:07,199	00:21:08,223	| serial-s02-e10 |	Now he's the chairman
EDL	00:21:08,991	00:21:15,391	| serial-s02-e10 |	Ask oversees the Department of Defense and has staffers in the Republican side told me that that relationship with
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,159	| serial-s02-e10 |	Tod
EDL	00:21:16,159	00:21:17,952	| serial-s02-e10 |	Has traditionally been pretty solid
EDL	00:21:17,952	00:21:18,720	| serial-s02-e10 |	Cooperative
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:19,488	| serial-s02-e10 |	Straightforward
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:26,144	| serial-s02-e10 |	Now they realized. She had been the lead on hammering out this final Bergdahl deal and had told them nothing
EDL	00:21:27,680	00:21:28,704	| serial-s02-e10 |	For instance
EDL	00:21:28,704	00:21:31,264	| serial-s02-e10 |	Three and a half months before the trade happened
EDL	00:21:31,264	00:21:34,336	| serial-s02-e10 |	The Washington Post publish the story quoting unnamed sources
EDL	00:21:34,848	00:21:37,664	| serial-s02-e10 |	Talk about the five Taliban going to Doha
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:38,432	| serial-s02-e10 |	Was pretty detailed
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:42,528	| serial-s02-e10 |	Ask stuff they said they asked the dod about it
EDL	00:21:43,040	00:21:44,320	| serial-s02-e10 |	Hey is there anything to this
EDL	00:21:44,832	00:21:45,600	| serial-s02-e10 |	And they said they were told
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,624	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nope
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:48,928	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's possible
EDL	00:21:48,928	00:21:49,696	| serial-s02-e10 |	Probable
EDL	00:21:49,696	00:21:52,512	| serial-s02-e10 |	Actually that the person they called wasn't lying
EDL	00:21:52,512	00:21:53,792	| serial-s02-e10 |	They weren't in the know
EDL	00:21:54,560	00:21:59,424	| serial-s02-e10 |	Meanwhile emails are singing among all these other government officials who are in the know
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:02,496	| serial-s02-e10 |	Quote who's leaking this very accurate info
EDL	00:22:03,008	00:22:04,544	| serial-s02-e10 |	These leaks are killing us
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:06,592	| serial-s02-e10 |	We need to talk about getting control back
EDL	00:22:07,360	00:22:13,760	| serial-s02-e10 |	Tony blinken at the White House sent one around about his dismay and disgust over the week since it could derail the deal quote
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:18,112	| serial-s02-e10 |	Simply put whoever is responsible should look him or herself in the mirror and ask
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,928	| serial-s02-e10 |	By what right did I jeopardize the life of a fellow American
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,232	| serial-s02-e10 |	Here's Thornberry again
EDL	00:22:23,744	00:22:27,840	| serial-s02-e10 |	We had specific questions you know why these press reports right
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:29,888	| serial-s02-e10 |	They denied
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,912	| serial-s02-e10 |	Denied it
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:32,448	| serial-s02-e10 |	In looking back
EDL	00:22:32,960	00:22:34,752	| serial-s02-e10 |	Now we know that in
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:38,848	| serial-s02-e10 |	Some instances they were too cute by half
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:42,944	| serial-s02-e10 |	By saying well we're not in negotiations today
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:49,088	| serial-s02-e10 |	When the guy was about to get on a plane and go to the Mideast to have negotiations tomorrow
EDL	00:22:49,856	00:22:54,208	| serial-s02-e10 |	What he's talking about is a congressional Hearing in late April just a month before the trade
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,536	| serial-s02-e10 |	State Department official was asked about efforts to recover bow
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,840	| serial-s02-e10 |	And he gives his kind of cryptic update
EDL	00:23:00,352	00:23:01,120	| serial-s02-e10 |	He says
EDL	00:23:01,120	00:23:03,936	| serial-s02-e10 |	Agencies across the government we're striving
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:08,032	| serial-s02-e10 |	In the most quote energetic and creative ways we can devise unquote
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:09,056	| serial-s02-e10 |	To secure Bose release
EDL	00:23:09,824	00:23:15,200	| serial-s02-e10 |	Unfortunately the Taliban broke off direct contact with us in January of 2012
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:21,600	| serial-s02-e10 |	We would very much like to return to direct contact with them and if we do at the top of our agenda will be Sergeant Bergdahl
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:25,440	| serial-s02-e10 |	It is certainly not the case as was reported that somehow
EDL	00:23:25,440	00:23:28,512	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's how that my Connie Network are seeking to release him and and that
EDL	00:23:29,024	00:23:32,096	| serial-s02-e10 |	Interagency squabbles within the United States government are
EDL	00:23:32,096	00:23:32,864	| serial-s02-e10 |	Preventing or delaying
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:34,656	| serial-s02-e10 |	Thank you very much
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:37,216	| serial-s02-e10 |	That same guy
EDL	00:23:37,728	00:23:39,264	| serial-s02-e10 |	Weather in Doha by the next day
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:40,800	| serial-s02-e10 |	From eating
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:41,824	| serial-s02-e10 |	About the Bergdahl trade
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:46,688	| serial-s02-e10 |	The administration wasn't exactly forthcoming with Congress
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,248	| serial-s02-e10 |	On the other hand it was an open hearing
EDL	00:23:49,760	00:23:52,064	| serial-s02-e10 |	And he's talking about a deal so fragile
EDL	00:23:52,576	00:23:55,392	| serial-s02-e10 |	He doesn't know if it's going to fall apart like the others before it
EDL	00:23:56,160	00:23:57,184	| serial-s02-e10 |	Regardless
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:24:02,816	| serial-s02-e10 |	Once Hask staffers on the Republican side went back and traced exactly what they were and weren't told
EDL	00:24:03,328	00:24:05,376	| serial-s02-e10 |	What's a investigated the whole trade
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,424	| serial-s02-e10 |	Issued a strongly-worded report about it
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:10,496	| serial-s02-e10 |	That report then entered the political Fray
EDL	00:24:11,264	00:24:14,592	| serial-s02-e10 |	Democrats called it an expression of shrill demagoguery
EDL	00:24:14,592	00:24:18,432	| serial-s02-e10 |	Accused the Republicans of using the tray to push their National Security agenda
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:21,248	| serial-s02-e10 |	Republicans accuse Democrats of exactly the same thing
EDL	00:24:22,528	00:24:24,320	| serial-s02-e10 |	I talked to some Hask staffers
EDL	00:24:24,320	00:24:26,368	| serial-s02-e10 |	Again on the Republican side about this whole thing
EDL	00:24:27,136	00:24:29,696	| serial-s02-e10 |	And they sounded to me surprisingly
EDL	00:24:29,696	00:24:33,792	| serial-s02-e10 |	Genuinely upset by what had happened to their ones collegial relationship
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:34,304	| serial-s02-e10 |	What's Tod
EDL	00:24:35,072	00:24:37,888	| serial-s02-e10 |	If that's going to be the relationship going forward
EDL	00:24:38,656	00:24:39,168	| serial-s02-e10 |	Then
EDL	00:24:39,680	00:24:42,240	| serial-s02-e10 |	There is nothing but can we rely upon
EDL	00:24:42,240	00:24:45,568	| serial-s02-e10 |	But they are telling us about any given issue
EDL	00:24:46,080	00:24:48,128	| serial-s02-e10 |	Like you just feel like you don't trust those guys anymore
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:49,920	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yes
EDL	00:24:50,688	00:24:55,808	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is this a big like I says the Big E that you've seen where you're just like I cannot believe
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:24:59,648	| serial-s02-e10 |	How this went down or is this just like oh my God there's like
EDL	00:25:00,160	00:25:02,208	| serial-s02-e10 |	This happens 3 times a year on different things
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:04,256	| serial-s02-e10 |	We view this is unprecedented
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:06,816	| serial-s02-e10 |	The staffer said
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:09,632	| serial-s02-e10 |	We're not just foot-stomping here that you guys didn't tell us
EDL	00:25:10,912	00:25:15,264	| serial-s02-e10 |	Actually a profound concern about
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:16,800	| serial-s02-e10 |	National Security risk
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:19,104	| serial-s02-e10 |	And the risk to
EDL	00:25:19,104	00:25:25,248	| serial-s02-e10 |	Particular our forces deployed overseas in Afghanistan
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:26,528	| serial-s02-e10 |	So
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:28,832	| serial-s02-e10 |	We're worried
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:31,904	| serial-s02-e10 |	She's talking about the Taliban five
EDL	00:25:32,416	00:25:36,768	| serial-s02-e10 |	They felt like the president and the dod had done an end-run around the approval process
EDL	00:25:36,768	00:25:37,536	| serial-s02-e10 |	Just forget Mo transfer
EDL	00:25:38,304	00:25:39,328	| serial-s02-e10 |	Encino
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,864	| serial-s02-e10 |	Who are these 5 Taliban guys anyway
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:43,168	| serial-s02-e10 |	How can we trust you that they're safe to release
EDL	00:25:43,680	00:25:45,472	| serial-s02-e10 |	But they won't rejoin the battle
EDL	00:25:45,472	00:25:46,240	| serial-s02-e10 |	Who signed off on this
EDL	00:25:48,032	00:25:50,592	| serial-s02-e10 |	This part of the fight over Bose trade
EDL	00:25:51,104	00:25:55,200	| serial-s02-e10 |	I want to talk about it for a minute because it mirrors a deeper bare-knuckled fight
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,736	| serial-s02-e10 |	Over Guantanamo
EDL	00:25:58,272	00:26:00,064	| serial-s02-e10 |	President wants to close Guantanamo
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:02,368	| serial-s02-e10 |	Most republicans in Congress
EDL	00:26:02,368	00:26:03,904	| serial-s02-e10 |	Even though President Bush wanted to
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:04,672	| serial-s02-e10 |	2
EDL	00:26:04,672	00:26:06,976	| serial-s02-e10 |	They've opposed the idea since Obama took office
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:09,024	| serial-s02-e10 |	And what are the arguments they make
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:12,864	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is that some of the prisoners we released from gitmo have rejoined the fight
EDL	00:26:13,376	00:26:14,144	| serial-s02-e10 |	Industrial
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,680	| serial-s02-e10 |	Most heaven
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:20,288	| serial-s02-e10 |	So it's a fair question right what about these five Taliban guys
EDL	00:26:20,800	00:26:22,592	| serial-s02-e10 |	Were they safe to release from Guantanamo
EDL	00:26:24,896	00:26:31,296	| serial-s02-e10 |	There's probably nobody including the military who knows the ins and outs of gitmo better than Carol Rosenberg from them
EDL	00:26:31,296	00:26:31,808	| serial-s02-e10 |	Miami Herald
EDL	00:26:32,320	00:26:35,648	| serial-s02-e10 |	I'm actually asked military people questions about Guantanamo
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,440	| serial-s02-e10 |	And they referred me
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:38,464	| serial-s02-e10 |	Carol Rosenberg
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:43,840	| serial-s02-e10 |	Explain that these five guys were what's known down there as forever prisoners
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:45,376	| serial-s02-e10 |	They hadn't been cleared for release
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:48,704	| serial-s02-e10 |	And I hadn't been and wouldn't be charged with crimes
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:52,544	| serial-s02-e10 |	But they also weren't going through the administration's new review
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:57,152	| serial-s02-e10 |	An interagency board meant to assess each detainee who is still down there
EDL	00:26:57,664	00:27:01,504	| serial-s02-e10 |	And figure out whether they could be cleared for transfer or should still be held
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:07,904	| serial-s02-e10 |	By all accounts this review process is a much more rigorous and we're rational look at the intelligence that has been done in the past
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,464	| serial-s02-e10 |	Again these Five Guys
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,488	| serial-s02-e10 |	Weren't on the list
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,000	| serial-s02-e10 |	Review
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:13,024	| serial-s02-e10 |	There's Carol
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:17,632	| serial-s02-e10 |	Three of these guys got there on the first day you would have thought that they'd get the first reviews
EDL	00:27:18,656	00:27:19,168	| serial-s02-e10 |	But they didn't
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:24,032	| serial-s02-e10 |	And I'm watching through the years why aren't they reviewing these guys why aren't these reviewing the
EDL	00:27:24,032	00:27:24,544	| serial-s02-e10 |	Disguise
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:31,456	| serial-s02-e10 |	When I started asking questions really early why are
EDL	00:27:31,456	00:27:32,224	| serial-s02-e10 |	Betrayed
EDL	00:27:32,224	00:27:35,296	| serial-s02-e10 |	What do you think they're trying to push them through the board to get him in position
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:40,416	| serial-s02-e10 |	And then they're not they're not and I'm like
EDL	00:27:40,416	00:27:45,024	| serial-s02-e10 |	I wonder if they think that they intelligent people won't clear them
EDL	00:27:46,304	00:27:46,816	| serial-s02-e10 |	Right
EDL	00:27:48,352	00:27:48,864	| serial-s02-e10 |	Got it
EDL	00:27:49,888	00:27:51,680	| serial-s02-e10 |	Right if you have it on paper
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:53,984	| serial-s02-e10 |	That it would look even worse for the President right
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,288	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:56,288	00:27:58,848	| serial-s02-e10 |	Imagine if they been rejected for released by the board
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,384	| serial-s02-e10 |	And the USA traded them anyway
EDL	00:28:04,224	00:28:08,064	| serial-s02-e10 |	Since there wasn't a review we don't have in any public way at least
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:11,136	| serial-s02-e10 |	A recent intelligent assessment on these Five Guys
EDL	00:28:12,160	00:28:14,464	| serial-s02-e10 |	However I talked to someone who should know
EDL	00:28:14,976	00:28:17,280	| serial-s02-e10 |	That guy Nathan not his real name
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| serial-s02-e10 |	You heard him back in episode 5
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:22,912	| serial-s02-e10 |	He's a guy who is close to the recovery effort for bow and it worked with both parents
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,472	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nathan is not a lefty
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:29,824	| serial-s02-e10 |	He's former military and he was an Intel Analyst at gitmo
EDL	00:28:29,824	00:28:32,128	| serial-s02-e10 |	The specialty was afghanistan-pakistan
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:35,712	| serial-s02-e10 |	He did two stints in Guantanamo for a total of 3 years
EDL	00:28:35,712	00:28:36,992	| serial-s02-e10 |	Ending in 2013
EDL	00:28:37,504	00:28:39,808	| serial-s02-e10 |	So he knew all about these Taliban guys
EDL	00:28:40,320	00:28:42,880	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is office equipment was a stone's throw from where they were being held
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:49,536	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nathan Radley admits that he's biased and surprised you wanted to come home and he was working for that very goal
EDL	00:28:50,048	00:28:52,608	| serial-s02-e10 |	But he was not happy about this trade
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:57,472	| serial-s02-e10 |	He doesn't hate it like a lot of his peers in the MLS world you just wishes it hadn't come to that
EDL	00:28:57,984	00:29:01,568	| serial-s02-e10 |	The only option left for the president was this getmoe option
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:03,872	| serial-s02-e10 |	It wasn't the political will to do anything else
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,920	| serial-s02-e10 |	He also thinks
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,200	| serial-s02-e10 |	These Five Guys
EDL	00:29:07,200	00:29:08,480	| serial-s02-e10 |	They're okay to release
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:14,624	| serial-s02-e10 |	They're being watched closely in Qatar their high-profile so they can't hide everyone knows who they are and what they look
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:19,232	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nathan says there's just not much they be able to pull off even if they want it
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:22,560	| serial-s02-e10 |	The value to the Taliban in Afghanistan he said
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,608	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is pretty much limited to a rallying cry
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:28,704	| serial-s02-e10 |	You know was very familiar with them and honestly
EDL	00:29:29,216	00:29:33,312	| serial-s02-e10 |	I didn't feel that it was that big of a danger to relieve so I really didn't
EDL	00:29:33,824	00:29:36,128	| serial-s02-e10 |	No not even that sort of guys
EDL	00:29:36,640	00:29:39,456	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nori and and Fazal who were the
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:40,224	| serial-s02-e10 |	Kind of
EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:41,248	| serial-s02-e10 |	Biggest fish it seems like
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:44,064	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yeah yeah definitely
EDL	00:29:44,064	00:29:48,416	| serial-s02-e10 |	They're not going to be that they're not going to trouble trouble it's
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,184	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:49,952	| serial-s02-e10 |	You know
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:54,304	| serial-s02-e10 |	We let them be trouble cuz we drop the ball on you know keep an eye on them
EDL	00:29:54,304	00:29:56,352	| serial-s02-e10 |	Do you feel like you guys had
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,632	| serial-s02-e10 |	Clear door
EDL	00:29:58,144	00:30:02,240	| serial-s02-e10 |	I know it's not your job to clear someone for release but had recommended release
EDL	00:30:03,008	00:30:04,544	| serial-s02-e10 |	Forehead seeing people released
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:07,360	| serial-s02-e10 |	Hoover on par with these guys
EDL	00:30:07,872	00:30:11,200	| serial-s02-e10 |	Sure sure yeah and you know we've released
EDL	00:30:15,040	00:30:17,856	| serial-s02-e10 |	But yeah I definitely would definitely release them
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:19,648	| serial-s02-e10 |	Not so good guys that were
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:20,672	| serial-s02-e10 |	Supposed to be
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:21,952	| serial-s02-e10 |	I'm in love with you guys
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:26,304	| serial-s02-e10 |	Right so it's like you didn't see the names and just like
EDL	00:30:26,816	00:30:27,840	| serial-s02-e10 |	Freak out like I
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:36,032	| serial-s02-e10 |	And there's only like one or two people that get mailed it would freak me out if we
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:42,432	| serial-s02-e10 |	That's going to be a problem going to be a problem
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:46,528	| serial-s02-e10 |	But it's but you're being serious like they're really only a few who
EDL	00:30:47,296	00:30:48,320	| serial-s02-e10 |	You know and
EDL	00:30:48,832	00:30:49,600	| serial-s02-e10 |	And frankly
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:53,696	| serial-s02-e10 |	We got it we got to do something when you get mold I'm leaving gitmo
EDL	00:30:53,696	00:30:56,512	| serial-s02-e10 |	They would have laughed anyway if you know at least we
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:30:58,048	| serial-s02-e10 |	Made use of them
EDL	00:30:58,048	00:30:58,816	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yasso
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:02,400	| serial-s02-e10 |	The heart reaction to this trade
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,936	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nathan says he understands it
EDL	00:31:04,704	00:31:05,728	| serial-s02-e10 |	But he also says
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,264	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's not exactly based on the fact
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:14,432	| serial-s02-e10 |	Leave the anger over releasing those guys comes down to a lot of the same reasons why people are
EDL	00:31:14,432	00:31:20,320	| serial-s02-e10 |	You know it's still mad at bo4 walk out the basic it's it's it's very personal thing like you don't
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:23,648	| serial-s02-e10 |	I think they feel very strongly about what these guys have done
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:26,720	| serial-s02-e10 |	And we know what kind of people they are and
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:29,536	| serial-s02-e10 |	You don't negotiate you don't make trades
EDL	00:31:29,536	00:31:32,608	| serial-s02-e10 |	You know so they're wrapped up in a larger moral question
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:38,752	| serial-s02-e10 |	Obama releases Five Guys
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,520	| serial-s02-e10 |	Congress didn't like
EDL	00:31:40,288	00:31:44,384	| serial-s02-e10 |	To be clear Congress doesn't get a vote on individual get mode transfers like this
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,664	| serial-s02-e10 |	They're just supposed to be notified
EDL	00:31:46,688	00:31:50,272	| serial-s02-e10 |	Right after the trade the White House explained that the Secretary of Defense
EDL	00:31:50,272	00:31:52,320	| serial-s02-e10 |	Had followed all the requirements
EDL	00:31:52,320	00:31:54,112	| serial-s02-e10 |	For the detainee transfers
EDL	00:31:54,112	00:32:00,512	| serial-s02-e10 |	Got the 30-day notice could have endangered bows life and that they believe the president had the Constitutional thought
EDL	00:32:00,512	00:32:01,536	| serial-s02-e10 |	Authority to make this decision
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:05,888	| serial-s02-e10 |	But disagreed all around Republicans and Democrats
EDL	00:32:05,888	00:32:08,960	| serial-s02-e10 |	Administration I pulled a fast one by not giving the 30 day notice
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:13,312	| serial-s02-e10 |	And the government accountability office which is non-partisan
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:16,640	| serial-s02-e10 |	Found that the dod broke the law by doing the transfer the way it did
EDL	00:32:17,920	00:32:19,456	| serial-s02-e10 |	Which that happens sometimes
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:24,576	| serial-s02-e10 |	President Obama's definitely not the first to claim executive power in order to make a move like this
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:30,720	| serial-s02-e10 |	But when a president does that rankles Congress tends to push back with whatever power it has
EDL	00:32:31,488	00:32:32,256	| serial-s02-e10 |	In this case
EDL	00:32:32,256	00:32:34,816	| serial-s02-e10 |	One way to do that get no legislation
EDL	00:32:35,328	00:32:38,400	| serial-s02-e10 |	So here's a fairly tangible effect of the trade for bow
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:41,728	| serial-s02-e10 |	There's this massive annual defense bill
EDL	00:32:41,728	00:32:46,848	| serial-s02-e10 |	Put together by the House and Senate armed services committee has decided for the past 5 years
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:53,760	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is language specifying what the Secretary of Defense has to do before he can sign off on any foreign Tran
EDL	00:32:53,760	00:32:55,808	| serial-s02-e10 |	Answers of gitmo detainees
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:33:02,208	| serial-s02-e10 |	After the trade Republicans decided to change that language to make it harder to transfer
EDL	00:33:02,208	00:33:05,792	| serial-s02-e10 |	Anyone Adam Smith Democrat from Washington State
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:10,400	| serial-s02-e10 |	Was one of four lawmakers trying to come to final agreement on that bill last year
EDL	00:33:11,168	00:33:15,520	| serial-s02-e10 |	I talked to him over the summer when he was still in the thick of arguing with Republicans over the harsher transfer
EDL	00:33:16,800	00:33:19,360	| serial-s02-e10 |	Smith has been a big proponent of shutting down gitmo
EDL	00:33:19,872	00:33:24,992	| serial-s02-e10 |	Can I were both on the phone when I asked him about it both of us traveling in cars actually so the tape isn't great
EDL	00:33:26,016	00:33:29,856	| serial-s02-e10 |	How much is the the Bergdahl trade for the Taliban
EDL	00:33:29,856	00:33:31,392	| serial-s02-e10 |	Does 5 Taliban guys
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:37,280	| serial-s02-e10 |	It is that a shadow over what you guys are doing right now and how big is shadow
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:39,328	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's a pretty darn big shadow
EDL	00:33:42,912	00:33:47,264	| serial-s02-e10 |	I don't think we would be having the discussion of further foreign transfer restriction
EDL	00:33:49,568	00:33:50,592	| serial-s02-e10 |	Really well
EDL	00:33:59,552	00:34:01,088	| serial-s02-e10 |	Republican Mac Thornberry
EDL	00:34:01,088	00:34:05,184	| serial-s02-e10 |	It was also one of the four lawmakers negotiating that Bill said it's true
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:06,464	| serial-s02-e10 |	Bergdorf thing
EDL	00:34:06,976	00:34:07,488	| serial-s02-e10 |	Corrosive
EDL	00:34:08,000	00:34:11,840	| serial-s02-e10 |	They were not going to budge on that stricter standard for letting people out of gitmo
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,632	| serial-s02-e10 |	No there's no question
EDL	00:34:13,632	00:34:15,168	| serial-s02-e10 |	I mean it was a direct result
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:18,496	| serial-s02-e10 |	The Bergdahl trade
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:19,520	| serial-s02-e10 |	And
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:23,104	| serial-s02-e10 |	The not telling Congress the truth
EDL	00:34:26,944	00:34:28,736	| serial-s02-e10 |	Another result less tangible Maybe
EDL	00:34:29,248	00:34:32,320	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is it outrage and suspicion over the trade
EDL	00:34:32,320	00:34:33,856	| serial-s02-e10 |	Spilled over onto Bo himself
EDL	00:34:36,160	00:34:36,928	| serial-s02-e10 |	June 11
EDL	00:34:36,928	00:34:37,952	| serial-s02-e10 |	2014
EDL	00:34:37,952	00:34:41,280	| serial-s02-e10 |	The house armed services committee held up at hearing on the bird.
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:48,192	| serial-s02-e10 |	At the start of this hearing I'm pleased to welcome members of the public who have such an interest in these
EDL	00:34:48,192	00:34:48,704	| serial-s02-e10 |	Proceedings
EDL	00:34:49,472	00:34:53,568	| serial-s02-e10 |	Chairman open by saying we are not going to talk about Bergdahl personally
EDL	00:34:53,568	00:34:56,896	| serial-s02-e10 |	Let me be clear up front on the focus of today's hearing
EDL	00:34:57,408	00:34:59,456	| serial-s02-e10 |	It is not my intention
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:00,992	| serial-s02-e10 |	The dive into the circumstances
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:02,272	| serial-s02-e10 |	The parents of
EDL	00:35:03,552	00:35:04,320	| serial-s02-e10 |	Horse it came up
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:08,416	| serial-s02-e10 |	Testifying before the committee with defense secretary Chuck Hagel
EDL	00:35:08,416	00:35:12,512	| serial-s02-e10 |	He had to answer all the who knew what when questions that were pissing Congress off
EDL	00:35:13,024	00:35:15,840	| serial-s02-e10 |	Representative Jeff Miller Republican took a turn at the mic
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:21,472	| serial-s02-e10 |	Did you or did you not notify Congress within the 30-day time frame yes or no
EDL	00:35:21,472	00:35:22,496	| serial-s02-e10 |	No
EDL	00:35:23,008	00:35:27,616	| serial-s02-e10 |	Okay yes or no
EDL	00:35:27,616	00:35:34,016	| serial-s02-e10 |	Mac miller started asking questions about Bo
EDL	00:35:34,016	00:35:36,064	| serial-s02-e10 |	Stoughton American Military Hospital in Germany
EDL	00:35:36,576	00:35:42,464	| serial-s02-e10 |	And what we are doing is we are allowed
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:43,488	| serial-s02-e10 |	Wait a minute
EDL	00:35:44,512	00:35:47,328	| serial-s02-e10 |	Why hasn't even returned to the United States we have
EDL	00:35:47,328	00:35:49,376	| serial-s02-e10 |	Seriously wounded soldiers
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:51,424	| serial-s02-e10 |	Better return to the United States
EDL	00:35:51,424	00:35:54,240	| serial-s02-e10 |	Almost immediately after they are stabilized
EDL	00:35:54,240	00:35:55,776	| serial-s02-e10 |	How long did Jessica Lynch
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:04,992	| serial-s02-e10 |	Wait before she was returned to the United States you're trying to tell me that he's being held at Landstuhl Germany
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:07,040	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because of his medical condition
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:11,136	| serial-s02-e10 |	Cars but I hope you're not implying anything other than that
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:17,792	| serial-s02-e10 |	The question Mister secretary
EDL	00:36:17,792	00:36:18,304	| serial-s02-e10 |	Answer it
EDL	00:36:20,096	00:36:21,376	| serial-s02-e10 |	The implication
EDL	00:36:21,376	00:36:22,144	| serial-s02-e10 |	I think
EDL	00:36:22,144	00:36:24,448	| serial-s02-e10 |	Was it maybe something fishy was going on with bow
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:26,496	| serial-s02-e10 |	Something embarrassing to the Army
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:28,544	| serial-s02-e10 |	The baby this Bergdahl fellow
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:31,872	| serial-s02-e10 |	An American soldier who made just brought home at enormous cost
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:33,920	| serial-s02-e10 |	I walked off to join the Taliban
EDL	00:36:34,688	00:36:36,480	| serial-s02-e10 |	And now they were hiding him away in Germany
EDL	00:36:37,248	00:36:39,040	| serial-s02-e10 |	Hegel fended all of this off
EDL	00:36:39,040	00:36:44,672	| serial-s02-e10 |	This isn't just about a physical situation Congressman this guy was held for almost 5 years
EDL	00:36:45,696	00:36:49,024	| serial-s02-e10 |	And God knows what kind of conditions we do know some
EDL	00:36:49,024	00:36:52,608	| serial-s02-e10 |	Other conditions from our intelligence Community not from by-the-way Bergdahl
EDL	00:36:53,120	00:36:59,520	| serial-s02-e10 |	This is not just about Kenny get on his feet and walk and get to a plane so you're telling me she cannot be questioned because of
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:03,872	| serial-s02-e10 |	His condition I'm telling you is that the the medical professionals
EDL	00:37:07,456	00:37:08,992	| serial-s02-e10 |	So what was going on in Germany
EDL	00:37:09,760	00:37:15,648	| serial-s02-e10 |	An Army hospital in Landstuhl was undergoing this really pretty profound transition
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,208	| serial-s02-e10 |	The official word for it is reintegration
EDL	00:37:19,488	00:37:23,072	| serial-s02-e10 |	First imagine every single thing is weird for him
EDL	00:37:23,584	00:37:25,120	| serial-s02-e10 |	You can't talk really
EDL	00:37:25,120	00:37:26,656	| serial-s02-e10 |	He's blinking and squinting
EDL	00:37:27,168	00:37:29,472	| serial-s02-e10 |	For five years he had only a few things
EDL	00:37:29,472	00:37:30,752	| serial-s02-e10 |	A bowl
EDL	00:37:30,752	00:37:32,032	| serial-s02-e10 |	A blanket a water bottle
EDL	00:37:33,056	00:37:35,360	| serial-s02-e10 |	He says his mind adapted to the Simplicity of that
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:39,712	| serial-s02-e10 |	Now all the sudden they're all these people he's got to interact with them
EDL	00:37:39,712	00:37:40,992	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's all the stuff around
EDL	00:37:41,504	00:37:43,040	| serial-s02-e10 |	Furniture he's not used to
EDL	00:37:43,552	00:37:45,856	| serial-s02-e10 |	Princess one of the first things that happen
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:48,160	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is a bring him into this room
EDL	00:37:48,160	00:37:49,952	| serial-s02-e10 |	PenAir chairs sofa
EDL	00:37:49,952	00:37:52,256	| serial-s02-e10 |	And I tell him wherever you want to sit down is fine
EDL	00:37:58,656	00:38:04,032	| serial-s02-e10 |	Squatted down and talk down in the Indians
EDL	00:38:04,800	00:38:07,104	| serial-s02-e10 |	Until all these commanders they follow suit
EDL	00:38:07,616	00:38:13,760	| serial-s02-e10 |	Everybody was sitting down on the floor and were talking like Captain

EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:14,432	| serial-s02-e10 |	They said the poor guy away
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:18,528	| serial-s02-e10 |	One person who was on the Germany team told me that all these people
EDL	00:39:18,528	00:39:21,600	| serial-s02-e10 |	It was like they wanted to behold bow to meet him
EDL	00:39:22,112	00:39:23,392	| serial-s02-e10 |	But they wanted to touch the stone
EDL	00:39:25,696	00:39:29,536	| serial-s02-e10 |	I spoken to several people who are involved with bows reintegration and debriefing
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:32,864	| serial-s02-e10 |	They told me it was all planned down to the smallest detail
EDL	00:39:33,376	00:39:36,704	| serial-s02-e10 |	How to walk boat from the plane to the bus that would take him to the hospital
EDL	00:39:37,472	00:39:40,288	| serial-s02-e10 |	How to speak to him explain exactly how the day was going to go

EDL	00:39:51,552	00:39:57,696	| serial-s02-e10 |	By giving me complete control over everything asking me everything even if
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:03,072	| serial-s02-e10 |	Are you comfortable sleeping in
EDL	00:40:04,352	00:40:05,888	| serial-s02-e10 |	Couldn't really talk yet
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,168	| serial-s02-e10 |	But you had to let them know
EDL	00:40:07,168	00:40:09,728	| serial-s02-e10 |	He was not comfortable sleeping on the bed
EDL	00:40:10,240	00:40:13,568	| serial-s02-e10 |	His body was in pain especially the spots that have been in contact
EDL	00:40:13,568	00:40:15,104	| serial-s02-e10 |	With the floor for so long
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:18,176	| serial-s02-e10 |	But somehow he couldn't deal with the softness of the bed either
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:20,736	| serial-s02-e10 |	Pause the hospital bed was out in the open
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:22,272	| serial-s02-e10 |	Open on all sides in a row
EDL	00:40:23,552	00:40:24,576	| serial-s02-e10 |	Somebody

EDL	00:40:27,648	00:40:33,792	| serial-s02-e10 |	Uneasy feeling so what I had to do with that the move over by the bathroom where there was like a little hallway
EDL	00:40:35,072	00:40:39,680	| serial-s02-e10 |	First night I slept in the bathroom because there's a door
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:46,080	| serial-s02-e10 |	Also distance between
EDL	00:40:46,080	00:40:48,896	| serial-s02-e10 |	Room and the bathroom so I knew that there is
EDL	00:40:49,408	00:40:50,688	| serial-s02-e10 |	That allowed me to
EDL	00:40:50,688	00:40:51,968	| serial-s02-e10 |	Hear footsteps coming

EDL	00:41:09,120	00:41:12,704	| serial-s02-e10 |	His progress was being watched very very closely by lost
EDL	00:41:12,704	00:41:13,472	| serial-s02-e10 |	People
EDL	00:41:13,472	00:41:14,496	| serial-s02-e10 |	Especially at the Pentagon

EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:18,080	| serial-s02-e10 |	All the follow-up question
EDL	00:41:18,080	00:41:19,360	| serial-s02-e10 |	The until people were asking him
EDL	00:41:19,872	00:41:20,640	| serial-s02-e10 |	They had to clear them
EDL	00:41:21,152	00:41:23,968	| serial-s02-e10 |	All the way up to the Joint Chiefs and then all the way back down again

EDL	00:41:40,096	00:41:44,704	| serial-s02-e10 |	Again it seemed as if the people dealing with bow in a daily way had such a different
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:46,752	| serial-s02-e10 |	Softer view of him than the higher-ups.

EDL	00:46:06,335	00:46:08,127	| serial-s02-e10 |	I have seen no evidence
EDL	00:46:08,895	00:46:10,943	| serial-s02-e10 |	No facts presented to me
EDL	00:46:11,967	00:46:12,991	| serial-s02-e10 |	I want I asked that question
EDL	00:46:14,783	00:46:17,087	| serial-s02-e10 |	Hegel had to know that question
EDL	00:46:17,087	00:46:18,879	| serial-s02-e10 |	Was the consequential heart
EDL	00:46:18,879	00:46:19,391	| serial-s02-e10 |	Apus story
EDL	00:46:20,159	00:46:21,183	| serial-s02-e10 |	Did anyone die looking
EDL	00:46:22,463	00:46:26,303	| serial-s02-e10 |	And I have to think he also knew that his answer would not settle this
EDL	00:46:27,071	00:46:27,839	| serial-s02-e10 |	Nobody Longshot
EDL	00:46:29,119	00:46:30,655	| serial-s02-e10 |	Soldiers were talking about it
EDL	00:46:30,655	00:46:31,935	| serial-s02-e10 |	Commanders like Mike Waltrip
EDL	00:46:32,959	00:46:33,471	| serial-s02-e10 |	Testifying
EDL	00:46:34,239	00:46:35,519	| serial-s02-e10 |	The people did die looking
EDL	00:46:37,055	00:46:39,871	| serial-s02-e10 |	That's part of what was so going to them about the Rose Garden in the first place
EDL	00:46:40,639	00:46:42,431	| serial-s02-e10 |	Weren't those families being recognized by the
EDL	00:46:43,967	00:46:44,991	| serial-s02-e10 |	I asked Mike Walton
EDL	00:46:45,503	00:46:47,295	| serial-s02-e10 |	Why is the Army saying the opposite
EDL	00:46:47,807	00:46:48,831	| serial-s02-e10 |	What you're saying
EDL	00:46:48,831	00:46:51,135	| serial-s02-e10 |	Why are they saying nobody died in the search
EDL	00:46:51,135	00:46:55,231	| serial-s02-e10 |	I'm not sure who did the investigation I'm not I haven't seen
EDL	00:46:55,231	00:46:58,815	| serial-s02-e10 |	From you or any other journalist a real dig into
EDL	00:46:59,583	00:47:01,375	| serial-s02-e10 |	How the Army came to that conclusion
EDL	00:47:01,375	00:47:02,655	| serial-s02-e10 |	What did they look at
EDL	00:47:02,655	00:47:04,959	| serial-s02-e10 |	What was the basis of that statement
EDL	00:47:05,983	00:47:08,543	| serial-s02-e10 |	I don't know I can only speak to my own experience
EDL	00:47:09,823	00:47:10,591	| serial-s02-e10 |	Okay then
EDL	00:47:11,103	00:47:11,871	| serial-s02-e10 |	What's find a journalist
EDL	00:47:12,639	00:47:13,407	| serial-s02-e10 |	Kuwait
EDL	00:47:13,407	00:47:14,175	| serial-s02-e10 |	We're journalists
EDL	00:47:14,943	00:47:17,759	| serial-s02-e10 |	One of our staff Whitney Dangerfield on this question
EDL	00:47:18,527	00:47:22,879	| serial-s02-e10 |	Has there been an official investigation into whether people died looking for Bo
EDL	00:47:22,879	00:47:25,439	| serial-s02-e10 |	Is there a record of people who got injuries looking for Bo
EDL	00:47:26,719	00:47:28,511	| serial-s02-e10 |	She started with army public affairs
EDL	00:47:29,023	00:47:32,607	| serial-s02-e10 |	And they told her to ask forscom US Army Force
EDL	00:47:32,607	00:47:33,119	| serial-s02-e10 |	Command
EDL	00:47:33,887	00:47:38,239	| serial-s02-e10 |	A guy there appointed her to the investigation by Army Major General Kenneth Dahl
EDL	00:47:38,751	00:47:43,103	| serial-s02-e10 |	The general doll he didn't look into this question whether people died or got hurt in the search
EDL	00:47:43,871	00:47:44,639	| serial-s02-e10 |	That wasn't his mission
EDL	00:47:45,407	00:47:48,735	| serial-s02-e10 |	Adhering on Bose case in September Rose Attorney asked all about
EDL	00:47:49,247	00:47:54,111	| serial-s02-e10 |	I don't said he'd heard a lot of discussion about it and his own interviews and just in a press
EDL	00:47:54,111	00:47:55,391	| serial-s02-e10 |	Allegations one way or another
EDL	00:47:55,903	00:47:56,927	| serial-s02-e10 |	But he didn't pursue it
EDL	00:47:57,439	00:47:58,463	| serial-s02-e10 |	He said he was told quote
EDL	00:47:58,975	00:48:00,511	| serial-s02-e10 |	No you don't need to do that
EDL	00:48:00,511	00:48:01,791	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because Central Command is going to
EDL	00:48:04,863	00:48:06,655	| serial-s02-e10 |	Okay interesting
EDL	00:48:06,655	00:48:10,239	| serial-s02-e10 |	So Whitney went to Central Command centcom
EDL	00:48:10,751	00:48:12,799	| serial-s02-e10 |	In sent cam wrote back to her
EDL	00:48:12,799	00:48:18,943	| serial-s02-e10 |	There is no official report or investigation that we are aware of directed or conducted by us
EDL	00:48:19,455	00:48:23,295	| serial-s02-e10 |	I would direct you to the US Army for any records they may have
EDL	00:48:24,319	00:48:26,879	| serial-s02-e10 |	So Army to forscom
EDL	00:48:27,903	00:48:28,671	| serial-s02-e10 |	Which sent her back
EDL	00:48:29,183	00:48:29,695	| serial-s02-e10 |	The army
EDL	00:48:30,719	00:48:31,743	| serial-s02-e10 |	Also known as Square One
EDL	00:48:33,279	00:48:35,583	| serial-s02-e10 |	Unless we're missing something the US Military
EDL	00:48:35,583	00:48:39,167	| serial-s02-e10 |	Hasn't done an official investigation into whether any soldiers died
EDL	00:48:39,167	00:48:40,191	| serial-s02-e10 |	Because they were looking for both
EDL	00:48:41,983	00:48:45,055	| serial-s02-e10 |	Here's the other thing General doll said about this question
EDL	00:48:45,055	00:48:46,847	| serial-s02-e10 |	When he was on the stand back in September
EDL	00:48:47,615	00:48:48,383	| serial-s02-e10 |	He said quote
EDL	00:48:48,895	00:48:51,967	| serial-s02-e10 |	I had asked the appointing authority you know should I invest
EDL	00:48:51,967	00:48:54,527	| serial-s02-e10 |	To get this because really this is something that
EDL	00:48:54,527	00:48:55,551	| serial-s02-e10 |	At the end of the day
EDL	00:48:55,551	00:48:56,575	| serial-s02-e10 |	It's going to have to be answered
EDL	00:48:57,855	00:48:59,903	| serial-s02-e10 |	I mean if I was a parent I would want to know
EDL	00:49:00,415	00:49:01,439	| serial-s02-e10 |	Everybody should want to know
EDL	00:49:02,463	00:49:03,743	| serial-s02-e10 |	We really ought to close that out
EDL	00:49:06,559	00:49:07,327	| serial-s02-e10 |	Yeah
