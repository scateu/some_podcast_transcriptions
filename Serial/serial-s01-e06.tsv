EDL	00:00:02,816	00:00:04,096	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's a really tight
EDL	00:00:04,608	00:00:07,424	| serial-s01-e06 |	Free Windows time taking place right
EDL	00:00:07,936	00:00:08,960	| serial-s01-e06 |	All right ready
EDL	00:00:09,984	00:00:11,008	| serial-s01-e06 |	I started it
EDL	00:00:11,520	00:00:14,848	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's 2:51 and we're making a right out of the Best Buy parking lot
EDL	00:00:15,872	00:00:18,688	| serial-s01-e06 |	Isn't that sort of tantamount to say
EDL	00:00:18,688	00:00:20,736	| serial-s01-e06 |	I think you're telling the truth
EDL	00:00:20,736	00:00:23,552	| serial-s01-e06 |	The cell phone was in Lincoln Park
EDL	00:00:27,136	00:00:33,536	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from
EDL	00:00:33,536	00:00:39,936	| serial-s01-e06 |	An inmate at a Maryland Correctional Facility
EDL	00:00:39,936	00:00:46,336	| serial-s01-e06 |	From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it's serial one story
EDL	00:00:46,336	00:00:52,736	| serial-s01-e06 |	Week-by-week I'm Sarah Koenig the most incriminating piece of fish
EDL	00:00:52,736	00:00:55,808	| serial-s01-e06 |	Physical evidence against Adnan Syed was a fingerprint
EDL	00:00:55,808	00:00:57,344	| serial-s01-e06 |	Or rather a palm print
EDL	00:00:57,344	00:00:58,112	| serial-s01-e06 |	A map
EDL	00:00:58,624	00:01:01,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	It was one of those big math books you buy at a gas station
EDL	00:01:01,696	00:01:04,256	| serial-s01-e06 |	Police found it in the backseat of his car
EDL	00:01:04,256	00:01:07,840	| serial-s01-e06 |	On the back cover with a partial print of anions left palm
EDL	00:01:08,352	00:01:10,400	| serial-s01-e06 |	One page was ripped out from the map
EDL	00:01:10,400	00:01:13,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	A trial a pointed out that it was the page that showed leakin Park
EDL	00:01:15,008	00:01:19,360	| serial-s01-e06 |	The defense argued on fingerprints
EDL	00:01:19,360	00:01:23,968	| serial-s01-e06 |	They could have been six-week-old fingerprints or six months old fingerprints there's no way to tell
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:28,832	| serial-s01-e06 |	Bedridden and driven his car many times all their friends said so
EDL	00:01:29,344	00:01:35,488	| serial-s01-e06 |	Show the whole lot more than just leakin park in fact it showed their whole neighborhood the school the mall
EDL	00:01:36,000	00:01:38,560	| serial-s01-e06 |	Probably 90% of where they most often drove
EDL	00:01:39,072	00:01:40,096	| serial-s01-e06 |	And that page
EDL	00:01:40,096	00:01:41,888	| serial-s01-e06 |	Didn't have enough prints on it
EDL	00:01:41,888	00:01:43,936	| serial-s01-e06 |	His palm print was only on the back cover of the book
EDL	00:01:45,216	00:01:51,104	| serial-s01-e06 |	13 other unidentified prints turned up on and in the map book
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:54,432	| serial-s01-e06 |	The prince weren't exactly conclusive
EDL	00:01:55,200	00:02:01,600	| serial-s01-e06 |	Over the past few weeks I've been holding up bits of evidence here and there that look bad for add-on
EDL	00:02:01,600	00:02:08,000	| serial-s01-e06 |	Today I'm just going to lay out the rest everything else that a person could reasonably add to the Adnan is guilty side of the scale
EDL	00:02:08,000	00:02:14,400	| serial-s01-e06 |	Everything that the state had that I know about before but let's just hang them all up
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:20,800	| serial-s01-e06 |	Side-by-side and see what they look like first off there's a question of whether Adnan asked me for a ride that day after
EDL	00:02:20,800	00:02:23,872	| serial-s01-e06 |	Score movie looking for an excuse to get in her car
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:25,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	So he could kill her
EDL	00:02:25,664	00:02:31,040	| serial-s01-e06 |	Officer Adcock testified that the day she disappeared Anon told him he'd asked her for a ride
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:34,368	| serial-s01-e06 |	Then later told he didn't ask for a ride
EDL	00:02:34,368	00:02:39,488	| serial-s01-e06 |	He can't remember much at all about the missing
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:42,048	| serial-s01-e06 |	I was just a normal day to him something which stands out
EDL	00:02:42,816	00:02:45,632	| serial-s01-e06 |	I wondered about that the normalness of the day
EDL	00:02:45,632	00:02:52,032	| serial-s01-e06 |	When to call from officer Adcock asking whether he's seen her
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:53,824	| serial-s01-e06 |	Not normal.
EDL	00:02:55,104	00:03:01,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	Something pretty unusual did happen
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:08,160	| serial-s01-e06 |	I do remember that phone call and I do remember being high
EDL	00:03:08,160	00:03:08,928	| serial-s01-e06 |	Because
EDL	00:03:08,928	00:03:13,792	| serial-s01-e06 |	Crazy fingers behind have the police call your phone I'll never forget that
EDL	00:03:15,328	00:03:20,960	| serial-s01-e06 |	I guess that's the only thing that seems weird to me that you wouldn't
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:23,776	| serial-s01-e06 |	Come into Focus for you
EDL	00:03:25,312	00:03:27,104	| serial-s01-e06 |	You got this call from the cops
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:29,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know you lit
EDL	00:03:29,664	00:03:32,224	| serial-s01-e06 |	You were high you were young you know
EDL	00:03:32,224	00:03:36,320	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's a it's a scary call together or just a jarring call to get
EDL	00:03:36,320	00:03:37,600	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean at the time
EDL	00:03:38,112	00:03:44,000	| serial-s01-e06 |	The only thing I really associated with that call was that night
EDL	00:03:46,816	00:03:53,216	| serial-s01-e06 |	Whatever reason she didn't get no go home or she went somewhere else in no way that I associate this
EDL	00:03:53,216	00:03:55,008	| serial-s01-e06 |	Call
EDL	00:03:55,776	00:03:57,056	| serial-s01-e06 |	The beginning
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:04:00,384	| serial-s01-e06 |	I know where it is it's like
EDL	00:04:09,344	00:04:11,904	| serial-s01-e06 |	Your mother's going to be pissed
EDL	00:04:13,696	00:04:17,280	| serial-s01-e06 |	If this really was his reaction then he wasn't the only one
EDL	00:04:17,791	00:04:21,887	| serial-s01-e06 |	The seriousness of his disappearance didn't start sinking in with her friends for a while
EDL	00:04:22,911	00:04:27,007	| serial-s01-e06 |	School was canceled on January 14th and 15th because of the ice storm
EDL	00:04:27,007	00:04:30,335	| serial-s01-e06 |	And The Weeknd came then Monday was Martin Luther King Day
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:33,919	| serial-s01-e06 |	So the kids didn't all reconvene at school until the following Tuesday
EDL	00:04:34,687	00:04:40,575	| serial-s01-e06 |	All his friends I spoke to said they initially thought he had either run off someplace with her new boyfriend on
EDL	00:04:40,575	00:04:43,647	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is another rumor that a lot of people talked about at the time
EDL	00:04:43,647	00:04:45,439	| serial-s01-e06 |	Did she run off to California
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:50,047	| serial-s01-e06 |	Friend said she talked about that sometimes that her dad or maybe with her stepdad
EDL	00:04:50,047	00:04:51,583	| serial-s01-e06 |	Was in California
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:52,607	| serial-s01-e06 |	And she wanted to go there
EDL	00:04:53,119	00:04:54,655	| serial-s01-e06 |	I told the cops the same thing
EDL	00:04:54,655	00:05:01,055	| serial-s01-e06 |	Next the night before he disappeared and then called her house three times
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:07,455	| serial-s01-e06 |	Actually spoke with the third call at 12:35 a.m. that's what a non says he was probably calling to
EDL	00:05:07,455	00:05:11,039	| serial-s01-e06 |	To give his new cell phone number and she does write it in her diary
EDL	00:05:11,039	00:05:13,855	| serial-s01-e06 |	Here's something that makes me pause though
EDL	00:05:13,855	00:05:19,999	| serial-s01-e06 |	If you look at his cell records from that day forward neither Hayes home number nor her pager shows up again
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:26,655	| serial-s01-e06 |	Which suggests he never tried to contact her after she went missing there supposedly such good friends
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,471	| serial-s01-e06 |	His friend said she was paging her like crazy
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:32,287	| serial-s01-e06 |	Did you ever try to page her and just good like
EDL	00:05:32,799	00:05:34,079	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know see if you could
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:36,639	| serial-s01-e06 |	Find her raise her see if you could get a response from her
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:38,431	| serial-s01-e06 |	Well
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:39,711	| serial-s01-e06 |	I know that we would always
EDL	00:05:40,223	00:05:42,783	| serial-s01-e06 |	I can't remember if I just paid you're not but
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:47,647	| serial-s01-e06 |	We would always talk about in school I would always like get my information first-half like I used to
EDL	00:05:47,647	00:05:49,439	| serial-s01-e06 |	What usually skin contact
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:53,279	| serial-s01-e06 |	If I can remember she was like in contact with his family
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:55,327	| serial-s01-e06 |	Cypress College I would always
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:57,631	| serial-s01-e06 |	Christopher Orr
EDL	00:05:58,655	00:06:02,239	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean it was like I was just sitting around like not even thinking about her
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:06,079	| serial-s01-e06 |	You don't not patient or whatever but I used to always get my information from them first half
EDL	00:06:08,127	00:06:09,663	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's not it's not that
EDL	00:06:09,663	00:06:11,455	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't have a pastry or not
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:12,991	| serial-s01-e06 |	No just seems like
EDL	00:06:12,991	00:06:18,623	| serial-s01-e06 |	I know Krista was trying to page Rhino Aisha was trying to pager during this time to just be like where are you where are you where are you
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:20,671	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I was wondering if you had
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,975	| serial-s01-e06 |	We're in that group of like where are you
EDL	00:06:28,095	00:06:28,863	| serial-s01-e06 |	Ask me a question
EDL	00:06:29,375	00:06:35,775	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't know I'm just explaining why I'm asking the I'm explaining why I'm asking
EDL	00:06:35,775	00:06:37,823	| serial-s01-e06 |	Play from the relationship you had with her
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,615	| serial-s01-e06 |	You would have been one of those people saying
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:43,711	| serial-s01-e06 |	Give a holler where are you okay
EDL	00:06:43,711	00:06:44,735	| serial-s01-e06 |	We're all worried about you
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:51,135	| serial-s01-e06 |	That mean I'm right alongside what's them though it's not like they're in a whole other everyday we're talking about it
EDL	00:06:52,671	00:06:56,511	| serial-s01-e06 |	Whatever he comes up in the conversation I'm leaving
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:01,887	| serial-s01-e06 |	Another side of the classroom or something like that I mean I'm just as involved as they are
EDL	00:07:01,887	00:07:03,423	| serial-s01-e06 |	DSLR mean
EDL	00:07:03,935	00:07:04,447	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't know
EDL	00:07:10,079	00:07:16,479	| serial-s01-e06 |	Things that I don't know what they mean
EDL	00:07:16,479	00:07:19,807	| serial-s01-e06 |	In case it came up a trial
EDL	00:07:19,807	00:07:24,671	| serial-s01-e06 |	After he broke up in early November a letter
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:28,511	| serial-s01-e06 |	I'm really getting annoyed that the situation is going the way it is she wrote
EDL	00:07:28,511	00:07:31,839	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know people break up all the time your life is not going to end
EDL	00:07:32,351	00:07:37,215	| serial-s01-e06 |	Apparently you don't respect me enough to accept my decision and quote
EDL	00:07:37,983	00:07:41,567	| serial-s01-e06 |	Aisha Pittman read this note a trial he was her best friend
EDL	00:07:42,079	00:07:45,151	| serial-s01-e06 |	Initial letter apparently in health class
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:46,943	| serial-s01-e06 |	Handwritten notes to each other on the back
EDL	00:07:47,455	00:07:49,503	| serial-s01-e06 |	Asian pencil and not in pain
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:53,855	| serial-s01-e06 |	They were joking making fun of him making fun of themselves they'll just silliness
EDL	00:07:54,367	00:07:57,695	| serial-s01-e06 |	Event at the top of the page it says I'm going to kill
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,463	| serial-s01-e06 |	In pain
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:07:59,999	| serial-s01-e06 |	I talked about it
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,815	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I mean did you take any of that is as
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:07,423	| serial-s01-e06 |	Medicine or anything was it just a part of the joke
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:10,495	| serial-s01-e06 |	I know just seems like you guys are
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:14,335	| serial-s01-e06 |	Messing around on the know when I was riding with it so fruit
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:16,895	| serial-s01-e06 |	To see it later it was one of those things where it's like that
EDL	00:08:17,407	00:08:18,687	| serial-s01-e06 |	Weird to see that
EDL	00:08:20,223	00:08:24,319	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't know when that would have been written or what this wasn't part of the conversation
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,391	| serial-s01-e06 |	Cuz I remember like
EDL	00:08:27,903	00:08:29,183	| serial-s01-e06 |	Show
EDL	00:08:29,183	00:08:30,463	| serial-s01-e06 |	Weather it is just
EDL	00:08:30,463	00:08:34,559	| serial-s01-e06 |	Like on it was our conversation on letterhead and then at the top of it was kind
EDL	00:08:34,559	00:08:35,327	| serial-s01-e06 |	Out of
EDL	00:08:35,327	00:08:36,351	| serial-s01-e06 |	Context
EDL	00:08:37,631	00:08:39,167	| serial-s01-e06 |	Did you or did you take it to mean anything
EDL	00:08:39,935	00:08:41,471	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean did you take it to be meaningful I guess
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:41,983	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't
EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:46,847	| serial-s01-e06 |	No because when I'm first seeing that part of it was sitting in court
EDL	00:08:46,847	00:08:48,383	| serial-s01-e06 |	Having to read the rest of the letter
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:52,223	| serial-s01-e06 |	Police had found the note when they searched the nuns house
EDL	00:08:52,991	00:08:54,783	| serial-s01-e06 |	But tonight was about that one right
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:57,343	| serial-s01-e06 |	Seems like a detail you find in a Cheesy detective novel
EDL	00:08:58,367	00:09:00,159	| serial-s01-e06 |	The other one I'm not sure about
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:02,975	| serial-s01-e06 |	Is this kind of stray report in the police file
EDL	00:09:03,743	00:09:06,559	| serial-s01-e06 |	I called the cops and said
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,863	| serial-s01-e06 |	My daughter just heard something about a dead body
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:10,655	| serial-s01-e06 |	Tell the cops
EDL	00:09:10,655	00:09:12,191	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who's the neighbor boy who mentioned it
EDL	00:09:12,703	00:09:16,031	| serial-s01-e06 |	Names the neighbor boy but I'm just going to call him the neighbor boy
EDL	00:09:16,543	00:09:17,055	| serial-s01-e06 |	Here's Dave
EDL	00:09:17,567	00:09:20,895	| serial-s01-e06 |	I just remember he had told my daughter he had seen
EDL	00:09:22,687	00:09:26,783	| serial-s01-e06 |	Cut the body of a girl in the back of such are in the trunk of some vehicle
EDL	00:09:27,807	00:09:28,319	| serial-s01-e06 |	And
EDL	00:09:29,343	00:09:33,439	| serial-s01-e06 |	I seem to me that it was an a said it was like an oriental girl or something but that's
EDL	00:09:34,463	00:09:36,511	| serial-s01-e06 |	That's all I remember that's all I know about it
EDL	00:09:37,279	00:09:39,839	| serial-s01-e06 |	Did he tell it to you or just to your daughter my daughter didn't talk to me
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,935	| serial-s01-e06 |	They gave me his daughters number I went to see her right away
EDL	00:09:44,703	00:09:45,727	| serial-s01-e06 |	Her name is Laura
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:49,055	| serial-s01-e06 |	Here's what she remembered about what the neighbor boy told her that day
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:50,847	| serial-s01-e06 |	He was
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| serial-s01-e06 |	With a friend
EDL	00:09:54,431	00:09:56,991	| serial-s01-e06 |	The friend said something like look what I have
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:58,271	| serial-s01-e06 |	Pop the Trunk
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:09:59,295	| serial-s01-e06 |	And
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:01,343	| serial-s01-e06 |	That's what he saw
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,391	| serial-s01-e06 |	Did he seem upset
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:05,183	| serial-s01-e06 |	You seem Disturbed
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:06,975	| serial-s01-e06 |	More like a
EDL	00:10:06,975	00:10:07,999	| serial-s01-e06 |	Wow I can't believe what I did
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,815	| serial-s01-e06 |	Almost like he was
EDL	00:10:10,815	00:10:12,351	| serial-s01-e06 |	Maybe getting something off his chest
EDL	00:10:12,863	00:10:13,887	| serial-s01-e06 |	Type of thing
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,935	| serial-s01-e06 |	I asked Laura
EDL	00:10:15,935	00:10:18,751	| serial-s01-e06 |	Did the neighbor boy tell you the name of this friend who showed him the body
EDL	00:10:19,263	00:10:22,079	| serial-s01-e06 |	I think the guy's name was maybe Adnan
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:32,319	| serial-s01-e06 |	This guy said
EDL	00:10:32,319	00:10:34,879	| serial-s01-e06 |	My friend Adnan showed me the body of a girl in the back
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:35,647	| serial-s01-e06 |	Car
EDL	00:10:36,415	00:10:37,183	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:39,231	| serial-s01-e06 |	Do you think he was telling the truth
EDL	00:10:39,231	00:10:39,999	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yes
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:42,303	| serial-s01-e06 |	Lord and go to Woodlawn
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:43,839	| serial-s01-e06 |	She didn't know at 9
EDL	00:10:43,839	00:10:46,399	| serial-s01-e06 |	Chicken on the neighbor boy since they were little they're friendly
EDL	00:10:47,167	00:10:50,495	| serial-s01-e06 |	Laura said she never spoke to police about this I never questioned her
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| serial-s01-e06 |	So this sounds really really bad right
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:58,431	| serial-s01-e06 |	But there was another witness besides J who saw his body
EDL	00:10:58,431	00:11:00,223	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who shot at 9 with his body
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| serial-s01-e06 |	That's huge
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:05,599	| serial-s01-e06 |	I called the neighbor boy that same night
EDL	00:11:05,599	00:11:07,903	| serial-s01-e06 |	He's now somebody else's neighbor and he's a man
EDL	00:11:08,415	00:11:11,999	| serial-s01-e06 |	He was affable and patient and he holy deny this episode
EDL	00:11:12,511	00:11:13,535	| serial-s01-e06 |	He's pretty convincing
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:18,143	| serial-s01-e06 |	He said the only dead body I've seen is on TV God's honest truth
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:20,959	| serial-s01-e06 |	Tepper my great-grandmother she died when I was like 9
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:24,543	| serial-s01-e06 |	Man said he wasn't friends with Adnan
EDL	00:11:24,543	00:11:27,615	| serial-s01-e06 |	He was friends with Jada they smoked weed together
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:28,639	| serial-s01-e06 |	I suggested
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:33,503	| serial-s01-e06 |	Maybe Jay told him the story and he kind of appropriated it and told it to the neighbor girl to freak her out
EDL	00:11:34,015	00:11:35,039	| serial-s01-e06 |	You said no way
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:37,599	| serial-s01-e06 |	I wouldn't kid around about something like that
EDL	00:11:39,135	00:11:43,487	| serial-s01-e06 |	The cops came to see him in 99 and he told them the same thing you know anything
EDL	00:11:43,999	00:11:49,375	| serial-s01-e06 |	The statement to the same effect to a private investigator who was working for the defense in an oz case
EDL	00:11:49,887	00:11:50,399	| serial-s01-e06 |	I've read it
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:52,703	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is what's weird
EDL	00:11:53,215	00:11:59,103	| serial-s01-e06 |	The original police report about Dave and his daughter Laura it's dated April 28th
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:02,431	| serial-s01-e06 |	I had already been in jail for nearly two months
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:06,527	| serial-s01-e06 |	I was under the impression that whatever happened to her neighborhood just happened
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:09,343	| serial-s01-e06 |	I told her dad right away and he called the cops right away
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:20,863	| serial-s01-e06 |	A guy untalented at keeping secrets
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,167	| serial-s01-e06 |	Which could play either way I guess
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:26,495	| serial-s01-e06 |	Nobody would tell him anything they wanted to stay quiet
EDL	00:12:27,519	00:12:30,591	| serial-s01-e06 |	I never shows up a trial he's never mentioned
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:32,127	| serial-s01-e06 |	Let It Go
EDL	00:12:33,919	00:12:35,199	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know what is weird
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:37,247	| serial-s01-e06 |	And if Laura Story is true
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,295	| serial-s01-e06 |	And there's another witness to this murder
EDL	00:12:40,063	00:12:43,135	| serial-s01-e06 |	Things about this case that kind of Bob's above the water for me
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,671	| serial-s01-e06 |	Like a disturbing buoy
EDL	00:12:52,351	00:12:53,631	| serial-s01-e06 |	Then there's Cassie
EDL	00:12:54,143	00:12:57,727	| serial-s01-e06 |	That's not a real name and we've changed your voice and I'm calling her Kathy
EDL	00:12:58,239	00:12:59,519	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mentioned her before
EDL	00:13:00,287	00:13:05,407	| serial-s01-e06 |	She saw Adnan and Jay together acting suspiciously the word cheese as Shady
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:09,247	| serial-s01-e06 |	At a critical time that evening of the 13th the day he disappeared
EDL	00:13:09,759	00:13:11,295	| serial-s01-e06 |	A story
EDL	00:13:11,295	00:13:15,135	| serial-s01-e06 |	He brought his apartment after he picked Adnan up from track practice
EDL	00:13:15,647	00:13:19,231	| serial-s01-e06 |	So after Haven killed but before they went to bury her body
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:20,511	| serial-s01-e06 |	About 6 at night
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:24,351	| serial-s01-e06 |	MJ and Kathy
EDL	00:13:24,351	00:13:27,423	| serial-s01-e06 |	Knowledge being together at the apartment there's no dispute about that
EDL	00:13:28,447	00:13:31,519	| serial-s01-e06 |	Kathy was a close friend of Jen's they were sorority sisters
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:34,591	| serial-s01-e06 |	A little bit but only for Jen
EDL	00:13:34,591	00:13:35,871	| serial-s01-e06 |	Chicken at all
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:40,735	| serial-s01-e06 |	Acquaintance and a stranger
EDL	00:13:41,503	00:13:45,599	| serial-s01-e06 |	Heather remembers that night pretty clearly her boyfriend Jeff was there at the apartment 2
EDL	00:13:46,111	00:13:48,927	| serial-s01-e06 |	Surprise Lake little confused because
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:49,951	| serial-s01-e06 |	Didn't call me last
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:52,255	| serial-s01-e06 |	Antlers with Jonathan
EDL	00:13:52,255	00:13:53,279	| serial-s01-e06 |	No it called
EDL	00:13:54,303	00:13:56,351	| serial-s01-e06 |	How long do you want to hang out
EDL	00:13:56,351	00:13:59,167	| serial-s01-e06 |	Nothing like that so it's a little strange that he would just pop up in the door
EDL	00:13:59,679	00:14:02,495	| serial-s01-e06 |	Cameron me like you do you want to smoke do you want to
EDL	00:14:02,495	00:14:05,055	| serial-s01-e06 |	Hang out and I remember being like why not a second
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,615	| serial-s01-e06 |	Asking Josh you know if you wanted to
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:09,407	| serial-s01-e06 |	Jada the door
EDL	00:14:10,687	00:14:11,199	| serial-s01-e06 |	For what
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:15,295	| serial-s01-e06 |	High School
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:19,647	| serial-s01-e06 |	So J came in and introduced his friend
EDL	00:14:21,695	00:14:22,207	| serial-s01-e06 |	Just like you know
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:23,743	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's a friend of mine
EDL	00:14:24,767	00:14:30,911	| serial-s01-e06 |	Kathy remembers J set over by the table on the floor on some big cushions that were there and didn't speak
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,703	| serial-s01-e06 |	And where the guy wasn't
EDL	00:14:32,703	00:14:34,751	| serial-s01-e06 |	Doing a whole lot of talking like he was just kind
EDL	00:14:36,031	00:14:36,799	| serial-s01-e06 |	Start over
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:38,847	| serial-s01-e06 |	Emma stole my car shows
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:43,711	| serial-s01-e06 |	I kind of thought it was really strange like who is a
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:44,991	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who is this guy
EDL	00:14:47,039	00:14:51,647	| serial-s01-e06 |	When I first heard about Kathy statement in her testimony didn't seem like a big deal to me
EDL	00:14:51,647	00:14:54,975	| serial-s01-e06 |	Does a girl who says some kid she didn't know who was high
EDL	00:14:54,975	00:14:56,767	| serial-s01-e06 |	Was acting strangely in our living room
EDL	00:14:57,279	00:15:02,399	| serial-s01-e06 |	I've been that girl for chrissakes having a deal with a stone friend-of-a-friend on the living room floor
EDL	00:15:02,399	00:15:04,959	| serial-s01-e06 |	I probably been that weird guy in the floor at least once
EDL	00:15:06,239	00:15:09,055	| serial-s01-e06 |	Listen to Kathy tell it all these years later
EDL	00:15:09,055	00:15:09,823	| serial-s01-e06 |	The way it's
EDL	00:15:09,823	00:15:10,847	| serial-s01-e06 |	Stuck with her
EDL	00:15:10,847	00:15:13,919	| serial-s01-e06 |	How she describes a whole night that's just feeling wrong
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:15,711	| serial-s01-e06 |	Stick with me
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:22,879	| serial-s01-e06 |	Happy thought J was acting out as well as super laid-back Stoner guy like Shaggy from Scooby Doo
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,439	| serial-s01-e06 |	Inconspicuously chatty
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:29,279	| serial-s01-e06 |	How is your day what's going on you know it's kind of like Phil
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:31,071	| serial-s01-e06 |	The Dominator conversation
EDL	00:15:31,839	00:15:35,423	| serial-s01-e06 |	She says why were there Jen called the apartment
EDL	00:15:35,423	00:15:37,727	| serial-s01-e06 |	Or maybe it was she who called Jen can't remember now
EDL	00:15:38,495	00:15:41,311	| serial-s01-e06 |	But she does remember talking to Jen and saying
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:44,383	| serial-s01-e06 |	He's here with some kid who's practically passed out on the cushions
EDL	00:15:44,383	00:15:47,199	| serial-s01-e06 |	That was curiously what's Jay doing there
EDL	00:15:47,711	00:15:50,783	| serial-s01-e06 |	Still kathy that jave been acting weird earlier in the day 2
EDL	00:15:51,807	00:15:56,159	| serial-s01-e06 |	The story he's telling is pretty close to what you told the cops during the investigation
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:59,743	| serial-s01-e06 |	Detective Miguel very energy Kathy in March of 99
EDL	00:15:59,743	00:16:01,279	| serial-s01-e06 |	Afternoon tea been arrested
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:03,327	| serial-s01-e06 |	She told him back then
EDL	00:16:03,327	00:16:05,887	| serial-s01-e06 |	Remember to nanjing only one thing to the group
EDL	00:16:06,399	00:16:07,679	| serial-s01-e06 |	How do I get rid of a high
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:10,239	| serial-s01-e06 |	How do I get rid of a high
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,103	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's really important
EDL	00:16:21,247	00:16:24,831	| serial-s01-e06 |	Do you have any idea where he was going to go who is going to be
EDL	00:16:24,831	00:16:30,975	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't know I'm at my camera clearer but I remember him saying I have to go talk to someone actually meet someone.
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:37,375	| serial-s01-e06 |	I remember how to do
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:48,127	| serial-s01-e06 |	Incoming calls on the call log that King towers near Kathy's house
EDL	00:16:48,639	00:16:51,711	| serial-s01-e06 |	607 609 and 6:24 p.m.
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,991	| serial-s01-e06 |	That's the longest one
EDL	00:16:52,991	00:16:54,271	| serial-s01-e06 |	More than 4 minutes
EDL	00:16:55,551	00:17:01,951	| serial-s01-e06 |	We don't know for sure who they're from but officer Adcock testifies that he calls around this time and he thinks the 624
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,975	| serial-s01-e06 |	For college probably him
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:08,095	| serial-s01-e06 |	Young also calls are not around this time looking for a sister
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:10,399	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't know who the third College from
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:15,775	| serial-s01-e06 |	Kathy definitely remembers Adnan getting one song called while he was at her apartment
EDL	00:17:16,543	00:17:21,407	| serial-s01-e06 |	She says they're sitting around talking one of Kathy's favorite shows is on the TV Judge Judy
EDL	00:17:21,919	00:17:23,711	| serial-s01-e06 |	The phone rings and
EDL	00:17:24,223	00:17:26,527	| serial-s01-e06 |	You had said anything the whole time he had been there
EDL	00:17:27,039	00:17:29,087	| serial-s01-e06 |	So when he answers the phone
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:29,855	| serial-s01-e06 |	Anything

EDL	00:17:39,327	00:17:40,095	| serial-s01-e06 |	Worried
EDL	00:17:40,095	00:17:41,375	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's all right you know like this was
EDL	00:17:42,143	00:17:43,167	| serial-s01-e06 |	Whatever was happening
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,959	| serial-s01-e06 |	Not good on the other line
EDL	00:17:47,263	00:17:48,287	| serial-s01-e06 |	Lamborghini

EDL	00:17:52,383	00:17:54,687	| serial-s01-e06 |	Wondering what was going on
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:57,759	| serial-s01-e06 |	And then I'm not too long after
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,039	| serial-s01-e06 |	He hung up the phone
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:17:59,807	| serial-s01-e06 |	Laugh
EDL	00:17:59,807	00:18:00,319	| serial-s01-e06 |	Just

EDL	00:18:03,391	00:18:03,903	| serial-s01-e06 |	Left
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:05,951	| serial-s01-e06 |	Jay follows Adnan out
EDL	00:18:05,951	00:18:07,999	| serial-s01-e06 |	Leaves his hat and smokes behind Kathy says
EDL	00:18:08,511	00:18:13,631	| serial-s01-e06 |	Stairs and then she says they get in a car and just sit there in the car for a while
EDL	00:18:13,631	00:18:16,447	| serial-s01-e06 |	As so now they're outside in the car
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:21,567	| serial-s01-e06 |	Never going to the window like why they doing you know Jethro in the car that just sitting there you know what

EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:33,343	| serial-s01-e06 |	Don't matter what you know who cares you know
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:37,183	| serial-s01-e06 |	What is going on
EDL	00:18:37,695	00:18:41,279	| serial-s01-e06 |	And you never met
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:45,119	| serial-s01-e06 |	The other guy before it right so you didn't know what was normal behavior for him
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,959	| serial-s01-e06 |	Normal behavior for
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,263	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean anybody I mean did I was just
EDL	00:18:53,567	00:18:55,359	| serial-s01-e06 |	Whether you know him or not
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,127	| serial-s01-e06 |	Philly Hotel
EDL	00:18:56,639	00:18:59,711	| serial-s01-e06 |	Something was going on something wasn't going on it wasn't good
EDL	00:18:59,711	00:19:00,479	| serial-s01-e06 |	Anna
EDL	00:19:01,759	00:19:02,527	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yeah
EDL	00:19:02,527	00:19:04,319	| serial-s01-e06 |	I was just drinking maybe for anybody
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,623	| serial-s01-e06 |	I think that's been
EDL	00:19:06,623	00:19:08,927	| serial-s01-e06 |	The one thing I've always remembered like
EDL	00:19:08,927	00:19:10,719	| serial-s01-e06 |	How he said how he looked when he said it
EDL	00:19:11,487	00:19:12,511	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's definitely
EDL	00:19:13,023	00:19:13,535	| serial-s01-e06 |	Panicked
EDL	00:19:14,303	00:19:15,583	| serial-s01-e06 |	He's definitely
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:18,911	| serial-s01-e06 |	Worried and
EDL	00:19:20,703	00:19:24,287	| serial-s01-e06 |	I can imagine if I was in the position just what I would have been saying on the phone
EDL	00:19:24,287	00:19:26,079	| serial-s01-e06 |	My best friend you know
EDL	00:19:26,079	00:19:29,663	| serial-s01-e06 |	My God what am I going to do they're going to come talk to me what am I supposed to say
EDL	00:19:29,663	00:19:31,199	| serial-s01-e06 |	You're trying to come up with some
EDL	00:19:32,479	00:19:33,759	| serial-s01-e06 |	Story quickly
EDL	00:19:38,879	00:19:45,023	| serial-s01-e06 |	Many hours later at the end of the night she came back to CAD
EDL	00:19:46,047	00:19:47,327	| serial-s01-e06 |	Without an ion
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:49,119	| serial-s01-e06 |	But this time John was with him
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:51,423	| serial-s01-e06 |	Living like so what the f***
EDL	00:19:52,191	00:19:54,751	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yeah when I remember kind of them both being like
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,031	| serial-s01-e06 |	Something you know
EDL	00:19:56,799	00:19:58,847	| serial-s01-e06 |	Smoothing it over think a little bit
EDL	00:19:59,615	00:20:01,151	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I thought it was kind of like
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:03,967	| serial-s01-e06 |	No big deal. You could death
EDL	00:20:05,247	00:20:07,039	| serial-s01-e06 |	A big deal and whatever
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:12,927	| serial-s01-e06 |	What's going on with kind of like a secret or you know because Jen and I were best friends I mean
EDL	00:20:13,439	00:20:15,999	| serial-s01-e06 |	Honey we talked about everything I mean we were
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:20,351	| serial-s01-e06 |	Any we don't do anything without talking about it or you know I knew what she was
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:23,679	| serial-s01-e06 |	Wearing in the morning anyway she was going at night you know I knew
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:27,775	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yoshi talk to on the phone you know it's a little strange that when I said so what happened
EDL	00:20:28,287	00:20:29,823	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I didn't get a full like
EDL	00:20:29,823	00:20:30,335	| serial-s01-e06 |	Account
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:41,343	| serial-s01-e06 |	Next time I talk to and I told him how Kathy still remembered all this stuff how Shady the whole scene was for her
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,951	| serial-s01-e06 |	How much water with them
EDL	00:20:46,719	00:20:53,119	| serial-s01-e06 |	First of all if someone had called him to warn him the police were about to call why would he then answer the phone when the police
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,887	| serial-s01-e06 |	What is called
EDL	00:20:53,887	00:20:57,215	| serial-s01-e06 |	Answer my phone
EDL	00:20:57,983	00:20:59,775	| serial-s01-e06 |	Turn the phone off
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:05,663	| serial-s01-e06 |	We're going in the scenario I'm trying to avoid the police
EDL	00:21:06,431	00:21:09,759	| serial-s01-e06 |	United mean that I wouldn't pick up the phone and engage them in a conversation
EDL	00:21:10,271	00:21:16,672	| serial-s01-e06 |	Well but there's also the other thing where you just like just act normal.
EDL	00:21:16,672	00:21:17,440	| serial-s01-e06 |	After school
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:21,024	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know like where you try to
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:22,304	| serial-s01-e06 |	Just play cool
EDL	00:21:31,008	00:21:35,360	| serial-s01-e06 |	Started visual
EDL	00:21:42,528	00:21:43,296	| serial-s01-e06 |	Right
EDL	00:21:43,296	00:21:45,600	| serial-s01-e06 |	Her story would imply a third man
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:46,880	| serial-s01-e06 |	A co-conspirator
EDL	00:21:47,392	00:21:49,440	| serial-s01-e06 |	Would be on the phone with
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:50,976	| serial-s01-e06 |	The clearly knew about the murder
EDL	00:21:51,744	00:21:53,792	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who would the third color be
EDL	00:21:53,792	00:21:55,584	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who's the third person on the phone
EDL	00:21:56,096	00:21:59,424	| serial-s01-e06 |	EBenefits
EDL	00:21:59,424	00:22:03,776	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean it's that's a hard one it's her testimony does not look good for you you know
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:08,384	| serial-s01-e06 |	Because she is not really connected to Jay she's not connected to you
EDL	00:22:08,896	00:22:10,432	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know she's a little bit
EDL	00:22:10,432	00:22:11,968	| serial-s01-e06 |	More objective I would say
EDL	00:22:12,992	00:22:14,784	| serial-s01-e06 |	And she really thought you were acting
EDL	00:22:15,552	00:22:16,576	| serial-s01-e06 |	Very strangely
EDL	00:22:18,624	00:22:21,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	So it didn't it's not good for you what she has to say
EDL	00:22:27,584	00:22:30,656	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean I listen to you but I kind of think that
EDL	00:22:31,424	00:22:35,008	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is not good for me if a person believes The Narrative of what you're saying
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:40,128	| serial-s01-e06 |	But if you don't believe in their civil would chase a horrible person questions
EDL	00:22:40,128	00:22:43,200	| serial-s01-e06 |	What did she say specifically that links me to Hays Market
EDL	00:22:43,712	00:22:46,528	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know she didn't say she didn't say that she saw me with any
EDL	00:22:46,528	00:22:51,648	| serial-s01-e06 |	Type of equipment or materials are charged clothes or Devils or anything like that
EDL	00:22:51,648	00:22:52,416	| serial-s01-e06 |	RTA
EDL	00:22:53,184	00:22:54,464	| serial-s01-e06 |	Well
EDL	00:22:55,232	00:22:59,584	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't know
EDL	00:23:00,096	00:23:01,888	| serial-s01-e06 |	I feel really
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:04,192	| serial-s01-e06 |	All this in the car is in the context of her
EDL	00:23:04,704	00:23:09,056	| serial-s01-e06 |	Leaving okay well maybe he did this or he's charged with this and you know it now all this stuff
EDL	00:23:09,056	00:23:12,896	| serial-s01-e06 |	Make sense whatever may not have been estranged
EDL	00:23:12,896	00:23:14,176	| serial-s01-e06 |	Adam never been charged
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:14,688	| serial-s01-e06 |	What's this
EDL	00:23:16,480	00:23:17,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	Second thought
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:19,040	| serial-s01-e06 |	Had I never been charged with his murder
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:22,368	| serial-s01-e06 |	Maybe
EDL	00:23:22,880	00:23:23,648	| serial-s01-e06 |	Maybe not
EDL	00:23:32,608	00:23:34,912	| serial-s01-e06 |	Person who puts Jane and on together that night
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:35,680	| serial-s01-e06 |	Next gen
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:42,848	| serial-s01-e06 |	Now last episode we talked about those two incoming we can park calls on the call log at 7:09 and 7:16
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:44,640	| serial-s01-e06 |	She says they were burying hay
EDL	00:23:45,408	00:23:47,968	| serial-s01-e06 |	Are we think the cell phone really was in Lincoln Park
EDL	00:23:49,248	00:23:51,552	| serial-s01-e06 |	Jen has a cameo in that scene
EDL	00:23:51,552	00:23:54,112	| serial-s01-e06 |	Jen says she was one of those incoming calls
EDL	00:23:55,136	00:23:58,720	| serial-s01-e06 |	She said she call the cell phone around that time looking for Jay
EDL	00:23:58,720	00:24:00,000	| serial-s01-e06 |	Button on picked up
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:03,072	| serial-s01-e06 |	He didn't identify himself but she assumed it was an on
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:05,120	| serial-s01-e06 |	Hears from her police interview
EDL	00:24:05,120	00:24:05,632	| serial-s01-e06 |	When
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,168	| serial-s01-e06 |	I called them
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:10,496	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't answer the phone
EDL	00:24:10,496	00:24:12,544	| serial-s01-e06 |	And said she would call you
EDL	00:24:12,544	00:24:13,824	| serial-s01-e06 |	You back when you're right when he's ready
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:16,896	| serial-s01-e06 |	Can you come and get him a few time meet him or whatever
EDL	00:24:19,200	00:24:19,712	| serial-s01-e06 |	Annum
EDL	00:24:20,224	00:24:21,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	So that's all
EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,040	| serial-s01-e06 |	Very quick and very
EDL	00:24:25,600	00:24:30,464	| serial-s01-e06 |	Jen Story is true it does look an awful lot like Adnan was in Lincoln Park that night
EDL	00:24:30,976	00:24:33,536	| serial-s01-e06 |	Busy not handing the phone over to Jay
EDL	00:24:34,816	00:24:40,704	| serial-s01-e06 |	The second time Jen puts them together that night is pretty soon after that when she picks Jay up sometime after 8
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:44,032	| serial-s01-e06 |	So in Jesus timeline after they've already buried hey
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:48,896	| serial-s01-e06 |	She said she'd arranged to meet him in the parking lot of Westview Mall
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:51,456	| serial-s01-e06 |	She said she saw them arrive in add-ons car
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:55,296	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I said hi to me
EDL	00:24:55,296	00:24:56,064	| serial-s01-e06 |	Say what's up girl
EDL	00:24:56,576	00:24:58,368	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I was like Hey so
EDL	00:24:59,136	00:25:01,184	| serial-s01-e06 |	And then you left
EDL	00:25:01,184	00:25:01,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	The parking lot
EDL	00:25:02,976	00:25:04,256	| serial-s01-e06 |	Smj told me
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| serial-s01-e06 |	What the exchange
EDL	00:25:05,536	00:25:07,840	| serial-s01-e06 |	Hey what's up girl how are you describe
EDL	00:25:10,144	00:25:11,936	| serial-s01-e06 |	It seems like you know
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:16,032	| serial-s01-e06 |	Inside that details always stuck with me to
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:18,336	| serial-s01-e06 |	Legend says Adnan seem so normal
EDL	00:25:18,848	00:25:21,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	She says neither his nor J's close he mustered dirty
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:27,040	| serial-s01-e06 |	Doesn't remember seeing Janet Westview Mall or where he dropped off Jade at night
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,368	| serial-s01-e06 |	And Jay doesn't say he met Jen at Westview either
EDL	00:25:30,368	00:25:32,672	| serial-s01-e06 |	Matter fact Chasez consistently
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,512	| serial-s01-e06 |	Turn on dropped him off at home and then Jen showed up at his house to get him
EDL	00:25:37,536	00:25:38,560	| serial-s01-e06 |	Just talked to that
EDL	00:25:38,560	00:25:39,584	| serial-s01-e06 |	Even a trial
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:41,120	| serial-s01-e06 |	When it contradicted Jen Story
EDL	00:25:42,400	00:25:46,752	| serial-s01-e06 |	The thing about Jen and Kathy though is that even if they don't look great for Adnan
EDL	00:25:46,752	00:25:49,824	| serial-s01-e06 |	They don't actually contradict anons on account of that evening
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:52,128	| serial-s01-e06 |	Which I think is why he kind of shrugs them off
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,432	| serial-s01-e06 |	Why I'm sometimes tempted to shrug them off
EDL	00:25:55,200	00:25:58,016	| serial-s01-e06 |	Because it has always admitted she was hanging out with Jay that night
EDL	00:25:58,528	00:26:01,088	| serial-s01-e06 |	So what if a couple of people saw them together
EDL	00:26:01,088	00:26:01,856	| serial-s01-e06 |	Does that prove
EDL	00:26:03,392	00:26:05,184	| serial-s01-e06 |	Now we come to the big one
EDL	00:26:05,696	00:26:07,232	| serial-s01-e06 |	The one nobody can shrug off
EDL	00:26:08,000	00:26:14,400	| serial-s01-e06 |	Just call Wilkinson a bad metaphor for a phone call but of all the calls on the log this is the one I think I've is the smoke
EDL	00:26:14,400	00:26:15,424	| serial-s01-e06 |	Pekin gun call
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,448	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's the Nisha call
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,752	| serial-s01-e06 |	Think of it as a title capitalized
EDL	00:26:19,520	00:26:20,288	| serial-s01-e06 |	The Nisha call
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:27,968	| serial-s01-e06 |	Between noon and 5 p.m. that there's 7 outgoing calls on the log 6 of them are two people jado's
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,040	| serial-s01-e06 |	The 7th is Tunisia
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:38,976	| serial-s01-e06 |	Anon story is that he and his cell phone were separated that day from lunchtime all the way until after track at around 5
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:39,488	| serial-s01-e06 |	5 something
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:43,328	| serial-s01-e06 |	Benicia call happens at 3:32 p.m.
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,864	| serial-s01-e06 |	Smack in the middle of the afternoon
EDL	00:26:45,376	00:26:49,216	| serial-s01-e06 |	The prosecution makes much of this call at closing and I can see why
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:55,872	| serial-s01-e06 |	NJ second tape statement granted is the one where detectives are showing him the call records
EDL	00:26:55,872	00:27:01,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	Detective mcgilvery is asking Jay about all those afternoon calls on the log between 3 and 4
EDL	00:27:02,016	00:27:07,136	| serial-s01-e06 |	Again Jace's this is when they were driving all around Forest Park and Edmondson Avenue looking for weed
EDL	00:27:07,136	00:27:08,416	| serial-s01-e06 |	Did anybody else use the phone
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yeah
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:13,792	| serial-s01-e06 |	Adnan I can't remember whether he received to call place to call
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,584	| serial-s01-e06 |	But I remember he was talking to a girl
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:17,888	| serial-s01-e06 |	Can't remember her name
EDL	00:27:17,888	00:27:20,960	| serial-s01-e06 |	On the phone with her for like 3 minutes I said hello to her
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:21,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	Where did she live
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,032	| serial-s01-e06 |	Silver Spring
EDL	00:27:25,056	00:27:26,336	| serial-s01-e06 |	Your caller name
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,616	| serial-s01-e06 |	No I don't
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	You have any idea why Adnan
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:30,432	| serial-s01-e06 |	We call
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:33,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	This individual in Silver Spring
EDL	00:27:33,248	00:27:34,272	| serial-s01-e06 |	After he hits you
EDL	00:27:35,040	00:27:37,600	| serial-s01-e06 |	No strangled his girlfriend
EDL	00:27:37,600	00:27:38,880	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't and
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,000	| serial-s01-e06 |	I have no idea why
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:44,512	| serial-s01-e06 |	You call
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:48,608	| serial-s01-e06 |	In a conversation didn't change anything if you just done
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,192	| serial-s01-e06 |	The cops went and talked to Misha to the high school student
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:57,824	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yeah there was a time when I spoke to an on his cell and he put his friend Jay on the phone
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,640	| serial-s01-e06 |	Misha testified at both trials
EDL	00:28:01,152	00:28:03,968	| serial-s01-e06 |	For Smoking Gun she's very cute like a chipmunk
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:05,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	Good afternoon
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,552	| serial-s01-e06 |	Good afternoon to you too sir
EDL	00:28:07,552	00:28:09,600	| serial-s01-e06 |	Do you know the defendant
EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:10,368	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yes I do
EDL	00:28:10,880	00:28:12,416	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is from trial number one
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:16,256	| serial-s01-e06 |	It's a little hard to recall but I remember
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:19,328	| serial-s01-e06 |	I'm telling you that they invited invited him over
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:22,144	| serial-s01-e06 |	To arm a video store. He worked at
EDL	00:28:22,912	00:28:23,680	| serial-s01-e06 |	And
EDL	00:28:24,448	00:28:29,312	| serial-s01-e06 |	He basically walked in with a cell phone and then he said
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:32,384	| serial-s01-e06 |	Like he told me to speak with Jay and I was like okay
EDL	00:28:32,384	00:28:34,944	| serial-s01-e06 |	Cuz they wanted to say hi so I said hi today
EDL	00:28:35,456	00:28:37,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	And that's all I can barely recall
EDL	00:28:38,272	00:28:40,064	| serial-s01-e06 |	At what time of day did that occur
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:44,672	| serial-s01-e06 |	I would think towards the evening but I can't be exactly sure
EDL	00:28:45,696	00:28:50,304	| serial-s01-e06 |	The prosecutor Kevin urick asked her if this call the 3:30 to call in the log
EDL	00:28:50,816	00:28:53,376	| serial-s01-e06 |	Could it be that same call Lauren on PJ on the phone
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,400	| serial-s01-e06 |	And she says
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:56,448	| serial-s01-e06 |	It could be but I'm not sure
EDL	00:28:57,728	00:28:59,776	| serial-s01-e06 |	Video store
EDL	00:28:59,776	00:29:04,384	| serial-s01-e06 |	He worked mostly nights there so it makes sense this call would have happened towards the evening
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:08,224	| serial-s01-e06 |	What doesn't make sense if Nisha saying this call happened at the video store
EDL	00:29:08,736	00:29:11,808	| serial-s01-e06 |	Is it Jaden have that job yet on January 13th
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:17,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	As far as I can tell from j-zone testimony and from the notes of a private investigator for the defense
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:19,744	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who interviewed the video store manager
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:22,816	| serial-s01-e06 |	Jaden start working there until the very end of January
EDL	00:29:24,608	00:29:26,912	| serial-s01-e06 |	Listen to what happens at the second trial
EDL	00:29:26,912	00:29:28,704	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't have a tape but I have a transcript
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,008	| serial-s01-e06 |	Your gas Tanisha
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:36,128	| serial-s01-e06 |	Become a time when the defendant called you and put a person he identified as J on the line
EDL	00:29:36,128	00:29:36,640	| serial-s01-e06 |	Yes
EDL	00:29:37,408	00:29:40,480	| serial-s01-e06 |	Please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what that call consisted of
EDL	00:29:40,992	00:29:42,272	| serial-s01-e06 |	You should start to answer
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:46,112	| serial-s01-e06 |	Basically
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:49,184	| serial-s01-e06 |	He says
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:49,952	| serial-s01-e06 |	No don't
EDL	00:29:49,952	00:29:51,488	| serial-s01-e06 |	Tell us the content of the call
EDL	00:29:52,512	00:29:58,656	| serial-s01-e06 |	I guess I said the prosecutor is trying to get her to not mention the video store because it contradicts their story
EDL	00:29:59,680	00:30:03,520	| serial-s01-e06 |	Ninja says okay he just asked me how I was doing the sitter and then she goes on
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:06,080	| serial-s01-e06 |	She doesn't mention the video start of your again
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:12,992	| serial-s01-e06 |	So I'm convinced this call the 3:30 to call on the 13th
EDL	00:30:12,992	00:30:16,064	| serial-s01-e06 |	That this was a call when a non put down the phone with Nisha
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:17,856	| serial-s01-e06 |	Still
EDL	00:30:18,880	00:30:24,768	| serial-s01-e06 |	Bernard is supposedly at school during this time and J's not talking to Nisha for 2 minutes and 22 seconds
EDL	00:30:26,304	00:30:27,840	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who the hell is calling Misha
EDL	00:30:29,376	00:30:31,424	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is what a non can't explain
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:33,216	| serial-s01-e06 |	I've asked him about it many times
EDL	00:30:33,728	00:30:37,824	| serial-s01-e06 |	He says niches number was entered into his phone on speed dial
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:40,128	| serial-s01-e06 |	You can see calls are allowed on the cell
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:44,224	| serial-s01-e06 |	And Fighters is the very first number he dials when the phone is activated on the 12th
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:50,880	| serial-s01-e06 |	What must have happened is some combination of a butt dial and an answering machine
EDL	00:30:50,880	00:30:52,672	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is from one of our very first phone calls
EDL	00:31:05,728	00:31:07,520	| serial-s01-e06 |	But if she but she says
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:08,800	| serial-s01-e06 |	She test
EDL	00:31:08,800	00:31:13,408	| serial-s01-e06 |	That's her phone does not have an answering machine or voicemail on it
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:19,808	| serial-s01-e06 |	So who is picking up that call and talkin for 2 and 1/2 minutes or whatever it was
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,856	| serial-s01-e06 |	2 minutes and 22 seconds or so
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:26,976	| serial-s01-e06 |	I'm sure
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:31,328	| serial-s01-e06 |	Call voicemail
EDL	00:31:32,096	00:31:33,632	| serial-s01-e06 |	Call Duck
EDL	00:31:35,168	00:31:36,960	| serial-s01-e06 |	Let me look let me look when I look older
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:38,496	| serial-s01-e06 |	I was right
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,776	| serial-s01-e06 |	Here's from the first trial
EDL	00:31:39,776	00:31:43,360	| serial-s01-e06 |	Eurocast Nisha does your home phone have an answering machine
EDL	00:31:43,872	00:31:45,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	Does your home phone have an answering machine
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,968	| serial-s01-e06 |	Not this phone number now
EDL	00:32:25,856	00:32:29,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	Past year I've swivel the Rubik's cube of this case so many different ways
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:34,304	| serial-s01-e06 |	I've arranged and rearranged it to come up with alternate versions of how this day might have actually gone
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:37,632	| serial-s01-e06 |	Certain hypothetical directions
EDL	00:32:38,144	00:32:41,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	Every time Jay says Adnan name in his story
EDL	00:32:41,984	00:32:44,288	| serial-s01-e06 |	Maybe he's really talking about someone else
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:50,688	| serial-s01-e06 |	Person we don't know about today's afraid of her he's trying to protect mean he's got the car j's got the phone
EDL	00:32:50,688	00:32:52,736	| serial-s01-e06 |	All these calls are to his friends
EDL	00:32:53,248	00:32:55,552	| serial-s01-e06 |	And then I remember
EDL	00:32:55,552	00:32:56,832	| serial-s01-e06 |	Tanisha call
EDL	00:32:56,832	00:32:58,368	| serial-s01-e06 |	Whole thing crumbles
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:05,024	| serial-s01-e06 |	No Way Around It the Nisha call is a big fat problem for a nun
EDL	00:33:11,680	00:33:13,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	His biggest fear is not being believed
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,032	| serial-s01-e06 |	When he's sure about something
EDL	00:33:16,032	00:33:18,336	| serial-s01-e06 |	He has a tendency to over explain
EDL	00:33:18,336	00:33:23,200	| serial-s01-e06 |	To inundate you with facts and information and then corroboration for the facts and information
EDL	00:33:23,712	00:33:27,296	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't like this tendency in himself but he says he can't help it
EDL	00:33:27,296	00:33:33,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	Anyone who knows he was saying that I'll try to go over Force before my people be like alright man alright man we believe you
EDL	00:33:33,696	00:33:35,488	| serial-s01-e06 |	It rained yesterday
EDL	00:33:35,488	00:33:38,048	| serial-s01-e06 |	Because in my mind just like it just received something
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:40,864	| serial-s01-e06 |	Personality Quirk born of all this
EDL	00:33:41,376	00:33:44,704	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean I really I don't like to talk about things unless I can prove
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	No matter how silly it is
EDL	00:33:47,008	00:33:48,544	| serial-s01-e06 |	He does it with anything
EDL	00:33:49,056	00:33:53,920	| serial-s01-e06 |	He's a cook at the prison and he said he got into a discussion with some guys recently about barbecue sauce
EDL	00:33:54,432	00:34:00,832	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I was saying if you don't have Molasses for brown sugar you can substitute pancake syrup
EDL	00:34:00,832	00:34:05,184	| serial-s01-e06 |	Breakfast
EDL	00:34:05,696	00:34:11,840	| serial-s01-e06 |	Nobody needs barbecue sauce at breakfast time at the Maximum Security Prison in Cumberland Maryland but he didn't anyway
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,192	| serial-s01-e06 |	All these things that look bad for a nun
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:19,008	| serial-s01-e06 |	Everything that's raised my suspicions even stupid things
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:21,312	| serial-s01-e06 |	I run every single one of them by him
EDL	00:34:21,824	00:34:26,688	| serial-s01-e06 |	I got this thing in my head that I'll catch him in a lie maybe just a tiny meaningless lie
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:28,480	| serial-s01-e06 |	And that's going to be his towel
EDL	00:34:28,480	00:34:29,248	| serial-s01-e06 |	He'll be caught
EDL	00:34:30,016	00:34:33,600	| serial-s01-e06 |	Not as smart and clever he knows that's what's going on we talk
EDL	00:34:34,112	00:34:37,952	| serial-s01-e06 |	Every time I call he's a little on guard is not sure what's coming at him
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:41,024	| serial-s01-e06 |	Cuz what if I ask him something he can't prove
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,304	| serial-s01-e06 |	And then I don't believe in
EDL	00:34:43,584	00:34:48,448	| serial-s01-e06 |	That notion that people out there in the world people he went to school with who knew him
EDL	00:34:48,448	00:34:49,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	Don't believe him
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:52,544	| serial-s01-e06 |	But they could imagine he's capable of killing hey
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:55,360	| serial-s01-e06 |	And I'm spent 15 years thinking about that
EDL	00:34:55,360	00:34:57,152	| serial-s01-e06 |	And then try not to think about that
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:00,992	| serial-s01-e06 |	What was it about me
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:04,576	| serial-s01-e06 |	It is what it is
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:09,440	| serial-s01-e06 |	What was it what was it about me
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:11,232	| serial-s01-e06 |	Difference between Xs
EDL	00:35:16,096	00:35:20,960	| serial-s01-e06 |	All the stuff of me like
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:26,592	| serial-s01-e06 |	Call me leaving with her
EDL	00:35:27,104	00:35:30,176	| serial-s01-e06 |	She said yes to going here like

EDL	00:35:53,472	00:35:55,264	| serial-s01-e06 |	I used to really really like you know
EDL	00:35:57,312	00:35:58,336	| serial-s01-e06 |	Take me to my core
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:02,432	| serial-s01-e06 |	Just just like just like what is it
EDL	00:36:02,432	00:36:07,296	| serial-s01-e06 |	About me that would allow someone to even entertain the possibility that I could do this
EDL	00:36:09,600	00:36:10,624	| serial-s01-e06 |	Is that the thing
EDL	00:36:11,904	00:36:14,976	| serial-s01-e06 |	I mean when you really think about it
EDL	00:36:14,976	00:36:17,024	| serial-s01-e06 |	Pool
EDL	00:36:36,992	00:36:39,296	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't think I ever displayed in Tennessee
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,088	| serial-s01-e06 |	He's like that like that you know
EDL	00:36:45,440	00:36:49,280	| serial-s01-e06 |	I'm actually would have assumed it was the police got the right guy they got them for the right reason
EDL	00:36:49,280	00:36:50,560	| serial-s01-e06 |	Because
EDL	00:36:51,072	00:36:52,608	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know he was ex-boyfriend
EDL	00:36:52,608	00:36:55,680	| serial-s01-e06 |	I will be doing the same thing but
EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,008	| serial-s01-e06 |	But you know what I know and it's like the people who
EDL	00:36:59,008	00:37:05,152	| serial-s01-e06 |	Have told me that they think either they they should have after a long time came to the conclusion that you were guilty or the
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:12,832	| serial-s01-e06 |	They're kind of like I don't know maybe I've never really liked they all at some point in the conversation almost everybody
EDL	00:37:12,832	00:37:16,160	| serial-s01-e06 |	He has said well the unknown I knew didn't do it
EDL	00:37:16,160	00:37:18,464	| serial-s01-e06 |	Like the guy I knew couldn't have done it
EDL	00:37:24,864	00:37:27,680	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know what I mean
EDL	00:37:28,192	00:37:33,568	| serial-s01-e06 |	So what they're saying is maybe there was another guy in there that I just never
EDL	00:37:35,104	00:37:35,872	| serial-s01-e06 |	New
EDL	00:37:35,872	00:37:37,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know like everybody has
EDL	00:37:38,176	00:37:42,016	| serial-s01-e06 |	Deep dark
EDL	00:37:42,016	00:37:45,344	| serial-s01-e06 |	Not everyone has a good you do something cool and heinous like this
EDL	00:37:45,344	00:37:46,368	| serial-s01-e06 |	Uno
EDL	00:37:46,880	00:37:53,024	| serial-s01-e06 |	Galaxy paint color for June
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:09,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't believe you're not someone who believes that like everyone put in
EDL	00:38:10,176	00:38:16,320	| serial-s01-e06 |	Anyone could kill depending on the circumstances like if they were innocent
EDL	00:38:16,832	00:38:21,184	| serial-s01-e06 |	If it's me or him
EDL	00:38:21,184	00:38:23,232	| serial-s01-e06 |	If my kids are in danger
EDL	00:38:23,232	00:38:23,744	| serial-s01-e06 |	No
EDL	00:38:25,024	00:38:26,048	| serial-s01-e06 |	Anyone
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:27,584	| serial-s01-e06 |	Or even majority of people
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:31,936	| serial-s01-e06 |	Doing something like this
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:36,544	| serial-s01-e06 |	What did she ever do to me that will cause me to feel so angry
EDL	00:38:36,544	00:38:37,568	| serial-s01-e06 |	But but
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:45,760	| serial-s01-e06 |	I thought I didn't care about this
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:47,296	| serial-s01-e06 |	I probably do
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,576	| serial-s01-e06 |	How could you not
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:50,112	| serial-s01-e06 |	How could you not care about it
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:56,768	| serial-s01-e06 |	What people say
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:38:59,584	| serial-s01-e06 |	I shouldn't care
EDL	00:39:02,144	00:39:04,704	| serial-s01-e06 |	I see many problems with the state's case
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:08,800	| serial-s01-e06 |	But then I see many problems with a non Story 2
EDL	00:39:08,800	00:39:10,336	| serial-s01-e06 |	As I start to doubt him
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:15,200	| serial-s01-e06 |	Then I talked to him and talk to him and talk to him and I start to doubt my doubts
EDL	00:39:15,200	00:39:17,760	| serial-s01-e06 |	I'm sucker that I don't know
EDL	00:39:18,272	00:39:19,040	| serial-s01-e06 |	That's the cycle
EDL	00:39:20,320	00:39:24,672	| serial-s01-e06 |	Once about six months after we began our phone calls and not ask me a little nervously
EDL	00:39:25,184	00:39:27,744	| serial-s01-e06 |	What's your interest in this case really
EDL	00:39:27,744	00:39:28,768	| serial-s01-e06 |	Why are you doing this
EDL	00:39:29,536	00:39:34,400	| serial-s01-e06 |	Explain all the interesting stuff I read in the people I talked to blah blah blah
EDL	00:39:34,400	00:39:37,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	But I also told him that really what hooked me most is him
EDL	00:39:38,496	00:39:41,056	| serial-s01-e06 |	Just trying to figure out who is this person
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:44,896	| serial-s01-e06 |	Who says he didn't kill this girl but is serving a life sentence for killing this girl
EDL	00:39:45,408	00:39:48,736	| serial-s01-e06 |	I interested it honestly has been you like you're really
EDL	00:39:49,248	00:39:51,040	| serial-s01-e06 |	Nice
EDL	00:39:51,040	00:39:52,832	| serial-s01-e06 |	I like talking to you
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:57,696	| serial-s01-e06 |	Give me hope so then it's kind of like this questionable what does that mean you know
EDL	00:40:06,912	00:40:07,424	| serial-s01-e06 |	Oh
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:09,984	| serial-s01-e06 |	You don't even really know me though
EDL	00:40:12,544	00:40:15,360	| serial-s01-e06 |	Maybe meet you know I don't
EDL	00:40:15,872	00:40:17,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	When we talk on the phone I don't understand
EDL	00:40:20,992	00:40:23,552	| serial-s01-e06 |	Weird to hear you say that because
EDL	00:40:24,576	00:40:25,600	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't even really know you
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:29,952	| serial-s01-e06 |	Are you saying you don't think that I know you at all
EDL	00:40:32,000	00:40:36,352	| serial-s01-e06 |	I need for you to say that I'm a great person
EDL	00:40:37,888	00:40:40,960	| serial-s01-e06 |	I don't know
EDL	00:40:40,960	00:40:42,752	| serial-s01-e06 |	Investigating me back then
EDL	00:40:44,800	00:40:46,592	| serial-s01-e06 |	We had this conversation in July
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:49,664	| serial-s01-e06 |	At least 30 hours on the phone
EDL	00:40:50,176	00:40:53,504	| serial-s01-e06 |	More than I talk to a lot of people I think I know
EDL	00:40:53,504	00:40:54,784	| serial-s01-e06 |	Consider friends
EDL	00:40:55,296	00:40:56,576	| serial-s01-e06 |	I'm confused by this
EDL	00:40:57,344	00:41:00,160	| serial-s01-e06 |	This is the closest thing to hostile Adnan has ever gotten with me
EDL	00:41:00,672	00:41:02,720	| serial-s01-e06 |	The next day I came back to him about it
EDL	00:41:03,488	00:41:04,256	| serial-s01-e06 |	And so
EDL	00:41:04,768	00:41:09,120	| serial-s01-e06 |	I was a little bit like taking a bath and I still like I feel a little taken aback that like
EDL	00:41:09,888	00:41:11,936	| serial-s01-e06 |	What do you think I don't
EDL	00:41:11,936	00:41:12,448	| serial-s01-e06 |	No
EDL	00:41:13,984	00:41:14,752	| serial-s01-e06 |	About you
EDL	00:41:17,824	00:41:19,616	| serial-s01-e06 |	Myself
EDL	00:41:19,616	00:41:22,688	| serial-s01-e06 |	If I hear someone else I don't think you did it cuz you're a nice guy is not

EDL	00:41:24,736	00:41:27,808	| serial-s01-e06 |	Cuz you wouldn't know that but I've heard people say that to me over the years
EDL	00:41:29,600	00:41:34,464	| serial-s01-e06 |	I would love someone to hear I would love you so much but I don't think that you did it because I look at the case
EDL	00:41:34,464	00:41:38,048	| serial-s01-e06 |	It looks
EDL	00:41:38,560	00:41:39,584	| serial-s01-e06 |	You're selfish
EDL	00:41:40,352	00:41:44,448	| serial-s01-e06 |	You know you're a crazy sob
EDL	00:41:46,240	00:41:47,008	| serial-s01-e06 |	And it looks
EDL	00:41:47,520	00:41:49,056	| serial-s01-e06 |	She'll like a little off
EDL	00:41:49,056	00:41:50,080	| serial-s01-e06 |	Feel like something's not right
EDL	00:41:53,663	00:41:54,687	| serial-s01-e06 |	I understand this
EDL	00:41:55,199	00:41:58,015	| serial-s01-e06 |	The nice guy doesn't count as exculpatory evidence
EDL	00:41:58,783	00:42:02,623	| serial-s01-e06 |	But if I'm going to spend a year figuring out that he's a nice guy I might as well piss off
