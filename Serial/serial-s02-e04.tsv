EDL	00:01:22,432	00:01:23,200	| serial-s02-e04 |	And the rest of it
EDL	00:01:23,712	00:01:24,736	| serial-s02-e04 |	Four more years
EDL	00:01:25,504	00:01:27,296	| serial-s02-e04 |	What his purpose is less Sharp
EDL	00:01:27,296	00:01:28,576	| serial-s02-e04 |	Hope is blurrier
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:29,600	| serial-s02-e04 |	There's less action
EDL	00:01:30,112	00:01:31,648	| serial-s02-e04 |	Now he's got to endure
EDL	00:01:32,416	00:01:34,976	| serial-s02-e04 |	And that's in large part because after you're one
EDL	00:01:34,976	00:01:36,512	| serial-s02-e04 |	AfterBuzz 9 day Escape
EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:38,816	| serial-s02-e04 |	The Taliban put him in a cage
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:40,352	| serial-s02-e04 |	And
EDL	00:01:40,864	00:01:43,936	| serial-s02-e04 |	There is no way I'm getting out of that cage
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:47,776	| serial-s02-e04 |	This is a metal cage or wood cage or what
EDL	00:01:48,544	00:01:50,592	| serial-s02-e04 |	Can iron bar cage
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:52,640	| serial-s02-e04 |	Made for what purpose
EDL	00:01:53,920	00:01:54,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	For keeping me
EDL	00:01:56,736	00:01:58,272	| serial-s02-e04 |	Beau says it was six parts
EDL	00:01:58,272	00:02:02,112	| serial-s02-e04 |	Four sides with the top in the bottom made of quarter inch bars
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,392	| serial-s02-e04 |	Does collapsible
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:07,744	| serial-s02-e04 |	When they moved into new location they rebuild the cage and whatever room they put them in
EDL	00:02:07,744	00:02:09,280	| serial-s02-e04 |	Both in padlock it together
EDL	00:02:10,048	00:02:14,400	| serial-s02-e04 |	BOCES if he stretched out his arms he could touch opposite sides of the cage with his fingers
EDL	00:02:14,400	00:02:15,936	| serial-s02-e04 |	Figured it was about 6 feet wide
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:19,264	| serial-s02-e04 |	Explain stuff like this
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:20,032	| serial-s02-e04 |	I can picture it
EDL	00:02:20,544	00:02:23,104	| serial-s02-e04 |	I can understand what he's describing
EDL	00:02:23,104	00:02:24,896	| serial-s02-e04 |	But at some point I realized
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:27,712	| serial-s02-e04 |	I don't actually understand what is going on
EDL	00:02:28,224	00:02:34,368	| serial-s02-e04 |	Looks like the whole thing with overlay with a scram where exactly is he who exactly is holding him
EDL	00:02:35,136	00:02:38,720	| serial-s02-e04 |	I couldn't tell what the Taliban in the colonies wanted or expected
EDL	00:02:38,720	00:02:40,000	| serial-s02-e04 |	Why is he being moved
EDL	00:02:40,000	00:02:41,280	| serial-s02-e04 |	Why is he being ignored
EDL	00:02:41,280	00:02:45,888	| serial-s02-e04 |	I didn't tell his treatment was senseless and haphazard or if it was part of a plan
EDL	00:02:47,168	00:02:49,728	| serial-s02-e04 |	Most descriptions are vivid that's not the problem
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:52,544	| serial-s02-e04 |	The problem is they're mainly from inside a room
EDL	00:02:53,056	00:02:55,360	| serial-s02-e04 |	Oh couldn't see what was happening outside
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:58,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	So I could make order of it because Bo himself couldn't make order
EDL	00:03:02,272	00:03:07,136	| serial-s02-e04 |	There's another guy who has a very good idea of bows place in haqqani World Order
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:08,672	| serial-s02-e04 |	His name is David Road
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:14,816	| serial-s02-e04 |	Davidson investigative reporter for Reuters now but back in 2008 he was on leave from the New York Times
EDL	00:03:14,816	00:03:16,608	| serial-s02-e04 |	Researching a book about Afghanistan
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:21,728	| serial-s02-e04 |	Arrange to interview a Taliban Commander about an hour's Drive south of Kabul
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:29,408	| serial-s02-e04 |	And headed over to the same people and pretty much the same place at close to the same time as bow
EDL	00:03:30,432	00:03:34,528	| serial-s02-e04 |	Once I heard David story so much of bows story clicked into place for me
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:37,600	| serial-s02-e04 |	ProLogistix locations
EDL	00:03:41,184	00:03:45,024	| serial-s02-e04 |	Many aspects of David's experience are really different from Bose
EDL	00:03:45,024	00:03:47,072	| serial-s02-e04 |	David the civilian first officer journalist
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:50,400	| serial-s02-e04 |	Two already knew a lot about Afghanistan and Pakistan
EDL	00:03:50,912	00:03:54,240	| serial-s02-e04 |	He got free after about seven months versus nearly five years
EDL	00:03:54,752	00:03:56,032	| serial-s02-e04 |	And a huge difference
EDL	00:03:56,032	00:03:57,312	| serial-s02-e04 |	David wasn't alone
EDL	00:03:57,312	00:03:58,848	| serial-s02-e04 |	He was taken with two Afghan
EDL	00:03:58,848	00:04:01,408	| serial-s02-e04 |	Asada driver anti-hero translator
EDL	00:04:02,176	00:04:04,736	| serial-s02-e04 |	So he had someone to interpret whatever he didn't understand
EDL	00:04:05,504	00:04:09,856	| serial-s02-e04 |	Also David wasn't blindfolded all the time really only when he was being moved to a different location
EDL	00:04:10,368	00:04:11,904	| serial-s02-e04 |	He wasn't chained or tied up
EDL	00:04:12,416	00:04:14,976	| serial-s02-e04 |	Inside the compound he could walk around in the courtyard
EDL	00:04:14,976	00:04:16,512	| serial-s02-e04 |	He could have conversations with his guards
EDL	00:04:17,280	00:04:21,375	| serial-s02-e04 |	And I'm not bringing all that up to suggest some sort of grim hostage contest
EDL	00:04:21,375	00:04:24,191	| serial-s02-e04 |	Only to point out that while David was imprisoned
EDL	00:04:24,191	00:04:27,519	| serial-s02-e04 |	She wasn't in the dark he wasn't in solitary confinement like Bo
EDL	00:04:28,031	00:04:29,823	| serial-s02-e04 |	So he had an awareness bow didn't have
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,127	| serial-s02-e04 |	About the system he had entered into
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:38,527	| serial-s02-e04 |	After they were carjacked to David and Assad anti-hair were taken around Afghanistan for a few days
EDL	00:04:38,527	00:04:41,599	| serial-s02-e04 |	And then they were told to get out of the car and start walking
EDL	00:04:41,599	00:04:42,367	| serial-s02-e04 |	Over the mountain
EDL	00:04:43,391	00:04:45,439	| serial-s02-e04 |	The next morning is clear to David where he is
EDL	00:04:45,951	00:04:49,279	| serial-s02-e04 |	For one thing the car that Picks Them Up is driving on the left hand side of the road
EDL	00:04:49,791	00:04:50,815	| serial-s02-e04 |	Like they do in package
EDL	00:04:51,583	00:04:55,423	| serial-s02-e04 |	And soon after that I saw a road sign in Urdu the national language
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| serial-s02-e04 |	Pakistan and I
EDL	00:04:57,727	00:04:58,751	| serial-s02-e04 |	New weed walk
EDL	00:04:59,263	00:05:01,055	| serial-s02-e04 |	Into the tribal areas over the mountains
EDL	00:05:01,567	00:05:02,847	| serial-s02-e04 |	And I knew we were
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:03,615	| serial-s02-e04 |	Doomed
EDL	00:05:03,615	00:05:04,127	| serial-s02-e04 |	And that's
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:07,711	| serial-s02-e04 |	The worst place you can be taken in the Afghanistan
EDL	00:05:07,711	00:05:08,223	| serial-s02-e04 |	Pakistan region
EDL	00:05:08,735	00:05:12,831	| serial-s02-e04 |	David knew how utterly dangerous the tribal areas in Western Pakistan were
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,903	| serial-s02-e04 |	This place it's really just over the mountain
EDL	00:05:15,903	00:05:16,671	| serial-s02-e04 |	It's right near the border
EDL	00:05:17,183	00:05:18,975	| serial-s02-e04 |	And if you're imagining a wild
EDL	00:05:18,975	00:05:20,767	| serial-s02-e04 |	Desolate inaccessible Terrain
EDL	00:05:21,279	00:05:22,047	| serial-s02-e04 |	It's not like that
EDL	00:05:22,559	00:05:26,655	| serial-s02-e04 |	David said compare to rural Afghanistan in Fat City like miramshah
EDL	00:05:26,655	00:05:29,471	| serial-s02-e04 |	The capital of north waziristan where the haqqanis are based
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:33,055	| serial-s02-e04 |	The time in or near miramshah
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:37,151	| serial-s02-e04 |	There are more paved roads more large buildings more schools
EDL	00:05:38,943	00:05:39,455	| serial-s02-e04 |	There is
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,991	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know a market
EDL	00:05:40,991	00:05:42,783	| serial-s02-e04 |	With people selling
EDL	00:05:42,783	00:05:45,599	| serial-s02-e04 |	Goods from Pakistan proper I mean my
EDL	00:05:46,111	00:05:47,903	| serial-s02-e04 |	Kidnappers you know brought me
EDL	00:05:47,903	00:05:49,183	| serial-s02-e04 |	Bottled
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:51,487	| serial-s02-e04 |	Nestle water that was manufactured
EDL	00:05:51,999	00:05:55,583	| serial-s02-e04 |	From a plant in a Inn in Lahore Pakistan one of the main
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:59,423	| serial-s02-e04 |	Cities you know but they were able to buy it in the market
EDL	00:05:59,423	00:06:01,215	| serial-s02-e04 |	In The Travelers I bought me
EDL	00:06:01,215	00:06:01,983	| serial-s02-e04 |	Copies of
EDL	00:06:02,495	00:06:06,335	| serial-s02-e04 |	This the most well-known English language newspaper in Pakistan Dawn
EDL	00:06:06,847	00:06:07,871	| serial-s02-e04 |	Another one's called the news
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:11,711	| serial-s02-e04 |	And they would be 2 or 3 days old but they could buy all these things
EDL	00:06:12,223	00:06:13,503	| serial-s02-e04 |	I'm in the market
EDL	00:06:13,503	00:06:15,039	| serial-s02-e04 |	In the middle of the tribal areas
EDL	00:06:15,551	00:06:16,575	| serial-s02-e04 |	There's kids
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:17,087	| serial-s02-e04 |	Stairs
EDL	00:06:18,367	00:06:19,135	| serial-s02-e04 |	Farmers
EDL	00:06:19,135	00:06:21,183	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know what donkeys in there
EDL	00:06:21,183	00:06:22,207	| serial-s02-e04 |	Bring in
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:22,975	| serial-s02-e04 |	Their crops
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:23,743	| serial-s02-e04 |	The cell
EDL	00:06:23,743	00:06:24,767	| serial-s02-e04 |	There's tons of
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,583	| serial-s02-e04 |	Toyota station wagon
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:33,727	| serial-s02-e04 |	People driving their own also service taxes and you know became clear in those first few hours and then days and weeks that this was a
EDL	00:06:34,495	00:06:36,031	| serial-s02-e04 |	Taliban mini state that
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:36,799	| serial-s02-e04 |	Auction
EDL	00:06:36,799	00:06:38,079	| serial-s02-e04 |	Open legged
EDL	00:06:38,079	00:06:40,895	| serial-s02-e04 |	Hino repaired roads and ran schools and
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,431	| serial-s02-e04 |	Had some sort of basic
EDL	00:06:42,431	00:06:44,479	| serial-s02-e04 |	Form of healthcare it wasn't
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:49,343	| serial-s02-e04 |	Is completely backward an area as a as you know is usually described
EDL	00:06:49,855	00:06:54,719	| serial-s02-e04 |	And it's not like the Taliban are sort of skulking around dodging any Pakistani military press
EDL	00:06:54,719	00:07:01,119	| serial-s02-e04 |	David says they're fully aware of each other may be wary at times but also like waiting to each other
EDL	00:07:01,119	00:07:07,519	| serial-s02-e04 |	As I drove around the tribal areas was there a Stan North and South David said there be regular checkpoint
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:12,127	| serial-s02-e04 |	Solana road that would normally be mad by a Pakistani security or Army
EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:18,015	| serial-s02-e04 |	And instead there be young Taliban fighters with kalashnikovs letting traffic through not letting traffic through
EDL	00:07:18,015	00:07:20,575	| serial-s02-e04 |	Driver of David's car had to have the right password to get by
EDL	00:07:21,855	00:07:27,487	| serial-s02-e04 |	One one time I was being driven in a car and we ran into a pack of signing Army resupply Convoy
EDL	00:07:27,487	00:07:31,583	| serial-s02-e04 |	And I thought this is this great opportunity maybe you know the Convoy will
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,655	| serial-s02-e04 |	Let us all get out of the car and we can make a run for it
EDL	00:07:35,167	00:07:37,727	| serial-s02-e04 |	And instead you know

EDL	00:07:43,615	00:07:45,919	| serial-s02-e04 |	The civilians had to get out of the car

EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,551	| serial-s02-e04 |	In the Pakistani soldiers did seem to be really afraid
EDL	00:07:52,063	00:07:54,879	| serial-s02-e04 |	That there would be a car bomb or some sort of attack
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:55,647	| serial-s02-e04 |	From one of these

EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,767	| serial-s02-e04 |	But you know they just drove by us
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:03,071	| serial-s02-e04 |	They never forces get out of our car
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:03,839	| serial-s02-e04 |	And then
EDL	00:08:03,839	00:08:04,607	| serial-s02-e04 |	The

EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,335	| serial-s02-e04 |	Tencent agreement with the Pakistani army
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:19,711	| serial-s02-e04 |	That the economy Vehicles just had to pull over to the side of the road that no one had to get out of the economy car
EDL	00:08:20,991	00:08:23,551	| serial-s02-e04 |	And in return the pakistanis would not inspect
EDL	00:08:23,551	00:08:28,671	| serial-s02-e04 |	The car and that if they know which one how do they know which is a haqqani car and which is it
EDL	00:08:29,439	00:08:31,231	| serial-s02-e04 |	No idea I just remember
EDL	00:08:31,231	00:08:35,071	| serial-s02-e04 |	When I watching battery and haqqani the number to come out of that kind at work
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:37,119	| serial-s02-e04 |	Smiling and waving
EDL	00:08:37,119	00:08:39,935	| serial-s02-e04 |	Two Pakistani soldiers as they drove by in their trucks
EDL	00:08:41,727	00:08:43,263	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know in my heart sinking
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:45,311	| serial-s02-e04 |	When I thought maybe they were going to rush
EDL	00:08:46,079	00:08:49,151	| serial-s02-e04 |	Oh my God so they're just it's just like
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:53,247	| serial-s02-e04 |	The word just like impunity is just jumping into my head like just
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,783	| serial-s02-e04 |	It's a it's a truce
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,295	| serial-s02-e04 |	So it's

EDL	00:09:02,207	00:09:04,511	| serial-s02-e04 |	The easiest way to explain fascism
EDL	00:09:10,399	00:09:13,215	| serial-s02-e04 |	Seems like anyone I asked to explain what gives
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:15,775	| serial-s02-e04 |	Annie's operating so freely in Pakistan
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,079	| serial-s02-e04 |	I have to take a deep breath first
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:20,895	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because it is fraud it is complicated
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:26,271	| serial-s02-e04 |	And to do it justice it would take a long time so I'm just going to give you the basics of what I've learned
EDL	00:09:26,271	00:09:30,111	| serial-s02-e04 |	Here goes the haqqanis are a family-run operation
EDL	00:09:30,111	00:09:32,927	| serial-s02-e04 |	And they're not one thing there Islamic nationalist
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:34,207	| serial-s02-e04 |	There a militant group
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:35,231	| serial-s02-e04 |	And they have businesses
EDL	00:09:35,231	00:09:40,095	| serial-s02-e04 |	New York Times story compare them to quote The Sopranos of the Afghanistan war unquote
EDL	00:09:41,119	00:09:43,935	| serial-s02-e04 |	They've got their own alliances their own source of funds
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:45,983	| serial-s02-e04 |	But they're also part of the Taliban
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:48,799	| serial-s02-e04 |	They use the same stationary I'm not kidding about that
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:54,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	One expert told me their statements come out under the Seal of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan same as the Afghan Taliban
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:10:00,063	| serial-s02-e04 |	Counties are the most militarily effective part of the Taliban
EDL	00:10:00,063	00:10:04,159	| serial-s02-e04 |	And they're the part of the Taliban that's most under control of Pakistan
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,207	| serial-s02-e04 |	One expert told me quotes
EDL	00:10:06,207	00:10:08,255	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know they're just very very close to
EDL	00:10:08,255	00:10:09,023	| serial-s02-e04 |	The Pakistani

EDL	00:10:19,007	00:10:25,407	| serial-s02-e04 |	Back in the 1970s they were fighting the Afghan government and then later switch to fighting the Soviets when they invaded after

EDL	00:10:26,431	00:10:32,831	| serial-s02-e04 |	And by the way we do us like to that they were fighting the Communists from the early 80s we gave them millions of dollars to help them
EDL	00:10:32,831	00:10:35,135	| serial-s02-e04 |	I'm trained fighters in North waziristan
EDL	00:10:35,135	00:10:36,415	| serial-s02-e04 |	We helped build them up
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:38,975	| serial-s02-e04 |	As for Pakistan
EDL	00:10:38,975	00:10:42,047	| serial-s02-e04 |	They tolerate all this because the haqqanis are useful in them
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:48,191	| serial-s02-e04 |	They're useful proxies in Pakistan's decades-long effort to influence events inside Afghanistan
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:50,751	| serial-s02-e04 |	To keep Afghanistan a manageable neighbor
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:52,799	| serial-s02-e04 |	And
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,079	| serial-s02-e04 |	Stay With Me
EDL	00:10:54,079	00:10:58,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	They're useful because they help prevent Pakistan's other neighbor India
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:02,271	| serial-s02-e04 |	I'm establishing any serious foothold or influence in Afghanistan
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,087	| serial-s02-e04 |	Pakistan has always seen India as its biggest threat
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:06,879	| serial-s02-e04 |	Here's David's
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:08,671	| serial-s02-e04 |	Valiant 30 second explanation
EDL	00:11:09,439	00:11:12,255	| serial-s02-e04 |	The Pakistani military their goal is to
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,279	| serial-s02-e04 |	Stop India
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:16,095	| serial-s02-e04 |	Everywhere they can in South Asia
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| serial-s02-e04 |	So the
EDL	00:11:17,631	00:11:18,911	| serial-s02-e04 |	Pakistani government
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:21,471	| serial-s02-e04 |	Allow the haqqanis and the Taliban to operate
EDL	00:11:21,471	00:11:24,031	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because they saw them as allies they saw
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:27,615	| serial-s02-e04 |	Connie's is a force that can allow Pakistan to remain
EDL	00:11:27,615	00:11:29,407	| serial-s02-e04 |	In de facto control
EDL	00:11:29,407	00:11:30,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	Of Afghanistan
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:32,735	| serial-s02-e04 |	And stop India from taking over f
EDL	00:11:34,527	00:11:35,807	| serial-s02-e04 |	97 and life
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,831	| serial-s02-e04 |	Three sentences
EDL	00:11:36,831	00:11:37,855	| serial-s02-e04 |	10
EDL	00:11:37,855	00:11:39,903	| serial-s02-e04 |	And I like your 10 what are good
EDL	00:11:40,671	00:11:41,439	| serial-s02-e04 |	And
EDL	00:11:41,439	00:11:42,975	| serial-s02-e04 |	And this is also important
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:47,327	| serial-s02-e04 |	Connie's help Pakistan deal with the other Taliban in their country
EDL	00:11:47,327	00:11:48,095	| serial-s02-e04 |	The Pakistani Taliban
EDL	00:11:48,863	00:11:52,959	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because the haqqanis have good relations with the Pakistani Taliban
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:56,031	| serial-s02-e04 |	But the Pakistani Taliban does not have good relations
EDL	00:11:56,031	00:11:57,055	| serial-s02-e04 |	The Pakistani government
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:11:59,103	| serial-s02-e04 |	So
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:03,711	| serial-s02-e04 |	That was the situation back in 2009 when Beau and David were held by the haqqani
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:09,343	| serial-s02-e04 |	In the past couple years though Pakistan strategy toward the Taliban has changed somewhat
EDL	00:12:09,343	00:12:10,879	| serial-s02-e04 |	They're bombing waziristan
EDL	00:12:10,879	00:12:11,903	| serial-s02-e04 |	Probably right now
EDL	00:12:12,415	00:12:16,767	| serial-s02-e04 |	If you've been reading the paper maybe you're caught up on all this if not I have some phone numbers for experts
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:24,191	| serial-s02-e04 |	David describes the haqqanis as an incredibly disciplined organized crime Network
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:29,311	| serial-s02-e04 |	They were super careful not to use cell phones or Communications devices that could be tracked
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:32,639	| serial-s02-e04 |	Jordan haqqani one of the top Commanders
EDL	00:12:32,639	00:12:37,247	| serial-s02-e04 |	What sometimes show up at a house where David was being held and he be completely alone
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:41,599	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because he figured the drones overhead would be looking for a commander moving around with bodyguards
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:46,207	| serial-s02-e04 |	David and Assad and Tasha are removed all the time
EDL	00:12:46,719	00:12:50,815	| serial-s02-e04 |	As far as David can tell the house to house system work sort of like a franchise
EDL	00:12:51,327	00:12:55,935	| serial-s02-e04 |	Each family that took them would get some share in the prisoners either some money
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:13:01,055	| serial-s02-e04 |	Or maybe they had family members who were prisoners whom they wanted released as part of a deal to exchange David
EDL	00:13:01,567	00:13:03,103	| serial-s02-e04 |	Where in houses from
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:04,639	| serial-s02-e04 |	Tudi
EDL	00:13:04,639	00:13:06,175	| serial-s02-e04 |	Four to five weeks at a time
EDL	00:13:07,711	00:13:12,319	| serial-s02-e04 |	And is that is there a logic to the moving that you can discern
EDL	00:13:13,343	00:13:19,487	| serial-s02-e04 |	Is it just like we will you can't you just can't stay in one place for too long cuz going to be found out or is it like I think
EDL	00:13:19,487	00:13:25,887	| serial-s02-e04 |	I think that I mean in again I have a huge Advantage because I have these two Afghans I've been kidnapped with me and their hearing all kinds of time
EDL	00:13:25,887	00:13:27,167	| serial-s02-e04 |	Relations there talking to
EDL	00:13:27,679	00:13:28,959	| serial-s02-e04 |	The boys who
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,983	| serial-s02-e04 |	Bring in bread
EDL	00:13:31,263	00:13:32,031	| serial-s02-e04 |	And so
EDL	00:13:32,031	00:13:33,823	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know I was told now and then
EDL	00:13:33,823	00:13:36,127	| serial-s02-e04 |	Families you know would get tired of holding us
EDL	00:13:36,639	00:13:38,175	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because it was very dangerous
EDL	00:13:38,175	00:13:38,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	For them
EDL	00:13:38,943	00:13:42,015	| serial-s02-e04 |	There everyone was very afraid to be a drone strike to kill me
EDL	00:13:42,015	00:13:44,063	| serial-s02-e04 |	And all their family would be killed
EDL	00:13:44,063	00:13:48,671	| serial-s02-e04 |	When they held me a densely populated neighborhoods it was cuz the nearby children they hoped
EDL	00:13:49,183	00:13:53,023	| serial-s02-e04 |	Would prevent you know the US from carrying out a drone strike to kill me because it would
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:55,071	| serial-s02-e04 |	Kill so many civilians at the same time
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:57,375	| serial-s02-e04 |	Are those like
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:01,727	| serial-s02-e04 |	Connie family members are they like who are those
EDL	00:14:01,727	00:14:06,591	| serial-s02-e04 |	People who are keeping you or do they just like Bustin at anyone's house and be like we're going to hang out here
EDL	00:14:06,591	00:14:07,103	| serial-s02-e04 |	Here for a while
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,407	| serial-s02-e04 |	And gear
EDL	00:14:10,431	00:14:13,247	| serial-s02-e04 |	I think they only kept us in a homes of Commanders
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:15,295	| serial-s02-e04 |	And family that they felt they could trust
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:16,319	| serial-s02-e04 |	Most
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,879	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because they were constantly
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| serial-s02-e04 |	Terrified
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:20,671	| serial-s02-e04 |	House pies
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:23,231	| serial-s02-e04 |	They were rounding up
EDL	00:14:23,231	00:14:25,535	| serial-s02-e04 |	Local people and accusing them of guiding drone strikes
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:29,631	| serial-s02-e04 |	The young guards
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:33,215	| serial-s02-e04 |	Protective when we were staying in the intelligence commanders house would come
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,799	| serial-s02-e04 |	Home everyday with the cell phones and possessions of
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:39,871	| serial-s02-e04 |	Then they had executed that day
EDL	00:14:39,871	00:14:42,175	| serial-s02-e04 |	Cumbia guys pies and guiding
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:43,455	| serial-s02-e04 |	Drone strikes
EDL	00:14:43,967	00:14:46,527	| serial-s02-e04 |	And is that like did you
EDL	00:14:46,527	00:14:47,807	| serial-s02-e04 |	Know that ad
EDL	00:14:47,807	00:14:50,111	| serial-s02-e04 |	The timer is that something you understood only later
EDL	00:14:50,879	00:14:52,159	| serial-s02-e04 |	Tell me I mean
EDL	00:14:52,671	00:14:54,463	| serial-s02-e04 |	Again I was learning all this stuff through
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:54,975	| serial-s02-e04 |	Retire
EDL	00:14:58,559	00:15:02,655	| serial-s02-e04 |	What are the last houses David was held in Seguin
EDL	00:15:02,655	00:15:04,703	| serial-s02-e04 |	The guy who later take charge of Bose custody
EDL	00:15:05,471	00:15:09,055	| serial-s02-e04 |	They only had one conversation but David said Sunday and made an impression
EDL	00:15:09,567	00:15:11,871	| serial-s02-e04 |	He seemed more radical than my guards
EDL	00:15:12,639	00:15:13,151	| serial-s02-e04 |	He was
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:15,455	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know
EDL	00:15:15,455	00:15:16,223	| serial-s02-e04 |	Deeply
EDL	00:15:16,735	00:15:19,295	| serial-s02-e04 |	Incredibly so angrily anti-American
EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:26,719	| serial-s02-e04 |	And I can check I think that there was a joke one of his men made about
EDL	00:15:27,743	00:15:28,767	| serial-s02-e04 |	Killing me here
EDL	00:15:28,767	00:15:30,559	| serial-s02-e04 |	Xiaomi my head off or something like that it was
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,119	| serial-s02-e04 |	It was much more aggressive than other
EDL	00:15:33,119	00:15:33,887	| serial-s02-e04 |	Commanders
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:34,911	| serial-s02-e04 |	I really
EDL	00:15:35,935	00:15:42,335	| serial-s02-e04 |	The execution videos the sickness the constant toying with you about whether they're going to let you go
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:43,871	| serial-s02-e04 |	Kill you
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:46,431	| serial-s02-e04 |	And the cultural Chasm between us and Them
EDL	00:15:46,943	00:15:51,039	| serial-s02-e04 |	David talks about all that Echoes so squarely with with BOCES
EDL	00:15:52,063	00:15:58,207	| serial-s02-e04 |	Has the my captivity went on they were more more Angry me because they weren't getting the money or prisoners are Fame they want
EDL	00:15:58,975	00:16:02,559	| serial-s02-e04 |	And they sort of became more and more disgusted with me that I was sort of
EDL	00:16:03,071	00:16:09,471	| serial-s02-e04 |	Dirty because I was a non-believer because I wasn't Muslim I was in pure and the reason I was
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:15,359	| serial-s02-e04 |	Having stomach problems and diarrhea was because you know I wasn't a Muslim it wasn't because of the
EDL	00:16:15,359	00:16:17,407	| serial-s02-e04 |	Conditions we were being held in
EDL	00:16:17,407	00:16:18,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	Eventually they should have
EDL	00:16:18,943	00:16:19,711	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know
EDL	00:16:19,711	00:16:22,783	| serial-s02-e04 |	Ordered me to stop washing dishes that was one of the things I did to
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:24,831	| serial-s02-e04 |	Filippi's them
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,879	| serial-s02-e04 |	Stay alive and then they
EDL	00:16:26,879	00:16:27,903	| serial-s02-e04 |	Stop wanting to eat
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:28,415	| serial-s02-e04 |	Near me
EDL	00:16:28,927	00:16:29,951	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because I was
EDL	00:16:29,951	00:16:30,719	| serial-s02-e04 |	Assertive dirty
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,255	| serial-s02-e04 |	Animal
EDL	00:16:32,255	00:16:36,351	| serial-s02-e04 |	In their minds and in one of the more amazing moments there was an older
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:37,631	| serial-s02-e04 |	Man
EDL	00:16:38,399	00:16:39,423	| serial-s02-e04 |	He
EDL	00:16:39,423	00:16:42,239	| serial-s02-e04 |	He came in and he started lecture the younger guards that they shouldn't
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:44,031	| serial-s02-e04 |	See me as dirty
EDL	00:16:44,543	00:16:45,823	| serial-s02-e04 |	Oh really
EDL	00:16:45,823	00:16:46,847	| serial-s02-e04 |	And he said
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:49,151	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know David is God's creation
EDL	00:16:49,919	00:16:51,199	| serial-s02-e04 |	Any took this
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,479	| serial-s02-e04 |	He said he would
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:53,247	| serial-s02-e04 |	Take this
EDL	00:16:53,247	00:16:54,527	| serial-s02-e04 |	Piece of ready withholding in
EDL	00:16:55,039	00:16:56,063	| serial-s02-e04 |	I could eat it
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:17:00,159	| serial-s02-e04 |	David can eat this piece of bread in and take it out of his mouth without swallowing it
EDL	00:17:00,159	00:17:03,487	| serial-s02-e04 |	And the man said he would take that piece of bread and then place it in his own mouth
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,023	| serial-s02-e04 |	Cuz that's what
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,815	| serial-s02-e04 |	The prophet talk
EDL	00:17:06,815	00:17:08,095	| serial-s02-e04 |	Then you should treat all humans
EDL	00:17:08,607	00:17:09,375	| serial-s02-e04 |	Humanely
EDL	00:17:11,679	00:17:15,263	| serial-s02-e04 |	Kind of so interesting why do you think he cared how they thought of you
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,359	| serial-s02-e04 |	Well I think that that mean this is the moment there's a civil war
EDL	00:17:19,359	00:17:22,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	Any Islamic world for the interpretation of this face and I
EDL	00:17:22,943	00:17:24,735	| serial-s02-e04 |	Saw a examples of
EDL	00:17:24,735	00:17:29,087	| serial-s02-e04 |	Islam the modern Islam I saw I practiced in in Bosnia
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:31,135	| serial-s02-e04 |	Pakistan and Afghanistan and Iraq
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:35,487	| serial-s02-e04 |	So you there was this one older man who said that to them
EDL	00:17:35,487	00:17:38,047	| serial-s02-e04 |	But he was surrounded by these young diluted
EDL	00:17:38,559	00:17:40,351	| serial-s02-e04 |	Man whose whole identity
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:45,471	| serial-s02-e04 |	Was you know that there was only this strict interpretation of Islam than anyone
EDL	00:17:45,471	00:17:46,495	| serial-s02-e04 |	Who didn't
EDL	00:17:46,495	00:17:49,823	| serial-s02-e04 |	Follow their interpretation of Islam deserve to die
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:52,127	| serial-s02-e04 |	Anyone who live they literally told me
EDL	00:17:52,127	00:17:53,663	| serial-s02-e04 |	But anyone who lived under the
EDL	00:17:54,175	00:17:58,527	| serial-s02-e04 |	Karzai government in Afghanistan or the Musharraf government in Pakistan
EDL	00:17:58,527	00:18:00,575	| serial-s02-e04 |	Where are non-believers and deserved
EDL	00:18:00,575	00:18:01,087	| serial-s02-e04 |	To die
EDL	00:18:01,599	00:18:02,367	| serial-s02-e04 |	Michaels
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:03,903	| serial-s02-e04 |	Those are infidels as well
EDL	00:18:04,415	00:18:08,767	| serial-s02-e04 |	Everyone's and they were worse they hated the maiamai to Afghan College more than I hated me
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,303	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because they were
EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| serial-s02-e04 |	They were
EDL	00:18:12,095	00:18:15,935	| serial-s02-e04 |	Munafiqeen I can't remember all these words anymore but they were traitors
EDL	00:18:16,703	00:18:17,983	| serial-s02-e04 |	Did you ever have like
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:21,055	| serial-s02-e04 |	Substantive conversations with
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:26,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	Anyone who was holding you about the first the first three days it was all about
EDL	00:18:27,455	00:18:28,991	| serial-s02-e04 |	The Warren lady magazine
EDL	00:18:28,991	00:18:31,039	| serial-s02-e04 |	Did, 911 in my book and
EDL	00:18:32,063	00:18:35,135	| serial-s02-e04 |	And I told him about the reporting it down in Bosnia exposing the
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:37,439	| serial-s02-e04 |	Mass executions of thousands of Muslims in
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:44,863	| serial-s02-e04 |	I remember after I told him about my reporting in Bosnia they said
EDL	00:18:45,375	00:18:46,399	| serial-s02-e04 |	That's good
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,679	| serial-s02-e04 |	That means you're worth more money
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:49,471	| serial-s02-e04 |	Oh man
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:53,311	| serial-s02-e04 |	Can I see the point of my story you missed it
EDL	00:18:53,311	00:18:55,359	| serial-s02-e04 |	But there was now I mean it was
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:58,175	| serial-s02-e04 |	You know there was no kind of rational
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,967	| serial-s02-e04 |	Conversation
EDL	00:19:10,463	00:19:13,279	| serial-s02-e04 |	Oh and David did not overlap and haqqani custody
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:19,679	| serial-s02-e04 |	David escaped one night along with tie hair from the compound where they were being held and they made their way over to a Pakistani
EDL	00:19:19,679	00:19:22,239	| serial-s02-e04 |	Military base about a half-mile away and they were rescued
EDL	00:19:23,519	00:19:26,847	| serial-s02-e04 |	David and Tahir got out on June 20th 2009
EDL	00:19:26,847	00:19:29,151	| serial-s02-e04 |	I was captured just ten days later
EDL	00:19:30,175	00:19:33,247	| serial-s02-e04 |	David's never met never talk to Bo
EDL	00:19:33,247	00:19:34,783	| serial-s02-e04 |	But he says he feels linked to him
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:37,087	| serial-s02-e04 |	In our interview he kept coming back
EDL	00:19:37,087	00:19:39,647	| serial-s02-e04 |	Guiltily tell how much better he had it then bow
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:43,231	| serial-s02-e04 |	Obviously he knows it's not his fault what happened to Bo
EDL	00:19:43,231	00:19:44,255	| serial-s02-e04 |	Play Feels Bad
EDL	00:19:44,767	00:19:48,351	| serial-s02-e04 |	He said as soon as he heard a US Soldier have been grabbed by the same people
EDL	00:19:48,351	00:19:50,399	| serial-s02-e04 |	He worried that he'd be treated harshly
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:52,703	| serial-s02-e04 |	In part because David was treated well
EDL	00:19:52,703	00:19:53,727	| serial-s02-e04 |	Which helped him get away
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:59,871	| serial-s02-e04 |	Sami Yusuf sari Afghan reporter told me he did hear that after David escaped
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:04,223	| serial-s02-e04 |	There were all kinds of rumors and accusations flying around that someone had been paid off
EDL	00:20:04,735	00:20:09,599	| serial-s02-e04 |	Infighting between economies and other Taliban without Connie's can be trusted
EDL	00:20:09,599	00:20:11,647	| serial-s02-e04 |	What news reports at the Makati suspected
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:13,183	| serial-s02-e04 |	Taliban guards have taken a bribe
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:15,231	| serial-s02-e04 |	Maybe there was a traitor among them
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:16,511	| serial-s02-e04 |	So yeah
EDL	00:20:16,511	00:20:19,071	| serial-s02-e04 |	It does seem they weren't planning on letting it happen
EDL	00:20:20,863	00:20:27,263	| serial-s02-e04 |	Then again maybe bows rough treatment had more to do with the fact that he had tried to escape from them right away that first week
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:31,615	| serial-s02-e04 |	The haqqanis are Savvy enough to know the difference
EDL	00:20:31,615	00:20:32,895	| serial-s02-e04 |	In terms of risk
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:34,943	| serial-s02-e04 |	In terms of danger in terms of value
EDL	00:20:35,455	00:20:37,247	| serial-s02-e04 |	Between an American journalist
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:38,527	| serial-s02-e04 |	An American Soldier
EDL	00:20:40,831	00:20:41,855	| serial-s02-e04 |	In the beginning
EDL	00:20:41,855	00:20:46,975	| serial-s02-e04 |	It seems that perhaps undine in the haqqanis were looking for a quick and easy deal to get rid of bow
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:52,607	| serial-s02-e04 |	Sami Yusuf side in an interview for us in Dubai with a high-level Taliban guy there
EDL	00:20:52,607	00:20:56,191	| serial-s02-e04 |	This guy wasn't directly involved with the negotiations for bow
EDL	00:20:56,191	00:20:58,495	| serial-s02-e04 |	But he heard about it from the people who were involved
EDL	00:20:59,263	00:21:02,335	| serial-s02-e04 |	What does Taliban told Sammy is that initially
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:03,103	| serial-s02-e04 |	They wanted
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:04,383	| serial-s02-e04 |	Ransom Maybe
EDL	00:21:04,383	00:21:06,175	| serial-s02-e04 |	Prisoners from an Afghan jail
EDL	00:21:06,175	00:21:08,735	| serial-s02-e04 |	Which is what they'd also been asking for an David Rhodes case
EDL	00:21:09,247	00:21:12,575	| serial-s02-e04 |	But then somehow the Taliban gets word from The Americans
EDL	00:21:12,575	00:21:15,391	| serial-s02-e04 |	And it's not clear how or from whom exactly
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:16,416	| serial-s02-e04 |	But the story is
EDL	00:21:16,416	00:21:19,488	| serial-s02-e04 |	They get word that the Americans aren't going to pay Ransom
EDL	00:21:19,488	00:21:20,512	| serial-s02-e04 |	Just True by the way
EDL	00:21:20,512	00:21:23,840	| serial-s02-e04 |	And furthermore that they're not going to free any prisoners
EDL	00:21:23,840	00:21:25,888	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because they're not too concerned with getting blowback
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:30,496	| serial-s02-e04 |	Tri-State can tolerate the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Afghanistan
EDL	00:21:30,496	00:21:34,080	| serial-s02-e04 |	One soldier in captivity isn't that big a deal for the US Army
EDL	00:21:35,104	00:21:37,152	| serial-s02-e04 |	And this message if it really came
EDL	00:21:37,664	00:21:39,712	| serial-s02-e04 |	But apparently Sunday and got upset
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:43,552	| serial-s02-e04 |	And his position was what and why are we wasting our time and our resources
EDL	00:21:44,064	00:21:44,832	| serial-s02-e04 |	Let's just kill him
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:48,416	| serial-s02-e04 |	And that's when the sky told Tammy
EDL	00:21:48,416	00:21:49,440	| serial-s02-e04 |	That someone
EDL	00:21:49,440	00:21:52,000	| serial-s02-e04 |	A well-connected person in Pakistan
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:53,280	| serial-s02-e04 |	Totes on game
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:54,048	| serial-s02-e04 |	Don't kill him
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:58,656	| serial-s02-e04 |	Add that said don't worry keep the guy this is a wolf DDS
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:22:01,472	| serial-s02-e04 |	Don't get upset don't lose your patience today
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:04,032	| serial-s02-e04 |	This is
EDL	00:22:04,544	00:22:06,592	| serial-s02-e04 |	And after. Did you okay
EDL	00:22:07,104	00:22:08,640	| serial-s02-e04 |	Economies are willing to wait
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:11,200	| serial-s02-e04 |	Between spell also weights
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:14,528	| serial-s02-e04 |	One defense official told me
EDL	00:22:14,528	00:22:18,112	| serial-s02-e04 |	If you could set aside the circumstances of both capture
EDL	00:22:18,112	00:22:20,160	| serial-s02-e04 |	Of course you can't but if you could
EDL	00:22:20,160	00:22:22,976	| serial-s02-e04 |	Both would be a huge success story for the Army
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,280	| serial-s02-e04 |	Is 23 year old kid
EDL	00:22:25,280	00:22:29,888	| serial-s02-e04 |	No training manager is not only to survive but to resist as a p o w
EDL	00:22:30,400	00:22:33,216	| serial-s02-e04 |	The most extraordinary perhaps he does it alone
EDL	00:22:33,216	00:22:33,984	| serial-s02-e04 |	And isolation
EDL	00:22:34,752	00:22:38,080	| serial-s02-e04 |	There's no one else in the recent history of the army with a story like that
EDL	00:22:39,360	00:22:42,432	| serial-s02-e04 |	Terrence Russell as principal debriefer
EDL	00:22:42,432	00:22:44,992	| serial-s02-e04 |	Testified at a military Hearing in September
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:51,392	| serial-s02-e04 |	Russell is an Undisputed expert on this stuff during his career he's debriefed or interviewed about a hundred and twenty-five
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:53,952	| serial-s02-e04 |	5 pows possibly more than anyone in the country
EDL	00:22:54,464	00:22:56,256	| serial-s02-e04 |	The hearing Russell was asked
EDL	00:22:56,256	00:22:58,560	| serial-s02-e04 |	Basically how bad did Bo have it
EDL	00:22:59,072	00:23:03,424	| serial-s02-e04 |	Russell said you'd have to go back to the Jungle camps Vietnam to begin to compare
EDL	00:23:03,936	00:23:08,032	| serial-s02-e04 |	Experience and I don't know sir that I can give you a percentage
EDL	00:23:08,544	00:23:14,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	What is experience ranks at the same Echelon of the most horrible conditions of captivity that we've seen in the last six
EDL	00:23:14,944	00:23:15,968	| serial-s02-e04 |	Steers unquote
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:21,600	| serial-s02-e04 |	After Bo was rescued and they took him to a hospital in Germany
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:27,744	| serial-s02-e04 |	Go ask them to take the clock off the wall in the room he was in time rated like that
EDL	00:23:28,256	00:23:31,072	| serial-s02-e04 |	Should have taken him years as a captive to wean yourself off of time
EDL	00:23:31,840	00:23:33,888	| serial-s02-e04 |	Even when he was locked in whatever room
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:36,192	| serial-s02-e04 |	There might be a light on all the time or not at all
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:40,288	| serial-s02-e04 |	The clock in the calendar became bendy and troublesome
EDL	00:23:47,200	00:23:49,504	| serial-s02-e04 |	Nothing you can really understand
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,208	| serial-s02-e04 |	What do you mean
EDL	00:24:01,536	00:24:07,680	| serial-s02-e04 |	You're not in tomorrow you're not in the next week you're not here next month
EDL	00:24:16,640	00:24:19,712	| serial-s02-e04 |	And the fact that there was nothing there
EDL	00:24:19,712	00:24:20,480	| serial-s02-e04 |	I mean
EDL	00:24:20,480	00:24:21,504	| serial-s02-e04 |	You can
EDL	00:24:21,504	00:24:27,904	| serial-s02-e04 |	When you were able to distract yourself
EDL	00:24:27,904	00:24:29,440	| serial-s02-e04 |	Your mind
EDL	00:24:30,464	00:24:32,256	| serial-s02-e04 |	When you don't have any of that
EDL	00:24:32,768	00:24:34,048	| serial-s02-e04 |	Yeah
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:39,424	| serial-s02-e04 |	Repetition
EDL	00:24:41,216	00:24:44,032	| serial-s02-e04 |	You're my you turn into a broken record
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:48,128	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because at some point you have only so much to think about
EDL	00:24:48,640	00:24:50,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	Right you run out of ideas yeah
EDL	00:24:58,624	00:25:00,416	| serial-s02-e04 |	Such as will I get food today
EDL	00:25:00,928	00:25:01,952	| serial-s02-e04 |	Give it to me
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:08,352	| serial-s02-e04 |	Why did the girl who gave it to me yesterday look annoyed why are they giving it to me is there something I can do to make them give it to me but not make it look like I'm try
EDL	00:25:08,352	00:25:08,864	| serial-s02-e04 |	Can you get it
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:15,520	| serial-s02-e04 |	By the way depriving someone of any discernible schedule is a time-honored method of keeping her prisoner compliant
EDL	00:25:16,288	00:25:18,592	| serial-s02-e04 |	Who said it was maddening the obsessive thoughts
EDL	00:25:19,360	00:25:23,712	| serial-s02-e04 |	Maybe you do an Abbott and Costello bit in his head or that line from the Johnny Cash song
EDL	00:25:23,712	00:25:27,296	| serial-s02-e04 |	I fell into a burning Ring of Fire he said he can't remember the rest
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,880	| serial-s02-e04 |	Or he'd look and look and look at the room around him
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:32,160	| serial-s02-e04 |	Not in search of something new
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:38,816	| serial-s02-e04 |	Just because that's all he had to look at
EDL	00:25:52,640	00:25:54,176	| serial-s02-e04 |	Are you still moving
EDL	00:26:05,952	00:26:09,280	| serial-s02-e04 |	If you're thinking maybe bone went crazy
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:10,560	| serial-s02-e04 |	He didn't
EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:11,328	| serial-s02-e04 |	He says he didn't
EDL	00:26:11,840	00:26:14,144	| serial-s02-e04 |	I might have been a little easier if you had but he didn't
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:20,032	| serial-s02-e04 |	In fact a psychologist we talked to who was on a Seer team that plan for Bose return
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:25,152	| serial-s02-e04 |	He said that they assumed if you survive captivity you're more or less psychologically healthy
EDL	00:26:25,664	00:26:26,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	PTSD Maybe
EDL	00:26:26,944	00:26:27,712	| serial-s02-e04 |	I'm not crazy
EDL	00:26:28,224	00:26:30,528	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because as soon as you start to lose your mind
EDL	00:26:30,528	00:26:32,320	| serial-s02-e04 |	Your chances of surviving go down
EDL	00:26:33,088	00:26:38,208	| serial-s02-e04 |	If you spend save 5 years trying to get food trying to get water trying to escape
EDL	00:26:38,208	00:26:40,256	| serial-s02-e04 |	You need to keep your mind intact for all that
EDL	00:26:41,792	00:26:43,072	| serial-s02-e04 |	Still sanity
EDL	00:26:43,072	00:26:45,632	| serial-s02-e04 |	In both situation is psychologically exhaust
EDL	00:26:46,400	00:26:48,448	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because you're simultaneously bored
EDL	00:26:48,448	00:26:49,472	| serial-s02-e04 |	Afraid
EDL	00:26:49,472	00:26:51,008	| serial-s02-e04 |	And Hyper aware
EDL	00:26:51,008	00:26:52,800	| serial-s02-e04 |	A combination other pows
EDL	00:26:52,800	00:26:53,312	| serial-s02-e04 |	Described
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,360	| serial-s02-e04 |	Mark espo
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,896	| serial-s02-e04 |	Did you tell yourself stories
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:59,200	| serial-s02-e04 |	Did you try to disappear into your imagination
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:02,016	| serial-s02-e04 |	And surprisingly both said not really
EDL	00:27:02,528	00:27:08,672	| serial-s02-e04 |	He said he would force himself to stay in the present not succumb to what he calls his fantastic storybook tendon
EDL	00:27:09,696	00:27:11,488	| serial-s02-e04 |	And that's partly what got him in trouble in the first place
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,560	| serial-s02-e04 |	Anyway even if you'd wanted to drift off
EDL	00:27:15,072	00:27:16,352	| serial-s02-e04 |	Ebony just couldn't
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,632	| serial-s02-e04 |	I didn't have a choice about it
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:19,424	| serial-s02-e04 |	Pain he said
EDL	00:27:19,424	00:27:20,448	| serial-s02-e04 |	Is a great distractor
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,776	| serial-s02-e04 |	He might spend an entire day just dealing with his feet
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:26,336	| serial-s02-e04 |	Or the cramps from dehydration
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:27,104	| serial-s02-e04 |	From starvation
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,432	| serial-s02-e04 |	His body was demanding his full immediate
EDL	00:27:30,432	00:27:30,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	Attention
EDL	00:27:31,712	00:27:35,808	| serial-s02-e04 |	Dosas even when he was kind of ready to give up his body was stubborn
EDL	00:27:35,808	00:27:36,320	| serial-s02-e04 |	Nagging
EDL	00:27:36,832	00:27:37,856	| serial-s02-e04 |	Doing its own thing
EDL	00:27:39,648	00:27:43,232	| serial-s02-e04 |	Only reason why I'm still here simply because my body didn't quit
EDL	00:27:43,744	00:27:45,536	| serial-s02-e04 |	What food came he ate it
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:46,048	| serial-s02-e04 |	Body just
EDL	00:27:47,072	00:27:48,096	| serial-s02-e04 |	Maybe so cold
EDL	00:27:48,096	00:27:49,632	| serial-s02-e04 |	But his body would struggle to get warm
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,376	| serial-s02-e04 |	But even with that like wrapped around my shoulders
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:25,216	| serial-s02-e04 |	Did you ever ask for more blankets
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:34,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	Ended up giving me an extra blanket
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:40,320	| serial-s02-e04 |	I don't know I mean everybody human has some some
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:44,160	| serial-s02-e04 |	Did you know
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:46,976	| serial-s02-e04 |	Good qualities especially if somebody's
EDL	00:28:47,488	00:28:50,816	| serial-s02-e04 |	How to place a low placenta and travels in Hawaiian
EDL	00:28:51,584	00:28:56,960	| serial-s02-e04 |	I can't say for sure of course but I think it's possible the guy who gave both a blanket with a cook
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,496	| serial-s02-e04 |	Emma Brock
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:29:03,104	| serial-s02-e04 |	Sammy interviewed him for Mark's company page one who's an older guy maybe 50
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:03,616	| serial-s02-e04 |	Unmarried
EDL	00:29:04,128	00:29:10,528	| serial-s02-e04 |	He don't have Connie's a long time you cook for them and their people for many years
EDL	00:29:10,528	00:29:16,416	| serial-s02-e04 |	He retired and moved back to his Village from your job but he told Sammy that one day a few years ago
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:18,464	| serial-s02-e04 |	He got a call to come to a job
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:20,256	| serial-s02-e04 |	He's met my Melissa and Dean
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,048	| serial-s02-e04 |	Protection for remote farmhouse
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:24,864	| serial-s02-e04 |	There's no Road you have to hike way out to it
EDL	00:29:24,864	00:29:28,448	| serial-s02-e04 |	And I'm not sure but it's possible this place was somewhere in the show all Valley
EDL	00:29:28,448	00:29:29,728	| serial-s02-e04 |	Couple hours from here to Shaw
EDL	00:29:31,008	00:29:36,384	| serial-s02-e04 |	Sunken gives them an AK-47 and tell them the whole area is mined don't leave the house
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:38,688	| serial-s02-e04 |	If you see anyone approached shoot
EDL	00:29:38,688	00:29:41,760	| serial-s02-e04 |	Inside the house by Brock says he sees his gas
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:48,672	| serial-s02-e04 |	I guess he means prisoners a blue-eyed Foreigner in one small dark room and some rich Afghan guy
EDL	00:29:48,672	00:29:49,184	| serial-s02-e04 |	In another room
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:52,000	| serial-s02-e04 |	He said they were all stuck out there in the wild
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:54,048	| serial-s02-e04 |	The two prisoners 3 guards in Iraq
EDL	00:29:54,560	00:29:56,864	| serial-s02-e04 |	The guards weren't allowed walkie talkies or phones
EDL	00:29:57,376	00:30:01,216	| serial-s02-e04 |	Couple times a week someone might show up then use a code word to be let in
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:05,568	| serial-s02-e04 |	In Sammy's notes by Brock sounds like he was more than a little freaked out
EDL	00:30:06,848	00:30:07,616	| serial-s02-e04 |	Kisses
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:10,688	| serial-s02-e04 |	The only thing we could hear there was noise of drones
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:15,808	| serial-s02-e04 |	Dangerous animal crying dangerous animal cries at night and scary deep Darkness
EDL	00:30:16,320	00:30:17,088	| serial-s02-e04 |	Yeah
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:23,488	| serial-s02-e04 |	Yeah babies Montanez night time is quite scary you know it's very scary they have all kind of bad animals and draw
EDL	00:30:23,488	00:30:24,768	| serial-s02-e04 |	24-hour light
EDL	00:30:25,792	00:30:27,840	| serial-s02-e04 |	Making buzz buzz buzz and you are worried
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:31,680	| serial-s02-e04 |	High enough maybe there is a red or something going on
EDL	00:30:34,240	00:30:38,080	| serial-s02-e04 |	You could not leave everything like that you know because they were trusted by
EDL	00:30:38,848	00:30:40,128	| serial-s02-e04 |	The commander
EDL	00:30:40,128	00:30:44,224	| serial-s02-e04 |	Bob Rocks first menu he said was potato with gravy yogurt and naan
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:49,088	| serial-s02-e04 |	He said they kept one plate aside for bow since he wasn't Muslim no one else would eat off that plate
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:52,928	| serial-s02-e04 |	Brock said the Afghan prisoner was chatty and funny
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:54,720	| serial-s02-e04 |	Couldn't communicate with bow
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:57,024	| serial-s02-e04 |	I could see that if I wasn't doing well
EDL	00:30:57,536	00:30:58,304	| serial-s02-e04 |	Wasn't eating much
EDL	00:30:58,816	00:30:59,840	| serial-s02-e04 |	Which is an insult
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:00,864	| serial-s02-e04 |	By the way
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:04,960	| serial-s02-e04 |	Tell Sammy he wasn't sure if Beau didn't like the food or just needed a utensil
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:06,496	| serial-s02-e04 |	Find a spoon for him
EDL	00:31:06,496	00:31:12,640	| serial-s02-e04 |	And he said I mean every time of course he was trying to say something but you don't understand
EDL	00:31:13,152	00:31:14,944	| serial-s02-e04 |	I want English was not good
EDL	00:31:14,944	00:31:16,224	| serial-s02-e04 |	Then he said
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:20,576	| serial-s02-e04 |	Sometime I really wish I could understand he was trying to say something can next
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:21,344	| serial-s02-e04 |	Time
EDL	00:31:21,344	00:31:25,952	| serial-s02-e04 |	I brought lot of thing for him and he didn't pick up nothing kuptimi Enola
EDL	00:31:25,952	00:31:26,464	| serial-s02-e04 |	Like I brought

EDL	00:31:31,584	00:31:37,216	| serial-s02-e04 |	Understand what you're what I had in color
EDL	00:31:37,216	00:31:38,752	| serial-s02-e04 |	He says in the notes
EDL	00:31:38,752	00:31:39,776	| serial-s02-e04 |	It says

EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:18,656	| serial-s02-e04 |	We treat our prisoners better than Americans treat their prisoners in Guantanamo and upgrade
EDL	00:35:19,424	00:35:20,960	| serial-s02-e04 |	Bose case though
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:23,008	| serial-s02-e04 |	That rationale seem to work in reverse
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:26,080	| serial-s02-e04 |	Princeton's the guy who repeatedly tortured bow

EDL	00:35:43,488	00:35:46,816	| serial-s02-e04 |	Don't know don't think one or two cuts at a time
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:51,680	| serial-s02-e04 |	Between 60-70 cuts at a time
EDL	00:35:58,848	00:35:59,872	| serial-s02-e04 |	It hurts more
EDL	00:35:59,872	00:36:01,152	| serial-s02-e04 |	Of course if you do it slowly
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:05,248	| serial-s02-e04 |	I lost count how many Cuts after it reached 600

EDL	00:37:57,888	00:38:00,960	| serial-s02-e04 |	Understanding what they're saying
EDL	00:38:01,472	00:38:05,568	| serial-s02-e04 |	And that's what they wanted acknowledgement so that's what I give him
EDL	00:38:17,088	00:38:20,928	| serial-s02-e04 |	Goes in the cage against a metal cage padlock together
EDL	00:38:20,928	00:38:24,000	| serial-s02-e04 |	Is soulmate one last impotent attempt at Escape
EDL	00:38:24,512	00:38:29,120	| serial-s02-e04 |	He said he did it because he was so angry he could not stand the idea of these guys winning
EDL	00:38:29,888	00:38:31,936	| serial-s02-e04 |	Is it wasn't a second to last year
EDL	00:38:31,936	00:38:35,008	| serial-s02-e04 |	One of the guys English
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:38:59,584	| serial-s02-e04 |	Got really angry about that
EDL	00:39:10,848	00:39:12,384	| serial-s02-e04 |	After the guy left
EDL	00:39:12,384	00:39:13,664	| serial-s02-e04 |	Beau decided to risk
EDL	00:39:13,664	00:39:15,968	| serial-s02-e04 |	Lifting the particle board away from the cage
EDL	00:39:15,968	00:39:20,576	| serial-s02-e04 |	Floor she'd realize the only fly in the cage was the shotty welding down there
EDL	00:39:20,576	00:39:26,976	| serial-s02-e04 |	He thought if he could rest the welds with spit or water you can maybe get a few of the bars free and squeeze out
EDL	00:39:26,976	00:39:33,120	| serial-s02-e04 |	Because of the cold and damp the particle board how to expand it so he gets it maybe halfway up
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:35,424	| serial-s02-e04 |	But then he can't get it back down in place
EDL	00:39:35,424	00:39:41,824	| serial-s02-e04 |	Hide what he's trying to do so he thinks if he softens it maybe you can shave off the edges and get it to go back down
EDL	00:39:41,824	00:39:48,224	| serial-s02-e04 |	Put water on it which just makes it swell even more and that begins a fight with a particle board at last
EDL	00:39:48,224	00:39:49,504	| serial-s02-e04 |	All night
EDL	00:39:49,504	00:39:55,904	| serial-s02-e04 |	All night he's using a AAA Battery he had he popped off the top and flattened it and sharpened it against the cage
EDL	00:39:55,904	00:40:02,304	| serial-s02-e04 |	And now he's using it to try to shave down the particle board and every noise he makes he scared someone's going to hear
EDL	00:40:02,304	00:40:05,888	| serial-s02-e04 |	And come in and then who knows what the consequences would be but very bad
EDL	00:40:05,888	00:40:07,680	| serial-s02-e04 |	I can't get the board back down
EDL	00:40:08,192	00:40:10,752	| serial-s02-e04 |	Idea of losing that one chance
EDL	00:40:15,104	00:40:17,152	| serial-s02-e04 |	Exhausted

EDL	00:40:23,808	00:40:25,600	| serial-s02-e04 |	I don't think I ever
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:26,624	| serial-s02-e04 |	I'm back from it
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:28,416	| serial-s02-e04 |	I never stop
EDL	00:40:28,416	00:40:29,952	| serial-s02-e04 |	It's like putting water on a
EDL	00:40:31,744	00:40:34,304	| serial-s02-e04 |	Stop trying to escape
EDL	00:40:34,304	00:40:37,120	| serial-s02-e04 |	That night thing to burn something out of me
EDL	00:40:37,120	00:40:39,168	| serial-s02-e04 |	Yeah I'm back
EDL	00:40:42,752	00:40:44,288	| serial-s02-e04 |	Something inside of me that
