1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Previously

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,048
Ontario

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,096
She kind of just always generally in

4
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
And we made it because

5
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,912
Just the constant

6
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Beijing

7
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,496
Her if she was out

8
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,032
Take a break

9
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:18,432
It was everything where I was like texting her like going to her house knocking on the door

10
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
He was going to

11
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,784
Color is car was broken down

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,088
And I asked her for a ride

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,976
Global Tel Link prepaid call from

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,024
Adnan Syed

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
An inmate from Maryland correctional facility from This American Life

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:46,080
WBEZ Chicago serial one story told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,968
The cops who investigated the murder of Hae Min Lee experience Baltimore City Detectives

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
Bill Ritz and Greg macgillivray

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:01,440
And how I wish right now that I could play you tape of their perspective on this case

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,488
But they didn't want to be here

21
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,584
Wendover it's finally turned me down after 6 weeks of back-and-forth

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
He said he didn't see the point

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
The case has been adjudicated

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
What good would it do

25
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,544
I also spoke on the phone

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,664
Sentences to me

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
Send it

28
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
Hammer horror hesitates remember the case right away

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Beyond question he did it

30
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
How did they arrive at that level of certainty

31
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
Before his body was found this is a missing person case

32
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
She disappeared January 13th

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Investigation starts out a little slowly which makes sense to me she's not a small child she's 18 she's got a car because I

34
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Also missing

35
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,760
At first the police call around to her friends they text Alicia

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,832
Remember that's when he tells him he's supposed to get a ride from her but didn't

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
The next day that Colorado Hospital's hotels motels

38
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
They checked the area around the high school parking lot where she was last seen

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:14,400
You can see from the reports that they immediately hone in on the most time-worn explanation for such disappearances

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
The boyfriends

41
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Current and former

42
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
The first day they called on her new guy

43
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,152
They checked the area around his house which is in another County Northeast of Baltimore

44
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,528
Over the next two weeks we keep asking more questions

45
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
They checked on The Alibi he was indeed at work at the LensCrafters store the day he went missing his manager tells

46
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,024
Anons track coach to check anons alibi

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
It's inconclusive

48
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
The coach tells him he can't be sure Adnan practice that day they don't take attendance

49
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,848
R6 they do that awful foreboding thing you see on TV sometimes

50
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,712
A team of dogs to check the wooded areas and fields around Woodlawn High School

51
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
Best curling iron for send

52
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,880
The February 8th report saying they're going to check his computer for AOL account

53
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
There's search stops

54
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Spect emerges

55
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,864
Testing one two three testing one two three

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,192
This is tape from a police interview of the man who finds hey

57
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
He's a little hard to hear on the tape

58
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
He's soft-spoken

59
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
I'm going to call this man mr. ass

60
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
I don't want to use his full name for reasons I promise will become clear

61
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
Mr.ass works in the maintenance department at a local school

62
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
Discovered

63
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Make it pop

64
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
I think I may have discovered a body in Lincoln Park he says

65
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,280
Bring it to the slightly off-kilter story about how Mr s discover this body

66
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
Just a word here about Linkin Park

67
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,936
It's actually spelled leakin Park leakin

68
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
Linkin Park

69
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
It's huge over a thousand acres on the western edge of Baltimore city it's got a reputation

70
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
Not for the beauty of its Woods or it's Trails Arts Nature Center

71
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,808
What is known for sadly is dead bodies

72
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
Mention Lincoln Park two people from Baltimore as I often did

73
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
A pretty much guaranteed to get a comment like this

74
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,024
Well you're digging it Linkin Park the bear your body you're going to find somebody else

75
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,215
The rental car in West Baltimore I was working on a story about a girl who was found in leakin park he said

76
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
My uncle was found dead in Lincoln Park

77
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
McCobb website dedicated to Baltimore murders list

78
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
68 bodies found there since 1946

79
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,039
Alyssa's missing at least 7 years of stats that number is probably low

80
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,903
A lot of law-abiding baltimoreans they don't even really know where leakin Park is

81
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,511
Rabia chaudry that family friend of a roofers contacted me about this case

82
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,119
Which is explaining it to me she said yeah and how is it supposed to get to Lincoln Park so fast

83
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
It's like an hour into the city

84
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Linkin Park is nowhere near the school

85
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,055
Her brother's best friend

86
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
After a non had initially got arrested

87
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
When I was on the phone with him talking like

88
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
When he was locked up I like

89
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,039
Lincoln Park MI where is that do you know where it is have you ever been there

90
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
And he's like I have never been there I don't even know where it is

91
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,951
So I mean living around here we don't know but it's somewhere in the Inner City

92
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
Is in fact less than three miles from where you are sitting right now

93
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Office across the street from Woodlawn High School

94
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Set a 7-minute drive

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
I have no idea

96
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,847
We wouldn't go there we go to the harbor somewhere yeah there's no reason for us to go there

97
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,711
I'm explaining all this just to say that the simple fact that he was found

98
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
A lot of people that alone made it

99
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
What's a nice boy like you doing a park like this

100
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Mister s

101
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,375
He also told the cops he's never been to that part of Linkin Park before he did seem to know that people go fishing back there

102
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Here's what he told the cops

103
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,007
At his job he got in a work order to shave down a door

104
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
But the school didn't have the tool he needed

105
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
A plane

106
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
He had one at home though

107
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,015
So during his lunch hour he said he drove his truck home got the plane from his basement and before you left

108
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
Grab some sustenance out of the fridge

109
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,647
I'd rather be unrefrigerated

110
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
On my way back

111
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
Feather-N-Fin

112
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Jenny

113
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,871
She's drinking this 22 oz Budweiser and he's heading back to work

114
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,687
And his route to the college is through leakin Park

115
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
He stops on franklintown Road

116
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
About three miles from work

117
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
There's a small pull off and some concrete barriers and he walks back in there quite a ways seems like for a guy who just has to pee

118
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Later they measure

119
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
127 feet back into the woods

120
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Legos

121
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
The next tape is a little upsetting

122
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
And I got that good way

123
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Which were your attention

124
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
2

125
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
The area that you

126
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,695
There was something there it was open

127
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
An open area

128
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
But there was also a fallen tree

129
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,167
Did you go to that area for certain reason

130
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
Suspicious of Mr s who by this time as become a Cessna

131
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,271
The tape was made on February 18th 9 days after Mr as reported finding the body

132
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927
They're going over the details carefully because there are parts of a story that are a little weird

133
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,023
Something about the fallen tree 127 feedback Into the Woods

134
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,399
It was a Fallen Tree essentially a 40-foot log lime or less parallel to the road

135
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
The other side of the name of dead run

136
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,151
His body was buried right behind this log on the Streamside

137
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
You're standing on the street side of the logs on the other side

138
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
It's not at all obvious that you notice her

139
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,647
Tell me a story about why he stopped where he stopped it doesn't quite seem right

140
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
When you're walking back

141
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
2

142
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
This area where you finally stop

143
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
Why did you pick that particular area

144
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
That's when I sing

145
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
You said you were going to actually go back further

146
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,295
In this part of the tape you get a sense of how Ritz and McGillivray operate together

147
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Or at least what I've gathered in listening to a bunch of these interviews

148
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,719
Montgomery starts out on judgmental just tell me your story

149
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
Ben wittes comes in and says something like

150
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
Tell me understand here

151
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Some harder questions

152
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Exposing weaknesses in the narrative

153
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Then I will come back in

154
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,919
He's asking direct sometimes harsh questions it seemed like they'd be good at pushing someone off balance

155
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
But this one sort out of the blue

156
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Have you ever been inside

157
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
Batgirl's carport

158
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
To the fallen tree

159
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,999
Purity saying wait I thought you told me

160
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
Stopped at the log.

161
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,351
And now you're saying you're on your way further back

162
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Stop Larry

163
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Getting ready to urinate

164
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
And then that's when you walked in and discovered the hair

165
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
Now you're saying you're going to actually go back further

166
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Before you discovered

167
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
Maybe I'm a little bit confused as you're standing on the south side of the tree in a tree in the room

168
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Minnesota Let It Go

169
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
A bunch of things are fishy

170
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
The path he takes back into the woods it doesn't really lead to the log

171
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
What is the end up there

172
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,399
He didn't need to find a hidden spot to pay there are so many other choices

173
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:20,031
And if you're walking through brush and brambles when you should have naturally avoid a big login into step over

174
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
What they're trying to get at is

175
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
Did you really just stumble on this body

176
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
Were you looking for this body

177
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
Because you already knew where it was

178
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
What is a reasonable question

179
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
Because his body wasn't just hard to spot

180
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Impossible to spot

181
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,535
Right where in the State's Attorney's office we just got delivered the first box of what they're saying is

182
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Disclosable under

183
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
Whatever Public Information Act

184
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Can I attend

185
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,287
I didn't understand how camouflage body was until I saw photos of the crime scene

186
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Mr s founded

187
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Before they remove the body

188
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,175
State's Attorney's Office in Baltimore

189
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,271
I went through the crime reporter from The Baltimore Sun name is Justin George

190
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
I've been talking to Justin about the

191
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,623
The story and he's interested maybe writing about it too

192
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Open a packet of photos together

193
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
Phone number awful to see if you'd imagine

194
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
There was one where you can make out a bit of black hair and the dirt and leaves

195
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,935
How did he notice that I don't understand that either

196
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
I mean it's it's pretty well covered

197
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Yeah you there's barely any

198
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
I need a showing

199
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
But are we supposed to be looking at something there

200
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
What is that

201
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
Is that her that's her that's all he saw

202
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Yeah that's

203
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Looks to be part of the body

204
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Yeah I expected it

205
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
To be more visible

206
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,911
Justin and I were the only ones who had this reaction

207
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,055
The city surveyor went out to the burial site to measure the distance from the road

208
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
This is before they disinterred her

209
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Testifying at trial

210
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,479
When I arrived at the site where the body was

211
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
There was a log

212
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
Wunderground approximate 40 feet long

213
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Oki

214
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
Stuck on the log I walked along the edge of the log expecting to find a body real soon I never saw

215
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Call one

216
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
How much time

217
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
I like taking one more step

218
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
I would have walked on the grave site where the body was

219
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
And at that point or others on the scene

220
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Yes ma'am it was a lot of people there

221
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
Inception point to somebody point out these exact location yes ma'am detective pointed to the site

222
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
I look at the ground

223
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
And I also

224
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,183
It looked it wasn't rushing Disturbed

225
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
Yeah just Blended in with their natural surroundings of the ground

226
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,959
Who's looking for the body

227
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,799
Knows where it's supposed to be who can see that they're a bunch of people standing around it

228
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
And still you can't find it

229
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
Does it seem reasonable that Mr s

230
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
Apparently wasn't looking for anything except a secluded place to pee would have discovered it just like that

231
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
This business of having to pee

232
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,095
The spot where mr.ass stops is only a few miles from his house

233
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
Only a few more miles from its work

234
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Kitty can't wait

235
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
Here's detective questioning mistress again

236
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,823
While you were at home did you have to urinate or use bathroom at all

237
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,223
So within 7 or 8 minutes how much is a 22 in your head

238
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,879
That 7/8 minute.

239
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
You had to go to the bathroom

240
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
Mr. Says he never actually does pee in the woods

241
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
So the ends of waiting till I get to work

242
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
Which okay maybe that makes sense you've had a shock

243
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
Find me walk so far in in the first place

244
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
He's just trying to have a quick pee

245
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Why was he studying the ground

246
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
Ask him about this

247
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
You got out of your vehicle Venture back

248
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
Into the Woods

249
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,975
What we're after we measured it was actually 127 feet off the roadway

250
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
As you're walking along why are you looking down at the ground

251
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,911
Are you looking every step you take

252
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
10

253
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
11

254
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,151
12 in February this year we went out to Linkin Park

255
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
We wanted to know whether it was strange that you done so far back into the woods

256
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
127 feet from the road look like

257
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,927
Producer Dana was with me and so is Justin George Baltimore Sun

258
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
The place where Mr acid entered the woods right at the road

259
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Just a notice to sign

260
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
What's that

261
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Just look at it I mean

262
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
The sign says a lot

263
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
This area patrolled

264
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Dumper's will be prosecuted

265
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
They can barely read it

266
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,871
Charger redesign that's covered in graffiti and pierced with seven bullet holes

267
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,015
In fact the cops found 20 cartridge casings and right about the spot when they collected evidence in 1999

268
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
I thought the park itself was quite lovely

269
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Rainbows and trees

270
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
It's rocking as a stream

271
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,231
Is uneven Transat hilly but not flat either

272
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
Not nearly as creepy as I imagined it

273
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
I think it is a nice

274
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,423
At night I think a dust gets it I think it is

275
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Very bleak

276
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
21

277
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
22

278
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,151
3 we walked in what we figured is about 127 ft

279
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Just in case it out by the yard

280
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
42

281
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
Be right about there

282
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
We actually wander around for a while trying to find the right spot

283
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,743
Finally I remember that we have a hand-drawn map of the site from that survey or better Meyer testified

284
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
40 ft long

285
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
15 inch log on the ground

286
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Once you get to the right location

287
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
It depends on all of us

288
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,983
127 feedback doesn't feel all that far

289
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
If you're looking for privacy

290
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,079
You can still see the cars on the road from where we're standing

291
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
.

292
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
If he's peeing

293
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Yeah

294
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
At least you want to come this far

295
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
There's nothing

296
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Yeah I mean there's something

297
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Some Dead Leaves or whatever but yeah you can totally see the cars

298
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
So actually that doesn't seem that weird to me

299
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
Emily Mister as a story seems eminently more believable

300
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,935
What were the woods I feel Justin in on the evidence they collected here

301
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
Was a liquor bottle

302
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
From which they got cellular material and never tested

303
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
And a rope

304
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
That was never tested

305
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
As far as I know

306
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Personnel

307
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
And then

308
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
Up at the road they found

309
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
A condom

310
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
And a condom wrapper back in the condom was still rolled

311
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Click on

312
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
Used condom is Harley

313
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
And they found

314
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
A bunch of shell casing

315
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
They found bullets and shell casings

316
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Set from two different guns

317
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
And they found

318
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,847
Blockbuster Video to Blockbuster Video like a cases

319
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,223
But by the body was the only thing they got right from the area of the body was

320
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
What's the liquor bottle in the Rope

321
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
I know it sounds like a game of Clue

322
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
If the condom part

323
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
As for the liquor bottle

324
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
Back at the taped interview with mr. s

325
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,583
Detectives Rich McGillivray want to find out if this guy could be the source of that liquor bottle

326
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
Do you drink anything else besides beer they ask

327
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
What

328
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Whiskey

329
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
What kind

330
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
Windsor Canadian whiskey

331
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
What denomination

332
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Maybe half a pint

333
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
Did you ever take

334
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
A bottle

335
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Would you ever take that in the car

336
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Keep you warm

337
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Yes

338
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
No risk comes in

339
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
We collected evidence

340
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
She says cans and bottles in a crime scene

341
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
We're going to test them

342
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
Is buffing hair they never do tests

343
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,911
We're going to find your DNA and one of those bottles yes

344
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,495
Baby cereal bottle out the window when you're driving past coming home from work

345
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
If so you better tell us now

346
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,103
But it's important we know about it because

347
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:28,223
We're going to do is Analyze That and come back 6 months

348
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Rehab Evans

349
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
That you were deceptive with us

350
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
That we have

351
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
DNA

352
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,951
Proof that you were there and then say oh I forgot

353
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
Pause icon fishnet there that weekend

354
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
And yeah you know half a point

355
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
And I threw a bottle in them

356
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
The lights to take a minute

357
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
In

358
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,919
Or any of the items not as fine whiskey balls beer bottle soda can

359
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,759
Or anything like that where you may have discarded in that general area

360
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Because I'm not sure could have

361
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
I'm not positive

362
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
Cuz I know a lot of bottles out the window

363
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Rich asks what bottles

364
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Beer bottles

365
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
Whiskey Maybe

366
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Possible he says

367
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
Welfare while he switch to Rum

368
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
What rum

369
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
Dark rum Bacardi

370
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
I can't stand it

371
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
He just starts listing different kinds of booze

372
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Legend

373
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
A long time ago

374
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Brandy

375
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Cognac

376
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Just

377
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
Just keep stuff yeah

378
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Brandy

379
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,263
Brandy was the answer they were looking for the bottle they found near his body is Coronet vsq Brandy

380
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
200ml blue right past it

381
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,063
Consider for a moment if Mr s was just trying to relieve his bladder

382
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
Modern piece that February day minding his own business

383
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
And then he sees this terrible sad sight and does the right thing

384
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
How's the cops shows and where she's buried

385
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,351
Well how horrible now that they're so suspicious of them

386
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,679
But they're considering the maybe either he did it or he knows who did

387
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
How terrifying for mr. ass

388
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,103
Girl I smell like a nice quiet guys Cooperative doesn't appear to be a brandy drinker

389
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
Again I can only go by the reports and files but my guess is the reason the cops are holding onto mr. ssss

390
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Is because

391
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Pinterest

392
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,903
Has a little bit of a record which isn't necessarily a big deal

393
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
But

394
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,511
And here's part of story where I'm hoping you'll understand why I'm not using his name

395
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,119
Mr. s is a Streaker kind

396
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Freaking kind

397
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,823
Indecent exposure charges defense attorney under circumstances that

398
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Hazard does not even begin to Define

399
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:11,039
Mr. SS arrested May of 94 for running about naked in a residential neighborhood two years later merchandise

400
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,903
36 acres and nothing else

401
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
The officer writes

402
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:23,584
The southwestern district has received numerous calls for service in the past three years to this area for the same incident

403
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
Same description

404
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Past 3 years

405
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
The officer chases down to stress onto I-95

406
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,336
Pinterest jump some chain link fences the kind with razor wire at the top

407
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
End up in the hospital

408
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
It gets worse

409
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,480
Or better depending on whether you enjoy police reports as much as I do

410
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
December 7th of 1998

411
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,624
So barely two months before Mr s finds his body

412
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
There's this

413
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,488
Around noon during what I have to imagine is Mister as lunch break

414
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,560
A lady named Margaret is driving along

415
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Jersey report

416
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:01,216
Black male dash out in front of my car and began shaking his body and up and down motion

417
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
No clothes

418
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,592
His penis was exposed as he faced my vehicle shaking

419
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
And this lady Margaret

420
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Is a police officer

421
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
In uniform

422
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,784
She chases him but he runs down into the Metro stop

423
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:21,440
Margaret finds his work clothes in a pile and takes them which means unless that's your ass has a second outfit stashed

424
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
Someplace he is riding back to work in the altogether

425
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
Twisted the sensitive

426
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
The same day he flashes Margaret so

427
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
December 7th 98

428
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Mr. s files his own police

429
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Support

430
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Jesus

431
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
From his car

432
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,872
Someone's taking his cellphone his money his keys

433
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
His work clothes

434
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
Who has all of it

435
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:50,880
Officer Margaret

436
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
Streaking isn't a violent crime

437
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
Or necessarily a sexual one

438
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
And there's no evidence that he was sexually assaulted anyway

439
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:04,704
But you can imagine both sets of eyebrows Rising Unwritten Aguilera's faces when they see these reports

440
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
It's strange Behavior

441
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,568
Mr. s about it on tape

442
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,616
But I figure he knew they knew

443
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,248
The same day they interview Monday February 18th

444
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
I also give him a polygraph test

445
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Which he fails

446
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
Deception indicated as a conclusion

447
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,720
But the tester also said Mr s seem to be nervous

448
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,328
Cuz apparently had an important meeting with a realtor that day his wife is expecting him to pick her up

449
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
But a week later another polygraph

450
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
This time with different questions

451
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Princeton

452
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,592
Do you know that girl you found I because she was hit with a tire iron

453
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
I guess that's a thing

454
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,968
This time there is no deception indicated

455
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,344
Pinterest Fades from their View

456
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,744
Pictures of my own thoughts were when I learn

457
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Mr ass

458
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,608
I didn't really think so maybe he did it maybe he killed her

459
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,704
Wonder if maybe heard something about the crime

460
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
In about where she was buried

461
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,848
Because it did seem a tad unbelievable to me that he spotted her the way he said he did

462
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,736
One Theory his step kids or a neighbor had told him about the body

463
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
It heard about it through other kids

464
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
School

465
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
Mister as just as a Good Samaritan thought

466
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,184
Someone needs to go find this girl and tell the cops

467
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,048
I just want to say he's heard about it beforehand cuz you don't want to get anyone else in trouble

468
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
Mr. s didn't want to talk to me

469
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,448
After I made several requests he asked if I please leave him alone

470
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Fair enough

471
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,384
I tried every witch way to figure out if he knew or anyone in his family knew Adnan or Jay or any of the people

472
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
I told about the murder

473
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
And vice-versa whether any of them had ever heard of mr. ass

474
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Condo connection

475
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
The closest I got was

476
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Bear with me

477
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:03,232
I found out the mister as his sister-in-law was a math teacher at Woodlawn back in 1999 when all this happened

478
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,304
He was her student she said

479
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
An excellent student top-of-the-line

480
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,448
But you didn't think this your ass knew anything about the crime before you found the body

481
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
She put her husband on the phone Mistresses younger half-brother

482
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,616
And he said you know what's crazy I used to live next door to the kid that did it

483
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
That's back when I was 9 or 10

484
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
Is it used to throw the football around with him anyway you seem like a nice kid

485
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,832
Again he said that his brother stumbled on the body by axe

486
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Menopause

487
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Chuckled and said

488
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,440
I think he was running through the woods

489
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Streaking

490
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
That's how you found it

491
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,328
I told him that apparently had stopped to take a pee he said

492
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
That's possible to

493
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
Mr s is telling the truth

494
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,848
After all why would a guy who's been in trouble repeatedly for indecent exposure

495
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Take out a dead girl

496
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,224
But inevitably inviting more police contact to rain down upon him

497
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:04,160
Mr. s wasn't the detectives only lead in this case

498
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
We're also looking at the boyfriend

499
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,304
Exactly their suspicions about an on start to percolate

500
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Have an educated guess

501
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:19,008
