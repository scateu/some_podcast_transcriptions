How do you how do you manipulate an entire country to get a

An enlisted Soldier home

15
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
Previously

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm cereal how can I get into Afghanistan

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,960
How can I get to Paxton I get my bag.

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:47,360
Are greater bureaucracy is telling the families to just shut up and waved us the Pakistani Armed Forces

19
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Think I can get that done for you but he really likes Johnnie Walker Black Label

From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
I'm Sarah Koenig

24
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
May 31st 2014

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,432
Sabo gets picked up by Special Operations team in Afghanistan

26
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
He's quickly pulled onto a

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,064
Leaving the ground like that

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
We space suddenly all around him

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
After 5 years of being locked in rooms

30
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
He said it was like Crossing in Abyss

31
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,840
When they landed at a nearby base bow wanted to communicate with these guys who rescued him

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
You couldn't talk yet

33
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
He hadn't spoken sentences

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,472
Has much less had a conversation in so long

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
He says you can think of the words

36
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
But he couldn't make them come out of his

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
What I ended up doing was asking for something real and at first thing I asked him was

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,600
Intel

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,976
They got me onto the plane

40
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
On the plane with the rest of the team

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Background

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
And that was the last I saw them

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
I did mention

44
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,528
Wanted to say thank you and the other people around at the time

45
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,976
We got to get you some food in you and all that you know and I didn't want to

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,496
At that moment a military transport plane was standing by a Guantanamo Bay

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
Waiting to take 5 Taliban guys to Qatar

48
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
5 years worth of machination

49
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,200
High Hopes and false starts and politicking at secret meetings

50
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
Had gone into getting bow onto that helicopter

51
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,088
And the five Taliban prisoners onto a C-17

52
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,672
Response to this trade back home in the US buried

53
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
But probably the loudest response was

54
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
Can't believe I just did that

55
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
We negotiated with terrorists

56
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
To release some terrorists

57
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
To get back a deserter

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,472
It seems people also had questions in Afghanistan

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Wait what was all of this about

60
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Did they really just give up

61
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,920
Five leaders of the Taliban for one American Soldier

62
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
That's Hyder Akbar

63
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
He grew up in the US

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Canales in Kabul

65
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
His father was governor of kunar province

66
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
How does a friend of This American Life he's done some stories for us

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
Spider was in Afghanistan when the trade happen

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
And he remembers the talk

69
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
The disbelief

70
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
This guy was definitely not if we see a general

71
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
No. She's just a soldier

72
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Really they're going to let go of

73
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
5 there must be something greater at play here

74
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
I was supposed to be something much greater at play here

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
Something as big and Grand

76
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
The plan to end the war

77
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
What happened

78
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
How did this become the solution to getting Bo home

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,887
In 2009 was captured

80
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,215
The war in Afghanistan was going very badly for US troops

81
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
And a struggle was going on inside the Obama Administration

82
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
About what to do about it

83
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,943
The idea the president settled on was fully resource counterinsurgency

84
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,807
Peace talks meaning talking directly to the Taliban about ending the war

85
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
That was not part of the

86
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Not yet

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:48,767
Person who argued the most forcefully for that to change who said we should start talking to the Taliban now

88
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
The Diplomat name Richard Holbrooke

89
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Holbrook had just been appointed a strap

90
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
Special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan

91
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,775
Basically Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had hired him

92
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
To help in the war

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
Holbrook was his legendary negotiator

94
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Huge tenacious Talent

95
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
And also a huge personality

96
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,063
Her Memoir about being Secretary of State Clinton tells a story about how Relentless he was

97
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
I once followed her into a ladies room in Pakistan

98
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
So you can finish making his point

99
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,559
Rub some people in the administration the wrong way including Obama himself

100
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,655
Albert didn't stop lobbying for a political solution to the war

101
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
Well Richard did not think that

102
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
There was

103
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
A military solution

104
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
The war in Afghanistan

105
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,871
Biscotti Martin

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
A journalist and writer

107
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
She's also married to Richard Holbrooke

108
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
Who died in 2010

109
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,831
He did not think that you could

110
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
Just muscle your way to a solution

111
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
General Petraeus

112
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
Felt that doubling down

113
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,655
On the Taliban was the way to go Richard would have 10 second conversations with Petraeus

114
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
And at least the gist of that was

115
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
No

116
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,127
This is not the time for diplomacy and he's deeply

117
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Resented Petraeus to with his friend referring to him repeatedly as his

118
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,135
Richard would Grumble to me since when did the Diplomat become

119
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
The military's wingman

120
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,791
How do you says it wasn't a personal slight Pebblebrook even care about that

121
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
It was a principal

122
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
Keep up the military had to much sway

123
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,447
It was dominating political strategy in these wars

124
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
Vale Nasser also work for Holbrook and a strap off

125
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Does a special advisor

126
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Is a Middle East scholar

127
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,479
Molly Nasser says in Holbrook view the whole military forces diplomacy debate was out of whack

128
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,063
In other words it was General Petraeus you should be holbrook's wingman

129
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Or

130
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
Handmaiden

131
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Military the handmaiden to diplomacy

132
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
And that balance has been lost during the bush years

133
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
And and and that's why I think he believed that that was fundamentally wrong and would find it and we get America into

134
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Greater trouble

135
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,287
Call Brooksville with that you use the military

136
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
To get the Taliban to the table

137
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,895
But the goal is to get them to sign a document

138
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Agreement

139
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
Holbrook is being sidelined this whole time

140
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
People in the administration are trying to get him fired in

141
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Hillary Clinton protected in

142
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,463
To make matters worse Holbrook had a crummy relationship with Hamid Karzai

143
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
Cars I thought Holbrook it undermined

144
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
And the Afghan presidential elections December of 2009

145
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Cuz I was

146
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Entirely wrong

147
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
Around Holbrook isn't so popular

148
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
And neither is the notion of the US sitting down with the Enemy

149
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Taliban

150
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
But it seems the enemy was interested in talking to us

151
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,783
Diplomats in Germany have been meeting with a 30-something Afghan guy

152
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
It was close to miloma

153
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
The Taliban leader

154
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
His name was Taya Baga

155
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
Back in Washington they didn't say his name out loud though

156
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
These two codename

157
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
A-Rod

158
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Holbrook was a baseball fan

159
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,191
Yes A-Rod was a very familiar

160
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
A meeting with A-Rod would be risky

161
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,311
Turn off the guys for real whether you're being played

162
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Neither side knows

163
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
Holbrook wanted to try it

164
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,223
He took it to Hillary Clinton who was skeptical but gave the go-ahead

165
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,831
For a first face-to-face meeting between the Taliban and the United States government

166
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Ways to be just outside Munich right after Thanksgiving

167
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
2010

168
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
And it was to be secret

169
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
Paladin insisted it

170
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
A secret or else they walk

171
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Pakistan didn't know the British didn't know

172
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Do people in the US government now

173
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
Two people the Taliban new

174
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,311
They met in a small village in a safe house run by German intelligence

175
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,919
Although Thai about guy had one Western suits in his earlier meetings with the Germans

176
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
At this meeting he wore traditional Afghan clothes

177
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
White tunic

178
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,135
Open by reading a formal propagandistic statement he knew the Americans wouldn't like

179
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Americans don't have a set agenda

180
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Are mostly there to listen

181
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,839
Weren't talking terms the US did have some non-negotiables

182
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
We wanted the Taliban to stop fighting

183
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Break with Al-Qaeda

184
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
And support the Afghan Constitution

185
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Including rice in there for women and girls

186
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
That was especially important to Hillary Clinton

187
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,967
The big goal was to get the Taliban to start talking to the cars I govern

188
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
Daddy has the state department put it

189
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,623
Afghans talking to other Afghans about the future of Afghanistan

190
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
So we could get out of the room

191
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
The Taliban wanted a few things too

192
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
They wanted the US to distinguish between them and Al-Qaeda take their names off a un sanctions list

193
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Paris

194
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,983
They wanted a political office outside of Pakistan they wanted it in Doha

195
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
And they wanted their prisoners

196
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
And that's where boat comes in

197
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,431
By that time the haqqanis have been holding him for almost a year-and-a-half

198
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
Now at this meeting his fate

199
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
Becomes tied to the fate of the peace process in Afghanistan

200
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
If us hands over some Taliban prisoners

201
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
They'll hand over the American Soldier

202
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
What would be part of water called confidence-building measures

203
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
That would pave the way for substantiv

204
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Peace talks

205
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191
The Americans weren't allowed to call it a prisoner exchange by the way

206
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
I had to call it a mutual release

207
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
Sobo is part of the discussion

208
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
That is not the point of these talks

209
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Not the Crux of any

210
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
It's pretty clear when I've asked diplomats and State Department officials about it

211
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Like a line item

212
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
An important line item

213
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
The line-item nonetheless

214
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,607
I've heard and read a number of different accounts now about what the Taliban initially asked for in exchange for Bo

215
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,471
One source told me it was always five particular guys at gitmo the Taliban wanted

216
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Another source

217
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
Who was at the meeting

218
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
Tell me that it first it was a simpler to man

219
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
4 Taliban prisoners held at Bagram

220
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
In Afghanistan

221
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
Cuyahoga turned us down for an interview

222
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,063
So I haven't been able to definitively pin this down

223
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,927
In any case when the Munich meeting was over the Americans

224
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
A contingent from the White House

225
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
State Department

226
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Defy home

227
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Report back to their bosses

228
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Thumbs up

229
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
It's on

230
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,447
Holbrook Dr. To the airport to meet his guy he's so eager to hear how it went

231
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
Just a couple of weeks later

232
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Holbrook.

233
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,639
He was at work when his aorta ruptured is rushed to the hospital for surgery

234
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Put on December 13th 2010

235
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
She died

236
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
Just a pause here for a minute

237
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,855
A bunch of people I talk to for the story we're sad about holbrook's death

238
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Just for him

239
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
The Frack Anniston

240
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,255
They have this feeling that maybe if Holbrook hadn't died when he did

241
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
The talks with the Taliban could have worked out differently

242
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
That we wouldn't still be in this mess of War

243
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Hayes Valley Nasser

244
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,543
Holbrook was the only I think Statesmen at that time in the United States who was willing

245
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
To take the risk of owning reconcile

246
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
That's that wasn't afraid of it wasn't afraid of it

247
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,807
He advocated what was a very very unpopular and and risky

248
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
At position

249
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
I don't think anybody else was willing to do it after

250
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Nobody stood up and said

251
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
I'm not mister reconciliation I'm now the champion

252
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
And the irony of it was that

253
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
You know he was being

254
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
So much effort was being put on marginalized

255
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,103
A dad that that that you know when you actually died

256
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
We realized

257
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
You know how much was he actually caring

258
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
And how important

259
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
Right after Holbrook dies

260
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,135
That's when political reconciliation with the Taliban officially becomes us strategy

261
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,183
In February of 2011

262
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,999
Hillary Clinton gives a speech in honor of Holbrook

263
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Actually

264
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,887
Which for the first time an American official speaks out loud in public about talking peace with

265
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
The Taliban

266
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
Still many people in the government aren't happy about it

267
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,871
Adversary that can be as brutal as the Taliban

268
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Sounds

269
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Distasteful

270
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Even

271
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Animash

272
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
And diplomacy would be

273
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
A lot easier

274
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
If we only had to talk to our friends

275
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
But that is not how one makes

276
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Peace

277
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
Where was the original Vision after Munich

278
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Over the next 6 months

279
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
Everyone would agree to terms on the confidence-building measures

280
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
The office would happen trade including Bo what happened and then the goal was by December

281
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
7-Eleven at an International Conference plan in Bonn Germany cars I would be there and the talks Afghan to f

282
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Afghan would be underway

283
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Such an orderly vision

284
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
Instead what happens is

285
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
Football

286
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Years of fits and starts

287
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:57,119
4 people in the diplomacy business the ping pong and trajectory of these taxes probably familiar

288
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:02,495
But to me as I was trying to figure out what happened with bow and his connection to these meetings with the Taliban

289
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
I just had no idea it would look like this

290
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,151
And I'm not going to take you through every step because we'd be here all week

291
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
But I just want to point out some of the moments of like only because they really bring home

292
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
How fraught and fragile diplomacy can be

293
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,207
So after Munich there's this brief moment of

294
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Hopefulness

295
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
How many cars I had created a high peace Council

296
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
In anticipation of impending peace

297
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,191
The US had a couple more meetings with Ty abaga

298
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
And then

299
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Stagnation

300
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Nothing is fine

301
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Nothing is moving

302
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Washington is wearing

303
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Dithering

304
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
Michael Steiner was the S trap

305
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Germany at the time

306
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
Heat help set up the US Taliban talks in the

307
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,367
He says after Munich it was like the motor of the whole process

308
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Sputtered

309
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Time

310
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Enormous

311
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
Precious time after 1

312
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
With every last month

313
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
Ade prospectus to get

314
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
The situation here

315
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Becomes more difficult

316
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
No

317
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
It took so damn long

318
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
I needed to show progress to his bosses

319
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
The Taliban are getting antsy

320
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,575
In addition for tabaga it's no easy thing for him to get to these meetings

321
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
In secret

322
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
He worried understandably that his life might be in danger

323
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Became public you was talkin to the US

324
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Factions inside the Taliban didn't want peace

325
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
And no one had consulted Pakistan about any of this

326
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
Pakistan had long wanted to be a player and NEP

327
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:41,055
Karzai was perpetually worried that the US and Pakistan were up to something behind his back

328
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
It all had to stay quiet

329
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,967
2011 Ambassador Mark Grossman replaced Holbrook is Ezra

330
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,831
What was supposed to be secret it would have been better if it is

331
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Been quiet

332
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,415
That as I as I know you know from doing your research

333
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,487
People just talk and talk and talk

334
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
They did

335
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
We suffered a lot of leaks from

336
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Washington and also

337
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
And also from Cabo

338
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
And why well because you know it wasn't the most popular thing in the world to be doing

339
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Result in May of 2011 The Washington Post and Der Spiegel in German

340
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Post reported that the talks were happening and for the first time they named Cuyahoga the Taliban

341
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,343
Man walked away from the talks

342
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,671
Clinton rushed to Islamabad to smooth things over with Pakistan

343
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
Another state department official pleaded Doha to ask the Cuttery is to please please ask the Taliban to come back

344
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Which a few months later they did

345
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,239
According to Michael Steiner the leaks meant the Taliban now had to Dig Inn on their demands

346
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,567
To reassure their own people they weren't selling out to the America

347
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Price for the continuation

348
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Of the process

349
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Fire

350
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
Because the demand beckemeyer

351
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Aunt

352
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
If you would have acted earlier

353
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Could have been

354
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
To be paid

355
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,375
Steiner didn't specify but I believe he's talking about the gitmo detainees

356
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
The Taliban now fixed on that demand

357
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
That made things harder

358
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Because getting prisoners out of gitmo

359
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
NE prison

360
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
Just ask President Obama

361
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
That's not easy

362
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Are laws about it

363
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,223
You have to tell Congress you have to get the Secretary of Defense to sign off on it

364
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:29,599
Someone in the office at the time told me when they discuss it at meetings the defense department just

365
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
Really really really

366
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
Opposed transferring anybody out of Guantanamo

367
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,303
Big picture Mark Grossman schools were the same as Holbrook

368
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
To create a stable Afghanistan inside a stable region

369
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
I need a plan

370
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
Series of international conferences and meetings

371
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
To get other countries to commit money and support

372
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,871
To help not only end the war in Afghanistan but sustained a piece

373
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
Explain all of this

374
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
The tie bar go when they finally met

375
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
In what were

376
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
What did he want

377
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Like what what became clear to you was like

378
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
Why he was there

379
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
They wanted their prisoners out of Guantanamo

380
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,631
Grossman's at one point they did try to offer Ty about got prisoners from Bagram

381
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
But that was a no-go

382
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:21,311
The reporter David road that they tried to offer up for different Taliban guys from gitmo lesser figure tutorial

383
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,383
I've been cleared for transfer but that was also rejected

384
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,199
Calvin wanted these Five Guys

385
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
This point in the middle of 2011 there were 17 Afghans in Guantanamo

386
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,743
All of them accused of being tied to the Taliban or two terrorist groups

387
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,839
So why was Tyga asking for these 5 back

388
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Can exchange for battle

389
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
You look especially two of the big he's on the list

390
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
Does a mullah Fazal an oriole and Nori

391
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,407
What happened with them is actually a really interesting window into what was going on with the war right in the beginning

392
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
2001

393
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,991
Because this is a surprise to me

394
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,087
About time late 2001 some Taliban commanders surrender

395
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,135
So there's this opportunity

396
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
People argue that we blew it it was a big missed opportunity

397
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
To get the Taliban to stop fighting

398
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
That we could have swooped in when they were weakest

399
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Contain them

400
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
A piece

401
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,471
Another words all the things we'd still be struggling to do a decade-and-a-half later

402
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
I talked to Carlotta Gall about these guys

403
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
Fazal Inori coladas reporter for the New York Times

404
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,479
And she arrived in Afghanistan just a couple of weeks after the US started bombing

405
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
The Taliban regime was unraveling and in the north where Colorado was

406
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
Hundreds of Taliban and Al-Qaeda Fighters had just been trapped

407
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
In the city of condos

408
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
Jordan newspaper story about what happened next

409
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
But never got published

410
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
So much else was going on that in

411
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,191
In retrospect what you saw with a singular moment in the war

412
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
I talked to Carlotta over Skype

413
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
Shoes at our office in Tunis she's in North Africa

414
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Correspondent now

415
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
The sound isn't great

416
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,919
But you told me the story of what she saw

417
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
She said she was up north

418
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
This big mud for it

419
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
Where General dostum also was

420
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
Dustin was his Infamous Commander

421
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
Who was fighting the Taliban

422
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
And the US was supporting him

423
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
So Dustin fair at this fort

424
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
And he he received the delegation of

425
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Taliban

426
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:25,215
He wanted to surrender and it was amazing we will bunch of us reporters with waiting that all day and Sunday

427
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Lisa

428
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,799
Lancome list of pickups

429
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Surprise

430
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
Didn't sweep into the

431
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:39,551
Into this mod World Fort late at night in the dark and they will you know

432
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,927
Fotos de Raul Taliban they were in mining these big guns on the back of that pick up Sunday

433
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,511
Swept in new pretty scary but actually didn't come in

434
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,095
222 Logan to surrender to Dustin

435
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
Moana father was the leader

436
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Soma lofaso

437
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
Anuria Lenora it was with him

438
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,567
And these are two of the guys that good decade later

439
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
The Taliban would ask us to release

440
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
In exchange for Bo

441
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,991
Carlotta says noriel anureet had a reputation as someone you could reason with

442
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Music quieter guidance

443
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
A provincial governor

444
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,416
But fossil kaleido said he was one of the most feared men in the land

445
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,232
He was this this hideous

446
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,424
Operational commander who had a string of massacres to his name and people up there in the north with her

447
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,496
These guys

448
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
And he

449
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
You know you would be telling me we'll weeks I've been there a week or seven people are saying this is the line

450
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
Who would

451
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,784
Shoving fingers are people's nostrils and

452
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
To push the head back and then slit their throats he was

453
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:51,488
It was Beauty I would say he was the two things of many war crimes and

454
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,632
He was none too committed massacres all the lord of the northern tribes as the Taliban soldiers

455
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Surprise

456
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
And here he is

457
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Maleficent

458
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Inori and others

459
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
They're surrendering

460
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,408
They head into this meeting with Dustin there Americans in the room to CIA probably

461
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,552
Colada's waiting outside midnight

462
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm depressed and short grumpy looking

463
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,328
Dustin made him Bay City say on camera that you know the fight so

464
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,728
He did not shoot a text say the word surrender but he basically said we will give up on weapons on

465
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
And the fighting incredible moment to see many of us

466
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,992
We're up there and not much of it go to the papers that time but

467
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
It was

468
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
The only public surrender of

469
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
The Taliban forces

470
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:59,328
Promises in the days that followed

471
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Puzzle delivered

472
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,960
Hundreds of his Fighters Taliban and also foreign Fighters and pakistanis

473
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
Can streaming in and handed over their weapons

474
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:12,640
Apparently the understanding was that fossils Fighters would be allowed safe passage back to where they came from

475
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:19,040
But it didn't happen instead many of them got killed at a now-infamous prison Uprising which lasted for days

476
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,624
Hundreds more got packed up in container trucks in asphyxiated

477
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
Whole other grizzley chain of events

478
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,072
As for fossil and Nori Justin kept them under house arrest for a while his own rather fancy guest house

479
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,632
But eventually he gave them up to the Americans

480
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,008
What we learned later was saying they were taken to one of the warships

481
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
In the Gulf I think

482
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:46,176
As quite a few PS4 at that time and then they later ended up in Guantanamo

483
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,784
They were in fact in that group of first arrivals at Guantanamo

484
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
On January 11th 2002

485
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
You seen the pictures from that day

486
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Men on their knees

487
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,184
Orange jumpsuits barbed wire

488
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
As for the other guys on tabaka's list

489
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
They all seem to have been in contact with

490
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
If not cooperating with

491
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
Either the us or the Karzai government

492
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
When they were arrested and sent to Guantanamo

493
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,032
When was the Taliban is Deputy intelligence chief

494
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
I was at a meeting with CIA agent

495
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
That's when he was grabbed

496
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,688
And rolled up in a carpet right away like that in broad daylight

497
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,016
Another was a former Taliban interior minister

498
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
Hidden contacts

499
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,576
The Karzai about a job

500
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
And one was meeting an American

501
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
At the airport when he got a rash

502
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
So those are the five

503
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
Actually there was one other guy the Taliban wanted back

504
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
But he died at Guantanamo

505
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:39,168
Get a heart attack after exercising on an elliptical in early 2011

506
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,264
If the Taliban to get these guys out of gitmo

507
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
It would be symbolic and a bunch of ways

508
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
First off it's a hugely morale-boosting message

509
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Their own fighters

510
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Look at the links will go

511
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
How to get our prisoners out

512
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,552
More than that it's a huge Public Relations Act

513
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
The United States

514
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
The highest levels

515
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Would be recognizing them

516
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
The Taliban

517
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
As legitimate organization

518
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,536
Not treating them as a ragtag band of terrorists

519
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm finally to them it's a victory for their understanding of Justice in this one

520
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,984
Since most of these guys say they weren't exactly fighting with America

521
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
When they were captured in the first place

522
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
Mufasa himself explains this line of

523
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,408
Is Military Tribunal at Guantanamo

524
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
He tells the tribunal about the meeting with dostum

525
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
Reporters

526
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
Derek ammerman in journalist

527
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,208
Meaning dostum he says there's 25 year war between person-to-person Village by Village City by City

528
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,768
Province by province and tribe against tribe

529
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:42,400
If you think this is crime than every single person in Afghanistan should be in prison or bring them here

530
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,288
I never ever fought against the new government I never fought against America and I didn't do anything wrong against

531
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
And why am I an enemy combatant

532
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,224
It does seem true that fossil was a brutal fighter

533
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
Powerful commander and possibly a war criminal

534
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,624
But you can argue the same is true of General dostum

535
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,928
Dustin has also been accused of war crimes

536
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,256
Is now first vice president of Afghanistan

537
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
Our Ally

538
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,376
And one last thing on this in 2001

539
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,472
Hamid Karzai had come to an agreement with Taliban commanders in the south

540
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,312
The Taliban with hand over control of four provinces peacefully

541
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
And in return they did amnesty

542
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
But the US said no you can't do that

543
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Wouldn't let it happen

544
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,808
Instead we proclaimed by a secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld

545
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
That because the Taliban harbored Osama Bin Laden we would be treating them the same way we treated International terrorist

546
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,768
We do not give amnesty to terrorists

547
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
We do not negotiate with her

548
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
We hunt them down

549
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:53,568
The talks with the Taliban suffered so many setbacks over the years it's hard to even contain them all in

550
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,664
I had so many factors were in play in so many different countries

551
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,760
Some of the setbacks are pointed an intentional elytra

552
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:08,160
Some setbacks for immutable a simple case of bad timing and some setbacks were so human

553
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
Old fashioned screw-ups

554
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,816
Most obvious assault on the tops came in September of 2011

555
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:19,168
A guy came to the door of former Afghan president Brandon Rabbani

556
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:25,056
Rabbani was heading Afghanistan's High peace Council this guy said he had a message from the Taliban

557
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Unglue app for Bonnie's house

558
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,176
Rabbani was killed as were four others from the council

559
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,992
Barney's assistant masoom stanekzai

560
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Was badly injured

561
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,392
No one took responsibility for the attack but many people suspected Pakistan was behind it

562
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
Mark Roseman says losing the help of those guys and especially having Statics II out of commission for so many months

563
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
Was terrible

564
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,960
We talked about Afghans talking other Afghans about future Afghanistan they were the Afghans

565
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Yeah

566
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
They they would have been doing this work

567
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
And whoever did this

568
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384
It was a very

569
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
It was a very strategic move

570
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:11,136
Rabbani assassination happened a couple months before the big international meeting and bond set for December 2000

571
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,464
11 the one that a year earlier had been something of a Finish Line

572
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,792
Now it felt like they were back to square one

573
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
And then a year-and-a-half later

574
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Screw up

575
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
With some very bad results

576
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
Mid-2013 have been in captivity for 4 years

577
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
By then

578
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,872
After various arm-twisting in Washington and in Kabul and a Doha

579
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,200
It looks as if they really might be able to crank up the talks again

580
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Things have shifted

581
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
Instead of the prisoner exchange first

582
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
They're going to do an office

583
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
The Taliban wanted in office

584
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
In Doha

585
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
As a home base for political

586
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
It would show they were legitimate political actor

587
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,072
The office had become Issue Number 1 for the

588
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
And cars I was naturally cautious

589
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
About this

590
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
There's a new s Rap by now Ambassador James Dobbins

591
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
He's working with Karzai and Woodcutter

592
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
Who's the intermediary

593
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,688
Cautious is probably an understatement for cars on this day

594
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
He doesn't trust us

595
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,552
He doesn't trust our stated objectives in Afghanistan are for real

596
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,344
He's worried we're trying to cut him out of the

597
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
The talks make a side deal with

598
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
Pakistan maybe he obviously doesn't trust package

599
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,304
He thinks maybe this whole office deal is a Pakistani orchestrated plot

600
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
To get recognition for the Taliban

601
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,984
He's worried Cotter is essentially letting the Taliban set up a shadow government with this Doha office

602
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
So it's shaky to say the least

603
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Car has cooperation here

604
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,176
The United States is trying to make sure everyone abides by the ground rules

605
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
Including the detail

606
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:46,112
The Taliban cannot throw around the words Islamic Emirate in connection with this office very important

607
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
They have to call it something like

608
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
The political office of the Taliban movement

609
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:57,120
Not as representation of the Islamic Emirate which was what they

610
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Call

611
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:03,776
Their government so they shouldn't present themselves in a fact as an alternative government

612
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Afghanistan

613
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,968
So everyone's agreeing to the starter ground rules the Assumption was that

614
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,504
In June

615
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184
The office would open and we would begin discussions and the detainee exchange would be

616
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
Most likely the first order of business

617
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,840
Meaning the exchange for both would be the first order of business

618
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,656
June 18th the office open

619
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
It's his new pretty elaborate multi-story building

620
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
The wall around it

621
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:41,408
An opening ceremony back in the US the time difference

622
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
Means it's something like three or four in the morning in Washington

623
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:49,088
Jeff Eggers who's in Afghanistan and Pakistan director for the National Security Council

624
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,672
Has David been up all night waiting for the opening on TV

625
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
The first indication that there was a problem with the flag

626
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
The flag

627
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
Of the Islamic Emirate

628
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
They also had a sign outside the

629
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
It said Islamic Emirate

630
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
John Kerry was Secretary of State by then

631
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Within minutes he calls the Emir of Qatar

632
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,848
Remember we're not communicating directly with the Taliban

633
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
The spine is all through the

634
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
Guitarist

635
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,224
So carry presumably impresses on the emir

636
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,040
It's not supposed to say Islamic Emirate

637
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
The one word you can't have on that flag

638
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
On that building

639
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Is Emirate

640
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
We are upset

641
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
It's not what we agreed

642
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
And it's going to Karzai flip his lid

643
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
Exactly what he shared

644
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
Bernie Rubin works in the S rap off

645
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
An expert on Afghanistan and pay

646
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,216
And even hard by Holbrook

647
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,288
He was in the air when this happened flying to Doha

648
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Dubai

649
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
So I got off the plane

650
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
And I seal my Blackberry oh my God

651
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
So I was I went directly to the

652
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Embassy

653
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,576
The flag is lowered out of sight pretty fast

654
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
But the offending sign is still on the outside of the building

655
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Is there all day

656
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,976
And a tomb is still up

657
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,816
Barney decides to go there to try to find someone to take down the sign

658
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
The embassy is short on cars

659
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,168
He gets a ride in some guys private

660
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
Arrived at the Taliban office building they're surrounded by armed

661
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Qatari security

662
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
The whole thing for a while

663
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
So they can figure out who Barney is

664
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
What he wants

665
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,200
But he is not leaving until someone shows up

666
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
With some tools base

667
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
I usually leave till August

668
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,344
Already you stay there and watch them take it down

669
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
And then I took a photograph of the

670
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,952
Wall without the sign

671
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
And we emailed it

672
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,304
To the US Embassy in Kabul only showed at the prison

673
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
But by that time it was too late

674
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
Is Jeff Eggers but all it took was

675
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
You know the Optics

676
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,872
That one flag being thrown in there

677
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,944
To really derail

678
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,760
At that point years of effort

679
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,576
Dobbins and secretary Kerry fly to Doha

680
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,392
Find out if there's any way to salvage the situation

681
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
And to find out why it happened

682
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,024
Dobbins learned is that it seems to be a genuine misunderstanding

683
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,864
The Taliban thought it was fine for them to call themselves whatever they wanted

684
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
The Qatari said that

685
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Discussions

686
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Occurred in 2012 or 11

687
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,896
USS said we don't care what you call yourselves you just have to understand we won't call you that now I don't believe any us officials

688
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Said that

689
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
But the guitar is believed it

690
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,552
And as I say I think it I think it was

691
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,856
Is a Taliban warrant

692
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Trying to

693
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,928
Demonstrate bad faith

694
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,792
They genuinely believed what they were doing would be unexceptionable

695
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
And were I think

696
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
Surprised by the reaction

697
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,216
It all could have been avoided as what they

698
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
Simon says the arrangement had a whiff of amateurishness

699
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,640
It wasn't even being handled formally by the Qatari foreign minister

700
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Davis Kind of B-Team on it

701
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,016
Bernie Rubin says the office agreement kept changing

702
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
To accommodate everyone's concerns

703
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,416
There was never a final document everyone signed off on line by line

704
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
Anyway now

705
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
The towel that have lost faith

706
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
They felt it once

707
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,632
They had been in effect humiliated by having to take down their flag and their sign

708
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
That I couldn't go forward

709
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
With the talks

710
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
So peace talks grind to a halt

711
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,336
I would stay in captivity for another year

712
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,808
And I like simple straightforward people do you want a deal or not

713
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
Naats sami yusuf side the afghan reporter

714
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,208
Sammy interviewed someone high up in the Taliban for us

715
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
We agreed not to say who it is

716
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
This guy told Sammy

717
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
After 4 years

718
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
1/2 years

719
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
Holding bow

720
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,520
They were getting fatigued but it was obvious I believe this was getting too much long did you hear that contain

721
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,408
Echo 2010 or 12 and 13 still nothing was

722
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
Cumming Kaiser result

723
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:06,112
Going to the American is just quiet slow and responding and they told him that we have to bring everything in the knowledge of proper

724
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,672
President Obama and his Nautica

725
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
Easy case

726
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,560
I understand so that's why there was like I'm in the kitchen while getting longer and longer

727
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
In 2013

728
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
The year before but was released

729
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
The Taliban have a lot going on

730
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,520
We would know it for a couple of years but mullah Omar the Taliban leader

731
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,824
Who died in Spring of 2013

732
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,432
Melissa Holguin who was in charge of keeping both her most of his time as a prisoner

733
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
Was killed in a drone strike

734
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,760
In September of 2013

735
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,648
Sammy says he imagines the pakistanis were also pushing the Taliban to settle this prisoner.

736
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
Because they were getting pressure from The Americans

737
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
So they're all those reason

738
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
And

739
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,632
Ford Thunderbird David's I would say it in Pakistani army operation

740
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,240
The Pakistani army was gearing up to launch attacks in waziristan

741
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,288
Against the Pakistani Taliban

742
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
And so people there were on notice

743
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,640
Including the haqqanis for holding bow

744
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
You might want to get out of there

745
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
Before you get killed

746
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,320
But obviously you know the agony people was told that we are going to do application

747
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
So they always be totally abandoned Forest

748
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
All kind of medicines

749
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Objectified

750
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
King Wok on emu

751
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,608
Some of the motel Palestine in Dino in Afghanistan they could couldn't hide it

752
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Cuz American has access to

753
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Anywhere they want

754
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Yeah

755
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Yeah

756
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:33,408
Early in 2014 the Taliban finally let the Americans know

757
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
They're ready to make a deal

758
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
But not on a peace plan

759
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Instead they tell us

760
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,088
If you just want to swap for your prisoner

761
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
We're ready

762
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,952
How is now Cut Loose from the broader talks about reconciliation

763
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
He's free-floating

764
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,280
And it's up to us whether to grab him

765
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
Ultimately the White House would have to make the call

766
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,704
Jeff Eggers was working at the White House as a special assistant to the president for national

767
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Security affairs

768
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Dresses

769
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,544
They took stock of the situation

770
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
And

771
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,640
At around the same time there was

772
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
You have some sense that

773
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
We were

774
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:15,136
We were only going to lose opportunities to recover Bergdahl the the more the resources

775
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,720
The Western Coalition resources in Afghanistan decline

776
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,328
We're about to start withdrawing our troops transitioning out of there

777
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,912
This isn't going to get any easier to get him back

778
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,800
The United States and ask for proof of Life video of bow and in January it arrived

779
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,616
I haven't seen it but I've talked to a few people who have

780
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,920
And they said don't look to be in bad shape

781
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Is movements for strange

782
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
The speech was incoherent

783
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
People told me it was alarming

784
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,136
Edgar says the White House wasn't wearing any other options

785
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
Forbetterforworse

786
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,488
And they worried but wasn't going to last in captivity

787
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
And the US was getting out of Afghanistan

788
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,680
It was that it was a combination of those factors that gave rise to the idea that

789
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
You could

790
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
You could

791
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Salvage

792
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Those two line items

793
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
The two line items being

794
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,128
We got go back

795
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
Big at the 5 Guantanamo prisoners back

796
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
Those two line items

797
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
In the original

798
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
Confidence-building

799
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
Camphor for catalyzing

800
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
The political process

801
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
As a standalone pair

802
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
And

803
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,744
But at what once you had 2014

804
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
There is no water

805
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Agreement

806
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
It's just

807
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
It's just the trade

808
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,496
Right well I wouldn't put it that way I would say that the broader agreement was

809
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
Sitting up on a Shelf

810
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
Gathering dust

811
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Something was better than nothing

812
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:47,808
Maybe maybe one day someone would take down the rest of the big beautiful agreement to make p

813
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
And dusted off

814
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,672
And there be two fewer line items to argue about

815
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,816
Turn off last month before but was released

816
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
Has the Taliban started to treat him better

817
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,936
They fed him better more regularly

818
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
I got this little treadmill

819
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Gain some strength

820
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
He'd already gotten a toothbrush

821
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,592
He said he'd ask for during a video taping

822
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
Banana gave him some science book

823
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
She also asked for

824
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,736
He said they gave him college-level physics and chemistry books

825
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:23,392
Us officials including Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel start making trips back and forth to Qatar

826
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
We're not negotiating with Ty about anymore

827
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
Or anyone else from the Taliban about it directly

828
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,328
These aren't talks

829
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
The transaction

830
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
And the qataris are the brokers

831
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
We Droppin agreement with the

832
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:42,336
Guitar is about how they'd monitor the five Taliban were supposed to stay in Qatar for a year

833
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,432
There's this video I watched a few times on YouTube

834
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Treme 26

835
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
2014

836
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Memorial Day

837
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,320
Chuck Hagel is visiting Arlington National Cemetery

838
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Hi guys

839
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
Vietnam War veteran

840
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Activists

841
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Ipawn Mia cases

842
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,792
Confronts Hagel about bow we're getting out of

843
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
I need to get him home

844
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
July

845
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912
He says please sir you got to bring him home

846
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,496
Eagle stands there patiently awkwardly in the Sun

847
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Turn the guy out

848
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:17,152
Can't say anything except

849
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,992
The next day where comes back from the dod legal counsel

850
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
The guy hey go ahead travel to Qatar with

851
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
He says

852
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
We have a deal

853
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,904
Meaning the Taliban holding bow are good to go

854
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
Everything about this transfer was top secret

855
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
If it got out they were Ditka

856
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Fall Apart

857
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Somebody could get killed

858
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
On May 29th

859
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Delegation

860
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:44,288
5 people from Qatar comes to Guantanamo to ask with the Taliban guys back to Doha

861
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,360
The qataris talked to each of the Taliban guys

862
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
And then

863
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
A weight

864
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,736
The deal was that the US wouldn't release them

865
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
Until bow was in US

866
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
But the Taliban holding bow are taking much

867
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
Longer than anybody enter

868
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
8 hours later they realize this is not

869
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Happening

870
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,816
At the house the Cutterys in nearby Naval Hotel

871
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,144
Taliban guys they put in a kind of holding cell near the airport

872
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
This is not supposed to have

873
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,520
Carol Rosenberg reporter from the Miami Herald

874
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
I've been looking out for the Taliban trade

875
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,848
4 years

876
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
Carol's been covering Guantanamo since the day it opened

877
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
She watched three of these Taliban guys arrive there

878
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
Monday 1

879
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,088
Carol was down at Guantanamo at the end of May

880
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
She said she noticed these big

881
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
Planes 2 C-17

882
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
Across the water from where she was

883
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
She can just make them out

884
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:42,144
Squinting across the bay seeing you know the airframes of

885
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,216
C-17s on the airstrip

886
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,032
I'm like why doesn't it leave

887
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
Another day goes by

888
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,711
The plans are still sitting there

889
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
Now it's May 30th

890
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,575
Girls asking people to base what is going on with these plans

891
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
They're saying stuff like

892
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:08,255
C-17

893
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,839
Finally the morning of Saturday May 31st

894
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
The US gets word

895
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
The plane leaves for Doha

896
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
On it are the qataris

897
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
The Taliban prisoners

898
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
And US security personnel

899
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,663
According to a congressional investigation when they were planning to transfer

900
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,503
Defense Department officials said he thought the US security would be a good idea

901
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,319
Because they're concerned about quote one of the knucklehead

902
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
Trying something

903
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,047
Jim Dobbin said to me about the trade

904
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
It wasn't a disaster

905
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
And it wasn't a brilliant achievement

906
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
It was a successful and necessary operation

907
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
It wasn't going to end the war

908
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Which of course is disappointing

909
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,847
And also makes the steel hard to assess

910
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,967
You can easily say wow the Taliban really got a lot of bang for their Buck on this

911
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,087
You look back at the things they wanted at that first Munich meeting in 2010

912
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Well

913
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,975
They got some of their names off the UN sanctions list

914
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,815
Their office isn't official but there is that building in Doha

915
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
And they got their prisoners back

916
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
From get mono last

917
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
And all they gave up with bow

918
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
I got a plan to give up all along

919
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,799
Gatherer tired of holding

920
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,359
On Alitalia victory

921
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,759
On the other hand we had to get bow back somehow nothing else had worked and there was no way the end

922
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,855
United States government was going to let an American Soldier died in captivity

923
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,159
Another country's trade all the time

924
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,183
Israel say

925
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,999
Dolce prisoners even for the remains of one of their Soldier

926
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,095
And they're now five fewer prisoners at Guantanamo

927
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
President Obama would like to close Guantanamo

928
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,847
Carol Rosenberg what are the things she pointed out was at these 5 Taliban guys hadn't had Intel van

929
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
Value for a long time Osama Bin Laden was already dead and also as prisoners they didn't do any

930
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,647
The things you sometimes hear about from getting officials they weren't hunger-striking or gathering up their bodily fluids and cup

931
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Cops and flinging it at the guards

932
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,023
The exception of one they didn't even challenge their detention in federal court

933
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
So many others

934
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
Detainees have

935
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
These guys didn't none of that

936
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,447
They sat there in communal confinement

937
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
Following the directions

938
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,847
Praying when there was prayer time eating when it was food time

939
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,967
Sitting there sort of you know when I don't want to like boot up but you know sitting there

940
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:42,623
Following the rules and not being a problem they were what they would call them here highly compliant

941
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
And to me that sounds like

942
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,487
That's like a p o w Wright

943
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,583
There their they're thinking I'm a prisoner of this war and when

944
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
Did politics change your the war ends

945
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
I'm going to get out of here

946
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
Good afternoon everybody

947
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:05,919
This morning I called Bob and Jani Bergdahl and told them that after nearly five years

948
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
In captivity

949
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,759
Their son Beau is coming home

950
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,575
The day the trade right after lunch

951
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,367
Obama appeared in the Rose Garden

952
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Louis Bo's parents

953
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
He thanked the service members who recovered bow

954
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,303
He noted that the United States is committed to winding down this war

955
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
And closing gitmo

956
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655
And he gave a shout-out to the erstwhile peace talks

957
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
Going forward

958
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,031
The United States will continue to support an afghan-led process of reconciliation

959
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
Which would help

960
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,079
Secure

961
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
A hard-earned peace

962
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
Within a sovereign

963
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,919
And unified Afghanistan

964
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:42,271
Bob and Jani Bergdahl had been reassured many times over the

965
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
Years by many people

966
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
Some very high up people

967
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
Military and a pentagon

968
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
Triple came home

969
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
You wouldn't face serious charges

970
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
What time with the Taliban would be punishment enough

971
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,839
They probably didn't need to consult a military law

972
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
The bird I'll start that day in the Rose Garden

973
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
It was over

974
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,727
Mission accomplished

975
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,263

What

1007
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,479
President Obama did was

1008
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
It took a lot of

1009
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:55,391
A lot of intestinal fortitude to make that decision

1010
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
