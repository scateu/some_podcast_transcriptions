I'm cereal

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,584
Gentlemanly is a good where he is very much a gentleman

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,496
Do you think he's lying

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,384
And then all the sudden he shows up in his uniform

16
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Where can I find WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week I'm sorry.

17
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,848
I think the following will likely be a question I pose court-martial

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Did the Army screw up

19
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,456
By accepting Bow by deploying him to Afghanistan

20
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,296
Just remind you but was separated from the Coast Guard

21
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,320
In 2006

22
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,160
After he became overwhelmed and had a breakdown during basic training

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,232
The Army in order to enlist him 2 years later

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
Would have to waive its usual standard

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
It's what you did

26
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,656
So the question actually is did the Army Recruiting process work like it was supposed to

27
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
Separation from the Coast Guard wasn't labeled a psych discharge on paper

28
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
But that's essentially what it was

29
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
So did the Army miss something

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
We talked to a retired army psychiatrist

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Dr. elspeth Cameron Ritchie

32
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,624
Who's deployed all over to his chief of forensic psychiatry and also of inpatient Psychiatry at Walter Reed

33
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
And she was Psychiatry consultant to the Army Surgeon General

34
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
The top mental health advocacy position in the army

35
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
Dr. Ritchie's assessment of how all this went down with bow

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
She got the whole thing sounded pretty normal

37
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Like standard practice

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,056
Attack of the army didn't have all the details about bows hospitalization in the Coast Guard

39
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Not uncommon

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
She said getting access to more detailed medical information especially between branches of the military

41
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,344
Coast Guard and army was hard because the military's Network system wasn't so hot

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
Information sharing was incomplete

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
But she also didn't feel like anything we told her about those Coast Guard situation would have been disqualifying

44
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
Even if the Army had known

45
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,448
Had sent him for a mental health evaluation as the Coast Guard doctor recommended

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
Even if o had been assessed by saying Army psychiatrist dr. Ritchie said it probably would have been one session

47
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,456
And unless you showed obvious outward signs of psychosis or something like that

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,576
You're really depending on the potential recruit to self-report any psychological problems

49
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,416
So it's quite possible but would have been okayed regardless

50
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
At the end of the day doctor what she told us

51
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,608
The best assessment for weather someone's going to make it in the Army doesn't happen in the recruitment office anyway

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,192
What happens during the sustained high pressure test of basic training

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
And bow did really well in Army basic

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
That's one View

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Now for a second opinion

56
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Tumblr

57
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
The ball is dropped

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
This is dr. Michael valdovinos

59
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
He's a clinical psychologist

60
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
Is in the Air Force for about seven and a half years

61
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,440
Any worked in the Seer program which teaches survival evasion resistance and Escape

62
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
He knows Bo

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
Has led this year psych team

64
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
It helps reintegrate Bell right after his rescue

65
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,656
Those first few weeks when bow is at the hospital in Germany

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Two things

67
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,288
Jalapenos has permission from bow to talk to me about their conversations

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
And also he was not officially Bose doctor

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
The job was to reintegrate them not diagnosing or anything

70
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
He never even saw both medical record back

71
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,320
He's not breaking any doctor patient confidentiality

72
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
All three things I guess the last being both of you knows cares about bow

73
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,488
Who's not just passionate on the question of what happens to him

74
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
Is that the Army recruiter should have looked harder at both situation should have asked more questions before

75
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Signing him up

76
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,543
Even if the recruiter didn't have the particulars of Bose Coast Guard discharge in front of them

77
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
Or information about Bose hospitalization

78
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,991
He says the mere fact that Billy been separated at all from a branch of the military begged more scrutiny

79
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
Medieval bit more concerned about that

80
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
What is taking it may be a few steps further to say hey

81
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,215
Because what is separation like most house you just on its face

82
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
Is it for whatever reason this person couldn't hack it in basic training

83
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,431
Any Army recruiter's job is to send that potential recruit straight back into basic training

84
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,015
In both cases the same situation he washed out of two years earlier

85
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Finally told him

86
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
At the recruiter did know about his problems in the Coast Guard

87
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
Because Beau says he told the recruiter

88
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
Who said he was afraid not to

89
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
Time since you know not a good idea to keep things from the government

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,727
No one that is

91
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
So you broke down training and

92
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
What's a hospital

93
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,223
As part of his application bow did a test

94
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,575
That he had not consulted with a behavioral health care provider in the last 7 years

95
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
General doll ask him about that

96
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,743
Listen to Coast Guard treatment wouldn't have triggered the idea of Consulting a psychologist

97
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
I found that to be consistent with those other paper

98
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,727
Since I'm his medical history form bochek yes to the question of whether he'd ever received Counseling of any type

99
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
He said he was thinking of canceling he had when he was 10 years old

100
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
General. Concluded that the Army recruiter

101
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
On paper

102
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Did everything he was supposed

103
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
Read the codes all the regulations

104
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Put in a footnote

105
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
Y'all seem to agree that this system isn't good enough

106
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,951
Situation probably should have been looked at more carefully

107
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,279
He wrote that when you're deciding whether to reenlist someone

108
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,607
Few things are more relevant than a prior separation

109
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,239
Seattle quotes it seems inadequate that we would rely on an interview an applicant statement

110
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Explain the details of prior service

111
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
And not review the separation action

112
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Where was bows head at the

113
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
This time

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
It's funny once you hear how both thought about the military

115
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Why you want to join

116
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,231
Probably it does help explain why he decided to walk off his post

117
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
Did you did you

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
Think that you were going to be a career Soldier

119
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
Set my mind to get lost

120
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
World War

121
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Yeah I wanted to be a samurai Soldier

122
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
Right

123
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,863
I wanted to be

124
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,287
I love the idea of just

125
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,383
Basically your hands and that's it

126
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Bruce Lee when he was a kid

127
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Private school

128
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
You watched his movies later read his books Asian Warriors especially Samurai he learned about the Bushido code

129
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,207
Which stresses honor and loyalty and self-sacrifice

130
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
Campbell's childhood bedroom his dad kept a collector set of old army manuals way up high in the bookshelf that is deadly

131
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
Love military history

132
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Climbed up there and got the books down

133
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
He couldn't read it study the pictures

134
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
So

135
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
But I only option I had was to be

136
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Those ideal Soldier the one from history

137
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,143
Fights for a cause he or she is completely personally committed to

138
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
That Soldier rallies behind military leaders

139
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
That he or she trusts

140
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,103
The modern Soldier turns out to have no choice about those essential aspects of combat

141
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Instead

142
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
He's a brainless private that does whatever the government tells him to do

143
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
Come here go there go fight these people

144
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
He's just a tool

145
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
That's how Bo sauce

146
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,927
I knew this was going to be the case when he signed up

147
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
I sort of knew it

148
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
He thought he could handle that Gulf of meaning

149
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
And I was hoping that I had to deal with everyday

150
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,471
It's like an hour to play the game you have to play by the rules as they were

151
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
Being as they were busy

152
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
This is one of the things about Bo

153
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,319
He wants recognizes that his expectations are unrealistic

154
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
He sees things differently from other people

155
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,743
But at the same time he will fiercely defend his vision of how things should be

156
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
He does not let go

157
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
Especially when it comes to what he saw in Afghanistan

158
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Do you think

159
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,703
What you witnessed and what you were reacting to

160
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Was

161
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
The Army in an especially bad way

162
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Or

163
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Was it just the army

164
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
Meaning of self and kind of

165
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,063
Messed up as it you know in a kind of average weather

166
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
That make any sense

167
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Normal

168
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
Maybe what I was looking at was

169
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,351
Everyday Army however

170
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Welding leads

171
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,967
Regular

172
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,807
What I was looking at was problems when I was looking at was

173
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,463
SimpliSafe

174
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
Marx conclusion about Bell

175
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
After all those months

176
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Talking to him

177
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
He's not a conscientious

178
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:05,087
But he's also not your casual deserter he throws up his hands and just says don't care about any of this out of here

179
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Mark thinks he's the opposite of that

180
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
He's a rare person who will act

181
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,303
Rightly or wrongly it turns out but still he will act according to his principal

182
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:20,703
And his principles are wrapped up with the very institution that so many people now feel he betrayed

183
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,799
The disillusionment of somebody that really believes in the army

184
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Be somebody that

185
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Things that military leadership

186
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Is a

187
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
The sacred position

188
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
He wants the Army to be better

189
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,439
The military is huge for him right in here and resented something

190
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,535
There's got to be a better word than huge but it represented something

191
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Very powerful to him

192
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Even before he joined

193
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
And

194
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
His sense of himself as a man

195
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
To his

196
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Relationship to

197
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
Country to all sorts of

198
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,199
Big identity questions that were floating around for him

199
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
And it's still really important to him

200
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
He still kind of want his

201
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,415
Day of Reckoning with those values

202
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
In a way why he hasn't taken the more

203
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,143
Future all this which would just beat us her to stick your hands out and Save

204
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
Whatever you guys say I like

205
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Guilty gif

206
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
Get me out of here

207
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,383
I think he doesn't want to cross the line

208
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
I'm saying I had no point

209
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
Which is not to say that Beau wants all this

210
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
The tension on a MAO

211
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
He wasn't speaking this big an audience

212
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,719
And by the way he's not asking to be some kind of like Paul Revere he just wanted he didn't

213
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
Phone never wanted

214
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,143
The discussion is happening now write his whole goal was to talk to

215
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,519
Looks like it's inter-family dispute he wanted to talk to people in the military

216
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Yeah

217
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,127
There was actually reporter that was sent to

218
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
It was like embedded or something with his unit that was hanging around there and it's like he pulled the reporter aside and

219
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Sad hey

220
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Get loaded ass this will make a great story

221
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,719
You didn't do that he wanted to be heard within the military so

222
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:24,607
Obviously that didn't happen and obviously he behaved in a way which runs counter to like every single

223
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,215
Military precept ever known since the dawn of time which is he now you don't

224
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
You don't walk away from your from your brother so he's not a great messenger for his mess

225
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,247
But

226
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
I'm walking off like you did

227
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Is it so unthinkable

228
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,143
Did start to see signs that Bo wasn't totally okay

229
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
At the September Hearing in Bose case

230
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
Greg Leatherman Bose weapons squad leader

231
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Testified that at some point he noticed something was up

232
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,967
It started to kind of feel that he wasn't adjusting to the deployment like the rest of the guys were

233
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
Leatherman said he wasn't incredibly alarm

234
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
But he figures he got to say something to one of the higher-ups about it just in case

235
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,207
When did he's on a patrol somewhere southeast of Toronto

236
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
He finds himself sitting next to his first sergeant Pablo Jimenez

237
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,911
And so I told for sergeant that you know I thought that Sergeant Bergdahl should chat with somebody

238
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,055
You know whether be combat stress or a chaplain or even if it were just you know the company Commander just sit down and

239
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
Hey man how's everything going

240
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
Buzz lawyer a Slenderman how him and his responded to his seat

241
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
I'm just going to redo that part of the transcript

242
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Answer

243
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:51,135
First sergeant said that he didn't want to he didn't want one of his guys to tell him what was wrong and his company

244
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,719
That was not my place to tell him if he had problems inside of his company

245
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Question

246
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,095
I think when we interviewed you you had even more colorful language of what he said

247
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Yes sir

248
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Could you tell us that

249
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
Sure

250
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
He said f*** off

251
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
He said shut the f******

252
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,335
No one needs to hear what a f****** E5 has to say about a guy in my company

253
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
And I said

254
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Rodger for sergeant

255
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
News report General Dollar includes a statement from Jimenez who says he doesn't recall this conversation with Letterman or n

256
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Any conversation like that

257
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,743
Show no red flags or emotional problems as far as I could tell

258
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Uncle

259
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,703
Whose friend said from his messages and letters home

260
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
I could tell he wasn't very happy with how things were going in Afghanistan

261
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
In retrospect you can sort of see his thoughts churning

262
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Plans farming

263
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
On June 27th just three days before Bowl left mask

264
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
He wrote a letter to his parents

265
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,367
Venting and when she sounded pretty disgusted with how the Army was operating in Afghanistan

266
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,207
Give me the more loving letter to a girl he was romantically involved with

267
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Group emails

268
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
When was titled who is John Galt

269
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
His friend Chad was on that email

270
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
I saw that was like

271
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Hydrangea

272
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
Okay here we go

273
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
John Galt is a character from Atlas Shrugged

274
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
Very first line of the book who is John Galt

275
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
And after it's about a thousand pages

276
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
Finally learned that John Galt is this genius industrialist who said have single-handedly has shutdown the world economy

277
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
In order to fix it

278
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
He stops the machine

279
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
In the book he finally reveals himself delivering I kid you not 60 page speech laying out his

280
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Awesome me

281
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,119
I rather Ayn rand's philosophy

282
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,239
And honestly just as an exercise you can grab almost any sentence from that John Galt

283
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,055
And apply it to what both ended up doing

284
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Princeton

285
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,687
Call a code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality unquote

286
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
And now it just for kicks

287
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
Stirring save the Bushido code

288
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,135
The part that teaches that it's your duty to try to write a moral wrong

289
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Regardless of whether you'll succeed

290
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
That's maybe a potent cocktail if your bow

291
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
Here's a text to BOS June 27th email

292
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
It is not the being of value who fails the

293
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
The system is the system that has failed the man

294
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Her man should not stoop

295
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
To fit the system

296
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,359
But the system should be made and remade to fit the man who holds value as worth

297
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
I will serve no Bandon or liar

298
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
For I know John Galt and understand

299
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,295
This life is too short to serve those who compromise value and it's

300
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
FX

301
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
I am done compromising

302
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
His friend Nick read that email

303
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Along with everyone else

304
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
What uses like

305
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Or did you think like

306
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Like

307
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
Sorting through a bimbo

308
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
Yeah this is the other kinds of things

309
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
He would say

310
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775
Kim Harrison was on those emails to

311
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,103
And I've gotten other messages from bow and she was starting to worry

312
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
She said she could tell he was frustrated

313
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
The situation was dangerous

314
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
But he's trying to hold himself together

315
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,623
Here's a series writing these things is not sending email to sending all these cryptic things he's

316
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
In the State of Mind was obvious to me

317
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,511
What a mentally where he was at it was

318
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Stretch

319
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
He was on that press

320
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
Gaming Warehouse

321
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
A person can make bad choices

322
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Like really bad choices

323
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
I don't think

324
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
You know it's not suicidal or that kind of

325
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
And all it was just

326
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
He's frustrated he's on edge

327
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
And not really

328
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
Completely logical in his right mind

329
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
But is this what you

330
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
Understood at the time that you're using this in hindsight Avenue talk to him

331
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,927
Not really clear

332
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Yeah

333
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,767
A few days later some army people show up at her door

334
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Turbo is missing

335
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Just a day or two after that

336
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Boxer

337
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Trumbo

338
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
He said it from Afghanistan

339
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
What is computer his iPod is Kindle a journal

340
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
And a copy of Atlas Shrugged

341
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,527
It's been pretty widely reported that a Bose military hearing

342
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:07,135
His lawyer said this carefully phrase but also somewhat vague thing regarding bows mental

343
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Health

344
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,535
He said a quote neutral Army Psychiatry board has now concluded that back in June 2009

345
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,375
That Sergeant Bergdahl possessed a severe mental disease or defect

346
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
This past week I finally found out what he meant by

347
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,103
In May of last year but his defense team asked for what's called a 706 sanity

348
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Mental health assessment

349
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
Connection with the charges against Bell

350
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,295
An army forensic psychiatrist a well-regarded doctor named Christopher Lang

351
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Met with phone and give a diagnosis

352
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
Schizotypal personality disorder

353
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Reset both would have had as of

354
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
The time of the alleged

355
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,351
I'm guessing this too will be part of both defense at the court-martial

356
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Receding

357
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
Docker valdovinos this year psychologist who knows Bo

358
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
Said that when he heard this diagnosis he thought

359
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Yeah

360
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
I think they hit the nail on the head

361
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,575
What's going on

362
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:14,975
Elementary his teenage years

363
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,815
Ilili duck tell the story of the above unfortunately

364
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,143
Again OGE valdovinos permission to talk about the

365
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Describe the basic character

366
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,055
Diagnosed with

367
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Black Horse Friends

368
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Stay

369
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
Recording

370
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
External events have personal meaning to them

371
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:51,583
Peculiar ways for the century

372
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,655
Perceptual alterations

373
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,263
Assisted Living

374
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Can I watch Bravo

375
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
Really struggled with

376
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,247
Those grand ideas about his future about his capabilities the Romantic Adventures he wanted to make happen

377
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,807
Baldinos says those all fit the profile

378
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
He said for anyone with a psychiatric illness like this

379
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Symptoms tend to get worse when you're under stress

380
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
What are the major symptoms

381
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Is paranoia

382
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
And the potential to misinterpret situations

383
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,704
Amolatina says it's not a stretch to say that's probably what happened when bow is deployed to Afghanistan

384
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
Where is actually dangerous

385
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
Obviously stressful

386
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
Who's not super tight with the guys in his unit

387
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
He starts to think his

388
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,152
Battalion Commander is against them

389
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
Might even send them on a suicide mission

390
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
Which is very paranoid thinking

391
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
And that all leads to a decision that isn't

392
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Well entirely sane

393
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
I'll buy that point I think the paranoias at all

394
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
How to push him over the edge

395
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
He said I'm doing it

396
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,840
When you start thinking about the idea of him being Jason Bourne and

397
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:02,496
Still having pain doing Special Operations

398
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Going to going

399
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
And then bring the hell

400
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,920
Not really thinking through the ramifications of walking off a bass into

401
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
Basically until the Taliban

402
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
Absolutely

403
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
Frustrated with the army

404
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
There's still something I think biologically that's going to keep us from

405
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,888
And I literally blocking off of

406
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,472
I just self-preservation at that point when taking back

407
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,264
You know I fell for him

408
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,104
Thank you likewise

409
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
Notepad

410
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
When you look at the whole total picture it starts

411
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Alexa

412
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,904
Volcanoes things that would happen with bow at the Coast Guard what happened in Afghanistan

413
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
Is all the peace

414
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,608
The Army knows about this diagnosis

415
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,936
At the September hearing the Army prosecutor

416
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
Major Margaret kurz

417
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
Give a preview of the Army's thinking on the subject

418
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:12,640
One of the key points from the psychiatrist doctor Lang's report

419
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
Set in 2009 at the time of the alleged criminal misconduct the accused was able to appreciate

420
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,672
She ate the nature and quality and wrongfulness of his conduct unquote

421
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
Another words mental illness

422
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
Who should be held responsible for his actions

423
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,080
The other day I checked back in with Mark to see if the diagnosis made him think differently about anything

424
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
I guess it's it it's an interesting

425
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
Datapoint I don't know that it's the

426
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
Northstar

427
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
Of the story

428
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,672
Mark feels like he already knew walking off was not a rational thing to do

429
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,000
So putting a label on Bose way of thinking didn't really change much more

430
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,424
I told Mark that for me the diagnosis made me let go of any lingering doubts I had about the truthfulness of Bowser

431
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Like all the details that didn't add up

432
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,056
Well yeah if you're paranoid and doing some magical thinking

433
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Corset

434
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
It makes me believe in

435
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
He really was in his mind trying to raise an alarm

436
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
Mark already believes

437
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,832
So aside from a legal defense Mark wasn't sure the diagnosis made much of

438
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,928
Any worried in fact that once they heard the diagnosis

439
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
People

440
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
Maybe people like me

441
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,560
Would disregard everything but was saying about his military experience

442
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
I do think that

443
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
For you the diagnosis

444
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
It makes him more credible to you but it also

445
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Means you take him less seriously

446
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
I think

447
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
As a as a

448
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
A kid with opinions you know

449
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
Has like an American soldier with a

450
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Opinions

451
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,136
No I don't think that's correct I think that I think his Assessments in a general way

452
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
Of like the

453
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:07,072
Like I think we can all agree like the war in Afghanistan has not been a success right I guess I'm more think he was kind of right

454
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
By accident right

455
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
What is that mean right by accident

456
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,008
Like he sort of happens to be rich but not

457
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,616
He's not specifically right in the particular instances he's

458
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
That's really giving us examples of

459
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
The overall failure

460
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,832
But he's responding to real data points right I mean he's not thinking that stuff just from his

461
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,648
From his cat log cabin in Idaho

462
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:37,792
I guess but if I mean again I know we've we survived argued about on them before but I feel like

463
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
You know

464
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
His beef with Amna remember isn't like we never should have gone up there in the first place we never shut you know what I mean his beef really

465
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,776
At the end of the day has biggest complaint

466
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
Is this feeling of

467
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,920
R Commander doesn't care about our welfare

468
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
Yeah that it was to the point where he was maybe going to send us on a suicide mission to get rid of us because we

469
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
We are bad for his

470
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
Butaton

471
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
Yeah right like that's not

472
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
No I mean there's a lot of different judgments that that are stacked on top of each other and the last one is

473
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Is is

474
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
Just deeply paranoid and

475
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,192
You can reject it on its face I don't think there's a

476
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
Commander of the US

477
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Armed Forces who is

478
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,848
Do anything remotely like what both adjust

479
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
Okay so I just think it's just

480
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,480
But the other but the judgments that precede that

481
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
That

482
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
Maybe this Commander

483
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
Has other priorities in a

484
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
It besides

485
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:41,280
Purely the welfare of his soldiers I think that's clearly on the face of it true because he they did

486
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,120
Put American lives at risk to retrieve equipment

487
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,984
And that is part of the calculation of Warren you can talk to people and

488
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:55,104
Up and down the chain of command and I'll sell ya s*** like that happens all the time where you weigh

489
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
Someone's life

490
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
Against a piece of equipment

491
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
And that maybe a

492
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,064
An everyday calculation but that doesn't make it any less

493
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,648
F***** up especially if you're the kid that is

494
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,464
Whose life is being weighed to get the equipment back

495
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Here's where Mark and I die virgin

496
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,352
He links Bose personal experience more directly to

497
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
The problems of the world than I do

498
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,960
He wants to be careful to separate what bows saying

499
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
From who Bo is

500
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
In a case like this though that's the rub

501
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Moxie's.

502
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
Why I keep going back to

503
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:35,296
Tip something that somebody sent me a long time ago which is like I kind of agree with everything you said but I still want to punch him in the face

504
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
You know

505
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,648
It's like that line from The Big Lebowski

506
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
You're not wrong Walter

507
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
You're just an a******

508
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,072
I've heard something akin to that sentiment from a bunch of the soldiers who served with

509
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,192
It was not driving the leadership without a controller you know he's right about a lot of s***

510
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,240
We all are. We're all worried about it

511
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
Darrell Hanson

512
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,824
Does the fact of his

513
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,664
What he describes as his good intentions matter to you

514
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Yes it does

515
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,600
I mean but it intention like that is not ever Justified today

516
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:16,256
It's something so huge and such a big decision in that caused so many consequences with it

517
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,048
I feel like you won't have to be God

518
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,632
To make that kind of decision

519
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
I want to be careful not to suggest

520
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
All the soldiers we talk to are in lockstep

521
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,736
Some of them even when we talked to them last summer said they'd already forgiven bow moved on

522
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
Other said they never get over it

523
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:43,392
The past week or two my producer Dan and I checked in without a half dozen soldiers

524
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:47,744
See if anything they'd heard from both so far in the podcast had made them feel differently

525
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,072
Some said they still thought he was lying about why you left

526
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
Other said they believe him now

527
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
What are trying to forgive what he did

528
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
But they just

529
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Can't quite get there

530
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
Here's Ben Evans

531
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,336
He may have had the greatest intentions of the world but

532
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
Yeah I just don't I can't

533
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Yeah just don't

534
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Yeah

535
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,160
I talked to John Thurman for a while recently

536
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:22,304
John's mother is a therapist and like a lot of veterans he's also had counseling to help him deal with the after-effects of

537
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Deployment

538
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
Maybe a little more

539
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,424
Touchy feely on the question of those Mental Health

540
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:32,288
I wanted to know if a diagnosis would help John not to say that what bow did was okay

541
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,848
But whether diagnosis would help John forgive bow

542
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Personally

543
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,456
I got pretty pushy with John about it he was a really good sport

544
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
Yeah we all experience

545
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
The same thing

546
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
And we didn't walk off

547
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
I know I know but you're saying we all experience the same thing and we drove on

548
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,072
To you is you didn't experience well yes I didn't see it from his lens

549
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,144
You know she was she was getting

550
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,704
Scared by Adele you weren't

551
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,800
Like you're not perceiving danger in those reprimands

552
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
And he is

553
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
Yeah and I

554
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:14,272
I mean I don't think there was danger in those reprimands cuz I don't know I know that's not the poor not argue

555
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
Weather

556
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
We're not arguing whether he's correct

557
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
Yeah

558
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
I really really really

559
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Try

560
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
To see it from

561
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
His side

562
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,608
Through his lens and I understand that he and I have very different brains

563
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
Perception or not

564
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
I mean I still can never

565
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Forgiven

566
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Mercante

567
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
And it's on Principe

568
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
He broke

569
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
That intimate Bond

570
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
That we all share with each other

571
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
That's not something you can ever come back

572
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
I don't care where your head was

573
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
Bo you still f****** dead

574
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,160
You walked off

575
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
And you betrayed

576
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,792
It's like you stop there. It stops there

577
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,120
And that's just that that's the infantryman and me taking over

578
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
I'm a dyed-in-the-wool civilian

579
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
From a family of civilian

580
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,384
My father was in the Army in World War II

581
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,736
But he didn't deployed overseas the only War Stories I remember him telling me we're about like

582
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
Carousing in Denver

583
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Sorry Dad

584
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
It wasn't immediately obvious to me why some of the people both served with were not even just mad

585
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Hurt

586
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
Deeply hurt in some case

587
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
What I understand now is that

588
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
That Bond

589
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Brotherhood they feel

590
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
It's not just a cliche

591
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
What is a cliche but it's also profoundly true

592
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
I think about it this way

593
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
In my life who would die for me

594
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Really

595
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
My mom maybe

596
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
Who would I die

597
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
Ikids

598
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
And so imagine you're in a platoon

599
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
You become so close

600
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
So fast

601
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,112
To all these guys around you

602
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
You recognize each other's cough

603
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
Are there silhouette in the dark

604
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
You would die for The Other Guys in your platoon

605
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Even if you don't like them you do it

606
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
And they would die for you

607
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,400
It's not even hypothetical it happens all the time

608
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
And because of that

609
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
Personalities aside

610
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:14,080
These guys become family to one another if you walk away like Bo did

611
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,896
You break the promise you all have made to each other

612
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
You undermine the whole Enterprise

613
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
Your family starts to crumble

614
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
When you need it most

615
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,928
And that's what the soldiers say happened during the search for Bo Bo's friend Chris Engels said

616
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,792
It was like the soul of their platoon just dwindled people shrink into themselves

617
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:39,168
Even afterwards 2nd platoon felt like they were blamed for believing

618
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
They were sort of banished from the larger family of the

619
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Italian

620
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
A sergeant everyone told us they just love

621
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
A guy named Larry Hein

622
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,128
Was moved out of the platoon

623
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,456
Summer Place by commander who was to put it gently

624
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Stricter

625
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,320
After helping with Afghan elections in August of 2009

626
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
Between went on to a town called modicon

627
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
An embedded with Afghan Security Forces

628
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,024
And they did well enough there that they got commendations and a visit by General McChrystal

629
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
But still overall a lot of them just felt robbed

630
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
But their whole deployment lost it

631
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Its meaning

632
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
When I talked to Darrell Hanson again

633
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
A couple weeks ago

634
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,544
He said after hearing the podcast

635
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
He softens some

636
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
I don't have as much hate as I do towards them

637
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
What up

638
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
I went shooting today

639
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,624
But what about the time and I think I'll let you know but

640
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
Today I pray shake his hand be like

641
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
You think about next time

642
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
For what you do think about

643
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,072
Think about it a little bit more you know was it worth it

644
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,704
Almost all the soldiers we talked to said they still thought both should go to court-martial

645
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
A mark

646
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,104
I'll just said it makes sense for bow to go through the military justice system

647
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
Walmart says

648
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,504
Do United States did put a lot of time and money and energy into getting blowback

649
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
And that's as it should be

650
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,136
But we did take Extraordinary Measures

651
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672

Next episode of serial

682
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
I had previously

683
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
Had discussions with

684
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,376
Somali Warlords Haitian dictators and Afghan Insurgent leaders so

685
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,776
Given that range contacts I didn't find anything unusual about these without Ivana like simple straightforward.

686
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
Do you want a deal or not

687
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:03,712
He's done more serious time than anyone could possibly imagine I mean the release video and holyshit there's Bo again

688
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:11,136
The old strategy to win this with money to win this with song

689
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,696
Soldiers with military mites

690
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
Was doomed
