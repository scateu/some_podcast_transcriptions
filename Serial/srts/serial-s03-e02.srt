I'm not going to press charges it doesn't matter

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
Like you'll just be seen as an irritant now in this

23
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,264
Well it is an obstructionist you don't want to get a record

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Haitian for that

25
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,432
That's fine but you still have to go through this

26
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

27
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
One Courthouse told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
First thing I said to myself when I looked at the list of felony judges in Cuyahoga County was

29
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,872
Holy cow that's a lot of Irish names

30
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
Well truthfully that was the second thing I said

31
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
First thing I said was where all the Jews

32
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Second thing

33
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
So many Irish

34
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
There's judge Corrigan another judge Corrigan judge Hollie Gallagher judge Shannon Gallagher judge Kelly Gallagher to Sean

35
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
Manasi Joshi and George McClellan

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
McCormick judge McDonald's at O'Donnell and judge Donnelly

37
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
Second to the Irish or the Italian

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,704
Namely Russo Russo Russo & Russo

39
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,592
Judge John J Russo judge Joseph Russo judge Michael Russo and judge Nancy Margaret Russo

40
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
At the end of the last is Judge sutula

41
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
And her cousin

42
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Church the Tula

43
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm finally Gibsonburg

44
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,064
I know sounds like my kind of Judge

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
Which is actually Italian married to Centerburg

46
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
The upshot

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
In a courthouse where the majority of the defendants

48
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
What is black

49
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,536
Out of the 34 felony judges

50
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
32r White

51
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Two are

52
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,592
Early on in my reporting here I was on the 19th floor of the Justice Center

53
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,200
And I wandered into the courtroom of Judge Daniel Gaul just in time to hear him sentencing someone

54
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Think was 4 years ago I was about to get

55
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
I didn't record it but I took notes

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
You're pathetic the judge will say you're pathetic dude

57
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,744
My father had a saying I shouldn't say this in court but I'm going to say it you're a b******* artist

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,328
Your criminal and a liar and have used the system all your life

59
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,424
Send the b******* artist says to judge golf a liar a cheater

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
That's not what I built my life on

61
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,592
Don't come in here and make these pretty speeches just call says you've got what's called a mortal character flaw

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
A man says

63
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
I'm not going to let you down

64
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
I left the courtroom a little wigged-out

65
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
I've never heard of Judge talk to a defendant quite like that raw and brutal and confusingly in

66
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
As if these two men were locked in a personal argument rather than a legal one the man up on the bench Titan

67
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
And small acting the enrage parents

68
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,424
The other chin-up but shamed trying to mollify

69
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,848
A judge's job here when it comes to sentencing is broadly speaking to punish the offender and protect the pub

70
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:04,736
Their sentencing guidelines of course spelled out in excruciating detail in the Ohio Revised Code

71
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
Assume the guidelines meant that sentencing with Fraley mechanical a certain kind of charge would produce a certain kind of sentence

72
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,000
Plus or minus a little Wiggly room in the margin to account for special circumstances or whatever else

73
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
But it's not like that

74
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
County judges in Ohio have a lot of leeway instead of saying a lot of discretion to interpret what punishment can

75
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,775
Consist of what danger to the public looks like

76
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,079
Leeway discretion

77
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
That's power by another name

78
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:37,247
Today's episode we're going to spend it all in one place in judge called courtroom

79
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,391
We chose Israel we is our producer manual Joe Chan died because frankly it sometimes thrilling in there

80
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
The shock Factor alone is worth the price of admission

81
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,095
But also because his room more than any we saw laid bare this prodigious power that judges hold

82
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
And the many ways they can wield that power

83
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Try to get what they want

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Emmanuel's going to tell part of today's episode

85
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799

86
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103

He'll be reporting some of this

88
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
Serious so you'll hear from him throughout

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,295
And hang on to your hats America Emmanuel went to high school and college in Ohio

90
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
But he sounds like an Englishman

91
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Long story

92
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Is Emmanuel

93
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
In about five months off and on watching cases and juggles courtroom

94
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,607
I think we're going to let some record 6117 so I can say with confidence that this

95
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Is a typical day

96
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
Do you have any common sense at all dude

97
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983

Cause of exception

100
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
So this one's.

101
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,527
Sentencing for 19 year old I'm going to call Tyrell is unusual anyway

102
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
When was caught driving a stolen car

103
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623

Cupid guilty about a month

105
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231

Racial stereotyping and jungles questions

An assumption on the part of the judge that this black family is rudderless and unstable

149
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
But all these kids must be from different possibly incarcerated fathers

Just cool sentences to round to 4 years of probation

177
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,367

00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
Attack someone lost condition

181
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Ketosteril

182
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
But if he has another child out of wedlock

183
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Wacom support

184
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,519
You consider that a violation of his probation

185
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Mother are you with me there

186
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
Responsibility

187
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Is responsibility to community

188
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,159
I'm not down with you having kids and dumping them cradle-to-grave on the shoulders of the taxpayer

189
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,743
I know some people don't think that politically correct

190
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
But that's my view

191
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
That's my view and if you demonstrate your responsibility to this court I will send you to the point that you get AIDS

192
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Job

193
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
And believe me you're going to pay child support through support

194
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
Every child doesn't say anything

195
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,735
Attorney John Steiner banksters goal high school is by now

196
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,319
No one in the room went out But what does gorgeous friend to do

197
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Is unconstitutional

198
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
Accomplished well for having a child

199
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,743
Not legally but this is the sort of thing does Goldust

200
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Have the day continues

201
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
It was the same condition on two more defendants

202
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,383
As far as I know just Google has never made good on this issue threats over time

203
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,991
I'm going to talk to cell phone we can test your hair follicles for opiates right now

204
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
It sold after

205
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
The attorneys never that

206
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
And as long as you don't piss them off

207
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
Just cool isn't an especially tough sentence.

208
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,791
All the punishments handed out in this day of a reasonable for this building

209
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
People people on probation he could have sent to prison

210
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
And the people he did sent to prison

211
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
He said he'd consider getting out of a lease

212
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
So

213
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
For defendants and their attorneys

214
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
The strategy in just gold courtroom is

215
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
Enjoy whatever he loves it you don't challenge him

216
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Don't trigger him

217
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
You probably come out okay

218
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
That's what a defense attorney like don't stand it is trying to convey

219
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
Sweden to Russia oldest

220
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Just hold on

221
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Don't say anything

222
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Will misfire

223
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Can you see me one second

224
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:22,239
Back in his office judge calls got souvenirs from Ireland lot of the judges have Ireland stuff in their Chambers

225
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
He's also got one of those Potter things

226
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Hi

227
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Carolina golf balls

228
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Very funny fight a slip-and-fall case

229
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
From your golf balls

230
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
At home here

231
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,903
Is nestled into the building along with the sons of other prominent clevelanders

232
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,999
But his floor are two other judges whose fathers were also County judges

233
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,351
Does gallstones father with a Cleveland city councilman and later County Treasurer

234
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,983
Just got started out as a defense in civil attorney and then ran for judge in 1992

235
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
County judges are elected in Ohio

236
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
He hasn't lost an election since

237
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Nevin four of them

238
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
He's known around here as a TV judge

239
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
Controversially entertaining

240
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
The way he talks

241
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
He reacts instantaneously to stimuli

242
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,183
It's why the cleveland.com reporter sometimes Parks himself and judge calls room on a slow news day

243
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
A recent headline

244
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,791
Woman convicted in Murder conspiracy calls judge racist

245
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
Gets life sentence

246
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Here's another

247
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
Judge Compares man acquitted of murder charge to Las Vegas shooter

248
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Sentencing

249
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
Note the word

250
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Acquitted of murder

251
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,615
And that one just called said that if the defendant had pulled a gun on him on Judge call quote

252
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
I would have busted a cap in you unquote

253
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
The defendant's name was DiMaggio Callahan article said he remembered this guy from a previous case because quote he's gotten

254
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
Italian first name and an Irish last name

255
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Annie's brother

256
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
Black defendants brother and dude

257
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
You got a bit of an attitude go with your brother

258
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Emmanuel told me that in eight months of watching his courtroom the only black person he didn't hear judge call call brother or

259
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
Dude was a manual

260
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Use the terms like baby's mama and baby's daddy which impossible for a White Guy to do without making the whole

261
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Ballroom cringe

262
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
Is no truck with political correctness

263
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:16,159
He's out to use the term race card if you throw it down in his courtroom he says it is not going to work I eat woman calls

264
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
Ostrich racist gets life sentence

265
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,071
He'll work the black lives matter movement into his colleague weeds as a pun I guess

266
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,143
His black lives don't matter to you did it he'll say

267
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Has said more than once

268
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
Two black defendant regarding a black victim

269
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Just don't know if he's blind

270
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
Knows he's skirting not to quibble that I take Crossing

271
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Various lines

272
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
Constitutionally and socially

273
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
He says he's been called all the names

274
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Misogynist racist

275
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,879
But he says that is the price he pays for trying to connect with dependents

276
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,535
The I have been criticized in the past or maybe using a little slang or being a little bit too casual sometimes

277
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
But I'm

278
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Talking to

279
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
A group

280
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
People and I want to speak to them in their video

281
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,311
In language that they can understand not in legalese not in

282
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
But noted references injury and suggest hey dude

283
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Get real

284
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
May I really want them to understand

285
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
Me and understand that I understand

286
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Them

287
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
He's doing something up there he's

288
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Is not just a functionary

289
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,999
Say what you will about Judge calls personal views and his manner

290
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Temperament

291
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
And I will say many things here

292
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
But he is not cynical

293
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
Is fundamentally optimistic in a way

294
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
He can fix what's broken

295
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Defendant by defendant

296
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
And I really think

297
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,431
I know these people sometimes better than they know themselves and I share this information confront them I make them think about their lives

298
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,527
Everyday judge Gaul is seeing all these depressing stats made manifest

299
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
It's almost always there in the psi's

300
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,415
He'll see that the defendants parents were drug addicts or abusive

301
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,255
Couldn't or didn't take care of their children may be ended up in prison themselves

302
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,351
I know this person a product of foster care and a Board of Education

303
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
Kids are his or her own

304
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
Comes before judge call having committed a crime

305
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
The horrible crime

306
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
It's a rotten family cycle

307
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Angelica wants to break

308
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,663
He told Emmanuel that's why he's asking defendants about their children

309
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
You asked me why I ask people how many kids say

310
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
What wine goes up

311
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,367
Because it should be an issue of social

312
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Concern

313
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
It's not politically correct

314
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
To ask

315
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
People how many children died

316
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Why I don't know I think

317
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
Perhaps because some people think it dis is women

318
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
It's not about that

319
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,055
If I believe that most of the people are in here because of abuse or abandonment or neglect as a child and I do

320
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,151
But I want to see to it that there aren't kids that are just born

321
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
And left

322
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
By themselves in a band

323
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
You know some people say well you're a misogynist wait a second

324
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,207
I'm defending a little boys and little girls were brought into this world and raised in foster care for the rest of their life

325
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
What do you think their chance

326
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,839
And what percentage of the kids can be born into poverty

327
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Before

328
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
We don't have

329
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
A middle class anymore

330
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Or there's a permanent under

331
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
So

332
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Siri

333
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Meet prep

334
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Please tell me

335
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
You don't have

336
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,855
This woman had pleaded guilty to theft

337
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
An incident at Macy's

338
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
Her lawyer tries to help her out

339
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
Explain she has one child and a second on the way

340
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
Enter pregnant now

341
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Even better

342
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Wonderful

343
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Who's the first baby's dad

344
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
Give her a couple years probation

345
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
This is on a Monday

346
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,343
Over the weekend just go ahead read an article about the percentage of children born on Medicaid

347
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,927
After the Macy's women left the courtroom he start talking about it

348
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,791
Anybody see the story in the paper by the percentage of children born in this country on Medicaid

349
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Anybody see this

350
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
I don't even want to know Mona defense attorney

351
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,215
New Mexico I think leaves the country 72%

352
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
He told them

353
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
And the national average is over 50%

354
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
I believe it's a process

355
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Decatur

356
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,199
Whittier judge calcite this statistic From the Bench several times as the months went on

357
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,671
Is one of the most transparent judges in the building his world using woven into every proceeding

358
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
He like the old days better

359
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
Cleveland was better in America was better

360
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
When people were more respectful or Brazilian

361
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
What's whiny

362
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,007
Now we're dealing with a generation raised on ADHD medication which could who knows what to their brain chemistry

363
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,079
Chinese Millennials nourished on participation trophies

364
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Anchor rode something from the rest of us

365
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
All of this

366
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
The toll building

367
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,527
The 13,000 felony cases moving through the criminal court each year

368
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
Boat races at a frightful shortage

369
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
A personal responsibility

370
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,655
Sentencing in Ohio for recent history of it is similar with evolved all over the country

371
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,263
Back in the mid-1990s when we were freaking out about Rising violent crime

372
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,847
Ohio like many states revamp its sentencing laws

373
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,431
It redefined certain felonies made some punishments harsher

374
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
I got rid of parole for most cases

375
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,879
Animated shamelessly oversimplify for a second because the reasons why Ohio's prison population climb

376
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,743
Are complex and super interesting by the way it did climb

377
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,815
Mostly because people began serving longer sentences

378
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,167
In 1974 Ohio prisons held 10700 people

379
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
By 2011 they held almost 51,000 people

380
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
400% increase

381
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
That's expensive

382
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
More than a billion and a quarter dollars

383
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Expensive

384
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,991
So that your 2011 Ohio again like other places

385
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Swing back the other way

386
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
I passed new legislation aimed at unpacking the prison

387
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,719
Which has more options for diverting low-level felons to Alternative punishments

388
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
And broaden the opportunities

389
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
For probation

390
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
That suits judge called just

391
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Spine

392
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
He likes probation

393
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
He likes lengthy probation

394
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,031
I probably put more people on probation than any other judge in this Courthouse

395
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,847
Yeah because I can always put him in prison later

396
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,151
And I keep my eye out

397
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,759
Probation gives judge Galan going control over people's lives

398
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
It does best hope for getting them to change

399
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
And I probably have at any one time

400
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Anywhere between

401
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
I don't know

402
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Kayak

403
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
Couple thousand people on probation

404
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
50% of people on probation

405
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,423
Probation what insiders call getting paper rather than time

406
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Is what most defendants what

407
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
But probation has its own hazard

408
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079
Probation here is actually called Community Control sanction

409
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
Emphasis on the control

410
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:05,503
What is why I have heard defendants tell judges they'd rather pay a big fine or just do some jail time and get it over with

411
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
Rather than be on probation

412
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm probation you're out but you're not free you are still tethered

413
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
The courthouse

414
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:16,255
And the conditions of your release can worm their way into almost every aspect of your life

415
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
They can dictate who you live with

416
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,607
Where you work whether you can have a beer after

417
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,935
Whether you can go to your uncle's funeral or your niece's wedding

418
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
It's so easy to slip up

419
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,079
A dirty urine test and missed meeting maybe you get indicted on a new crime

420
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
And you're back before judge Gaul

421
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,199
That's why he's got more cases than most judges in the building

422
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
Because of all those probation violation

423
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
We watch one violation hearing

424
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
Four women named Vivian

425
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,439
I know you quite well we've talked on five or six occasions

426
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Correct a good person

427
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
So I feel like a nobody

428
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,119
Google doesn't know Vivian pretty well but he knows our specs

429
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
She 29 single three children

430
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Our youngest is 3 months old

431
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,823
Couple of years ago in 2015 she pleaded guilty to felony drug possession

432
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Got caught with a small amount of cocaine

433
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,271
Rather than convicted of the felony was called an ilc intervention in lieu of conviction

434
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
Work sort of like probation

435
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,159
The idea is a Vivian could do everything she supposed to her case will go away

436
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
The list of requirements is significant

437
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
Report weekly undergo drug testing complete intensive outpatient drug treatment go to AA meetings at 2

438
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Tina sponsor get counseling get her GED

439
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
She's done everything

440
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
Except stay clean

441
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,800
Recent drug test Church even using

442
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Is it a violation

443
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
R6 time before judge Gaul

444
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,528
And I'm telling you that you got to deal with the drug problem or you're going to lose your job and your children are going to live in

445
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Jekyll takes time with Vivian

446
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,160
Reminder that another judge might have dealt with in 5 minutes tops

447
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,768
Chekhov spent 20 minutes talking to her that's a dog's age in this building

448
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,888
He's been through the usual Jazz about babies daddies and bad decisions in the welfare state

449
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
Medicaid MX

450
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Seacoast NH

451
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,520
We also seem sincere about trying to help her

452
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,104
He bores into the detail of her schedule asked about her job

453
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,688
She works nights in the kitchen of a casino for $10 an hour

454
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,040
Bad idea he tells her that's exactly the kind of place where you going to be offered cocaine

455
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
You need to stop the second shift work

456
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
I think it's set me up for failure

457
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,816
Get up and get the kids off and get the kids daycare and work during the daylight hours

458
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,888
So that you and the children to rest at the same time

459
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,704
You need to get honest in your working

460
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
You're working you know

461
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,776
16 hours a day

462
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Without the help of anybody

463
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
Three months ago at another violation hearing

464
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
Just call that set up and said Vivian to jail for a week

465
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
To try to scare straight

466
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
That didn't work

467
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
Today she's desperate not to get locked up

468
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,136
She's worried she'll lose her children

469
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:55,488
4 compartment is Deft she knows not to beg in here not to whine

470
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
She missed her weakness flags are strength

471
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,912
She tells him all around she's enrolled herself in an intensive outpatient drug treatment program

472
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
And IOP

473
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,288
I just feel like I should do better and I can do better

474
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
And if you give me an opportunity I promise you I will I know I've done wrong numerous times

475
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
But I've been selfish and I'll keep her overnight without court-ordered without anybody telling me to do what I can do on my own

476
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,952
Vivian's attorney today request that judge call transfer Vivian to drug court

477
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,864
Instead of remaining under judge call supervision should be put on a specialized docket designed specifically for people like

478
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Like her

479
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,752
People who aren't violent I don't want to be criminals but who get in trouble with the law because of their addiction

480
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,824
Over in drug court that use a therapeutic model

481
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
The question is not how can we best punish you

482
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,200
It's how can we best help you get better

483
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
What are the drug court judges is Joan synenberg

484
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
Does a social work background

485
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:57,184
Actually she's the recovery Court Judge what does a docket for people struggling with both mental health and drug problems

486
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,744
And it is a different vibe over there

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
Just really fast I'm going to show you

488
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,608
I was with her one day when she popped into that courtroom to say hi

489
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,472
Hi how are you how are you

490
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,056
Another judge was substituting for her because she was tied up on a murder trial

491
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:18,432
The participants sat in the jury box and on the benches atmosphere was casual warm

492
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
I miss you a lot

493
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
I love you the right way

494
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,048
On the way out judge Centerburg ran into one of the recovery Court participants in the hallway got him Craig give her a big hug

495
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Amazing

496
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
You have been

497
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
Operations program

498
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
Little hectic and stressful but

499
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
Amazing experiences

500
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Is amazing

501
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
I'm so proud

502
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
You have come so far

503
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,176
Nice right no one gets torn down in drug court

504
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Nonna's ask why they're pregnant

505
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm not saying it's a cure-all

506
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
Ohio has been devastated by the opioid crisis

507
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,952
But research shows that programs like these are the best way we found to help people with drug problems

508
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Stay out of the criminal justice

509
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
So Vivian's attorney asks for drug court

510
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,912
Ana probation department which is staffed with substance abuse specialist

511
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Social workers

512
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Well-regarded around here

513
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,288
They're also recommending Vivian for drug court

514
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
The judge called

515
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Flix that idea side

516
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,944
As if drug court is going to do something different than what we've already

517
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
It's as if you saying I got this

518
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
I deal with addiction all day long

519
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
Vivian's just got a buckle down stay the course

520
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
She doesn't need drug court

521
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
She has me

522
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Vivian's attorney doesn't push back much on this

523
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,072
Even seem to agree with judge call what difference would it make

524
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
One difference

525
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,192
In drug court she have one defense attorney dedicated to her case

526
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
Follow her progress and update the judge

527
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
The sky is her fifth attorney

528
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,384
Each time she has to appear before judge golf she's assigned someone new

529
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,480
First there's a public defender Linda Rico negotiated the ilc deal

530
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,784
Instead it's been assignment list attorneys

531
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,904
Is Charles Morgan than jimho slick and Aaron brockler. Presented her at 2 hearings actually

532
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
Today is Joseph O'Malley

533
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,280
Their goal all of them is to keep Vivian out of jail

534
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
Other than that they don't have much of a stake here

535
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,960
You're not thinking too hard about how she progresses with drug treatment or what would work best for her

536
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
They're getting paid a hundred bucks for this hearing

537
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
The moments over she's not their client anymore

538
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,944
Today judge call ends up putting Vivian on house arrest at her own suggestion

539
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
I'm sure Vivian would like this interaction with judge Gaul to be her last

540
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
The last she admits

541
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Stream

542
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
A month from now she'll be indicted for theft

543
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Freezing a friend's credit card

544
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:42,048
Set another hearing Jessica will tell Vivian she's out of control and he'll send her to jail

545
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,888
Just been 51 days there while the credit card case gets sorted out

546
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,704
She'll be guilty to a couple of first-degree misdemeanors

547
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
God will tell her she's weak

548
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Indulgent

549
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Selfish

550
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,616
I'll tell her to quit the tears sweetheart and he'll give her a suspended jail sentence

551
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
More home detention plus two years probation

552
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,272
Now instead of three aana meetings a week she must go to for a week

553
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
She'll violate again

554
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,904
This time she'll beg for inpatient treatment

555
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,512
So tell Jessica her cousin died three weeks ago from an overdose and she's afraid

556
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,096
I need help I need help she'll say it seven times

557
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
I need to learn to get through this sickness you call it a sickness and I call it a crime he'll say will send her to jail

558
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,896
Once again she will leave her three sons who by this time are 9 years old 6 years old and 9 months old with their grass

559
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,736
Grandmother after Vivian has spent 66 days locked up

560
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,320
Her ninth assign lawyer will write to judge call asking him to let her out

561
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Scala release Vivian from jail

562
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,440
I'll put her on probation for another year-and-a-half

563
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
Now she must attend V A N A meetings a week

564
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,864
I'll try to help Vivian least I think he is

565
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,680
But consider a drug court

566
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
That new stuff charge would have been rolled into her existing case

567
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,592
It would not have affected her status in drug court at all

568
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
But she been in drug court it's unlikely she would have spent even one day in the county jail much less 127.

569
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,904
What you been in drug court and if she's anything like the other drug court participants almost all of whom backslide and struggle

570
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Twitter graduated from that program in about 13 months

571
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,584
As it stands she's been embroiled with judge Gaul for three and a half years and counting

572
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
Perkier than 5 grams of cocaine

573
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:32,384
This is possibly the most profound and least examined question in the building

574
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
What works

575
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:39,040
Court doesn't gather statistics on sentencing and that's true for most of the country by the way

576
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,696
No data that says defendants and Cuyahoga County do better after 6 months of probation then after 3 years of probation

577
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,744
In terms of reoffending

578
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,072
4 years in prison yields better results than 7 years in prison

579
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
We just don't know

580
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,704
Which I found rather astounding when I realize no one is tracking this

581
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,288
The court keeps extensive data regarding efficiency

582
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,360
How many cases are moving through who's dockets and how quickly

583
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
Which I'm not knocking efficiency it's important

584
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,992
People here are generally not waiting years and years for the KC

585
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,272
Test results and that's good

586
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,624
But there's no database locally or nationally that shows what works

587
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,464
To each judge in the building has to muddle it out for him or herself

588
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
Judge Cassandra collier-williams put it to me this way

589
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,864
There's 34 judges up here and it's like 34 different cities

590
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,216
Of course you're just here I'm just winging it mostly they're not winning it

591
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
They're basing their decisions on the sentencing guidelines

592
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,824
And on their professional experience

593
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
But they're also making decisions based on their life experience

594
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,992
And where they come from and who they know and where they live and what they read

595
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
And what it is they hold dear

596
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,600
Talking to various courtrooms and you feel it right away

597
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
Mr. cook how old are you

598
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
I need you to speak up just a little bit okay

599
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,048
That's Judge Collier Williams on the 23rd floor

600
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Taking a plea

601
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,120
Case of felonious assault with a gun

602
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,984
He painstakingly list for Mr cook all the rights he's giving up by not going to trial

603
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,568
With gentleness she makes double sure he understands what she saying

604
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,152
Okay so what's the total time you looking at the possibility

605
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Understand

606
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
Okay finally she lectures him

607
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
Thank you I accept your plea of guilty to count three and find you guilty there on just kidding

608
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
No muss no fuss

609
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,840
We have seen her do this

610
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,912
You have 30 days to register to vote

611
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,472
Superbad to your probation officer

612
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,616
And now you are required to vote in elections in the reason why I do that is because people died for this right

613
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,456
Does Keller Williams wants felons to participate in democracy

614
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Like everybody else

615
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
But please stop doing this

616
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,576
Ever since the ACLU had a little

617
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
Chat with her

618
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Again

619
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
Unconstitutional

620
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:00,608
Judge Michael Donnelly on 19 he'll only discuss please on the record no background sets in deals

621
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
Judge Janet Burnside down on 16

622
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:09,312
But she's giving people accused of serious crimes longer and longer prison terms cuz she's so struck by the sure violence you seeing

623
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,616
Look for probation she swings light

624
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
She wants to get people off of Court supervision

625
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
Quickly as possible 2 years ago the probation department start using what are called evidence-based practices to determine probe

626
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Location

627
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
Ask a bunch of questions to try to figure out a defendant's risk of recidivism and then Taylor the conditions of probation to his or her level of

628
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Risk

629
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,912
A PowerPoint I saw on the method included a slide that said quote avoid threatening lecturing arguing shame

630
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Gaming or sympathizing

631
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,312
But you just don't have to take the probation Department's recommendations their optional

632
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:47,200
Judge Kathleen Ann sutula backup on 23 so she uses the evidence-based thing only sometimes

633
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
Velocity is akin to judge cause she told us short probation that's throwing a person away she'll tip

634
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,184
Typically give five years probation super strict condition

635
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,560
90 AA meetings in 90 days for instance if you miss a day you have to start over

636
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,376
She owns her reputation as a tough judge

637
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
Wake up

638
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,240
Mean would be the tamest thing we heard a describer

639
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,288
But I got to say we didn't see that so much

640
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,128
She was tough but we can get the feeling her toughness with self-serving

641
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
We watch the sentencing of a young guy 19

642
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Kid stolen a bunch of cars

643
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,040
Other guys were involved but they didn't get indicted

644
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
It was intense

645
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Defendant

646
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
You live with your father

647
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,184
So why didn't he pay your bond

648
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Turn 50 bucks and you could have gone home months ago

649
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Set of sitting in jail all this time

650
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,144
You know we called your father he said he didn't know your address or where you stay

651
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
That surprise you

652
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Yes ma'am

653
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
He whispers

654
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,688
You're standing here all alone

655
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:56,320
There's no Louis there's no Mikey and even your father doesn't want to stand here with you

656
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
Is this tell you something

657
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,304
Do you have any thoughts about this in your head

658
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
What are they share them with

659
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
Yeah

660
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Big time

661
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,152
By the end they're talking about his future plans

662
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
She mentions College

663
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
I don't know

664
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:28,576
Can one still talking to change the trajectory of a teenager's life

665
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
I don't know

666
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
Maybe

667
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
Transgender is here how do you know

668
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
How do you know if what you're doing is working

669
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
They talk about the people who come back

670
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,984
Vista visitor who write letters or home AC on the street who say thank you for being hard on me or thank you for giving me a check

671
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
Chance you help me

672
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
I have my kids back I'm doing well

673
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:53,664
Which must be great for a judge to hear but rigorous evidence it is in

674
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,064
Forget to call I wasn't exactly sure what he needed to see from a defended in order to declare success

675
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,880
Until we came up on the case of Rayshawn Ellis

676
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
What's after this

677
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
This is the road to hire

678
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Bicep recruiter

679
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,984
Kevin Reynolds grandfather was a farmer all his life

680
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,616
Define

681
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,224
Personnel

682
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Interactive

683
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,064
The grandkids in the same way because

684
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
He just isn't comfortable

685
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,160
Kevin sound of Lumosity

686
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,488
It works with companies in energy farming and Construction Industries

687
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
I figure out how their employees are moving their bodies

688
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,864
And to teach them to move it back their arms or legs

689
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
More safely

690
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
As Kevin says

691
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
It all comes down to efficient

692
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,312
Which is exactly why when it came time to hire a marketing person

693
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,336
ZipRecruiter

694
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
Dana was the one who manage the hiring process

695
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,552
Let me post a job on ZipRecruiter we actually got so many qualified candidates that we ended up hiring

696
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
People

697
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,136
You hired someone you didn't even know you needed

698
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
That's The Power of efficiency

699
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Just ask Evans dad

700
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
I'm like his grandfather

701
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,096
Kevin Hart's dad start moving more efficiently years ago

702
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
My dad

703
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Is

704
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Gators old

705
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Cowboys

706
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,752

When judge call sentences someone

731
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
The principal thing he's looking for

732
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,704
Is remorse

733
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,544
Emmanuel and I've heard him say these two phrases dozens of times

734
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,872
Acceptance of responsibility demonstration of remorse

735
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Rehabilitation

736
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
Camp begin

737
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
Until there's some acceptance of responsibility

738
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Xiaomi

739
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
Chander with the court

740
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
Some demonstration of remorse

741
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Acceptance of responsibility

742
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
Showing remorse

743
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,472
Judge Gaul did not invent these phrases they come from federal and state sentencing guidelines

744
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:02,080
And they sound bed rockish like they're probably chiseled into the courthouse while someplace

745
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
Practice their controversial

746
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:08,224
Because acceptance of responsibility or showing genuine remorse

747
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
What does that mean

748
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
What's that supposed to look like

749
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
It's subject

750
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,672
Some judges will say well you plead guilty so that's taking responsibility right there

751
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
That's enough for me

752
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
The girls room

753
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Play alone definitely not enough

754
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
He needs to hear you say it

755
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,400
Even better he wants to feel you feeling it

756
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
If you do it's a good bet your sentence will be lighter

757
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
If you deflect responsibility

758
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
We're on the subject

759
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
The sentence could be heavier

760
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,200
The starkest example we saw this with the sentencing of a guy named Rayshawn Ellis

761
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:44,064
Rashawn is 31 he been a defendant in many cases ever since he was a teenager

762
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
Sumter Jazzy Beats

763
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,416
We are before he picked up a new case

764
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Are caught a new case is what everyone says

765
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
If it's a virus

766
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,048
Anyway Rayshawn caught a new case

767
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
Serious charges felonious assault weapons violations

768
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:04,032
Is a messy incident but the just was that a guy shot a gun out the window of Rayshon car while Rayshawn was driving

769
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,664
A fight a broken out early on Judge call me to claim he thought Rayshawn should plead guilty

770
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:16,320
Rayshawn said he wasn't the instigator of this debacle and what's more he tried to deescalate the situation to break up the fight

771
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:21,440
Fight even scared for his own life he said Rachel and took the case to trial

772
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
Anyone mostly

773
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,560
Who is acquitted of the most serious charge felonious assault

774
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,120
But he was convicted on two weapons charges

775
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Both of which carry the possibility of prison.

776
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,520
Because of the gun in the car even though it wasn't Ray Sean's gun

777
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,848
And he didn't fire it the jury found he was still criminally response

778
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
Immediately after the verdict

779
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,712
With the jury still sitting there

780
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
Surgical launch

781
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,088
Rashan he said you should resolve this case a long time ago

782
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
Juicer

783
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
Are going to be looking

784
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
Because I'm not going to put on a screen

785
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,584
A person that sew

786
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,144
Dysfunctional and destructive

787
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,240
It doesn't understand that you should resolve this

788
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
Without risking

789
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,616
23 years on the first count in Fountain

790
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,432
26

791
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,064
I want to pause on this for a second so the perversity of the moment can sink in

792
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,648
Just go is angry at Rishon for refusing to plead guilty

793
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,232
For risking huge prison time on an assault charge

794
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
For which he has just been acquitted

795
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Not guilty

796
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
That's what's dysfunctional indestructo

797
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Refusing to plead

798
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216
And that's what makes Rayshawn deserve prison

799
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,056
A month later Emmanuel winter rash on sentencing

800
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,360
You're curious to see what he was going to get

801
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
It was a Monday morning

802
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Resume was one of his first cases of the day

803
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,760
And already the goal was what

804
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,856
You get indicted and you don't it make your responsibility

805
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
You don't demonstrate any remorse

806
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,024
You know you're going to go to prison on a probation violation because I told you that

807
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
Stroger attorney

808
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
Rachel has been on probation adult

809
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,312
Jungle stop placing arrest after arrest

810
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:18,176
Chad off the child drop the law that ratio on faith ever since he was a juvenile

811
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:22,016
And he in racing the tonnage on his Island start with either getting the facts

812
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
Current case

813
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,624
Don't exasperated not pretend exasperated

814
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
You often see a Chinese performing an argument

815
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
You don't often see a real one

816
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,304
John is insisting that racial and try to do the right thing

817
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
I keep the people around him getting shot

818
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
It's getting hot in the judge

819
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:44,800
What is a party

820
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,104
This goes on and on

821
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,944
Which one is facing five and a half years on the probation violation

822
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,248
Malone never mind the new charges he's

823
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,272
Just been convicted of

824
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
You could add another phone a half years

825
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
So 10 years total

826
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
If it doesn't Stick it to him

827
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,440
This fighting is annoying

828
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Finally

829
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Right cervical says

830
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
So you're sentenced to

831
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
Rachel interrupts

832
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
So you're sentenced to

833
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,384
Michonne takes out a full-page letter

834
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
I'm against reading

835
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Jana just ghoul

836
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,272
One of the girls grow up

837
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,648
What time

838
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
I was wrong

839
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,512
Later

840
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
Back in his Chambers

841
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,608
Jungle Red Palms of the letter aloud to me

842
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,984
Criminal my point of view has been clouded since I was first charged at 16 years old

843
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,056
And I have been angry ever since

844
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,663
I have finally opened my eyes and saw and came to realize

845
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,991
I have been wrong for 15 years

846
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
It has humbled me

847
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
This experience has helped save my life

848
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
And awaken me

849
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
My self-destructive illusions

850
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
You are an outstanding judge

851
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
I'm going to remind you of what you said

852
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,887
Then I could be your son

853
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,727
And I'm not assuming that as favoritism

854
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
That, truly touched me

855
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,591
It made me

856
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Look at you different

857
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
I originally perceived you

858
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,575
To be Prejudiced and never expected you to show me your human

859
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Personal decent

860
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,207
I recognize the wisdom and help you imparted on me

861
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
That was wrong

862
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
And you have been trying to reason with me

863
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,631
To consider my choice

864
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
To associate with the criminal lifestyle

865
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
And it goes on and on and on

866
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
In the courtroom

867
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,335
Rachel meadows letter from heaven 7 minutes

868
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,871
Finished

869
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Does Google stand

870
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
It's really

871
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,207
The criminal equivalent of the Gettysburg Address

872
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,767
He said he wanted to get the letter laminated

873
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
Read it from.

874
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
I found it inspiring

875
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,191
A visit to the courtroom such as

876
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Myself

877
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,775
My considerations letter at Brigham strategic move

878
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
While also wondering if it just goes up

879
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
Play it

880
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
Adjust goal believe letter was genuine

881
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
He was moved

882
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
He said to Rachel on

883
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,295
It's not possible for anyone to fake what you just said

884
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,111
It was gratifying

885
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
Of course it was

886
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,207
But I think it was also maybe vindicating for

887
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
Because I'm in bed.

888
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,559
Alphabet in the room a few weeks earlier

889
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
When do the fender and quarter go racist

890
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,471
Just go new I've been squinting uncomfortably farangs in the stereotyping

891
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,519
Announce he was proof

892
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Gold method what

893
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,383
Just go with emotional about The Optimist

894
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,967
You mentioned the Bible story about the good thief who was redeemed

895

Jokes app

896
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
So

897
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
There may be

898
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
Some Redemption

899
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
He certainly on Earth

900
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
To change his attitude

901
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,815
Map my email

902
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,119
He may amount to something email

903
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Because of Alaska

904
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,215
Michelin tires on Santa Fe in half

905
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,543
The school was going to give him 6 and 1/2 of 7 years he said

906
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Instead

907
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,847
Gave him three

908
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
And I told Rachel

909
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,455
Come back in six months and apply for judicial release

910
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
Tony's chocolate

911
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,063
When cutting someone lose he's learned his lesson

912
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
Off of the Shocker prison

913
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
The six-month Seaside

914
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Follow motion

915
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
Maybe I'll smoke you out

916
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,935
Six months to the day John is an enrichment attorney did file a motion for shock release

917
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
Rashawn Amazon over there

918
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
But lack the magic of the sentencing

919
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:05,151
Instead just culture alterations criminal record all over again

920
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
So much prior involvement with the system

921
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,063
Cruelty to animals that jumps off the page anyone that would do that to an animal

922
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,207
Rashawn pushback it wasn't me I was 14 years old and someone shot a cat on my porch with a BB gun and I didn't tell

923
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,279
What are the aggravated robbery in 2001

924
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
Well that one I didn't do it but I was there so I got caught

925
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
And then the crime at hand

926
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,727
Accused Rayshawn of knowing about the gun

927
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,263
Does putting other people in danger

928
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,847
Rashawn said it wasn't like that to go side wiring minimizing

929
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
The Gettysburg Address

930
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
Wasn't echoing in anyone's ears

931
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,759
Just call denied Rayshawn motion for judicial release

932
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:47,647
I'm denying your motion for shock probation at this time he said because you are not accepting responsibility

933
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,207
And therefore you're not demonstrating any remorse

934
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
Try again in six months you told him

935
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,047
See if your attitude has changed

936
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,911
It was all over I talk to Rashaan about how this whole thing went down

937
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,727
He told me he still hadn't made sense of it

938
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,079
Just go ahead all the promised to shock him out if he did well in prison and he had done well

939
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,151
Six months earlier when he wrote the letter

940
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,223
He said it was partly sincere partly political

941
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
Annuity structured call Diego

942
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,807
He behaves like a king he

943
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,647
He wants you to do no honor him

944
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,695
So you can see from this picture yesterday

945
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
But at the hearing for shock release

946
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,423
He figured they were past the stage of flattery in theater

947
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,007
Who's taking a bath when judge calls started in on the details of his

948
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Does case

949
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
Rayshawn said he kept trying to talk to

950
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Man to man

951
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,431
Respect you as an individual in the position at

952
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
Vodka tonic

953
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,423
What you want me to tell you

954
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,799
Rashawn didn't feel as if judge kollra leading him down the road toward responsibility and Redemption

955
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,359
You felt as if dead girl simply wanted submission

956
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
Furzone sake

957
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
Rashawn surgical quotes

958
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Struck me as nothing less

959
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,247
In a raging slave Mass

960
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,111
Such a nice way

961
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,255
I'm not scared of you

962
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,775
He wanted it this way or no way and it was just like

963
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,639
But it is Judge calls way or no way

964
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,711
That's the maddening Corkscrew operations position

965
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,527
Jungle shouldn't require him to grovel

966
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
Michelle's right about that

967
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,367
But there's nothing Rayshawn can do about it

968
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,927
Is Rayshawn is the one who broke the law

969
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
Everything judge calls doing

970
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Is legal

971
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,703
What you're wondering

972
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,775
The judge call ever get in trouble for the way he runs his room

973
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:16,639
Is there a rain did well let me tell you about this one last case just quickly

974
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,479
Was back in 2015 so I wasn't there for it but I do have a transcript

975
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
A guy named Carlton heard with indicted for shooting

976
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,111
He said he didn't do it you want to go to trial

977
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,951
After being postponed a few times day of trial finally comes

978
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
Enchroma hurts attorney asks

979
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,279
For another continuance

980
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,095
Because he said Mr herd had just informed him

981
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Half hour ago

982
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
But he's been covering up for the real shooter

983
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,727
So now they need more time to investigate

984
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,311
Judge Gaul does not take kindly to this motion to

985
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Continue

986
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,151
He thinks his last-minute new evidence claim is bogus

987
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,943
He sure they're just trying to delay

988
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
He does what he does

989
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
Which is to excoriate Mr hard

990
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,063
For being black among other things

991
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
Your black life didn't matter to you did it and

992
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,463
Your child's going to grow up and I'm speculating now just like you did without a dad

993
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
Did you have a father

994
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
Knossos Carlton heard

995
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
No of course not

996
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,959
But then even by judge Gaul standards judge Gaul veers out of bounds

997
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,495
He says to Colin herd

998
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
You're either going to go to trial right now

999
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
Are you going to plead guilty

1000
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,151
Current herd hadn't asked for a plea deal

1001
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
The state had not offered

1002
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
No matter

1003
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,783
Judge call comes up with his own deal for cotton hurt

1004
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,343
He says if you plead no contest

1005
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
To the indictment right now

1006
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
I'll sentence you to 14 years

1007
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,743
Quote if you take the case to trial and are convicted

1008
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,047
You will do multiples of 14 years

1009
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,375
Because if you're convicted of these charges that's what you deserve

1010
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,471
You deserve to spend what could be the rest of your life in the state penal Institution

1011
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
What's it going to be

1012
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,823
Colin herd says

1013
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
I'll go to trial

1014
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,383
His mom works out no

1015
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,943
Carlton says to her listen to what he just said

1016
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,503
14 years seems like forever to Carlton

1017
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
Little daughter will be 18 when it

1018
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
Got out

1019
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
But his mom was hearing the other number

1020
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
Multiples

1021
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
14 if he's convicted at trial

1022
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,487
They confer for bit off the Record

1023
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:13,375
Ended girl tells them at length about another case he had in which he offered a couple of knuckleheads

1024
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
Ideal they didn't take

1025
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:19,007
I had the same conversation with them and having with you they said right there right in that chair

1026
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,359
I told him I said look you can do 15 years or if you're convicted of all this other stuff

1027
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
You're going to get consecutive time

1028
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,967
They both got sentenced to 78 years

1029
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,783
Just relax again weather Carlton wants to

1030
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
To plead

1031
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
I didn't do it

1032
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Colin herd

1033
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,671
The girl says look you want to go to trial go to trial

1034
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:41,791
You have a beautiful suit on you can sit there and maybe the jury will think you're a great guy and you're not guilty

1035
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,815
What do you want to do

1036
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
There's a pause

1037
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
Alright let's bring the jury up

1038
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Circle says

1039
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
The jury is on its way

1040
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,775
They walk into this room I deal with you is off

1041
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
I'll take it

1042
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
Mountain heart

1043
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,383
It was like an hour and everything

1044
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
Ritz Carlton

1045
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
I asked him why he said yes.

1046
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,783
He told me his mother persuaded him they could fight it

1047
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
But they could appeal

1048
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
But they did

1049
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,903
Cuz it was like what he was saying

1050
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,767
We just know that's not nothing that a judge really could be saying he ain't going to be

1051
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,559
Saying and doing none of that

1052
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
The court of appeals agreed

1053
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,983
I got the sense reading their decision that the justices restraining to contain their displeasure

1054
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,335
Aplia supposed to be knowingly intelligently and voluntarily made

1055
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:32,735
That's the standard the fact that judge Gaul participated in the play by itself that's not necessarily unconscious

1056
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
Traditional

1057
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
The way judge called today

1058
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:39,903
Can caulking the flea on his own without even asking the prosecutor the defense attorney

1059
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,951
When you add in the pressure that threats

1060
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,559
The way he made it obvious he thought Carlton was guilty before even seeing a scrap of evidence

1061
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,911
The only thing Carlton heard could have knowingly and intelligently concluded the court said

1062
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,519
Was that he was unlikely to get either a fair trial or a fair sentence after trial

1063
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
Hermitage Golf

1064
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,639
Under those circumstances they said the plea was not voluntary

1065
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
It was coerced

1066
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
Unconstitutional

1067
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:10,111
And then took the extraordinary step of ordering that Carlton hurts case be reassigned

1068
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
To a different judge

1069
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,999
Forcefulness of the court of appeals decision was remarkable

1070
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,047
Then something more remarkable happen

1071
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,119
This summer almost 3 years after being locked up

1072
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,215
Carlton heard went to trial this time in front of Judge John Russo

1073
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,775
He was acquitted of all charges

1074
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
So

1075
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
What is this mean for judge call

1076
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
For the moment

1077
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:34,943
Nothing

1078
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,039
I asked her to go whether he felt he'd screwed up and crawling hurts case

1079
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
An answer

1080
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
No

1081
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,111
To me he said

1082
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,439
This isn't a case about an innocent man being railroaded by the system

1083
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:52,095
It's a case that clearly demonstrates how defendant and his attorney manipulated the system of justice to their benefit and betta murder

1084
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,887
Attempted murder

1085
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,983
Today Carlton was acquitted I called judge Russo

1086
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,615
He presided over the trial but he's also the administrative judge for the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas

1087
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,943
He's not just ghost boss but he is the public face of

1088
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
At the court

1089
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,783
I called him on his cell right when you got home from the trial

1090
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
Is there any

1091
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
Consequence

1092
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,415
For judge Gaul because of

1093
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Desk

1094
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,487
I mean there isn't from me

1095
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,303
So I don't know he's a colleague

1096
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
Until I die

1097
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:27,423
I don't reprimand or sanction him as in any way

1098
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,495
After the verdict when Carlton heard was acquitted

1099
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,543
Did Rousseau had apologized to him

1100
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,847
Said coercion has no place in the system

1101
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
Etc

1102
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,199
Teresa clearly disapproved of how judge Gaul had handled the case

1103
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,039
But now on the phone with me he was having rather me lie about that

1104
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:49,183
What seems frustrating is that there isn't some automatic now review or some automatic

1105
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:53,279
Yeah something vestigation something I mean

1106
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,815
I've seen him do this and

1107
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,095
His courtroom to other people

1108
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,471
And if you're just doing that

1109
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
Somebody needs to be later

1110
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,335
There's a process

1111
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
Whatever that's why I said says it has

1112
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
By somebody

1113
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,551
I would argue that judge Russo is a somebody

1114
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:19,135
I talked to another Cuyahoga County Judge who was outraged by this case

1115
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,415
He's a somebody

1116
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,487
A couple of attorneys on this case whom I also spoke to

1117
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,023
There's somebody's

1118
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:29,119
The court of appeals judges who ruled in this case one of those somebody's

1119
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,495
If any of these somebody's is afraid of reprisal from Judge Gall they can even complain anonymously

1120
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
Did the Ohio Supreme Court

1121
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
There's a state board on Grievances and discipline that has the authority to investigate and sanction judges just farther Madness

1122
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,807
There goes actually been through that process once before in 2010

1123
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
I won't give you the details but suffice it to say the Supreme Court Justices were appalled by what judge call had done and said in that

1124
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
And then

1125
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,047
They gave him a fairly minor reprimand

1126
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:01,375
A six-month suspended suspension of his law license

1127
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,167
Meaning he was able to stay on the bed

1128
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:09,823
As of right now I've not heard that anyone has filed a complaint with the Supreme Court against judge Gaul because of hurricane

1129
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,431
Nothing about the case has been reported in the local newspaper or on TV

1130
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
No one's picketing outside

1131
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
This courtroom

1132
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,039
So just cause not to worry

1133
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,855
He's been on the bench for 27 plus years

1134
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
I take my role as per

1135
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,023
Protecting the peace and dignity of the state of Ohio very very seriously and I wasn't elected to be stupid

1136
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:33,119
He's being lied to is not going to sit back and pretend it's not happening

1137
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
I wasn't

1138
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
6 * to be a dumbass

1139
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,567
As long as the voters keep voting for him then he's going to Keep On Keepin On

1140
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103
He's right

1141
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,919
Yes there's the appeals court and the discipline board

1142
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,015
But really every 6 years it's the voters who had the final say

1143
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,831
Voters here. Everywhere

1144
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
It's understood that

1145
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
What are they now

1146
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:00,767
For decades facing the same Irish and Italian names on the ballot almost all Democrats

1147
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,583
What's a Russo / a Corrigan / Gallagher

1148
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
I could even keep them straight

1149
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,935
Mostly the voters are casting their ballots

1150
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,519
And then staying far far away from the felony Courthouse

1151
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,799
It doesn't touch that

1152
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
And they don't touch it

1153
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,383
Until there's a Shockwave

1154
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:21,247
Crime and Punishment Shockwave the Billows out across the city

1155
