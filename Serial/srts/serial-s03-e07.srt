How you been man

32
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:11,584
They talked through the new misdemeanor charges Jesse picked up

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,936
And also about whether Jesse's feuding with the East Cleveland Police might lead to a lawsuit

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,032
Scott Ramsey paste around his cluttered office while Jesse fill them in

Explaining the arrest at the block party on the 4th of July

36
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
How I felt like the police harassed him unfairly

37
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,112
My shoulder got injured at the hospital with 5 tickets

38
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
How many showed up in court to deal with those tickets

39
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
The police arrested him again

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
And he says to him in a locker room with no bathroom for 2 days

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,960
What can I use the bathroom can I use the bathroom can I use the bathroom

42
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
Emmanuel and I heard Jesse I've been locked in that same room where the East Cleveland Police had put Arnold black with his 22

43
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Billion dollar verdict

44
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,712
We thought there's Jesse's lawsuit right there no

45
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
How could that not be a giant settlement waiting to happen

46
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,392
Scott Ramsey wasn't that interested in the holding cell story didn't seem outraged by it

47
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
You got it might be hard to prove

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
Instead he wanted to hear more about the other thing

49
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
4th of July

50
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,632
From Jesse's description it did sound like maybe the police had targeted him

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Maybe that could lead to civil action

52
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,032
Okay let me ask let me ask a couple of questions the thing on

53
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
The incident on the 4th what proof do we have that it happen

54
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,712
I have several videos I stole videos

55
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
And they have videos

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,112
And then you and then also you have video from people's cameras and probably

57
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Somebody cams is that what you're talking about

58
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
Scott Ramsey tells Jesse to gather video evidence

59
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Find witnesses

60
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
7 to 10 people would be good he says

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Preferably people without criminal records

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
And then he'll assess the potential

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Her lawsuit

64
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,968
But I'm past it became obvious Scott Ramsey wasn't going to file a new lawsuit

65
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
Jesse didn't produce the evidence Scott Ramsey task 4

66
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,624
But also Jesse as a client was proving a slippery bat

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,208
His legal troubles came to Blossom Anew every couple months

68
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
Not just any Cleveland but in other municipalities

69
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,375
Jesse told Emmanuel about a case he was especially worried about

70
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
And Euclid

71
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
So the cops are pulled him over for no reason he has to Manuel to come to court with him so he could see for himself with Jesse

72
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
He was up against

00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359

When is a misdemeanor ticket

85
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
But Jesse didn't have a seatbelt on

86
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,551
He was driving without a license

87
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,695

Jesse's planta de whatsoever schools

180
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
One more time

181
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Except

182
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Capri deal

183
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,207
So once you all want to you what's the strategy here what are you going to say to her

184
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,047
Tell her the truth she asked me while driving telling the truth

185
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
Could you pass a drug test today

186
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
Why would I have to

187
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:23,359
I'm just saying this is Aniya Ryan when she asks how often you take drugs right

188
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Hawaii

189

Images of people that's quite a bit

190
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
Honesty test for defense

191
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
You bought a drug test today

192
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Are you can pause

193
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
That's the one right now

194
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
You couldn't fall

195
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
I'm sorry Speak Out

196
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Still Jessie

197
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
It smelled like his shadow would fail a drug test

198
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Told me no

199
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
He's going to play it straight

200
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,471
He thinks does a battle respect

201
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Fast forward an hour or so

202
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
And if I drove past you today you're going to be positive right

203
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,967
Oh you're not when's the last time you had smoked weed

204
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
Oh you think it's clear from your system

205
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,071
I called pasta drug test at the event.

206
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
I need to get back on the right track

207
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Because means

208
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
Where is Gordon Ramsay from

209
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
You told me on Friday you have him here

210
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Yeah

211
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
He wasn't able to make it

212
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,271
Dublin baranoff Jesse if he has anything to say from

About his son being born prematurely

216

00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
Does the baron is not moved

218
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
So you're driving home with the

219
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
Open container Smirnoff Ice in the center console

220
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,151
I didn't know that was there

221
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943
Fruity drink I did not mean

222
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,807
Let me know what it is that I don't think that but I did have some

223
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,415
But I did not yet and this is how you're going to go see your child

224
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839

Ben doesn't balance stop poking about Jesse's

226
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Try this life

227
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,031
And how many open suspensions did you have on that day

228
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
I hope you

229
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
9

230
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
9

231
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,343
Although people walking around with multiple drivers license suspensions

Hypnosis

233
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
Which I want to talk about for 1 picks I can have

234
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Because it's a real trap

Tiltonsville Ohio Criminal Court

236
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
One that judges seem to hate

237
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
I'm at snags lots of people

238
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
Especially poor people who live in urban areas

239
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Use hot wax

240
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
I grew up in Ohio

241
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,127
Law of Ohio but it is a terrible place to try to function without being able to drive

242
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
Perhaps in part for that very reason the State of Mind. Revoking someone's drivers license is a great wave

243
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
To get her attention for any number of things

00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,975

People with suspension don't have one Spencer

Mabry

252
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
On average

253
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
Because people keep driving

254
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,391
Be hard not to and every time you're caught driving on a suspended license

255
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
You get another suspension is an escalating series of penalties mandatory BMV fees and 5

256
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
Find me a payday loan company

257

00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,055
Jeffy he didn't even know how much he owed

260
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,359
I called around to various municipal

261
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
Added up my potential BMV call

262
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
And I'd say Jesse could I would much as $10,000

263
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,343
He told me he's trying from time to time the 10th of the Seas

264
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,415
Paid one fine here going on a payment plan.

265
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,255
But I'm afraid he's going to probably never be able to settle his

266
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,655
Valid driver's license

267
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,775
Okay

268
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
Tactical

269
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Mucus

270
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
Jeffy thinking of weed

271
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
Is offering to be guilty to 2 out of 8 challenges

272
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
Does Alabama accept

273
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:51,647
Men she wanted out loud whether Jesse would be a good candidate for probation instead of a jail sentence

274
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,511
Conclusions of the bound comes to is no no he would not

275
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,655
All you're going to do is argue with a probation officer over anything that I may order in this case

276
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
Kind of like you did with the officers

277
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
When they place you under arrest

278
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,895
And your kind of get the jail with the Corrections Officers

279
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
My contacts at the jail River Corrections Officers Jesse off

280
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
Does a bond refreshes memory

281
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
She takes out a police report from Jessie the rapper

282
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
When I hadn't seen

283
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
Well they were transporting YouTube

284
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,535
The jail do you remember your lovely comments to the officers

285
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:37,215
You're racist you and your partner that's why they call you pigs f*** you n****

286
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
Suck you over and over in the car

287
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,199
Then at the jail you're asking the officers in front of the Corrections Officers

288
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
What do you want to see him strip

289
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Search me you f****** f*****

290
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Want to see my dick

291
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,719
It's really quite bracing to hear Midwestern white ladies I'll be Inward and more

292
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
An open call

293
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
Mike listening to your 4th grade teacher read a Quentin Tarantino script

294
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
But just let down is not shy

295
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
On Jessie from what I can tell

296
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Is embarrassed

297
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
Looks resigned and small was just about attendances then

298
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,151
Hundred dollars in fines 40 hours of community service

299
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
And does nine suspensions

300
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Congratulations just appearances

301
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
You just bought suspension number 10

302
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
In the state of Ohio

303
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Genesis Jesse

304
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
The five days in jail

305
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Jesse tilts his head back

306
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
House designs

307
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,047
Are the bailiff places in handcuffs

308
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
I need some away

309
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:50,431
I want to tell you what ended up happening with Aramis Spencer the guy with the blunt I got arrested

310
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Sit in the hallway of his own apartment building

311
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,783
And put in the hospital by two police officers

312
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,391
Because Aramis and Jesse obviously their experiences with the police

313
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
At the hands of police

314
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
Are very different and they're very different people

315
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
But in certain ways their cases Echo each other

316
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
The aftershocks

317
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Especially

318
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
If you remember Aramis was trying to get rid of his criminal charges

319
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
So they could file a civil lawsuit

320
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
The resisting arrest was a sticking point

321
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
He was going to plead to it

322
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
The city was going to drop it

323
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
They're at a standoff

324
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
The trial date was set

325
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
And then at video came out

326
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
The one that Aramis is lawyer called a miracle

327
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
Manna From Heaven

328
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Only legally speaking

329
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Of course

330
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
In every other way the video was horrible

331
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
It showed a white Euclid Police Officer

332
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
Michael amiott the same one from aramis's case

333
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,167
Beating the crap out of a young black guy during a traffic stop

334
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
Seemingly without provocation

335
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,543
The guy in the video actually videos there are several

336
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Richard Hubbard the Third

337
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
You can see Hubbard splayed out on the asphalt

338
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,247
Officer amiott on top of him punching in the face with both arms

339
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Right left

340
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
Right left

341
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,415
You see Harper's girlfriend on her hands and knees slapping the ground just a few feet away from them

342
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Screaming for it to stop

343
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Pretty soon the story was in The Washington Post

344
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
The New York Post the LA Times CNN

345
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
They did the same thing to me

346
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
I mean it seems like they're going from one to another

347
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
When Aramis watched it

348
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
He recognized with bitterness

349
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
The beating in that video

350
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
The series of moves the officers make

351
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,967
Officer amiott straightaway tries to kick Richard Hubbard in the crotch

352
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
Guess I don't know maybe that's a new procedure and Euclid

353
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:37,183
Maybe they beg you to tell you to the ground and need you and kick you in the face and pays you and I

354
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
Maybe I don't know maybe that's the new procedure you could I don't know

355
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
Aramis is civil attorney Paul cristallo

356
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,935
Figured the Hubbard video would persuade the city of Euclid to drop the resisting

357
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Maybe drop everything

358
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,847
Because how are you going to put an officer on the stand who's been suspended for excessive force

359
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
Who it turned out that had to resign from his previous job at the mentor Police Department

360
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
For lying about a traffic stop

361
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
Crisp uniform

362
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,879
Officer amiott probably would look like a bad egg if he testified

363
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,279
Few weeks went by Euclid did not drop the whole thing

364
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,399
September 7th 2017 has had his final pre-trial date in Euclid

365
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Is it Thursday

366
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,263
The trial is scheduled for Monday for days from now

367
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,103
Spiros gonakis Armistice criminal attorney was running around the courthouse

368
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Haggling over the most recent plea offer

369
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
Irma's arrived with his mother

370
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Cali

371
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,063
They're a little tense understandably they weren't sure what was about to happen

372
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,903
They've been fighting these charges for a long time 9 months

373
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
That was all very real

374
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:47,071
The prospect that if they couldn't work something out today and Aramis ended up a trial and was convicted at trial

375
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
He could get jail time

376
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Spiros walks over

377
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
Ocean City wants to speak to Aramis and Khalid

378
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Can I come over now

379
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
No I'm not okay

380
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,895
They step outside the building I can see them through the plate-glass windows

381
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
Spiros gesticulating

382
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,247
Amazon Kelly listening nodding

383
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Where does circulating

384
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Or nodding

385
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
The comeback Inn

386
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Is the judge raining out

387
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
We all go into the courtroom

388
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,791
Chattanooga

389
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,119
The prosecutor's table with a guest prosecutor

390
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
A woman named Sara fanelli from a fancy Cleveland law firm

391
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,311
After the scandal with officer amiott Euclid it harder to deal with air masses case

392
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
You already know the judge

393
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Deborah lebarron

394
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:38,783
Hey my understanding is a plea agreement has been reached is that correct that is correct or on her

395
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
And The Plea is

396
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
Renaissance Festival

397
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,767
At this time is my understanding was responsible if not guilty

398
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,839
I prayed for your guilty to a drug abuse charge

399
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
For the balances

400
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
Emergent dismissed at his

401
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,239
After all the struggle over these four charges

402
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
And the Civil Rights Secrets they contain

403
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
We landed here

404
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,407
There was a sting in a last-ditch disorderly conduct

405
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Just the weed

406
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:13,855
So you're just messing counts b c and d the theft the resisting arrest in the criminal damaging is that correct

407
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
That is correct

408
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Churchill Baron checks with Aramis

409
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Is that correct

410
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Yes your honor

411
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
Just him if he's using marijuana

412
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
She says no

413
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
But he stopped after the incident

414
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Bowser is trying to get a job

415
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,008
Armistice mother Kali is moving around in her seat in the gallery

416
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,104
You seem like you want to say something to me do you

417
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Adult

418
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,968
Just a few minutes ago out in the lobby before court started

419
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
Counting I've been talkin

420
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
She's got four grown sons

421
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Foreclosed family

422
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,416
She's been right there with Aramis every step of this case

423
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
She told me

424
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
The police don't realize

425
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
One day this could happen to one of their children

426
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Someway somehow she said

427
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
Excessive force

428
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
It has to stop

429
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,008
I said I could care less about anything else that's my mango

430
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,664
Just to stop it I mean I'm not trying to throw the old race car that's another I just wanted to be fixed because

431
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
MSN police are bad

432
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,576
But if the system don't fix the ones as bad then

433
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
They made the whole system is corrupt

434
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
What you want us as a society

435
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,792
To fix what's going on in our home but you don't want to fix what's going on in your home

436
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Okay

437
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
Enough is enough

438
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
She talked about the beating her son took

439
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,520
What it was like for her to see him in a hospital bed

440
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
His face disfigured

441
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:41,152
How she felt blessed she hadn't been called to come view her son's body that day

442
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,504
Callie was about to address the judge for the first time

443
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
I thought

444
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Here Comes

445
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Even though it was a bad accident happened

446
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
I'm glad because

447
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,768
I've been trying to get my son off of marijuana for years

448
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,328
Hebron cleaner 67

449
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
I couldn't ask for

450
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
A better paint for me

451
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,288
Is to see my son back like he was

452
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Send him offer

453
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,432
Marijuana and everything else

454
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Surplus

455
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
But that I'm fat

456
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,184
And I appreciate your comments me I'm unfortunately sometimes it takes something bad to happen for something good to

457
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
You come out of it

458
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,840
You know what you know

459
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,960
Well I see mr. Spencer you afraid supporting your mother

460
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
And you're very lucky to have that

461
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,848
On the drug abuse charge I found you guilty

462
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,920
It'll be $150 and cost

463
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Spiros it said it to

464
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,784
This incident he told the judge has helped Aramis

465
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
He's been clean off marijuana

466
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Straighten out

467
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
He's just happy to put this matter behind him

468
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
The elephant in the room

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
Kicking

470
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,584
Teasing the two hospitals the broken orbital bone

471
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
All of it had suddenly shrunk

472
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
To the size of a bulge

473
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
What size bolts

474
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
Is it this whole ugly Endeavor was only about getting Aramis off of weed

475
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,408
Aramis near the truth of it of course

476
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,040
Later outside the courthouse he give me a ride smile and say I'll take what I can get

477
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,880
In This Moment Kelly was flooded with maternal relief

478
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:31,488
She walked over to Sara fanelli the visiting prosecutor and gave her a hug

479
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,168
The hug not the end of the story

480
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728

I wear yellow tuxedo every single day I step it up when you put yourself

485
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
A few years ago Jesse bought a minor league baseball team in Savannah Georgia and name them the Savannah bananas

486
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:14,752
He thought he could make Minor League Baseball more popular than making the games this crazy circus of fun

487
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:19,104
We started thinking we could have a senior citizen dance team called the banana Nana's

488
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:27,040
I knew we gave away a porta-john at the game the other day when they're on their knees and crawling

489
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
The crowd and it's very scandalous

490
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
I'll tell you you remember it

491
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160

And they loved it

493
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Just two years

494
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
Bananas went from selling a single ticket for game

495
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,376
Selling out every single game of every single season

496
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,984

Impala first taking me to meet Aramis back at the end of 26

524
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
16

525
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:18,400
Is there a driving home he'd impressed on me how enduring the consequences of a beating can be

526
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,472
Pulse talk to a lot of people who've been hurt by police officer

527
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Officers or Corrections Officers

528
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
And he said it's not something that's over

529
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Even when it's over

530
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,944
When when you are seriously injured by the police when your

531
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,504
Send to the hospital and isn't just

532
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,296

It'll it'll

535
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
That this will mess with him

536
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,768
Like if you stick with the story and we follow them

537
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
You'll see

538
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Understood the broad Strokes of what Paul was saying

539
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,680
But there'd be some kind of fall out over time

540
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Psychological Fallout

541
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
I wasn't sure what that was going to look like

542
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,616
A few weeks after Aramis is Criminal Case ended

543
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,944
All told me about a confusing conversation he had with Aramis

544
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,040
During which air mass was repeating certain things about what happened in his hallway

545
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,832
Different for looping in his head

546
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,416
Call Callie to ask whether she noticed the same thing

547
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,256
Over and over and over again

548
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Wow

549
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
As if it happened yesterday

550
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Nru

551
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
Like how worried are you

552
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
About him very

553
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
Oh really hairy

554
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Other mothers

555
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:38,272
It's not easy watching your child go through this and you better have nowhere

556
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
Anime

557
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
For me it's like he has trust levels

558
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Not there no more

559
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:54,144
Any time something comes up in the news she said or maybe they're watching a movie together what used to be a joy for her

560
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:59,008
Now if something comes up related to police violence or government corruption

561
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
She's worried about air masses reaction

562
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,384
First thing he'll say is see I told you

563
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Can't trust nobody

564
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
It's like

565
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
I may be angry

566
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,624
You get to talk and you can eat his voice gets loud yuca

567
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,672
Filled up

568
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
A sense of Rage

569
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
And his child now

570
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,328
His body language is totally different

571
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,120
What's your fear

572
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,424
For him if he's kind of

573
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
Got that rage and anger

574
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,872
He's got some for now he's not really afraid of the street

575
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
Aramis is hurting she said

576
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,392
In the shape of that hurt seems to be a need to prove to everyone around him

577
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
He's not a punk

578
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Chicago's biggest fear now

579
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,072
Is it'll take that hurt and that need out into the streets

580
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
And deploy them where they don't belong

581
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,704
Kelly's is none of her sons have been in the streets growing up

582
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
This is new for her

583
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
For them

584
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,592
She never thought this kind of thing would happen to her family

585
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
But she said suddenly you are that family

586
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
What is happening to

587
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Officer Michael amiott the cop in Hermes case

588
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:29,120
Was fired from the Euclid Police Department more use-of-force incidents and come to light

589
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,936
Including a Dreadful thing in the Euclid Public Library

590
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:38,336
Body cam video showed him taking a 16 year old girl wearing a backpack to the ground face-first while she was in handcuffs

591
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
Couture down with his knee

592
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,688
Small child is watching shrieking

593
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,760
Amy outstayed fired for about a year

594
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:51,136
I need appeal determination and just recently an arbitrator sided with him

595
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,464
Officer amiott should be back on YouTube police force any day

596
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,192
Paul cristallo did end up filing a lawsuit on behalf of Hermes

597
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:09,056
Against the city of Euclid police officers and are misses apartment building

598
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,920
Sir finale the guest prosecutor who Kelly hugged defended the city of Euclid

599
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
This past summer they settled

600
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:21,088
Neither the city nor the officers admitted liability Aramis got $50,000

601
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,184
Wasn't as much as Paulette hoped but you felt it was the best ever going to do

602
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,024
Become Rocky he picked up a few new charges

603
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
Marijuana but also domestic violence

604
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Are all misdemeanors

605
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
Still

606
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,752
I don't want to make excuses for whatever Aramis might have done

607
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
And to be clear neither did Paul

608
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,152
But I did ask call whether he thought there was a connection between then and now

609
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
Was this what he was talking about

610
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
Back in December of twenty

611
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
16 when he told me

612
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
This will mess with him

613
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
If you stick with the story and we follow him

614
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
You'll see

615
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Paul said

616
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
I don't know

617
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
I really don't know

618
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,792
In a Civil Trial

619
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
Assuming you win

620
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
The jury has to figure out damages

621
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
That's the final stage of Reckoning

622
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,752
Cause leaf stone effect leads to compensation

623
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
For the damaged on you

624
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,384
Financially physically to fairly rational calculus

625
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
How do you quantify the intangible damage a cop does

626
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Dear sense of the world

627
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
Your sense of yourself

628
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,320
Money kicks your ass

629
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,416
And then what if it's not one cause that's led to the damage

630
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
What if there are many causes

631
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,232
Many effects

632
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
I tried to call and message Aramis

633
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352
I got worth RuPaul

634
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,400
Hermiston plan on calling me back

635
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,216
He said he didn't have any interest in that right now

636
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Jesse Nickerson now

637
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Different story

638
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
Does he have a lot to say to a manual

639
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
About causes and effects

640
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
I'm going to hand you back to Emmanuel now

641
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
4 months

642
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,856
Jessie continue to rack up all kinds of tickets in Georgia

643
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
Including a child for menacing in East Cleveland police officer at a gas station

644
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,304
Life is hard about this thing honestly

645
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
My fault

646
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
The police have a hat-trick of Jessie

647
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,728
They're probably arresting him and he gave it back

648
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
Morphine to come alive

649
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,408
Yeah you can find it a call

650
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
But it was nothing really

651
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Party time

652
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
The video what happened

653
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
It really threw me

654
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
It was not time

655
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
Video is from a body cam

656
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,816
Fat David Duncan in East Cleveland police officer was wearing

657
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:43,424
In it you can see that Duncan standing inside a gas station convenience store

658
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Right by the entrance

659
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
Men's Jetty interview

660
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
The frame

661
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
Coming from the back of the shop carrying a drink

662
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,640
Jesse's gets everyone in line at the register

663
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,688
Put some money down on the counter

664
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
Anime wolf paws Duncan the wolf the door stop cussing him out

665
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm sorry you got it you want I ain't did nothing to you rather

666
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
Manhattan brother

667
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
Jesse leave the store but then comes back in

668
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,168
He walks with Duncan and then backs up

669
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
Opening the door just to leave again and again

670
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,824
As Duncan tell Jesse he never did anything to him

671
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,712
If he's trying to start something with Dunkin dunkin's really not going for it but Jesse's relentless

672
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
You need to stop the people in cops Jesse says

673
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,928
You account

674
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,000
Nothing to you

675
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:46,400
Jeff emotions about the Parthenon

676
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Videos shocking

677
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
Jesse so aggressive

678
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,968
I didn't understand it didn't understand what get before he was doing

679
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:06,368
Or in the walls you could possibly get from going out to a cult this way I'm even more trouble

680
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
Few hours off I got the video I met up with Jesse to talk about it

681
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,608
You're right I guess you can smoking weed in his car

682
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
In the parking lot at a train and bus station will Windermere

683
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
Right in the middle of East Cleveland

684
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
A lot of people seem to come and hang out

685
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,688
Jesse and I got in his car and watch the video

686
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,784
We got to the part where Jesse seems to be challenging Duncan to fight

687
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,880
What are you asking him to do that

688
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
I'm telling him I'm telling him

689
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,488
To address the issue I'm I'm I'm saying

690
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,280
I'm fed up basically

691
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,864
I'm fed up with you people putting your hands on me

692
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,424
That's why I'm saying like being mad then come on

693
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
I'm not saying

694
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,800
I'm going to beat your ass right now I'm saying you all saying like

695
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
Step outside

696
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
Repeat

697
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,456
I'm telling him to take off his s*** and what do you mean take off his ship

698
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Take office

699
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,528
Take off his armor is bad

700
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
And all that

701
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,624
And be a man like what is that mean be a man

702
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
I'm sad cuz

703
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
Cuz obviously

704
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,512
Everytime later ran into me they didn't beat me up water handcuffs

705
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
I guess

706
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,704
It's confusing to me because I'm the one who had you said I don't want any business of these police I'm going about my business I'm not

707
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
Do anything illegal

708
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,264
Entrusting me

709
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Button

710
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
It seems like

711
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,920
But it seems like you are. You're harassing this officer right now

712
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Like you'll starting

713
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
If I did

714
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,136
Jessie reminded me that David Duncan wasn't some random East Eden police officer

715
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
Duncan was the officer who don't approve a crowd of people on the 4th of July

716
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,792
Let everyone else alone

717
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Grab Jess

718
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
It was Duncan who dragged it into the car

719
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,704
It was Duncan on the body cam from that night

720
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Who stood over Jessie

721
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
Insisting that Jesse and hurt himself

722
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:06,688
I did feel a bat shouting in pain

723
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,136
Jesse also told me he was dunking even before that

724
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:19,744
Wind office in Devils Lake off of gave Jesse's phone number to the name Dixon

725
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,816
1 cycle mean Jesse in the park

726
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,888
Getting on the police department to complain about nipples

727
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,544
How many did it was always a Dunkin Jesse said he spoke to Jesse said Duncan often who he wanted to complain

728
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,896
Saying about when Jesse told him Neville's just he said Duncan told him

729
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
The f*** out of here

730
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:45,600
I tried to talk to Duncan talked about his various interactions of Jessie of the police department refused to make him

731
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:52,000
Available Jesse told me as a rule is Never back down from a fight except if a police

732
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
Sure

733
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,352
Before his mouth of it then but he never full back physically

734
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:02,752
Moana park at the name Dixon July 9th when he says they threw him in the holding

735
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,104
Jesse felt like a bullies were bullying him and he was just

736
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
Taking it

737
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,944
Not have been boring in more and more

738
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,784
Another timer a hangout at Windermere

739
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,392
Jesse told me he's been having dreams about being back in the park with the name and the avocado

740
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,976
We live in the moment the name to challenge him to a fight

741
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,560
It sounded like these dreams will one pop flashback

742
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,376
One pot fantasy about how things might have gone differently

743
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,216
The situation probably would have worked out for the best or the worst

744
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
If I would have defended myself like

745
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
I try to run from the situation

746
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
Nhac me and beat me around

747
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,688
So I'm thinking like a like if I would have handled my Village right internet cuz I'm a man

748
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:48,832
And I and I know like that you think that if you defended yourself it would have gone better for you if I was defending myself it would have been better

749
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Cuz I know

750
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
I know I know from me

751
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
My physical well-being like

752
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,072
I can I can handle him like I could have

753
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Adopted by

754
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,936
The name of the six-foot-four ex Arena Football linebacker

755
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,032
I don't know I just feel like two against one that situation I'm not trying to like

756
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
That would not listen.

757
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,384
I'm not saying like I would have

758
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,200
Daytime say Alyssa light

759
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
I hate that I couldn't defend myself

760
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
I hate that I can defend myself

761
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
When I just ran

762
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:27,232
That means I've been their surrender to him like a dentist to read it to him

763
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,072
I knew Jesse felt ashamed about by nitin

764
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,168
Buy noise for that was because it's inherently humiliating

765
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
Be physically overpowered

766
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,056
What song was Jesse I realized I didn't have that quite right

767
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,848
Really

768
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,640
The thing Debbie feel the same about

769
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Bugatti ran away

770
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,064
Good morning watch the video in the gas station

771
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
The mall Justice confrontation with office in Duncanville

772
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,744
Jesse was asking Duncan to fight him like a man now that Jesse Wilkening cup

773
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
What you going to hear a fight me like your arm

774
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
Pools open Dunkin to fight Jesse like Jesse's amantu

775
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,056
Any video off the wall feels like an eternity of yelling at Dunkin

776
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
Does he finally gives up

777
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Leaves

778
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
The other people in the store stopped working

779
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,224
A lot of my life

780
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,784
One guy in the stall. Duncan up

781
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
Congratulate Duncan on keeping his cool

782
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,440
At one point I want to says to Duncan about Jessie

783
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
That is so sad

784
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:44,800
What is over video Jesse yelling at Dunkin

785
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:50,176
I want to get my hands on as much information about Jesse's interactions with the police as possible

786
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
The same day I went from Jesse's call to be Stephen police station to see if I could pick up some more please. I'm just

787
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
What is a rest on the 4th of July

788
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,512
I'm a station build a man of the vestibule window I never met before Sergeant Jeff Williams

00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,912
Pulled with a salt and pepper goatee

00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:17,312
I told him I wanted a police report he got out and pulled over to a computer and I'll 2

792
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:23,712
Jason Nickerson I said I want to see the pools for the 4th of July

793
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
Williams knotted printed off reports as he won't have a window we didn't scan the pages Los Angeles

794
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Dorothy read what Jesse said to the offices

795
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,976
But then when you go up to the window

796
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
Father dies from the well.

797
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Tips

798
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,120
He told me that Jesse never would have talked to him that way

799
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,984
I've been trying for months to get anyone from the East Cleveland Police Department

800
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Talk to me about Jesse

801
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
Impossible

802
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Father William didn't say much else

803
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,687
Promotion the oven to a doll and buzz me into the back

804
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,479
We went to an office

805
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
Walgreens offered me a seat of the desk

806
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,087
He told me he didn't want to be recorded

807
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
What he said

808
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
Let me tell you why Jessie is the way it is

Jesse told me about Ricky

821
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
His older brother

822
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671

Who is sitting in his living room and just do a makeshift diorama on the coffee table in front of them

00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,935
Using a cigarette lighter and a bottle of vodka

Who killed them

836
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
According to Jesse

837
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,583
What has happened with the police officer just one street away

838
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,143
I don't know. Heard the gunfire

839
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,447
But didn't respond until after the shooting stops

840
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
The police couldn't save one person that night Jesse said

841
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,847
I didn't do nothing

842
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,639
Sign over there in three people died

843
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,735
Father Williams told me that after that night

844
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,527
Jesse Walden the same

845
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,343
Even a couple of years we started getting in trouble

846
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
Jesse whole family is going to reopen

847
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
He is off it was other way instead

848
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
It would constantly be picking up one of Jesse's Ava Brothers

849
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
Small crimes

850
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Mostly drug-related

851
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
One night

852
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
Williams responded to a disturbance

853
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,983
When he got back

854
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
He sold his brother was

855
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
Jesse's brother was so high and out of it

856
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,663
Father William decided to just take him home instead of taking to the

857
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
The station

858
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
Savage Road

859
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,759
This is David Hulse author Williams

860
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,623
Baldwin's admitted he didn't know.

861
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
The only people he never lost his grandparents

862
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,815
Unsalted ming tombs came home that morning

863
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,399
Arrived to find his own 14 year old son Kyle that died

864
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
Even having a bottle of dust off computer cleaner

865
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
I'm going into cardiac arrest

866
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,103
Father William said the death to his family apart

867
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,431
You blame themselves for not knowing how dangerous hopping laws

868
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:40,319
His daughter blame herself because she seen cows make off of a bottle of dust often hadn't said anything

869
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Father William said she never recovered

870
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:49,535
Sergeant Williams told me he's watched it to get in trouble and to him it's always look like suffering

871
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,887
The only war that is ever going for his suffering is he in the sergeant Williams

872
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
Was beaten up by two cops

873
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,495
Sent away with a little bit of money

874
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,567
He said these days whenever he is just his name

875
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,383
He braces himself for the news that Jesse's dead

876
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,991
He told me if I was going to do a story about Jesse Nicholson

877
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,063
I should talk to Jesse more about Ricky

878
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
So I did

879
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
3 weeks later

880
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,607
Jesse and I met in his apartment

881
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
Jesse was not in the greatest of moods

882
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,959
My interview had spilled into a Thursday night

883
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
I need to hear his friends drinking outside

884
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
I pulled up salted Williams

885
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,639
I ran into him not too long ago

886
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,479
And these are some really nice things about you

887
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,295
I started to tell him what Sergeant Williams it said

888
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,111
That would have sweet bright kid Jesse walls

889
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Tyrese mother

890
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
It wasn't like that

00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,767
I know officer never did it for me

892
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
Hayes Cleveland ain't never

893
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,607
Gave me an extra damn apple or nothing

894
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
So that's a lie

895
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
It's a lie

896
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,823
I mean he didn't even say that he thought he'd really done I didn't even say that

897
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Snow officer

898
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
That never

899
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,199
Never been nice to me so

900
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
No

901
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Jesse was adamant

902
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
More adamant about ever hurting be

903
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,135
B-29 that's all that we need to do anything about it

904
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,975
This is how blind and foolish she will see

905
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,279
He's not speaking on me you not speaking on me

906
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,327
He speaking on my brother William

907
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
I'm 29

908
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,519
I'm 29 my brother my brother got killed 20 years ago

909
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
I wouldn't out here in the streets

910
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:45,247
He would hardly wait until he wouldn't know me like that that's a lot but you said you were like a small kid that you knew you was a

911
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
Smoking I wasn't out here that I wasn't out here in the

912
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
Six-letter weather now here

913
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,951
I'm trying to actually do the math like I'm mad listen

914
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,535
I'm not interacting with an officer, school and stuff

915
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
What is

916
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
Nancy me

917
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,775
Jessica Sergeant Williams must be confusing him for his brother William

918
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
Live matches

919
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
Indian Desi do look a little alike

920
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
The thing Jeffy most strongly reject

921
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
This was at Ricky's death of change vehicles of Jesse's life

922
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
Anyway song Too Many people saying

923
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
His brother got killed

924
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,951
I seen I seen any trouble

925
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Listen

926
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,047
Okay It Ain't going to cry and all that what you see me cry

927
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,863
If you see me cry something

928
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,679
That's what I supposed to do

929
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,519
I went through the things I was going through when I was younger cuz I was young and dumb

930
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:45,663
I was young and dumb I seen everybody out here with all the flashy stuff and all that that I wanted on the same stuff

931
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
But you know

932
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271
Carter case when I was 18

933
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
Got out when I was

934
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
22

935
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
Any never been back by

936
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
So

937
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,207
It's cool. I mean I'm I'm not angry at the officers just

938
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
How to speak facts man like

939
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,327
I'd life is about facts

940
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
But

941
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
They want to single out something like

942
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
Why I am a trouble

943
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
Human being live while I was trouble person

944
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
Is this

945
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,127
A person spectating somebody else life

946
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:22,015
I mean that's it in all he trying to do is be like listen this is why

947
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
Nickerson is

948
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,415
The way is what is why he didn't went through the trials and tribulations either went through

949
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
That's not the case man

950
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
That's not the case

951
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,559
Jesse went willingly for the next 10 minutes

952
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
About Sergeant Williams

953
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
Tooth fairy

954
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,167
I think his reaction was so intense because

955
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
You been through so much more in Ricky's.

956
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,287
Is it to Denise Bugatti Wilkos to

957
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
Went missing for over a week when Jesse was a teenager

958
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
And he was found dead in her Palm

959
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,223
Baba Antoine died as an infant

960
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,807
Is teenage nephew DeAndre died in a drive-by

961
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Then

962
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
Now over wrongs that they believe the police have done him

963
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
I think

964
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,255
When does peeing so much meaning on Ricky

965
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
Ricky's death effects

966
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
Jessie

967
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,095
Jessie found it offensive

968
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
Generalizing

969
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,215
Jesse wasn't in the mood to have us off his favorite

970
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,495
YouTube angry

971
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,567
I wasn't interested in being explained

972
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Especially

973
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,871
Bible people

974
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
Police officer

975
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,223
Like I'm very serious now like

976
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
I am not

977
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:31,903
I'm tired of being treated like a I'm trying to I'm tired of being the victim so

978
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,999
No more Jesse Nickerson is being a victim like I'm not letting

979
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,583
Words that mean like timeout

980
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,887
Whatever it mean like I'm not

981
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,471
I just want the world to know that s*** like I'm not body

982
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
Keep Benedictine light

983
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,847
And then my father to come up on me and put a hand on me for no reason

984
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
I'm not

985
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,175
Going to let it happen like I'm not just about to

986
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,759
I do see all these are the times I never did nothing back

987
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
I just been evicted

988
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,135
If not I'm not about to keep being a victim and I better

989
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,463
Now I have to press them to get into lay it out explicitly

990
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,303
But Jesse was saying that the next time the police got physical with him

991
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
His plan was to find that

992
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
Petit Morrison for everyone

993
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
Especially words

994
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Cousin the moms off the bat

995
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:22,335
That leads in East Cleveland I paid to be driving down Jetty Street a lot

996
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
Riding Jesse ticketing off a ticket for the usual

997
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,991
Driving under suspension read possession

998
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
Money Stephen call

999
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Later told me

1000
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:36,671
The attitude of the folks in charge was that while opposition to go out of their way to White Jesse up

1001
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
Mason quote

1002
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:42,559
Handle Jesse whenever the opportunity presented itself

1003
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,375
Eventually these given, told me

1004
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,655
The Snowball Effect

1005
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
Well you know

1006
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
Take effect

1007
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:03,295
Las Vegas going to tell you it's how Jesse's pile up with criminal charges in East Cleveland Show

1008
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,671
Does it beat once audit trial but the bulk of them dragged on for months

1009
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,463
Months and months

1010
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:16,351
Until one cool day in January when is Cleveland essentially held out one hand to make a deal

1011
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,631
Imma be all the

1012
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
Ithaca swing

1013
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,727
Pacific dropped 5 challenges

1014
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,519
I'm guessing 4th of July arrests

1015
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,615
I didn't have body cam video about backed up the claim but Jesse will be aggressive

1016
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,759
Invitan Jesse pleaded to three misdemeanor charges

1017
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,599
Including the menacing charge against off the Dunkin at the gas station

1018
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
I know those charges

1019
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
I said he went off to him

1020
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,975
Alcanfor year in jail

1021
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:49,887
During the sentencing the city prosecutor listed some of his old felony convictions

1022
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Cleveland

1023
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,215
Some 22 cases in the hole

1024
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,799
Keep a body cam video from one of Jesse's previous arrest

1025
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,591
Wow through the phone

1026
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,895
Jesse was mouthing off to the police officer

1027
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,431
What you didn't know

1028
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,479
Was that Matt same arrest with suspect

1029
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,551
Jesse later beat that case to trial

1030
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Anyway

1031
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:13,695
In a brief filed is a call the city argued that Jesse pose a danger to the police

1032
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,231
On top of that

1033
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:20,095
Will the quote extremely negatively influence in the city of East Cleveland

1034
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,679
The judge William dolsen

1035
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,471
Didn't say move by the city's pitch

1036
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,055
Instead he did something I did not see coming

1037
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,871
He pretty much ignores that the city had a point

1038
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,943
But also the manager told everyone

1039
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,735
The evil Jesse had a point to

1040
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,551
The city and the police had it out for him

1041
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
Fulton Fab

1042
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
In not so many words

1043
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
That's probably true

1044
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,999
Obviously I wasn't there I don't know what occurred but it seems like

1045
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,791
You prevailed there was a settlement

1046
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
So obviously something happy

1047
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
That could be the reason you have a problem with

1048
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
The police

1049
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
I cannot discount

1050
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,983
And at the same time

1051
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,519
That may be a reason why

1052
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,823
They have a problem with you is like okay

1053
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:07,711
We we think that he prevailed and he shouldn't Prevail so yeah everytime you know his blinkers not working

1054
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,831
This this this is Carter as blank is possible they don't like you maybe and you may not like me

1055
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,391
So now how do we deal with encounter

1056
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,695
So did you end up in court at the key

1057
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,815
Josh Wilson decided some kind of solution other than jail time was in order

1058
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,655
He said his deputies six months of probation

1059
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:31,263
Enrolled him in a program designed to teach people how to have better experiences

1060
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,103
Is hope he later told me

1061
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,663
That Jesse would learn how to behave better

1062
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
Around police

1063
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,271
The common self-saving interactions would be less heated

1064
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,087
It was almost kind

1065
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,695
It also seemed like the judge was hoping Jesse would change

1066
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
Because he knew

1067
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
These Cleveland Police weren't going to

1068
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:10,431
Just before Jesse's 30th birthday on the phone

1069
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,223
Jessie was full of resolve

1070
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,527
Is wasting too much energy on the court

1071
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575

Meaningful

1073
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,647
Read a book about his life

1074
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,719
