All these people impartial jurors on add-ons case

00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Some say yes and he sent them back to their seats

55
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
He was on the lookout for prejudice

56
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
All kinds of prejudice

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112

And against Muslims

61
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,816
When I tells him he doesn't think he can be impartial because he's got a friend of the Muslim faith

62
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,144
And he seen him and also his son mistreat their families

63
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Friend of mine at work

00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,232

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
They believe Adnan is innocent

74
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
There's no question about it for them

75
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
Adam's father said to me

00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
We've had no happiness in our family since it down was arrested

77
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
It has been continuous torture

78
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
All day

79
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,944

83
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
I mean how do you guys

84
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
Makes sense of what

85
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Happened

86
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
How do you explain

87
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447

88
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
To yourselves I mean not to the outside

00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
Cyworld to yourselves like how do you understand

90
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
Why we must think about that

91
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,991
Ebony Majestic only thing you know I still believe you don't because you are asthma

92
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
This is discrimination

93
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
And everybody feed the whole community

94
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Because it was a Muslim

95
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,183
Jaundice

96
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231

You know

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
And do you believe she is a W-2 yet

100
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Because it was easy to Target you know

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423

We still don't know why they doing it

104
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
But again I said this termination

105
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
Because we are Muslim and we are in a minor in this country

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
So this Friday

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
I mean

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
You can hear me not believing her right

109
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,255
The notion that the cops and prosecutors in this case were driven by anti-muslim feeling

110
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
I racism anti racism alone

111
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
That I found very hard to believe but I still don't believe that by the way

112
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
I didn't want to write off what you mean was saying either

113
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
Because maybe anti-muslim this crap Dan

114
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
Contributed in some way to how the investigation and the process

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Staycation operated

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Advertently or inadvertently

117
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
She hadn't personally

118
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
I felt discrimination just out in the world in Baltimore

119
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Before the trial

120
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
And she didn't feel it after not even after 9/11

121
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
What are the hearing on add-ons bail status

122
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
On March 31st 1999

123

She felt that

124
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
The courthouse that day was packed with people from add-ons mosque

125
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Islamic Society Baltimore

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
They raised tens of thousands of dollars for his defense

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,479
The offer to put up their own houses and other properties does

Before or since

137
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
I remember almost

138
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Every

139
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:40,895

Pool

144

00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
Text Doug Culver who did the talking during this hearing

00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
Hands of the people who are here in this courtroom

147

Ledo's imams who are from different moths

152
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Here in Baltimore

154
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,463
Bet they commit themselves

155
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,327
To promise to Val that they will not only supervised at 9

156
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Should he be released should bail be set

157
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
But at the same time they will also accompany him to court as well

158

The same people who are likely to help a nun run away to Pakistan

163
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
And that's why he shouldn't get bail

164
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,375
The fact that the defendant has strong support from the community that is what makes him unique in this case

165
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
KitchenAid because

00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,799
And we have been unable to extradite them back

185
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,663
He gave me a specific instance that occurring now that spending in Chicago

186
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,247
Where the factual pattern is frightened least similar

187
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,575
Again young Pakistan Pakistan mail

188
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Who was jilted by his girlfriend who fled the country

189
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
And they have had no success

190
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
And he indicated it would be a dim situation indeed

191
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,095
If the defendant would flee to Pakistan

192
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:47,263
We have information from an investigation that the defendant has an uncle in Pakistan and he has indicated that he can make

193
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
Make people disappear

194
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,663
That information about the badass Uncle I think I got that from

195
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Teacher I'm not kidding

196
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
The cops talked to this teacher on March 24th

197
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,343
I did not know it says the teacher mr. Nicholson

198
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
But how did not as a student before

199
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,439
The word brooding is in there

200
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
But it says suspect

201
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,583
Had an uncle in Pakistan who can make people disappear on quote

202
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Under that it says

203
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,447
They drain blood from cow at the mosque one day he was pumped

204
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,591
Nicholson ends up as an argument at Advanced bail hearing

205
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,199
I couldn't find any other source for it in the detectives or State's Attorney's files I looked at

206
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,807
Attorney made a stab at fact-checking washes information

207
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,135
One thing led to another and three weeks after that hearing

208
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
Miss wash writes a letter to judge Mitchell

209
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
Apologizing if she misled the court

210
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,815
She said she'd misconstrued information

211
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
From Mr Harry Marshal of the justice

212
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Department

213
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
She talked to him again and he made it clear that there was not a pattern of young Pakistani men committing murder after they've been

214
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Hilton and then running off to Pakistan

215
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
Another case you've mentioned that frightening least similar one out of Chicago

216
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,063
That case parallel Syed case only that it involves a Pakistani male charged with murder

217
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
Where the victim was known to the defendant washroom

218
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
Apology there's an error

219
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Anon is not Pakistani

220
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
He's American

221
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Pakistani heritage

222
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Maybe this seems like I'm parsing I don't mean to

223
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,031
All this out because to me it shows how easy it is to stir stereotypes in with facts

224
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
All of which then gets baked

225
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Into a story

226
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Something like

227
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,967
Those Muslim men they can't control their pride their passions

228
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
They killed her Lover's Athleta concert

229
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Sequences

230
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
Put the full support of their families and communities

231
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
That's what shocks you mean

232
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,071
Obviously the state never said and was careful not to

233
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
To say Adnan did this because he's a Muslim

234
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
But they did skirt this idea few times at

235
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
The trial

236
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,543
They wanted to show that this wasn't a normal high school Romance

237
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,895
But this young couple was under an unusual amount of scrutiny and pressure from their families

238
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
And because of nouns culture forbid the very thing he wanted

239
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
That's why he reacted the way he did to The Break-Up

240
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,183
Various Witnesses talking about what happened at the homecoming dance or how the relationship a secret

241
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
Prosecutor Casey Murphy tells the jury

242
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
The crime was not about love it was about Pride

243
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
When is opening argument

244
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
You've heard this language before in an earlier episode but it Bears repeating

245
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,799
Prosecutor Kevin urick talks about how Adnan reacted when he broke up with him

246
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Became enraged

247
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
He felt betrayed that his honor has been besmirched

248
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
He became very angry

249
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
And he set out to kill Hae Min Lee

250
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
PetSmart

251
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Syracuse by axe

252
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,439
Usually he replied to a 17 year old kid at Woodlawn High School

253
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Is a word from the old country

254
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Where honor killings come from

255
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
And this word honor

256
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,471
Princess when I was looking through a huge set of documents from the detective's investigation

257
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
Confidential report

258
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,383
In late August of 99 so six months after the rest

259
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,271
Consulting Group Services helps law enforcement understand other cultures

260
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
Weather report for detectives risen mcgilvery

261
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
Report on Islamic thought and culture with emphasis on package

262
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,791
Comparative study relevant to the upcoming trial of Adnan Syed

263
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
Airport is 8 pages long I'm going to skip to the money shot

264
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
Summary as it relates to mr. Syed

265
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,079
I have another man Dishonored both Adnan Syed and his belief structure

266
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:39,967
It is acceptable for a Muslim man to control the actions of a Woman by completely eliminating her

267
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
It goes on

268
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,879
Within this harsh culture he has not violated any code he has defended his honor

269
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Finally

270
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:54,303
For many ethnic Pakistani incidents like this are commonplace and in Pakistan this would not have been a crime

271
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,607
Probably a question of Honor

272
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
I've no idea what the cops made of this report

273
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
They looked at it and thought

274
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Deer

275
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
And stuffed it in a file never to be considered again

276
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Or whether they thought

277
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
Interesting

278
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
But they were at the very least in regular communication with the

279
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Consultant

280
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Especially during the early stages of the investigation

281
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
I noticed a also gives a shout-out to Aslam

282
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
It's during the second trial

283
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,559
Testifying about what happened after he picked at none of it best buys their driving back to school

284
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
Jay says quote this is when we started to talk a little bit

285
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,727
I don't know he said to me it kind of hurt him but not really

286
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
And when someone treats him like that they deserve to die

287
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
How can you treat somebody like that that you're supposed to love

288
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
And then all-knowing is Allah

289
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Eric asked him

290
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
Explain what he meant by that

291
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
No Chasez

292
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,111
It's a detail Jay mentions neither to the detectives in his tape

293
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Nor during the first trial

294
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
So why now

295
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Allow only knows

296
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,935
Reporting the story I found plenty of examples of casual prejudice against Muslims

297
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,567
What are the nuns teachers for example think about what he would have been taught about women and women's rights

298
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,711
Another teacher I talked to told me she was terrified at the time that it needs relatives were going to come after her for talking to the Dead

299
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Detectives

300
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
She told me she assumes his parents were evil

301
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,879
On that website that lists all the bodies found in leakin park

302
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,695
The author's commentary about him in these cases

303
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Maybe my prejudices showing through but who in their right mind lets their daughter date a man named Adnan masud Syed

304
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,383
The jurors we spoke to said Indians religion didn't affect their view of the case

305
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,015
Lisa Flynn said maybe at first it interested her but then she pretty quickly realize that more to the point

306
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,599
Was a teenager in America doing American Teenager things

307
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,207
She said once they all understood that whatever stereotypes they had went right out the window

308
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Which is exactly what you wanted a jury

309
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
But when we press them a little more

310
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,399
It seems stereotypes about a nun's culture were there

311
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
Lurking in the background

312
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
I don't feel religion was why you were

313
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
American culture

314
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
What religion

315
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
I'm not sure how the culture is over there had a tree

316
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Preacher woman

317
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Leonard some cultures women are

318
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,807
Second-class citizens maybe that's

319
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
But it was I don't know

320
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
He just want to control and she wouldn't give it to him

321
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
Dr William Owens

322
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
Cristela Armstrong

323
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,351
They were trying to talk about in his culture and

324
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
Arabic culture

325
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Mineral

326
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Not women

327
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
I remember hearing that when you were deliberating one of the jurors

328
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
So

329
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
He had put his put his whole life on the line for her

330
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
You know and

331
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
She wanted to she didn't want no ball or anymore

332
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,791
The first thing Christina Gutierrez announced trial lawyer said in her opening statement about her client

333
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
This isn't the first trial

334
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,911
Was quoted masud Syed is an American citizen

335
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
He was born in this country

336
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
Like most American citizens

337
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,079
Jury selection

338
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,175
That the jurors might be prone to anti-muslim anti-foreigner sentiment

339
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,295
Which probably explains why she spent what seemed to me a Nutty amount of time during her opening

340
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,695
Talking about what an immigrant is what a mosque is what Pakistan is quote a country formed in the

341
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
Arab world in the tip of the landmass called Asia

342
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,887
She talks and talks about how I was raised about young Romance

343
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
The judge interrupts her four times

344
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,287
How much longer will you be Miss Gutierrez 5 minutes Miss Gutierrez 1 minute mask

345
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Gutierrez

346
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
She's rushing at the end

347
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,687
Would you rather quickly throw suspicion on DJ and then finally on to mr. s

348
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Earlier app

349
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,159
About whether she should have talked to Asia McClain or whether her style made of grated on jurors

350
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
But now I'm going to address this question head-on

351
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Did she blow it

352
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,679
Christina in terms of what happened at trial

353
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
Is it she never contacted Asia McClain

354
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,823
He thinks it wasn't deliberate on her part he just think she made a mistake

355
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
Like a Surgeon slip of the scalpel

356
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,711
I personally she was nothing but compassionate towards him he said

357
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
Always asking him how he was doing

358
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
To make sure he got the skin medication he needed the glasses he needed

359
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
She was his protector

360
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
I mean I still

361
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,303
You just mad I just I just had like a great deal of affection for a man

362
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
Jimmy Lee have my back in the

363
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,471
Like she know what she was doing

364
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Hopefully I mean

365
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
No one could explain

366
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
Standing there in that situation

367
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,455
Call me doctor nurse

368
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
School teacher coach in your pants

369
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
And you may have an idea of how much you know

370
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
I trusted

371
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Ciara

372
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,487
Your life is really in her hands

373
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Literally literally

374
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
I mean

375
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
No she never really mentioned what her plan would be I never really knew what it would be

376
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,751
Christina died in January of 2004

377
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,103
Play I can't ask her what her strategy was for Conjuring Reasonable Doubt

378
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,943
I have to go by what we seen in her notes and in the courtroom

379
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,551
And based on all that I can summarize her defense theory in four words

380
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Someone else did it

381
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,207
Such as a or the new boyfriend or Mister as the guy who found the body

382
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
After all she argued

383
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
For sure when he died

384
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
What day

385
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
It could have been the 13th or 14th or 15th

386
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,471
Christina wanted to show that once the cops zeroed in on an on

387
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
Ignored other viable suspects

388
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,591
Putting down an alibi for a.

389
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
She dumped as much suspicion as she could on to these other players

390
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,783
I mentioned before that announce first trial ended in a mistrial

391
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Here's what happened

392
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,391
Christina was what Chris floor described as a fighting person

393
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Generally a good quality in an attorney

394
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
That's scratchy part of Christina though

395
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,351
Sometimes it could elicit a response shall we say in the courtroom

396
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:27,007
An adversarial situation both sides and announced case were suspicious that the other was playing fast and loose when they could

397
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
And it could get Presley

398
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
Prosecutor Casey Murphy during a bench conference

399
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
The first trial

400
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Before church Coral

401
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,319
I'm going to attempt to defense counsel calling my co-counsel on a****** at the trial table

402
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
I did not hear

403
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
I wish I could complain to a judge every time someone called me an a******

404
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:54,655
Coral says he knows Christina to be a pitbull on the pant leg of Justice unquote but an otherwise

405
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,983
This person and how about everybody just behaves themselves okay

406
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,591
Slater Quarles loses his patience with Christina

407
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,127
It's over something small

408
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,967
Kevin urick asks if he can show exhibit 31 to the jurors

409
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
AT&T call records Herman on phone

410
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
Train calls from January 12th 13th and 14th

411
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
Christina says she hasn't seen it before

412
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,488
York says that's not true she has it already stipulated

413
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Call record

414
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
She says yeah but I hadn't actually looked at it

415
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,864
Before I haven't physically seen this exhibit

416
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
Cross calls him up to the bench

417
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Miss Gutierrez

418
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,032
You're going to stand there and lie to the jury about something that you agreed to

419
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
I'm not going to permit you to do that

420
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
Christina says judge the fact that I

421
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
That was a lie

422
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,992
You told a lie I'm not going to permit you to do that

423
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
That's not a lie judge I resent the implication

424
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Christina starts getting heated now

425
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,672
Girl says please be quiet please be quiet

426
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
She says it's very hard to be quiet when a court has

427
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Accusing me of lying

428
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,144
I don't want to overdo it here but it's possible that had this bench conference not happened

429
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,936
Announce whole life could have been different

430
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,824
That first trial according to Adnan to Kristina's colleagues to people who are watching it

431
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
Seem to be going well for Adnan Syed

432
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,200
It was moving fast and Jason to be more on the defensive

433
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Then this happened

434
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
And of course jurors overheard it

435
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,624
Despite the White Noise they turn on during bench conferences to muffle the sound

436
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
After a break

437
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
Christina asks for a mistrial

438
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Coral says

439
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
He's got a note from alternate number for

440
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,376
Infused the fact that you determine that Miss Gutierrez is a liar will she be removed

441
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Will we start over

442
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
Call Sister Christina

443
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Your motion for mistrial

444
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Scranton

445
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
Julie Remy was a law clerk for

446
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
16 at this time

447
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
She said moving into trial number to Christina was confident

448
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
I mean look you know

449
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
Are the jury cold after the first incident of the state kitzies case and they're giving me indications are going to

450
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,680
Quit and then you turn around and tried

451
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
Different jewelry and it comes out

452
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Completely

453
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,080
You know the opposite you guys pulled the jury after the mistrial

454
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
I wasn't part of it but I know the jury was polled

455
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
After the mistress

456
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
By her and I believe

457
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Lockhart

458
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Okay I'm not sure

459
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
But the jury was polled

460
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
And it was a fan of the state's case

461
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,696
The interview the duration and they gave

462
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Every indication that they were

463
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Heading toward acquittal

464
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,352
In fact it wasn't quite at the end of the state's case

465
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,192
AT&T expert hadn't testified about the cell tower technology

466
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,520
Engen hadn't taken the stand either which is significant

467
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
But it's true the jury had heard the bulk of the state's case

468
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,456
Used to have that information you got to feel pretty good about that you knows the defense attorney

469
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,040
I would expect him being at the trial tree myself that you would come

470
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
What is coursing

471
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
Keep doing the same thing get the same kind of results

472
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,608
True different jury but also different judge slightly different arguments

473
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,192
Weather for all we know winds blowing slightly more this way or that

474
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
There's so many factors

475
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Including chance

476
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,336
Which no one wants to think about in a first-degree murder case

477
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
The Corrs black is part of it too

478
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
About a month later they start all over

479
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
Trial 2

480
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
Christina strategies the same

481
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
Try to show that someone else killed Hae

482
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,816
She did a lot of research and hopes it blinking mr. s

483
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,376
The crime or at least trying to link him to J

484
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
Patronize the video store where they worked

485
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,984
But you never succeeded

486
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,104
During that second trial it take some doing but she finally gets mr. s on the stand

487
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
He's so desperately didn't want to be there

488
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
The courthouse staff basically to prevent him from leaving the building

489
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,808
So even though he's her witness he's a hostile witness

490
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,160
Who's Christina trying to get him to explain how work orders at his job got filled

491
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,256
If you could get to the epicenter job will do it at the time we can't do it at the time we do it

492
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Want to get you

493
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
That's my ass off

494
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
Which month is the next day

495
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Whenever

496
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
When your work day Within

497
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
You were going to leave

498
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
I guess so

499
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,176
You wouldn't get well sir is that a yes or no I'm not asking so yes when your workday don't you leave

500
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
Of course mr. s was more of a side dish

501
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,112
Christina's main prey with j

502
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
She tells the judge

503
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,256
Judge am I just like to be heard it is our entire defense. To make

504
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
James the person who committed this crime

505
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,704
I'm with all the ways in which he acted guilty and

506
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,848
Describing words and thanking when she acted with consciousness of guilt by concealing

507
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Evidence

508
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
His clothes his boots

509
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
Is powder coat

510
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
His shop was wiping shovels

511
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
To conceal evidence as he said

512
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
Wealthiness David Anton

513
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,256
I'm crossed to conceal evidence of his involvement

514
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,096
Christina cross-examined J on five different days

515
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
Choose exhaustive and exhausting

516
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,472
Her questions are detailed and deliberate

517
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:23,104
She questioned them and maybe it was the half speed pacing or the sing-songy aggression

518
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
It added up to something less than effective

519
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
Her punches and there were many many punches

520
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
Don't always appear to land

521
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,904
A masterful job of presenting the facts

522
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,744
Announces Christina actually he calls her Miss Gutierrez

523
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,304
Let me do some great things for him

524
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,912
True successful and barring the school nurse from testifying in a second trial for instance

525
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,984
I was a woman who said she thought a non was faking his reaction

526
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Lester Hayes death

527
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,592
But he says he wishes some of her arguments had been clear

528
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,688
It was at least linear

529
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,808
Officials confusing things but

530
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
It wasn't like a clear outline

531
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,744
Like the prosecution had everything was kind of jumbled I took so long

532
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
It was just like

533
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
Right

534
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
To give you an idea

535
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
Andrea's first and second tape statements to Detectives

536
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,712
He tells them different stories about when Adnan first told him he was going to

537
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Kill hay

538
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,088
In the first statement he says it not mentions it that same day January 13th

539
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
Weather driving Anand

540
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
School at lunch time

541
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
In the second tape statement

542
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
He says a Nan told him the night before

543
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,584
And also that has been talking about it for four or five days already

544
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
When you testify as a child

545
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
He goes back to the first version

546
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
That he first heard about it from a non on the 13th

547
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,568
So obviously Christina questions about all this

548
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,616
It's fertile territory for her side

549
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
Listen to how she does it

550
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,992
This tape goes on for awhile by the way but I want you to get the full effect

551
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
Another occasion

552
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
You told them

553
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
All the conversations I had with

554
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
For 5 days early

555
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Jasmine

556
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,192
How do you make sure because now there are new

557
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,776
The first very first

558
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Interest

559
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,152
Occur at a time

560
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
But never starts

561
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,088
And I'm sad agitation

562
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
Did you tell me the Crouton 13

563
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:54,144
Then your second interview after the tape recorder

564
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Scott's room

565
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
It's at our maker level 30

566
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
Snowman

567
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Is

568
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,456
15th of March

569
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
You tell me her number

570
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
I believe so

571
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,976
Closer to you recall the 15th of March

572
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,816
You told them that Adnan

573
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,168
Told you he was going to kill that b****

574
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,312
You actually told them

575
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
But you knew

576
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,664
A whole day ahead of time

577
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Good Adams

578
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
This evening it spoke to me

579
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
No

580
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
Something just happened

581
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,888
Just admitted something or didn't admit something but I honestly can't tell if it's a point for the defense

582
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
Or for the process

583
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Iqushion

584
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
Or if it's a draw

585
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
Stretches like this

586
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,664
14 dozen for cross-examination went so far into the weeds it was hard even for me reading it years later

587
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,712
The hack back to the main trail

588
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,040
A juror that Dana interviewed a guy named Sue.

589
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,624
Said Christina strategy was a little lost on them to

590
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
50 Frontage Rd

591
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,256
Everybody has been a long time ago but everybody was

592
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
Disco Converse

593
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Startup making a point

594
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
So they were just like a lot of words

595
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Bright

596
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,592
He talked and talked and didn't prove anything

597
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,480
I think there's a good chance though that Christina leaves these threads hanging for a reason

598
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
Was another defense attorney explain to me

599
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,904
During cross-examination you don't want a tie each point up in a bow in the moment

600
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
You don't want to tip your hand

601
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:59,584
Because any other side might come back with questions on redirect examination that could undo what you've just laid out

602
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
So you save all the threads

603
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
And then tie them up in a nice

604
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
Fat unassailable

605
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,288
Closing after all the testifying is over

606
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,384
Christina does revisit J's testimony at her closing

607
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
The gist of which is

608
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,248
The detectives arrested in on because of what Jay told them

609
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
And what was it

610
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
True

611
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
And you lied to them about many many things

612
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,952
It wasn't just that things didn't match up they were lies

613
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
They called them lies

614
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
Call demise

615
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
On the 15th of March on the 18th of March

616
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,400
On the 13th of April every single time lies

617
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Unquote

618
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:40,032
Clearly Christina put a ton of time and effort into discrediting J

619
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
But the fact is

620
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
The jurors believed him

621
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,664
Didn't think you'd be sitting there talking about this if it weren't true

622
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
She was less rigorous on other ask

623
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
McKay's

624
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
The cell phone wreck

625
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Princeton

626
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,904
Her main argument was at the Estates Oxford

627
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Tested the sites

628
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Wasn't valid

629
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,744
Because he used in Ericsson phone

630
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
How to make the calls

631
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
A different brand than Anon

632
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
Which turned out to be a bad debt on her part

633
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,656
Brand of the phone doesn't matter

634
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
But what you didn't do with the cell phone evidence

635
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
Was attack the states timeline

636
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
Call by call Tower by Tower

637
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,664
Or point out with Clarity that is significant swath of the day

638
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,736
The hours between noon and 6 p.m. on the call log

639
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Do not match json

640
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Testimony

641
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,904
30 second trial though when Christina really came to life

642
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
I just kick ass

643
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,304
She teased some information out of she hoped would change the course of the proceedings

644
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Granite Woods

645
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,192
The state specifically the attorney who is representing Jay

646
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,080
When she figured this one thing out about J's lawyer she told him this is our big chance

647
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,176
Excited about that

648
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
Charged with a felony

649
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
Accessory after the fact of first-degree murder

650
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,928
Plead guilty and had an agreement with the state that if he cooperated basically showed up in court and told the truth

651
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
A sentence with reflect that

652
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
Auntie auntie got no jail time

653
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
For that he had his own lawyer

654
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
A woman named Anne Benaroya

655
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
She's representing him pro bono

656
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
She wasn't a public defender choose a private defense attorney

657
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:21,408
Christina have been complaining to the court that the prosecution hadn't been totally forthcoming about Jays plea and how it came about

658
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Which isn't unusual in a trolley

659
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
This one

660
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,552
But in the middle of the second trial Jay says something

661
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,136
Something that Christina would later call the magic information

662
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,000
Happened on the stand when she's asking Jay how Benaroya came to represent him

663
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
Chess

664
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
Did anyone help provide you a lawyer

665
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,632
Did anyone help her body

666
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:54,176
Military prosecutor in this case provide you a law

667
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
What

668
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,784
Gutierrez freaks out

669
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
This is the magic information

670
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,416
Testifies that

671
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
April of 99

672
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,072
No contact with the cops or the prosecutors until September 6th

673
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
So long stretch where he doesn't know what's going on

674
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,008
He says he called the office of the public defender to try to see if he could get himself a lawyer

675
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,824
And they told him unless you've been charged we can't help you

676
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
True

677
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,456
So Jay says the next thing that happens is the cops come to see him on September 6th

678
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,784
And tell him he's about to be charged with accessory after the fact

679
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
And that he'll be able to get a lawyer

680
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
The next day September 7th

681
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,000
They come pick him up they booked them and they take him to the State's Attorney's office

682
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,560
Kevin urick prosecutor

683
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
Jay says he's never met your

684
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:49,216
Before and then he says Yorick introduces him to and Benaroya who can represent him for

685
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
For free

686
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:54,336
Talk privately for a while then they sign a plea agreement

687
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,712
That same day they all go across the street to the courthouse and resent the signed plea to a judge

688
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,088
If you were a loved one is an attorney your jaw is hanging open right now correct

689
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,696
Prosecutors do not find attorneys for Witnesses they are prosecuting

690
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
That is not a thing

691
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:17,632
Former prosecutor worked in the Baltimore office at that time said she's never heard of anything like that happening before

692
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
It sounded very strange to her

693
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
Gutierrez

694
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Freak out

695
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,568
There is no jurisdiction in America

696
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,968
For the win

697
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
If you got a free lawyer thanks

698
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,624
To the state Christina argues that's what's called a benefit

699
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
It's worth money

700
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:46,048
And it could look like JS being paid by the state for his testimony

701
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Tennis benefits

702
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,864
And therefore might lie to please them

703
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,680
And if it could look like that she says

704
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:57,056
The defense was entitled to know about it before the second trial or the first trial began

705
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
And here she was learning about it at this late date

706
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,712
That she said was a violation of the rules of discovery

707
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
She sounds

708
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
So mad

709
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
The jury is not present for this ranting by the way

710
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,904
But probably she was also giddy with Gaucho excitement

711
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,976
She told the judge this is so patently improper

712
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:20,864
Jehovah Witness who has this benefit and they feel indebted

713
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,520
In a way that may affect what are you trying to fight to provide a lawyer

714
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,592
Terminator collectible lawyer

715
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,176
Once you getting into this Christina did not let go

716
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
She wanted to rest from it everything she could

717
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
Maybe a mistrial maybe some other relief

718
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
They spent hours on this issue over several days of

719
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,928
The trial sometimes in front of the jury sometimes not

720
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
I called Benaroya about this

721
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,120
To find out if it was true that your exhaust her out and that the first time she met Jay was in eurex office

722
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
On the same day to sign the plea agreement

723
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,008
She said no it could not have happened that way absolutely not

724
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,824
A child out Uric doesn't dispute it

725
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
Edit J sentencing in mm

726
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
When Mr Urich first asked me first mention this case to me and asked me if I would consider speaking to

727
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
The judge Wanda heard agreed with

728
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
Christina that this Arrangement looked fishy at Bass

729
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,792
She was not happy about it

730
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
But she also said

731
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
The witness in question

732
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
What is Jay

733
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,448
She doesn't seem to be aware that it's messed up

734
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
She doesn't appear to think he's getting a benefit

735
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
Or being paid in Subway Forest

736
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,104
Testimony or did anything untoward went on

737
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,200
Testimony isn't tainted by any of this

738
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
And that's the main thing

739
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,296
So A for effort judge hotels

740
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Christina

741
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
Overruled

742
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
Annette Morales

743
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Was that

744
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
In terms of Defense Witnesses

745
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
The case Christina brought was Swift

746
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
Book about two and a half days for her to rest

747
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
Aside from the cops

748
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,544
A private detective and the guy who surveyed the burial site in Lincoln Park

749
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,128
Witnesses Christina put on the stand where mostly character Witnesses

750
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,456
Initial or nice things to say about Adnan

751
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,808
Whatever his assignment Adnan strive for excellence at all time

752
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
His teacher flea market he's a bright

753
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
Conscientious

754
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,720
And hard-working student or protocol stunt your studies with sobriety

755
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:27,584
But the nuns guidance counselor Betty Stuckey reading from a college recommendation she wrote for him

756
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,912
Which incidentally she printed out for non on January 13th

757
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
Same day he disappeared

758
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
She was the last defense Witness

759
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,336
Building a solar vehicle

760
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,896
Beijing national competition in Topeka Kansas

761
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Flask

762
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,280
Rabia chaudry first told me about a Nas case

763
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,840
She told me she thought Christina had bungled it

764
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
On purpose even

765
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
So she can make money off the appeal

766
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,496
That was the only way rob you could account for screwing up the Asia thing

767
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
And she said

768
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
Chabad Christina's defense

769
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
The witnesses she brought

770
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
We're laughably week

771
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,712
I do not agree with Robbie's assessment of

772
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Christina

773
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
I do not believe Christina through this case

774
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
On purpose

775
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,880
From reading the transcripts and watching the trial videos

776
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
You can see her scrapping on an on behalf

777
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
At every opportunity

778
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
Sometimes in long and rather beautifully

779
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
Constructed extemporaneous paragraphs

780
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
She made a thousand strategic decisions

781
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,656
About what

782
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,776
Chip for Clerk's + and Associates of five people working on the case

783
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,080
Like she did some sloppy rush job

784
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,640
I know that losing the case she was

785
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
I don't think she ever got over that case

786
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
This is Julie Remy again

787
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
Who works for

788
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Christina at the time of announce trial

789
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,112
And I can tell you the physical effects

790
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
Depression that I saw firsthand

791
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,208
She was

792
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,352
I think she wanted to kind of a deep depression after that case and I don't think she ever really bounce back

793
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
And if she really

794
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
Will impacted by the loss of a case

795
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
People who works with Christina back then they all said the same thing

796
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,920
That she was tireless and she cared a lot about her cases including Adnan

797
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,736
She's always going going a hundred miles an hour

798
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:26,368
I said she's heard a fly into the office in the morning sunglasses on hair flying barking orders

799
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,952
She smoke and she cursed at you fiercely meant her Clerks

800
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
Chicopee a giant pain in the ass

801
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,816
But also she was a giant in the profession

802
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
Manchester Maryland but nationally

803
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,192
She did the first or at least one of the first DNA cases in Maryland

804
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,288
To figure out how to explain it to a jury I heard a story that she went to a grades

805
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
School and practice

806
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,408
Each time a kid said he or she didn't understand the science she started over

807
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,992
Christina Ciccone First cases in Maryland that use luminol

808
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,272
Attract blood spatter

809
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
But six people told me she was brilliant

810
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Not in a hyperbolic way either

811
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,792
Despite her Stellar reputation though it does seem as if something not right was happening with Christina around this

812
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,608
Time everybody say she's the best you the best so she's

813
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
We was

814
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,424
Like you know you was begging her to take one

815
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
Betcha meme Jean's mother

816
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:18,336
Share husband consulted with friends and leaders the mosque about who to hire

817
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
Everyone said Christina sounded great

818
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
They felt like they were lucky to get her

819
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:26,528
What it was she asked for you know we'll just go and get it before she will lose her you don't because

820
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,576
Who is afraid producer we don't have no

821
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
National League

822
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Message

823
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Attorney

824
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,744
Kristina's bedside manner at least with them lacked a certain Delica

825
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,304
She said they were both intimidated by her

826
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,400
And they could never get her to talk to them about another case or what was going on

827
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:47,520
And she said she thought Christina had lost some of her magic in the courtroom by the second trial

828
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
But you seem sort of agitated

829
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:56,223
So another time she would be smoking in and out in and she was very nervous kind of person before she wasn't like that the first try

830
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,575
Christina initially asked for $50,000 to represent of non

831
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
That fee would more than double by the end of the second

832
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Control

833
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,975
Members of the mosque and donated lots of money to help pay her

834
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:11,839
But you mean says that toward the end of the second trial Christina had begun to bully them about money

835
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,423
If they managed to get Christina on the phone or in a meeting

836
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
Jim said the only topic would be money

837
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
Money money

838
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:25,663
At one point she says Christina told her parents she needed them to bring her $10,000 cash.

839
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
The courthouse

840
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
Taipei forgery expert

841
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,295
So it was kind of strange but when I

842
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,111
Told my friend is so not doing what she's doing her job you know

843
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:41,535
How could you even fit $10,000

844
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,095
Amazing

845
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,935
This supposed to take the chick like you know but you said no bring you the cash already

846
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,007
Was that the only time that she asked for cash

847
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
Yes yes butterfish

848
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Yes

849
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
She never hire the expert

850
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:03,807
Stream sister came another time for the end when Christina insisted in on parents owed her money and that you could take their house

851
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
House if they didn't pay up

852
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
They said they had paid her for everything

853
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,231
They're so scared they transfer their house into their oldest son's name

854
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:17,631
I bring all this up because my parents were not the only ones who had dealings like this with Christina

855
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,215
I spoke to another couple Ron and Sue Whitman

856
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,055
On the heels of a non-conviction in early 2000

857
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
Christina Angel pretty fast

858
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,199
Whitman Tire Christina to defend their 15 year old son

859
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,271
The worst and saddest case I've ever heard

860
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,343
Their son Zack was accused in ultimately

861
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,927
Convicted of killing their younger son Greg who is 13

862
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
It's just a terrible gruesome

863
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
Confounding case

864
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,935
I can't even begin to imagine but anyway they seek out Christina because she's been recommended to them

865
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
And they write about her Defense work in the paper

866
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
The first was great they said

867
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,871
She successfully argued a couple of important pretrial motions

868
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,687
Ron Whitman said she was magnificent in the courtroom

869
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
That is timing on singstar to get weird

870
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,831
This is around the same time she was working on a Nas case

871
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
Should be late really late

872
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
The court

873
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
The woman's case was in Pennsylvania

874
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
On the border with Maryland

875
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,351
The courthouse in Harrisburg

876
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,655
They check in 4 weeks in advance with

877
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
Christina they said

878
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,495
Asking how's it going when can we review

879
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
No worries

880
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,455
In person at Christina's office in Baltimore

881
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,135
Harrisburg meeting up with sewalong id38 so they could get it stamped by 4:30 p.m. at the court

882
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,951
Run the other way

883
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
Didn't even have time to park the car

884
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,191
The women's talk about many of the same things to me and told me

885
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,495
But they couldn't get a hold of Christina

886
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,335
Or saw that things were getting done but when they ask people who're

887
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,871
They were told don't push it

888
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
It'll be fine

889
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Here's to women

890
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
And they would send me this is how Tina works

891
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,527
This is dope

892
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Don't

893
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
Tell teen what to do

894
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
This is what she does

895
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,927
She's very good at it

896
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
Don't worry about it

897
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
So

898
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
Someone

899
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:24,863
That has worked with Tina for years tells you that this is just her way

900
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
Then you think that this is just your way

901
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
Has it got worse and worse

902
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,567
Announce trial ended in late February of 2000

903
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,895
By the end of that same year Christina had been hospitalized

904
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Tanks

905
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
She diabetes

906
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Should MS

907
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
She got very very sick

908
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,831
Tommy they bring files to her in the hospital

909
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,647
Christina would sneak cigarettes in the bathroom

910
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Another words

911
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
She was still at it

912
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
And maybe she shouldn't have been

913
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,143
Robin says it should have been clear to everyone around her that Christina couldn't keep up with her cases

914
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
But no one cried uncle

915
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
Ultimately in

916
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:05,055
January of 2001 if I have my ears correct

917
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
We had a

918
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,199
Grief do at the Supreme Court of the United States in 10 days

919
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,527
And she had told us that she had

920
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,367
University of Baltimore law professor who is she at work with

921
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Many times

922
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
April 4th

923
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Doing the draft

924
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,975
And finally

925
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
I called him

926
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
And he said I am

927
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
Talk to Tina about your son's case for urine

928
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Years

929
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
Christina asked them for an additional $65,000 for work she had to know full well she couldn't do

930
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,455
That they gave her $25,000 for an expert

931
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
The Christina never paid the guy

932
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
So he came to them for the money

933
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,855
They said it happened with a second expert 2 for $2,000

934
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,463
If she was too sick why didn't she tell them why did she leave them hanging

935
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:00,607
Kristina's career had collapsed by the spring of 2001 A year after announced trial ended

936
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,679
According to newspaper

937
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Written by me

938
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,543
Christina got in trouble with the attorney grievance Commission of Maryland

939
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:15,199
Clients were complaining that you taken their money ahead not done the work she promised or not used it the way she said she would

940
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,551
The state fund that compensates people when their lawyers will choose their money

941
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,159
Total of $282,328

942
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,951
128 claims against

943
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Christina

944
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,767
The largest payout was to the Whitman

945
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,631
So she was lying to them

946
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,935
Try to get as much money out of them as she could

947
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,287
More generous assessment would be that Christina was in denial about how sick she was

948
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,895
They're told me she was never much interested in the business side of things

949
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
Wasn't her forte

950
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,319
One former law partner of Christina's told the Whitman's that Christina had been slipping for a while

951
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
The past 5 years

952
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
This event

953
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,887
There's been a lot of news stories this week that it has gotten an appeal

954
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
That's not quite true

955
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,983
He had an initial appeal which was denied

956
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
And he had a hearing for post-conviction relief

957
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,079
Also denied

958
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,943
But he appealed to a higher Court the Maryland Court of special Appeals

959
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:23,551
Recently. Court order the states responded to one aspect of a nun's petition

960
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
By January 14th

961
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,135
So it is still alive

962
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
Buy thread

963
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,279
Announce petition is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel

964
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,327
Meaning Christina Gutierrez screwed up

965
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
The front of the claim is about Asia McClain

966
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,215
But she might have provided an alibi for a. At trial if

967
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Christina had talked

968
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:48,383
But the part of petition that the higher Court wants the state to answer is actually about a different complaint

969
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,735
Had to ask Christina to seek a plea deal

970
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
Twice he.

971
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
Christina never did it

972
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,135
Prosecutors in an ounce case said they never made an offer

973
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,439
Kristina also didn't sequin

974
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
Even though Adnan says he asked

975
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
Assertive

976
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,559
Once before his first trial and was before the second

977
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
When I first read his petition

978
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,447
I told him that I found it hard to believe he'd asked

979
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Cordial

980
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,031
He's been so unshakable for 15 years

981
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
What is anacin

982
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,103
Nothing to do with his death

983
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
It also seemed to me as if he trusted back then

984
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
That the system was sort all this out

985
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
He go home

986
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
Renown told me

987
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,343
There were times when he was really scared

988
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,647
He was trying to be brave for his family

989
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:37,279
But then keep your stories or watch guys he knew get 50 year 70 year life sentence

990
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
And it would hit him

991
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,863
I could be in prison for the rest of my life

992
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,703
It is so difficult

993
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
Not ever having

994
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Been in that situation

995
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,079
Like I would always think before I ever came to jail

996
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
Because they did it

997
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
You know no way would a person ever plead guilty

998
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
What you coming to like

999
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
This whole system

1000
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
What time does she really learned is that

1001
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,671
1st degree Murder cases

1002
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
It's almost impossible

1003
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,815
I can pick an all years in prison I can fly think of a handful of people

1004
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
Whoever beat the first-degree murder case

1005
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,191
Against you

1006
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Are people that like I've met

1007
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
I know and I'm so jealous of them

1008
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,663
In a good way because when we were over the jail or city jail

1009
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,479
A lawyer's advice and looking at you taking a life

1010
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,575
Dependable 30 years life suspended for 20 years whether you did it or not

1011
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
Because the way the elements of the case are

1012
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
You know

1013
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,695
You don't have like a strong alibi

1014
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,791
Could you have someone coming to court saying that you did it whether you did it or not

1015
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:46,655
You going to go in front of a jury and tell people to panic because they have never sat in your shoes before

1016
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
So it's really important that you have in a life sentence

1017
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
First choice if you have in my life

1018
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,359
Because now I still communicate with some of these guys are actually getting ready to go home

1019
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
1516 years later

1020
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,551
Annonces when he seen younger guys come in on parole violations or for whatever reason

1021
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
He tells them

1022
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,855
Take the deal

1023
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
Regardless of whether you did it

1024
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Take the deal

1025
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,535
Because of non has maintained his innocence

1026
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,863
He's got no hope of getting out or very little hope

1027
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
That's how the system works

1028
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,191
I understand that now

1029
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Parole

1030
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,127
But the chances of getting it are so slim for anyone with a life sentence for first-degree murder

1031
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,687
But especially if you don't show remorse

1032
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Because

1033
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
You know what is a psychopath right

1034
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
