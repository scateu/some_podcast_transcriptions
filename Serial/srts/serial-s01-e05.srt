1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
Batman call you

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,680
Woodlawn

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,496
Previously on serial

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,104
They said something like we know what you AJ did we talk today

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
What do you mean

6
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
Soundtrack

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,928
I don't know unless I don t j a good sum of money

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,976
Llcj helping you

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
Global Tel Link prepaid call from

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
An inmate at Maryland Correctional Facility

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,224
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
I told week by week

13
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:01,696
The first letter I got from Adnan Syed almost exactly one year ago included a challenge

14
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,280
He was writing about the prosecution's timeline of the crime

15
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,352
About when and where Hae Min Lee was killed

16
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:14,240
State contended that hay was killed between 2:15 and 2:36 p.m.

17
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
At the Best Buy parking lot about a mile from Woodlawn High School

18
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
That's a 21-minute window and wish to commit the murder

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,968
Which may seem like a long time ago

20
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
But it is virtually impossible if you consider the following facts

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,088
Which he then listed

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
For example

23
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,976
When the final bell rings at 2:15 you can't just leave and jump in your car he wrote

24
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:40,864
Quote there are 1500 other students filling the hallways and stairwells of a 4-story building on quote

25
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,264
Then you have to get out of the school parking lot but the parking lot is encircled by the school bus Loop

26
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
You can't get your car out until the buses fill up and leave

27
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,152
Which Anon Road took about 10 to 15 minutes

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
A picture of it

29
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,808
Woodlawn High School lets out

30
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
A 215

31
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
Elaborating on his letter

32
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680
Free Windows 10

33
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
There's someone like

34
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:29,504
You know what just trying to not have been committed

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,048
That happens sometimes the guards come by when you're just done mid-sentence

36
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,864
Anyway I can pick up from add-ons letter

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,472
Best Buy

38
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,360
Their major intersections along the way and that there is a ton of traffic at that time on quote

39
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:02,016
And then the murder itself how would he be able to strangle hey a tall strong athletic girl

40
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
Remove her body from the car

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,928
Turn to the trunk and place her in there in broad daylight at 2:30 in the afternoon

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,536
And then I walk into the Best Buy Lobby call Jackie and tell him to come meet me there

43
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
21 minutes

44
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
Hundred percent sure that if someone tried to do it

45
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
It would be impossible on quote

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Producer Dana Chavis and I gave it a shot

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
We tried this drive twice we tried in fact

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
Because full disclosure the first time we screwed it up

49
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
The second time though we were like a machine

50
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
So here we go

51
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
Woodlawn High School Wednesday afternoon

52
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
After school announcements

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
Okay then last bell

54
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,032
More than a thousand students fill the Halls just like Adnan describes in his letter

55
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,920
We figured he gets in her car quickly she's in a hurry

56
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,344
This now 217

57
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
The bell ring at exactly 2:15

58
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
Say that fast as she could have gotten to her car

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Is 2 minutes

60
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
So that's getting the state the benefit of the doubt right

61
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
She's really hustling maybe she can't get to her car and say 2 minutes remember her friend Debbie Warren

62
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,079
Some had told her right after school that she was in a rush to see her new boyfriend Don at the mall

63
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Presumably the Owings Mills mall where they both were

64
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
I think this is the last bus

65
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,831
We do indeed have to wait for the Bus Loop to clear it takes a few minutes

66
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Just have to sit there

67
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
What timing

68
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
We're in the back of the school

69
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
Now is to drive up around to the front of the school

70
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,863
Up around the circle near the gym remember that's where Inez Butler Hendrix says she sees hey

71
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
Who come to grab a snack

72
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,983
Once we get there we're at 11 minutes 38 seconds

73
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
I'm going to run in

74
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Set timing

75
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,967
I run into the gym area where the food cart was run back out to the car

76
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
Turn on to Security Boulevard

77
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Death row

78
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,951
We're trying to get the Best Buy that's still there today

79
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
In 21 minutes we're at 17 minutes right about

80
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,495
17 minutes were just crossing under the Beltway less than a minute later

81
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
There's the sign Best Buy

82
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
A story was that when he pulled into Best Buy

83
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,087
He saw at 9 at the phone booth are at the edge of the building

84
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Wearing red gloves

85
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:53,279
9 motion for Jada follow him across the front of the building around to the other side to the farthest corner of a

86
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Side parking lot

87
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
Where Jay saw his car parked

88
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
This particular part of the parking lot Alaska

89
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
It has significance

90
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,823
After adhan was arrested the detectives interviewed another friend of his

91
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
A kid named Juan

92
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,919
He gotten high with a non one

93
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Ananas car

94
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Her interview

95
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Where was this

96
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
Why did you go to Best Buy parking

97
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Nobody

98
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Is Joyce

99
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
And I hate to go to space

100
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Adnan Syed

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Hey

102
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
We can spend time

103
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
What they would do there

104
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,735
Play Verano para la colonne noted.

105
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
In case you didn't hear that he says

106
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
I think he might have said that they had sex there before

107
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Yeah

108
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,911
This happened the strip to get high at Best Buy that it happened after he went missing

109
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
Meaning

110
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
He was taking John back to the exact spot where he killed Hae

111
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
He was returning to the scene of the crime

112
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,991
From the sounds of it right where Jay says his car was that day

113
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Right where Dana and I are now also part

114
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
It takes Dan and me 18 minutes

115
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
To get to the spot

116
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,719
That leaves three minutes for the actual horror of the thing

117
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
An argument may be

118
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
And strangulation

119
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
He's got to put her body in the trunk

120
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Somehow without anyone seeing

121
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,055
Granted this part of the parking lot is pretty empty but it's still it's a parking lot in the middle of the afternoon

122
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,919
They're definitely cars and people near enough to make this seem like a very very risky move

123
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,807
Counting down the quickest possible imagining of such a thing

124
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Manual strangulation usually takes

125
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
A few minutes

126
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,535
We get out of our car and walk over to where we think the Payphone was according to a sketch J made for the cops

127
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
There's no phone booth there now

128
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:11,007
I just want to pause here and talk about this phone with from it we have not been able to confirm its existence

129
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
The Best Buy employees I talked to did not remember a payphone back then we spoke to the landlord at the time at the property

130
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
Manager they had no record of a peso from 2001

131
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,695
Thor Payphone lots of public funds did come down between 2001

132
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,071
Blueprints for the store when it was built in 1995 nothing

133
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,471
The manager also said there is no record of a service agreement between Best Buy in any pay phone company at that store

134
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,567
We checked with the Maryland Public Service Commission we check with Verizon

135
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
Neither could track down records from that far back

136
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
It seems crazy to me that the cops would have either not checked to make sure it existed or failed to mention it is

137
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Somehow it wasn't there

138
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,695
I never got the call record from this booth there's nothing in their files about it

139
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,327
A trial at nuns lawyer brings up this phone booth when she's trying to attack J's credibility

140
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
She says to the judge

141
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
Quote we believe that the physical description of the actuality of Best Buy including the location of the phone booth

142
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Best Buy

143
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
The entrance existence or non-existence of

144
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
Security cameras Etc she goes on

145
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
I don't know

146
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
We're stumped on this one

147
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
But let's assume it did exist

148
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
That day

149
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,111
The prosecutor said they knew he was dead by 236

150
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,719
Because there's a call at 2:36 to a non cell phone with J has

151
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
Miss a that must be to call Jay told the cops about

152
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,911
Turn on calls his own phone and says come and get me I'm at Best Buy

153
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,287
You can see it on the call log it just says incoming there's no phone number attached incoming calls

154
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
This 2:36 call was 5 Seconds long

155
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
We get out of quarter we put it in

156
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Dial a number

157
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
1

158
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
2

159
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
3

160
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
4

161
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
5

162
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
Stop at 22 and a half

163
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
Let's just be precise about it

164
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191
20 22 22 minutes into seconds

165
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,079
If we just did it in 22 minutes and two seconds and that was leaving about a minute and a half

166
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
In the car

167
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
For the actual

168
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Killing Park

169
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
Should probably be the minimum

170
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Lot of time

171
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
In the car

172
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
I mean if it seems like yeah could be done

173
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
But it seems far-fetched

174
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
It does seem far-fetched

175
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,911
Because there's no room for any errors any pauses even

176
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,543
Buses to drive the strangulation the moving of the body that they all have to happen

177
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,615
Quickly as I possibly can for the 236 call to work

178
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Possible

179
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
Or at least not impossible

180
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
Which is what I was saying in that first letter

181
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,559
When I told him and I more or less did it in the time allowed the 21 minutes

182
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
His overall reaction was incredulity

183
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Seems like 5 minutes

184
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,943
Since you have to wait for the bus

185
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
I don't know

186
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Conscious heart

187
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
Taken out of

188
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
I don't know I mean if you guys like you did it then you did it

189
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
I don't know I don't know what to say that

190
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,471
I don't know what to say I just always thought in my mind

191
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,311
This is what I'll say is it doesn't make me think

192
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
To me it doesn't

193
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Prove anything

194
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Except that it

195
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,015
It's possible it doesn't mean that I think you're lying or that I think

196
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
It even happened at the Best Buy I'm just saying

197
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
If you're going to debunked

198
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
The states

199
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
Timeline

200
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,255
Like we weren't able

201
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
Yeah we weren't able to do that

202
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,399
We weren't able to debunked they're trying

203
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
However

204
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
States timeline

205
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
In the detective notes

206
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
Then I found a handwritten itinerary March 18th 1999

207
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Jay II taped interview with police

208
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,839
This is the route J laid out for the cops his entire driving day on January 13th

209
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
This is what we're going to try to replicate

210
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,447
To see if it matches the call record from that day

211
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,567
Because right the prosecution story of the crime was mainly pin to two things

212
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Chase statements

213
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
And the sound records

214
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:09,759
Anon remembers that at his trial the prosecution had a big blow up chart of the call record

215
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,111
Enlisting 34 calls made and received an on cell phone that day

216
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
With blanks beside each call

217
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,767
Everytime I witness identified a, list the prosecutor would label it with a sticker

218
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Call Jen pusateri

219
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
It was a pretty powerful thing

220
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Because as he was testifying

221
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
Cell phone records

222
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
Okay be said what happened at this time

223
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
Besides the calls themselves they also had a list of all the cell towers that paint each time up

224
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,743
Particular call came in or went out

225
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,095
Sure the prosecutor said you might have your doubts about Jay

226
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
But the call record doesn't lie

227
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
Jake and possibly have known which Towers were getting paid when he couldn't fabricate that it would be

228
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,919
So the cell towers and the calls and Jay Story the way they all meshed

229
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
Prosecutors argue with irrefutable

230
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,319
Prosecutor Casey Murphy said to the jury in her closing statement quote

231
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,719
The most important thing for you to remember about Jay's testimony is that it does not stand alone it is corroborated

232
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Chatot

233
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,375
The cell phone records support with those Witnesses say and the witnesses support with those cell phone records say

234
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
There's no way around it

235
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
All right ready

236
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
So I started it

237
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,615
It's 2:51 and we're making a right out of the Best Buy parking lot

238
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
On to Belmont Ave all right so let's see if we can recreate what Jace has happened that day

239
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
The next stop after Best Buy is the I-70 park and ride

240
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
Where Jay says they leave his car for a few hours

241
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
It's just a large commuter parking lot

242
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,863
Jay says he follows Adnan there Anon is driving his car Jay has an on scar

243
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,983
He's pretty careful to let the cops know he wasn't ever in his car never touched her or her stuff

244
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,055
Did you get out of the car the car and

245
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,359
This is from J second tape statement

246
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
Trumpkin

247
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
The backseat

248
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
This detail has always struck me by the way

249
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,903
Anon is going through the trunk of his car at the I-70 park and ride

250
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
His body is back there

251
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
In the trunk at this point

252
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
But anyway

253
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
Several items you picked up in

254
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
Move around stuff Academy

255
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Came over to his card

256
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
Show me Paw Patrol Paw Patrol

257
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
And then he got in the driver's seat

258
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
And we switch places

259
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
And I got the passenger

260
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,295
Text Dana and me 11 minutes to get to the park and ride from Best Buy

261
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,111
Then we wait a couple minutes to account for a nun's movement

262
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,999
In case you're wondering if there were no security cameras at this park and ride back in 99 which exit.

263
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
So now it's a little after 3 p.m.

264
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,911
I took the cops on this ride on March 18th to Matt about the timeline

265
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
He told him that after they left the park and ride they went in search of weed

266
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
He says that's when he calls his friend Patrick

267
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
And this is where things start to get off

268
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,431
There is indeed a call to Patrick on the call log

269
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
But it's at 3:59 p.m.

270
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
The Runaway we've got a Time problem

271
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,903
Jay has sorted that out so his story better match the call log

272
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,535
He testified that he called Jen pusateri 1st at 3:21 to find out if Patrick was home

273
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,679
Jen testified that no Jay would not have called her to find out where Patrick was it's just not a thing that would have happened

274
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,007
Trinity case there is a call to Jen a321

275
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,639
Chase's when they didn't find Patrick at home they switched course and headed up to Forest Park to buy weed

276
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
Didn't I drive that same route

277
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,271
Are they said they buy two dimes of weed here that's a side note

278
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Done

279
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
We are making a left

280
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
Jay also mentioned another call around this time

281
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,839
This call is incredibly important and I will talk more about it and another episode I swear

282
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,399
But for right now what you need to know is

283
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,239
In his second interview when the cops show him the list of calls

284
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,311
Jay says Adnan spoke to some girl in Silver Spring

285
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,639
Her name was Nisha that girl would not have been flirting with

286
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
Briefly put J on the phone with her

287
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,879
And the reason this is so important is for two reasons one it's the only call in this stretch of time that's to some

288
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Anondo

289
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
Rather than a friend of Jays

290
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
And

291
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:40,351
It puts Jay and Adnan together in the middle of the afternoon when a nan says he was not with Jack he was back at

292
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
High School

293
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,727
In the March 18th itinerary there's a note about the Nisha call

294
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,799
Turn on handed the phone to Jay at the golf course

295
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
On West Forest Park Avenue

296
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
Yeah that is the first okay

297
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,711
If indeed this is the golf course he's saying where

298
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,831
Suspect hands the phone to the 10 to the witness who is Jay that was the Nisha call

299
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
And that does happen right now

300
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,743
So the time works for this one and not just a story

301
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,839
Here's the problem it doesn't match the cell tower in the car records

302
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,679
It's picking at our back near the Best Buy West of where we are

303
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
And that is true of all these calls from the middle of the afternoon the 321 to Jen 332 Denisha 3

304
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:28,991
848-283-5092 Patrick paying the tower near where Jay tells the cops

305
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,295
They were driving at afternoon not a one

306
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,207
A child and accounted for in Jay's testimony

307
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,791
Prosecutors did not point out that the cell towers didn't match

308
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
Announce defense attorney

309
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,703
Sort of but reading a trial transcript even if she notes the discrepancy

310
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
She doesn't nail it

311
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,799
So it's hard to tell what the discrepancy means

312
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
So onward we are headed to Pasco state park right now

313
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
We definitely don't have time to go to Patapsco well let's see how long

314
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,839
This is the next stop on the itinerary The Cliffs at Patapsco State Park which is a good 20-minute Drive

315
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
From where we are right now

316
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
I don't track practice starts at 4 p.m.

317
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
It before we were sort of clinging respectively to the great upon timeline thumb our noses

318
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
Yeah I mean this just seems absurd it's 3

319
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,039
Set between 3:45 and 3:50 now and their world

320
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,951
And if I'm on on and I need to be seen for truck I'm freaking out right now that I need to get back to track

321
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
To have an alibi

322
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,863
What's this like

323
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,191
Across the county to go to a state park to smoke a blunt like

324
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
Pull up to smoke in your car and

325
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,359
It just seems like there had to be other places you could have just pulled over for a quick smoke

326
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
If indeed that's what needed to happen

327
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
There's a shrimp sale at The Crab Crib

328
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
Sometimes I think Dana isn't listening to me

329
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,927
Anyway we had to Patapsco State Park because Jay is very clear

330
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
Take statement Number One Taste

331
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
Remember to March 18th itinerary

332
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
Now is when they go smoke a blunt at the Cliffs at Patapsco

333
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
My truck in there

334
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
Domini

335
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
Refune steps

336
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
This is beautiful

337
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
You can see the river below some train tracks

338
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
Chase memories about the spider specific

339
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
Daenerys from the handwritten notes March 18th

340
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Chinese religious texts

341
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
That's it says Patapsco Valley State Park

342
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
1630 hour

343
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,999
And then the next node is Sun getting ready to hit mountaintops

344
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,327
1630 hour means 4:30 p.m.

345
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,655
Sunset that day was at 5:05 p.m. so that would make sense

346
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,751
And then it says I can't believe I did it I'm sad but not really

347
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
Here's what J says they talked about

348
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,407
And before I play this mixtape just a warning that is disturbing

349
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,247
Percentage overlooking a whole bunch of stuff at this Cliff you're not

350
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
He starts

351
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Tell me about

352
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
How was when he killed her house

353
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
He said he wrapped his hand around her

354
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,376
Started kicking then he said he looked up to make sure nobody was

355
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Look in the car Adam

356
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
Synonym for fingernails

357
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,992
Emily. She's trying to say something that she thinks that she was trying to say that she was starting but that's what she deserves

358
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
How long

359
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Do you think you're worthless

360
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
20 minutes to happiness

361
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,744
Other than that conversation was there anything additional

362
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
It said to me wonders where you can put the body at

363
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Did you make any suggestions

364
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Not at all

365
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Did he name any location

366
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
You didn't say you know what about here yo

367
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
He didn't name up

368
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200
They have dozens locations and you gave him

369
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
Thumbs up or thumbs down

370
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
John PS

371
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Say something to me

372
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:29,120
Defective State Park where we were a little bit up the river but I told him that

373
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
People walk up and down there

374
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,264
AJ says they talked about the murder at the cliffs

375
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,128
He said they talked about whether to dispose of the body right there and Patapsco State Park

376
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
He says they're there for 20 minutes to half an hour

377
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,344
Come trial when json the stand talking about where they went that day

378
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
This whole trip to Patapsco and never happens

379
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
It's just not there

380
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,840
Instead it happens in a nun's car when they're tooling around looking to buy weed

381
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,984
This is a puzzle to me it's such a vivid scene describing it's so detailed

382
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,800
I have to think he included it for a good reason

383
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
But it doesn't fit the timeline

384
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
Patapsco story at all

385
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,696
It's like trying to

386
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,608
I'm trying to think of an analogy

387
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
The uselessness of what we're trying to do

388
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
By recreating something that doesn't

389
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
Fit

390
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
Like trying to plot

391
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:50,016
You know the coordinates of someone's dream or something we're just like 420 that doesn't like as if we're going to be surprised every single time but it's

392
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
It's not

393
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Probably call it a Fool's errand

394
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,304
A trial Jason on gets another call I just dropping an on off at school for track

395
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,656
Before he left the car he received a phone call or placed a phone call

396
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
It was in Arabic

397
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
I don't know who he was talking to I don't know what it entails

398
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
I believe it was his mother on quote

399
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,640
Adnan and his family say he doesn't speak Arabic

400
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Or Pashto or Urdu

401
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,528
Accent on the other end of the call

402
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,368
And there is a 427 call in the log maybe that's the one

403
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,464
But again the cell tower pings isn't near Woodlawn High School

404
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,632
The earliest and I can get from The Cliffs back to Woodlawn is 4:45 p.m. and that's being generous

405
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,960
But even so that means if an OnStar to get changed

406
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:47,360
He is very late for 4 p.m. track now which seems like a bad strategy

407
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Wait like that

408
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,456
Jay says he goes next to a friend's house

409
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
I'm going to call this friend Kathy because she didn't want to be identified

410
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,856
Jay says he gets there by 5:20 or 5:30

411
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:04,000
He says he smokes more weed there but it's not long before an on calls him and says I'm done with track come get me

412
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
Chickens back to Woodlawn to get an on

413
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,656
She tells the cops that he gets to Woodlawn at about 6 p.m.

414
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Andre season on with a friend from track

415
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
The notes for March 18th say

416
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
Said goodbye to track buddy will

417
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
That day

418
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,456
DJ by the wheel and then

419
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
That is Will

420
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
Amtrak

421
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
It's hard to remember that

422
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
What a contraction

423
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
You mean I should have asked you 15 years ago

424
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Maybe

425
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,560
That's hard to remember

426
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,424
I didn't even know that I was apart of anything until you just told me that like

427
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
No one ever contacted me about everything

428
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Really

429
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Yeah like

430
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,408
No cops ever called you and said with an eye on it

431
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,504
Track that day no no attorneys no attorneys ever called and said

432
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,088
Did you work with a non present at track practice at

433
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
I don't remember any of that

434
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,952
Will confirm that yes track started at 4

435
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
So you had quite a bit of time from the end of school at 2:15

436
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
Big round

437
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,728
No playing footsies with your little girlfriend and then go get back to go get ready for practice

438
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,568
Ready and on top of an excuse to be late

439
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
Because there was so much

440
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:30,016
Exactly what would happen if you were really late or you skipped or

441
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
It was already,

442
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,392
Actually like giving you my love

443
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
Family emergency

444
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Okay

445
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,424
Their coach Michaels I told the cops that are non probably was there that day

446
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,984
3 things you didn't notice of a non wasn't there

447
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
But I couldn't be a hundred percent sure

448
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,688
The other thing will told me he saw Jay pick up and also drop off at 9 for track multiple times

449
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,992
Yeah that was just normal

450
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,808
Normal to the point where no one will pay attention to it

451
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Right

452
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
So you can't solve this crime for us

453
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Wish I could oh my goodness

454
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
There's another problem with the track story

455
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
Jay says he gets up not at about 6

456
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,360
There's an outgoing call at 5:38 p.m.

457
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
2 anons friend Krista

458
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,688
Someone J would not be calling

459
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,040
Which would suggest Adnan had his phone at 5:38 p.m.

460
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,184
Call Pings a tower that's out near that guy Patrick's house so does near where they end up ditching his car

461
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,232
Not at all close to Woodlawn High School

462
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,072
I could keep going here to The Bitter End Of The Night

463
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
But I'm hoping you'll take my word for it

464
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
The timeline has some problems

465
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
I'm going to try very hard not to bore you right now but I do want to talk about

466
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
Outsell records for a sec

467
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:12,160
Because I want to know whether the state use the call records accurately and fairly in a dunce trial

468
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
Do the records really corroborates a story

469
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,376
Seen some recent reports about how cell phone evidence isn't as reliable as it was once cracked up to be

470
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,960
Washington Post ran a story in June for instance with the headline

471
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,312
Experts say law enforcement's use of cellphone records can be inaccurate

472
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,432
Federal courts in Oregon and Illinois have ruled cell phone evidence inadmissible

473
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
The problems arise when you're trying to say I can prove you were at such-and-such a place at such-and-such a time because of the cell

474
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,136
Power that your phone paint

475
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:49,280
You can't do that with certainty because of the way cell towers get activated and how much charge were they cover

476
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
In fact these kinds of records are mostly useful as a way to say where someone wasn't rather than where he or she was

477
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,592
Call Pings a tower in downtown Baltimore I'm going to be pretty confident that you're not making that call from

478
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
Annapolis or DC

479
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
Or Patapsco State Park

480
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,576
The first I know Adam case was the first in Maryland to use cell tower technology as evidence

481
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
There's a new thing

482
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,952
Because I am technologically speaking a moron

483
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
I asked Dana to find out

484
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,888
Did the cell experts who testified at trial present the technology accurately in a way that still holds up

485
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,008
So Dana sent this gripping testimony to two different engineering professors

486
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,568
Purdue and one at Stanford University

487
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
Yes

488
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
The way the science is explained in here is right

489
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,504
Anyway that the stakes expert a guy named Abraham aronowitz

490
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Custody cell site

491
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,648
I just going around to different spots and dialing a number and noting the tower it ping

492
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
That's legit

493
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
What is not junk science

494
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
But that's a different question from

495
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,120
Does the science is explaining here actually support the state's case

496
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,936
Did the prosecution deploy that science fair Lee

497
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,776
That's a more complicated question with a more complicated answer

498
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:12,224
Aronowitz the cell expert and prosecutor Casey Murphy did the sight test

499
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Together

500
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
She took him around to various locations connected to Jay story

501
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
Explain it to me

502
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,464
They went to the spots that matter the most in the story of the crime

503
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
What's the place is like

504
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Jen's house

505
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
The Best Buy

506
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:33,728
We can park where where hey was buried so like those places that are really important Kathy's Apartments

507
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
2nd stage 14 of the

508
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,872
That's right. The state in October they do 14 of them

509
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Do you know how many Nevada fit trial

510
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
They asked

511
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
The cell phone expert about

512
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Four of them

513
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
Really for us

514
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Four of them

515
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,792
Because the rest of the tests didn't really help their argument

516
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,888
Which is their prerogative their job is to put on the strongest possible case

517
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,800
But of the foresight test they do talk about one is a test run and what's does in a place called gilston Park which I'm not even

518
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Can explain

519
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
It's basically irrelevant to our story

520
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
The other three places

521
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
It all happened in Jay's narrative

522
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
After 6 p.m.

523
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
After J had picked a nun up from track

524
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
Serta from 12:07 until

525
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
6

526
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
07

527
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,720
That window of time is where

528
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Kind of

529
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,304
Jay's story doesn't line up

530
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
With the cell phone records

531
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,168
And the timeline he's giving is also not lining up with

532
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
The times of the cell phone

533
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
So the towers the times

534
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
And Jay's story are not matching right

535
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
Anywhere in that basic

536
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
6 hour.

537
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,600
This is sort of what date and I have experienced on our drive that day but it wasn't plotting out

538
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
Just a word about the cell tower testimony

539
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
It took two days

540
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
And it was sort of a mess

541
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
Announce defense attorney Christina Gutierrez

542
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:08,192
Claimed she didn't have all the cell record of attention have the cell tower maps she tries to get we're running with

543
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Testimony thrown out

544
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
The judge nearly agrees with her

545
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,872
Prosecutor Kevin urick and the Basking for a mistrial which isn't granted

546
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,968
And this might sound like exciting courtroom fireworks but I just

547
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,808
I can't stress enough how tedious this must have been for the jury

548
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,368
And also possibly confusing

549
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,952
This is actually a young guy on the stand he looks

550
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Kind of like George Stephanopoulos

551
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
Except tired and fearful

552
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:38,400
Here's one of the more lively moments of his testimony prosecutor Kevin urick talks first

553
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
Wiping your breakfast

554
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
RAM for cell phones

555
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
Functioning

556
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Wireless camera

557
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,872
Overruled if you know

558
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,200
Depends on the quality of the phone

559
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
How might that affect you

560
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,016
Objection

561
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Overalls and again

562
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
If you know

563
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Poor performance

564
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
If how so

565
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
Objection

566
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Disappointment

567
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
Mister on York

568
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,424
Unless you are prepared to last position

569
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,008
Seriously most of it is more boring than that

570
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,824
Which is why I made a Nereid at all so I didn't have to

571
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:23,456
She explained that the cell site test the prosecution did bring up a trial the ones after 6 p.m.

572
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,344
The first one was about a site near Kathy's apartment remember that's the call Adnan get to Kathy's

573
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,672
When officer Adcock called asking if he seen hey

574
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,976
It says that one worked

575
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
At 6:24 p.m. call in the winter

576
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
It matches the cell tower and matches the call log and it matches Jay story Adnan story and Kathy

577
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Happy Story 2

578
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,056
It puts Jane and on together at a certain place at a certain time

579
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,640
The question is what happens after that

580
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:59,040
Chase's after the Adcock called they left Kathy's and that's when they went to Barry hay and leakin Park

581
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,696
Then they ditched her car out of Edmondson Avenue and then they headed back toward Westview Mall where they true evidence in

582
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Dumpsters

583
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:13,632
And if you map the cell towers that ping between 6:24 p.m. and say 805

584
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
If you imagine each Tower lighting up

585
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
Illuminate this Trail

586
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,312
They support the locations in Jay's story

587
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:26,176
Confirm this with riveting testimony that sounds like this

588
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Yes

589
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,576
The most incriminating stop on the route that night is of course we can park

590
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:37,440
There were two incoming calls one at 7:09 and one at 7:16

591
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,256
The hit a tower at the Northwest end of the park

592
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:46,400
I asked Dana since the range of that leakin Park Tower reaches Beyond just the territory of the park

593
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,704
Could they have been someplace else besides

594
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
Digging a grave in the actual Park

595
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,312
I do have been at someone's house or something

596
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
It's possible you could have been here with that like this is

597
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Patrick's house

598
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,808
One of his address for Catherine since these are strips

599
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,624
Maybe you could have been there okay

600
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
I think they were probably in Lincoln Park

601
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Okay

602
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
Because it's

603
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Just

604
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:19,424
I don't think I thought the amount of Lucky would have to have to make up a story like that and then have

605
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
The cell phone records corroborate those key points

606
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
I just don't

607
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
That's possible

608
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,640
Isn't that sort of tantamount to say

609
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
I think they were in

610
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
The truth

611
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,552
I'm saying I think the cell phone was in Lincoln Park

612
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
Right

613
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
Looks pretty bad for a non

614
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:45,536
Because even though the cell towers can't say who was with the phone or who was making the call

615
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:50,144
And I'm self says he's pretty sure he was with his phone at that time after track

616
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,984
Getting his memory is vague. I probably would have

617
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,056
But he says that from what he can remember the evening

618
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
After he got the call from officer Adcock

619
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,432
He remembers dropping Jay off at some point

620
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,992
And then he said he would have gone to the mosque for prayers

621
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
What is Ramadan

622
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,624
He doesn't say he lent his phone out or his car to Jay or anyone else that evening

623
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,208
So according to Adnan he was with the phone

624
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
I'm twice that night the phone ping the tower near leakin Park

625
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,352
So bad for Adnan

626
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
On the other hand

627
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:28,032
Also undermined what J tells the cops about that same trip to Lincoln Park

628
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,384
The actor called Cathy's ends about 6:29 p.m.

629
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,456
But we can park calls are 40 minutes later

630
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:41,344
Put chases after the iPad call henan on left Kathy's and then they do a bunch of different things

631
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,696
They drive to Jay's house for shovels then to I-70 park and ride for Hays

632
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:52,096
Karsten Jacobs to McDonalds back by school to wait for Adnan says he's there waiting for about 20 minutes

633
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,704
Then they drive all around for a while back over to Patapsco then

634
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Security

635
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
Before they finally get to Lincoln Park

636
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,336
All that what I just described

637
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
That takes an hour and 20 minutes

638
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,432
Twice as long in other words

639
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Pinnacle lock accounts for

640
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm not trying to be Petty Here

641
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,904
I don't think we should hold to some Crystal Clear timeline

642
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,280
How could you possibly remember each twist and turn and phone call from that day 6 weeks later

643
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
Ever

644
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
If the state is saying

645
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:29,472
Adnan Syed is guilty because we have this witness and his story is backed up by cell records

646
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,872
What I see is have this witness but his story has shifted rather significantly over time

647
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:41,504
And you have his call records but I don't think there is Ironclad as you're making them out to be

648
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,112
Because for the most part they don't exactly align with your Witnesses narrative

649
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,208
There are key moments when they do support his version of that night

650
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,512
But what about the rest of the day

651
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,408
Whatever is true even with the prosecutor says

652
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,480
Moses tablet

653
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,576
Whatever something I'm saying is like the Holy Grail we don't know where it is

654
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,880
It really exists

655
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,976
But that's not cool though because now what you're saying is that you can use

656
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
Shuffle records

657
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,536
When it benefits me

658
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
That was a 30-minute cutoff

659
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
Adhan called back

660
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
So but just finished the rent went on

661
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
All the calls

662
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
The 236 call is the most Troublesome to Anan

663
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,480
It's the one he probably thinks about the most

664
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,296
Because that's the call that starts the whole chain

665
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,392
He also thinks about it because he says he has an alibi for that time

666
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
The Asia letters

667
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,464
Where she said she saw him in the library

668
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,560
Here's a weird thing about the 236 call

669
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:03,168
The prosecutors are very clear at trial that this is the come and get me I'm at Best Buy call

670
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,240
But they're not basing it on anyone's testimony

671
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Jennifer says the call was at that time

672
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,408
He says repeatedly that Adnan called him around 3:40 or 3:45

673
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,992
Jen also says that's about when Jay left her house that day

674
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,600
But there is no incoming call at or near 345 on the call log

675
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,672
The prosecution has to go with 236

676
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,512
Because it's the only one that's sort of lines jstory up with the log

677
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
Is their only choice

678
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,912
When you tease apart the state's case you can get tripped up on details like this

679
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:40,032
Which is maybe why prosecutor Kevin urick address this head-on in his opening statement to the jury

680
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
He told them

681
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,104
Look at the big picture

682
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,944
The main plot points in Jay story have been consistent

683
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,760
He tells them that consistently J quote

684
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,344
Has always given the same story about what the defendant did wear

685
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,672
Consistently he tells Jennifer a consistent story

686
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,488
He tells police a consistent story about the defendant

687
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,304
It has consistently the defendants involvement

688
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
The defendant's actions on that day

689
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,912
He has never wavered on that point unquote

690
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,240
That is a lot of consistently is

691
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,056
Maybe it's not great oratory

692
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
It does have the advantage of being true

693
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,200
Commence wild a particular shifted

694
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
The spine of his story did not

695
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,112
Anon told Jay was going to do it and then showed him the body they buried her in Lincoln Park

696
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
They ditched her car

697
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
Jay has been consistent on those points

698
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,560
Itsfunneh there's this part of the trial that keeps coming back to me

699
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,632
Twin Christina Gutierrez is cross-examining J

700
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,704
Just pointing out that he lied to detectives about various things

701
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,568
Including the location where he says Adnan showed him his body in the trunk of the car

702
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,128
What you told them

703
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,968
Interactive showing them that place

704
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,576
They're not

705
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,904
What's the opposite of the

706
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,464
Objection sustained

707
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,328
You told them something that is not

708
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,936
The truth Naruto

709
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,776
You back it up showing them up slang

710
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
That was not true

711
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
I told him the truth

712
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,688
I did not show them in a location extreme now

713
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
He says I told him the truth

714
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,576
I did not show them a location that was true

715
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,208
Is oxymoronic as that sounds I think I see what he saying

716
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
Yes I told him lies

717
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
I told the truth

718
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
Overall I told the truth

719
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
Parts of J story that make no sense

720
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,008
It seems like there must have been more going on than he's saying

721
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
But here's what's also the truth

722
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,407
You can say the same thing about Adnan Story 2

723
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
Next time

724
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
