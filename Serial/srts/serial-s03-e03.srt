I'm not going to press charges it doesn't matter if you're fine

00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
But I have to take you to jail because you hit a police

I'm ceracade

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,776
A while back and maybe when I went to a meeting about community policing in Cleveland

30
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
The police department had invited people to a banquet hall for a workshop

31
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Big round tables filled the space

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
Representatives from the police department or sprinkled throughout

33
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,784
Any stable had a moderator to keep things moving

34
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,904
The group is supposed to answer a bunch of questions about what kinds of problems they wanted police to deal with

35
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,720
My table was populated with rule-followers

36
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
They dutifully work their way down the list of questions

37
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,888
The kids are hanging out in abandoned house in your neighborhood what should the police do about that

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,240
I guess I would hope that they would start by talking to the kids and

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,592
Reminding them that some people have to go to sleep and get up and work the next

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
Stay and be a little more

41
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
Cigarette

42
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Thank God for a manual

43
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,832
He was sitting a few tables to the east of me and he sending me over there

44
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Because his table

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Brass tacks

46
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
Lot of young African-Americans

47
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,584
Music particular we are afraid of the police officer

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
I'm just going to be on it

49
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
I have a guy with an attorney

50
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
The civil rights cases

51
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,776
A police Commander sitting at the table Langley responded to him

52
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Chris that's a broad brush

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,176
That's a broad brush you just have not afraid of me you not afraid of me

54
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Which we just met we just may I take your hand again

55
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,344
Exactly you see me you see me here today in my suit

56
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
This was the struggle of the table

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,768
The citizens wanting to talk historically culturally structurally

58
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
The cops wanting to talk specifically

59
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Personally

60
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Procedurally

61
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
The tables moderator was stalwart

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
She tried her level best to keep everyone on task there was just no way

63
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
We can have meeting for Dad

64
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,944
Mini if you said earlier we don't do a good job of getting people to come out

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
Would you do that way but how else do we

66
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,576
Send out to get feedback how can we engage more people

67
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
In this process

68
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
I want to know

69
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,208
What responsibilities or what

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
Right Discipline Do the police get for harassing the community

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
But I will make sure that

72
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
City of Cleveland Police Department have been corrupt for over 70 years when will

73
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,224
Can you go back and tell him it's right setting over 70 years that have been corrupt

74
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
When is

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
That's Amore Rising that one white police in here

76
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
They need to be in here here now

77
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
You tell him I said that okay you tell him I said it

78
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
This woman saying it

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Miss rice

80
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
Is Samaria rice

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Her son was Tamir rice

82
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
You've probably heard his name before

83
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,239
He was shot and killed by Cleveland Police a few years back

84
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
When he was 12 years old

85
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
Kitten playing around with a fake gun in a city park

86
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
Someone called nine-one-one the police drove up on em

87
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Shot him in the stomach with in a couple of seconds

88
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,623
Whenever you talk about police or two police in Cleveland Tamir rice is right there

89
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,183
Below the surface on the surface

90
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
His killing causes Civic spasm

91
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,839
Between police and the public but still painful and still unresolved

92
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,959
Santa Maria rice shows up at a meeting about the community's expectations from police

93
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
She speaks with Dreadful moral Authority

94
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,103
At first I didn't understand what Miss rice wanted from this meeting

95
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
She didn't seem interested in the State admission of the workshop

96
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
List of questions

97
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
For the community

98
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
Because it's going to be for the police today

99
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,487
The reason is aggravated because

100
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
That's what this mean it should be about you

101
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,239
We have an estimate no that's the main thing that's the main topic

102
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Episodes of anything else that night

103
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:41,503
All of that falls upon the Earth

104
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
One of the two police officers at the table jumps in

105
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
He says

106
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Which I completely get

107
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
How can you help us do that

108
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
What is a solution

109
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
She's laughing

110
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
That's what I got it

111
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,007
But there's something absurdly wrongheaded to her and to a lot of people in Cleveland mostly black people

112
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
With this Earnest sounding question

113
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
How can you help us do that

114
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Tamiya Raisa saying

115
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
Why are you turning his back on me

116
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
Why is it my job to help you do your job the way you're supposed to

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,343
You're the ones with the Cruisers in the handcuffs in the tasers and the god

118
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
She saying for god sakes

119
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Physician

120
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Heal thyself

121
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,703
A persistent slogan in Cleveland even four years after his killing

122
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Is Justice for Tamir

123
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
The case was investigated by three different agencies

124
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
City state and federal

125
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,687
The mayor appointed his own panel for fourth investigation

126
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
None found that the officers broke the law

127
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
Steuben County prosecutor handle the case with the delicacy of a lumberjack calling it a perfect storm of human error

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Mistakes and miscommunications

129
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
Should have come as a surprise to no-one when a grand jury declined to indict

130
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
Technically you can argue

131
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,727
How many police officers in prosecutors do that Justice was applied in Tamir rice his case

132
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
But it doesn't feel that way

133
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,615
Instead it feels like an open question haunting the courthouse

134
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
If you're harmed by police

135
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
What does it take

136
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Define Justice in court

137
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
Knife feels like justice

138
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
One way to try

139
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
Is by filing a lawsuit

140
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Suing the police

141
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
We're going to

142
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Euclid Ohio

143
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
A little bird on the Eastside of Cleveland

144
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
To meet with

145
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
My client

146
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Aramis Spencer

147
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
I was going with apartment

148
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,127
I'm going to talk to him about what happened to him a couple weeks ago

149
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
I'm in the car with Paul cristallo

150
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Civil rights attorney

151
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
10 days earlier he sent me a text

152
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
Those photos of a guy in a hospital bed

153
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
Is face hugely puffed up on one side

154
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,487
Skin so tight from swelling that you could see the hospital lights reflected in his cheek

155
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,303
His left eye was submerged by the distortion

156
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
The guy's mother said he'd been beaten up by two police

157
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
She found Paul's number called him up

158
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
Asking is there anything we can do

159
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,335
I'll talk to her talk to Hermes suicide sounded cogency

160
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Ciara

161
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
Had no criminal record to speak of

162
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
Few misdemeanor convictions but nothing violent

163
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Spell decided

164
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Does a good case

165
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,111
And we're going for me right you actually don't have business with him today as is for me

166
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
History of crack

167
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Thank you

168
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
You're welcome

169
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
You know a lot of people in the building

170
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Yes

171
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
Aramis his face hasn't fully healed

172
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
When I was still blood red

173
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
He described above his eyebrow

174
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
How long have you lived here

175
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
3 years

176
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
3

177
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Where do you live before

178
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
I was living on 115th

179
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
Is that in Cleveland

180
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Euclid is safer cleaner

181
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Commerce

182
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Then a lot of neighborhoods in Cleveland

183
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Especially if you're from a dangerous neighborhood

184
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Save got a teenager trying to keep out of the street

185
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,999
You might send them to his Andres grandma and you could put in school there

186
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
Airbus' building is called Richmond Hills

187
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
Apartment complex built in the 1960s

188
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
I'm so tired out by now

189
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
Irma's lives on the 5th floor

190
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,031
He wants me through his version of what happened that day

191
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
The police have a different version which will get to later

192
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,943
Therapist says he come downstairs to bum a cigarette from a friend on the 4th

193
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783
And a couple cops were coming down the stairwell at one end of the hallway

194
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Anime songs

195
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
Standing there knocking at his friends door

196
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
So sorry they can do that

197
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
I was going to tell you through the window

198
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,279
Yeah they saw me through the window I was standing at the door knocking at the door

199
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
And they came and stopped me

200
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Right here where we standing

201
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
So they did they talk to you from there

202
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Yes they were basically telling me to stop

203
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
You know just stay still

204
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
And they want to ask me some questions whatever

205
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,407
And it was two of them like mess we how y'all standing

206
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
And

207
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
Dachshund for my ID and asked me to searching for weapons in cops around the hallways before so that was

208
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
Surprised they work security here Moonlighting technically they're off-duty but they're in uniform and they are full

209
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,351
Police Powers most normal by the way lots of cops do this in Cuyahoga County

210
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:17,215
And Hermes had had run-ins with the police before and mostly they gone okay

211
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
Not counting the time he says he was jaywalking in East Cleveland and a cop stopped him and he ended up getting whacked in the knee repeatedly with a billy club in a rush

212
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
President put in jail for the night

213
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,759
But mostly he felt like he knew how to successfully navigate these interactions

214
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,647
With the Euclid cops that day he figured his best strategy was to cooperate and get it over with

215
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,743
He wasn't doing anything wrong he didn't want to give the cops any reason to suspect otherwise

216
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
So says he showed them his ID told him he lived upstairs

217
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
He said they asked if they could search him for weapons

218
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Which means a pat down there feeling around for a gun

219
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,287
An air mass allowed in he didn't have a weapon on him he wasn't worried

220
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
What you did have on him with a blood

221
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
Marijuana cigarette in the pocket of his jeans

222
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,063
Which the cops found and which I'll get back to you because this measly blunt will become an outside player in the story

223
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,903
Anyway next thing Erma's new the officers went to arrest him

224
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
The other officer on this side

225
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Acme

226
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
2

227
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:17,375
Put my hands behind my back I told them what am I under arrest where I'm asking like what am I under arrest for

228
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,447
And you never told me what I was under arrest for

229
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
At that point Irma says he stiffened his arm

230
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,823
The arm that one of the officers was trying to put behind his back

231
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Who is resisting technically

232
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
And he's also asking

233
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
Why are you arresting me what did I do

234
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
No answer

235
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Discussion

236
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
And then

237
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
The one on your side

238
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
He was like shut the f****** and need me and my boss

239
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
And I went down

240
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
Orissa my balls immediately like this

241
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
The other officer trying to tell me on the ground

242
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
I guess as if he was going to

243
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Don't you know the procedure how they

244
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
You know if you resist arrest

245
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
They have a right to throw you to the ground

246
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Put your hands behind your back

247
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
But they didn't put my hands on her better have one hand behind my back

248
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,943
And then other one to the kicking my face while I was on the ground

249
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,015
The kickin' Irma says is what caused the damage to his face

250
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Broken orbital bone

251
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
That's about around your eye

252
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:14,463
A public defender in Cleveland told me how everyone's always whining about a broken orbital bone

253
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:20,095
What an air mass is case it was bad enough that the Euclid ER folks transferred him to a bigger Hospital in Cleveland

254
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
To make sure I would be okay

255
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,775
Anyway Aramis is down on the ground when cop is kicking him in the face another cop is holding back his right arm

256
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
His left arm is pinned underneath them

257
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
He can't get it free

258
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
Hermes got down on the gross hallway carpet to xiaomi

259
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,015
I didn't need him to do that but it seems as if he wanted to replay each step

260
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Wish I could understand

261
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
It only been 10 days since it happened

262
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Dan got his mind around it

263
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
I'm right here

264
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
My head is right here

265
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
The blood is leaking from my face

266
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Going down dropping

267
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
What's the weather like this

268
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
So what happened was

269
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
He pays me right here

270
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
Something like this it takes me right here

271
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Pays me and my neck

272
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Tase me in the back of my thigh

273
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
And taste me and my left chest right here

274
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
And then I finally I told him like

275
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
I'm going to let you put my hands behind my back

276
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
And they put my hands behind my back pick me up

277
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
Oh my God is that your blood right there

278
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,791
There was a smear of blood with a big drip going down the wall at exactly the height of air masses I

279
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Which isn't very high by the way

280
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
Nervous about 5657 I'd say

281
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
X-lite

282
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
The police tase him about 7 times

283
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
Not the full deployment each time where the wires come out in everything

284
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
The Lesser taser setting where it shocks and burns

285
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
Irma said he could feel electricity shoot down his legs

286
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,295
There's the burn marks to from the city mean

287
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,159
Aaron's furniture some spots that are feet where the carpet fibers were melted and Clump together

288
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Is Hazel rare

289
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Oh my God

290
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
Burn through my skin just like a burn through the carpet

291
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
So

292
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,567
Irma said while all this was going on the police were cursing at him he was cursing back

293
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
He said I just kept asking them why why are y'all doing this

294
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
What did I do to deserve this

295
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
He says they would not answer

296
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,575
Aramis if he'd been scared or enraged

297
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,391
The word he used was uncomfortable

298
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
Is it the whole thing made him feel uncomfortable which seems like an oddly muted way to express being kicked in the head by a cop

299
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,191
He also said he was trying not to let what happened distract him mentally not let it take him out of his everyday life

300
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
He said he just turned 30 a few days earlier

301
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
His family his girlfriend had gathered around him to cheer him up

302
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
He tried to celebrate

303
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
I got the sense he wasn't ready to stare too hard it would happen

304
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
For now

305
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
He'd leave it at uncomfortable

306
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,647
There's a security camera in the hallway right near the door he was knocking on

307
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,767
But it was pointed straight down we saw it so it seemed quite possible that even if it were working at the time

308
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Apparently wasn't

309
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
Mapreduce footage of the floor

310
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,447
As the cops walked Aramis out of the building he says they were talking s*** to him

311
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
It doesn't remember exactly what they said

312
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
One more false move

313
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Going to make it even worse for you the next

314
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Then they put him in an ambulance

315
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,295
Backup an air mass is apartment we talked about that marijuana cigarette he had in his pocket

316
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,135
Dermis is thinking the police had no right to arrest him in the first place

317
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,999
That's why he's different his arm because he says he genuinely did not understand what was going on

318
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,327
Because of the amount of weed that I had

319
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
It was not arrested or charged

320
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,447
So I can never be resisting arrest for when blind

321
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
That's not impossible

322
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
Blend on me and believe me I have situations like this before

323
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
Where officers will take the weed

324
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Throw it in the grass

325
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Or throw it away

326
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Flush it down the toilet

327
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,879
Because there's no probable cause to arrest

328
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Sometimes officers write you a ticket

329
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,511
I'm not like I still couldn't be arrested no matter

330
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,863
No matter how mean are you sure that's true and Euclid though maybe that's true in Cleveland

331
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
That sure is a misdemeanor offense

332
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
And it's not a rustable

333
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Is that right so

334
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,079
Lawyer in the room

335
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
Explain jet lazy could that

336
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Aramis is incorrect

337
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,759
And Euclid Ohio any amount of weed can be charged as an M1

338
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
First degree misdemeanor

339
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
Possibility of $1,000 fine 6 months in jail

340
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
Just over the City Line back in Cleveland Ms would be correct

341
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
One blunt probably would be at

342
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
At most

343
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
But not here in Euclid

344
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
Ohio takes home rule very

345
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Seriously

346
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
Cuyahoga County has 59 different municipalities

347
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
Each one has its own set of ordinances

348
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
Most of them align their city codes with Ohio state law

349
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,919
Which treats less than 100 grams of marijuana as a minor misdemeanor

350
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,271
But two of them treat any amount of marijuana as an M1

351
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Broadview Heights

352
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
Little town down South

353
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
And Euclid

354
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,183
Euclid made its ordinance harsher in 1998

355
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
I'm not sure why

356
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
But it's worth noting that the city's black population was growing then

357
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,399
Curfew decades white people have been moving out and black people have been moving in

358
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
About 60% African

359
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,103
Euclid city government though city council six out of nine members are white mayor is white

360
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,479
Police chief is White City prosecutors White City law director is White City Judges White

361
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,551
And it's got the harshest weed law in the county

362
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Just saying

363
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
The best Paul can do for Hermes

364
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
It's really the only thing he can do

365
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,935
It's a try to make everyone involved in sending Hermes to the hospital pay

366
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,031
How to drive back to Cleveland Paul talks about what he would do next

367
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
He also anticipated with the city's lawyer would like

368
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
Which he can do with confidence

369
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
Because Paul used to be that lawyer

370
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Used to work the other side of these cases

371
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
Defending the government

372
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
The cops

373
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
He works for the city of Cleveland

374
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,975
Then he was a partner in a law firm that contracted with insurance companies to defend against civil rights claim

375
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
I was good at his job

376
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Any make good money

377
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Here to BMW

378
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
Convertible and hardtop

379
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
After while he couldn't stomach it

380
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
Cuz he felt like he was working for the wrong side

381
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
And start to affect

382
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
Is health so they switched over

383
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,871
So frequently mentioned that he drives a Hyundai now

384
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
And then I'll say

385
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
I'm fine with that

386
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
He's not totally fine with that

387
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
Aramis is case won't be huge money

388
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
Aramis wasn't permanently injured not physically

389
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,647
The poor things you can at least get him something

390
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Maybe in the tens of thousands

391
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,815
Is a complication they have to take care of first though before Paul can get a lawsuit going

392
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,143
Nothing not small matter of air masses criminal charges

393
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
The Euclid Police cited Aramis

394
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
4 crimes

395
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Drug abuse

396
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
Resisting arrest

397
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
Theft and criminal damaging

398
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
Paul said that list

399
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Pretty typical

400
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
So I'm hitting you with four charges

401
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
And so now let's negotiate down

402
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
So I'm going to load you up so this way I mean it over overcharges and the prosecutor little something else

403
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
A little bit more left

404
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
To still get you to plead to something

405
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
I was confused

406
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
House where Aramis and Paul

407
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
What does theft and criminal damaging or about

408
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
Until I read the police report

409
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
There's a page long narrative

410
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,103
Didn't the cops describe an event with roughly the same Contours as what Hermes told me

411
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
But very different detail

412
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
The officers didn't talk to me for this

413
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,783
Story and just to say neither of them has been disciplined for what happened that night

414
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,391
In the report they say that after They confiscated the marijuana

415
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Hermes try to take it out of one office

416
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
They say Aramis was fighting with

417
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Pushing them

418
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
But everyone was getting stung by the taser in the process

419
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,655
They say Hermes tried to take the taser away from them

420
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
That's the FAFSA parent

421
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
And if the tasers cartridge got pulled off

422
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
And the blast door broken off

423
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
The term has knocked one officers glasses off his face

424
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Breaking them

425
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
They never mention kicking Aramis

426
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
They do describe kneeing him in the crotch

427
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
Anclote close-fisted strikes

428
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
To his face and head

429
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,903
Aramis has got to get out from under these charges

430
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Strategically

431
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
Quietly

432
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
Right now I almost doesn't think he should have to plead any

433
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:23,679
But Paul thinks it might actually be better for the civil case if he does plead to something minor

434
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
And that's hilarious is looking at

435
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
He's like like I should walk out of this

436
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Literally

437
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
With no

438
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
Problem with that is

439
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Nephew just take this hard-line

440
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
Like I'm not going to plead the even up

441
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
Minor misdemeanor some one of them

442
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Play U2

443
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
I think that's going to

444
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Raise

445
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
The flags that that

446
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,791
He's up to something that that he's standing on principle he's looking to sue you for the injuries

447
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,399
Last thing Paul wanted the stage is for Euclid to know it is being sued

448
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,727
Because if they know they will dig in on the criminal charges

449
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Tell first step

450
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Delay

451
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,359
Hermes was supposed to have his initial court appearance

452
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Today actually

453
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,687
Are they got it postponed a couple weeks

454
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
Ticket is FaceTime to go back to normal

455
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
I don't want him walking into court looking like he just got his ass

456
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Why

457
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Again because

458
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
People asking a so what happened then

459
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
If you go in front of the judge

460
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Sure

461
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Yeah young man what happened to you

462
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,312
Prosecutor might notice you could police officers who happen to be in court that day they might notice

463
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
Start asking around

464
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,408
Paul wants Hermes to be unremarkable

465
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,224
Just there to take care of these charges and go on home

466
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
No big deal

467
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Second step

468
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Hire a beard

469
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:48,672
Paul himself has Delilah while the criminal case moves through the Municipal Court

470
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,232
He will not be shepherding Hermes through

471
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:56,608
Instead he's hired at Dependable local attorney who won't raise any eyebrows and Euclid

472
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,192
Alt farming it out in part because his specialty is not criminal defense

473
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,288
The more the point is the folks in Euclid C Paul's name on the docket

474
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
The Jig Is immediately up

475
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,920
They will know they're facing a civil lawsuit probably a big fat civil lawsuit

476
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,224
Because they will have heard of Paul already

477
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Or else they'll Google him and I'll see

478
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
Alright relocate

479
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,648
Also known as 137 shots case

480
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,792
Back in 2012 two people in a car man and woman both African-American both homeless

481
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
We're driving past the Justice Center downtown

482
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
Police said the couple's fired a gun out the window toward them

483
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:38,080
What subsequent investigation suggested the noise the officers heard might have been the car backfiring they never located a gun

484
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Spaghetti chase them

485
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,712
Which isn't that strange except for the debacle that ensued

486
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:48,832
The chase wolf through residential neighborhoods then onto the highway and back off the highway

487
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,904
20 miles and 62 police cars later

488
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
The chase ended in East Cleveland parking lot

489
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
We're police fired a total of 137 shots in the car killing both people inside

490
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,704
Officer alone Sergeant Michael brelo shot at them 49 times

491
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,544
Scrambled onto the hood of the car to shut down at them through the windshield

492
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,408
At close range was indicted for voluntary manslaughter

493
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
A judge found him not guilty

494
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,272
There's no proof brelo had actually killed them the judge

495
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
Explain an opinion

496
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,880
Possible they were already dead by the time he got onto the hood

497
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
The families of the two people who were killed

498
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Sued

499
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Paul represented one of them

500
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
And the city of Cleveland settled for $3000000

501
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Is Paul's biggest media case

502
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
Also his biggest payout

503
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Lately he's been struggling a little

504
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
He's not into the hustle

505
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,592
Doesn't show up at Memorial Gatherings looking solemn

506
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,200
Doesn't slip a weeping relative his card it doesn't know website or do social media

507
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
He's white which isn't always helpful and

508
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Possess

509
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,392
Aramis is case is an order of magnitude smaller than 137 shots case

510
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Or the Tamir rice case

511
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Don't finish out his name during a protest

512
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
Call Tommy the smaller cases

513
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
They matter

514
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
Because they ricochet

515
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Is Russia a lot of people go through incidents like this

516
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,984
He says the speeding will knock around inside Aramis head

517
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
And then it will rebound off of them

518
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
Out into the city

519
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
It's me.

520
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
Do you want to talk about how

521
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,456
You know we need to come together as a society

522
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
And

523
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,504
You know

524
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Black lives matter

525
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
All life matter

526
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Please have a hard job and

527
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Listen to what the

528
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
Please tell you to do and you got to obey the law don't be a criminal

529
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,584
I mean the realities is now you just traded somebody who I mean

530
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,376
He's busy this walking

531
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
Perpetuation

532
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Don't trust the police

533
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
He now knows

534
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Let that happen

535
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
And all he

536
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
He had on

537
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
What is a blunt

538
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
In his own apartment

539
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
In his own apartment

540
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Not late at night

541
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
No drugs

542
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,808
No alcohol no gun

543
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
No criminal activity

544
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
But the blind

545
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
And that's what happened to him

546
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
That this will mess with

547
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
Like if you stick with the store and we follow up

548
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
You'll see

549
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
I mean it'll it'll f*** with them

550
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,264
GS family he has friends they're all going to know what happened. Going to see the pictures

551
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:21,664
And so it becomes part of his life scrap this is this this this has become something that

552
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,320
You know is going to be told and retold and photos are going to be shared and Andre share

553
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,976
You know on and on and on and on and it just one guy in Euclid Ohio

554
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
A study published in 2016 found that

555
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,240
Reports of police brutality not only contribute to a quote Spirit of legal cynicism

556
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,568
They also cause people to not call the cops when they need them

557
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,616
They make entire cities less safe

558
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,760
The researchers looked at 911 calls before and after an Infamous case in Milwaukee

559
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,576
The 2004 beating of a guy named Frank Jude

560
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:07,232
They found it for a year afterwards there were twenty-two thousand fewer 9-1-1 calls in Milwaukee Residence Inn

561
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,816
Black neighborhoods especially or far less likely to report crime

562
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
And at the same time that people were reporting fewer crimes murders in Milwaukee Rose by 32%

563
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
The goal of Paul's lawsuit

564
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
Aside from getting Hermes some justice

565
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Dim sum dough

566
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
Is DeForest police to account for their behavior

567
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Answer for it

568
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
And I asked him

569
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
Setting his own livelihood aside

570
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,624
Is it possible that his involvement could actually be hampering progress

571
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,952
Seramis went to the police department in complaint

572
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
The supervisors

573
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,072
Or the use of force in the officer's report triggered an internal investigation

574
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,680
And say that process were allowed to play out without the Specter of a lawsuit

575
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,008
Isn't it possible that apartment would fix itself

576
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,544
That is no that's

577
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
I mean

578
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
I know you probably hate

579
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
People say it's a great question

580
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,200
I love when people say that

581
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
It is

582
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Because

583
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
I mean you know if I could even

584
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
We brought your question a little bit

585
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
I know what you're asking is

586
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,440
But the way you're handling is Paula kind of how you're at your ear

587
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,328
Triangulating orchestrating if you well you're denying the city of Euclid

588
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,376
And the police department the opportunity

589
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
To do this right on their own

590
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
And you're absolutely right

591
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
You're right I am doing that but that's because

592
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Distrust

593
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,688
If I were to kind of do what you're saying are we were to March down there and fill out a citizen

594
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,272
Complaint and talk to them about constitutional rights and excessive force

595
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm leaving it up to them now

596
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
Set to kind of say well you know what yeah this was awful we better do an intro investigate

597
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Guess we better do what's right

598
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
And

599
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
And that just hasn't been my experience

600
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,816
I thought just hasn't been my experience

601
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
I think when you do that

602
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
They don't own it be the lawyer up

603
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
It's never situation

604
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
We're like

605
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Did the city of the

606
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
The police are like wow

607
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
You know we really met

608
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Is that we need to do the right thing here

609
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
It's it's

610
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Always

611
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
And what are you talking about

612
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944

614

615
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
And

616
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
We got insurance

617
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
Like I just

618
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Iodide I just had

619
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
0

620
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
Based on my experience

621
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Did that would happen

622
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,448
This is what bothered Paul the most when he worked the defense side he said

623
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
The city's disdain for the plaintiffs

624
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
A person with following excessive force claim

625
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,152
Runaway Paul says everyone would attack the character of the complainer

626
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,224

What kind of loser

630
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
What kind of scumbag

631
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
But sue the police

These past few years

686
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,112
Is an era of law enforcement soul-searching

687
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Or supposed to be

688
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,768
All over the country police departments are meant to be considering deeply and anxiously

689
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
Whether they're using Force properly whether they are operating without bias whether they're listening to and hearing the sea

690
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Citizen State Police

691
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,592
In Albuquerque in New Orleans in Portland Oregon in Ferguson Missouri in Baltimore and in Cleveland

692
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,224
After the hundred thirty-seven shots case when were the couple was killed by police after the chase

693
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
First the Ohio attorney general investigated

694
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
Then the feds came in

695
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
Civil rights division of the Department of Justice

696
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,976
Less than 2 weeks after Tamir rice was killed they issued their report

697
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:04,864
The Cleveland Police Department was engaging in a pattern or practice of using unlawful excessive force

698
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
Among many other problems

699
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,984
The articles about the breadth and depth of the overall find eggs

700
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,776
Exhausted all the usual words

701
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Scathing

702
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Embarrassing

703
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Staggering jaw drop

704
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,480
The report was not all that different from the previous doj investigation of the Cleveland Police

705
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
A decade earlier

706
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
This time the city promise things would be different

707
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,672
In 2015 they entered into a consent decree with the federal government

708
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,512
A federal judge would oversee massive reforms in the CDP

709
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
Citizen complaints don't bring change

710
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,192
If internal investigations don't bring change if criminal charges against cops don't break

711
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
If Pakistan has lawsuits don't bring change

712
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,824
Perhaps of federally mandated consent decree

713
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
A decree

714
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,640
Just one click from a Fiat

715
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
Would persuade police the change is nigh

716
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
Perhaps not

717
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Political nonsense

718
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
This is detective Steve Loomis

719
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,952
Until recently he was the president of the Cleveland Police patrolmen's Association the police Union here

720
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,560
Clevelanders have a certain political persuasion including some cops I'm sure

721
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,608
Just left their foreheads and groan

722
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
Please no not Steve

723
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
Because they know

724
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
Bald-headed me be fisted Steve Loomis

725
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,592
The guy who dress convincingly in a Santa hat at the Department's Christmas party

726
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,920
And as the dirty biker hillbilly dude when he worked Undercover

727
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
Will say whatever the hell he wants

728
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
Steve dettelbach kiss my ass

729
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,088
What's his b*******

730
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
Steve dettelbach was us attorney for the Northern District of Ohio his signature is at the bottom of the doj report

731
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,888
Airport which devoted several pages to the substandard way in which the Cleveland Police Department dealt with citizen

732
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Complaints

733
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
We really don't

734
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
Care about civilian

735
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,080
It's not that we don't not that we don't care that we get that we don't

736
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
My laughter here is born of shock

737
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
Not Mirth

738
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,992
I'm not going to say I like Steve Loomis I can't get there

739
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,064
Some of the positions he inhabits our too awful

740
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,672
President Obama has blood on his hands for the police officers killed in Dallas

741
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,744
Racist and anti-muslim tweets by a CDP sergeant

742
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
Are the First Amendment right of every American

743
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Etcetera

744
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
I appreciate Steve Loomis

745
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
I appreciate that he's got a sense of humor about himself

746
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
I appreciate that he appears to be a True Believer

747
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:25,408
That he is sincere when he says even the lowliest rookie patrolman does more to help this community than any other person in government

748
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,504
I appreciate that Steve Loomis give us six hours of his time

749
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
In one day

750
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
6 hours

751
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
Sat there in his Union office pact with Trump paraphernalia

752
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
Also one or two cartoons that I called racist

753
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
He called political

754
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Explaining his world to us

755
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
Arguing with us congeniality

756
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,936
Decide to clevelanders he'll complain that the media only quote Steve

757
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
Because he's colorful and available

758
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,288
Jose Steve doesn't represent us

759
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,688
What's true no other Cleveland officers were permitted to talk to us on the record and I know from off-the-record conversations that

760
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
Not all of them think like Steve

761
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
But that aside Steve is the man whom the rank-and-file elected as their leader and spokesman he does

762
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
Or did officially represent the police

763
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
So here we are

764
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
I know where activist

765
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
Stand on the question of reform

766
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
I know where a lot of non-active

767
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
The stand on the question of police reform

768
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
But I wanted to know is reform even possible

769
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Are the police willing

770
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,848
As Union President Steve Loomis set on the Cleveland Community police commission

771
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
CPC

772
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,456
A group mandated into existence as part of the consent decree

773
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:37,856
It supposed to make recommendations on new policies for community policing bias-free policing use-of-force

774
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Inner participate

775
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
With a full heart

776
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Absolute the full heart

777
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,608
The problem that we have on the timer

778
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Like literally had not shown

779
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,704
Yeah you want to believe though

780
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,056
The rhetoric out there

781
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,872
In fact there's been a steady drip of articles in the local

782
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,176
Cool press about Steve spotty attendance at meetings

783
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
And the many calls for his resignation

784
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,320
In what article he explained that he'd appointed himself as a commissioner

785
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:12,416
Because he didn't want to subject any of his patrolman to quote that farce of a commission

786
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,000
Still he insisted he is not an to reform

787
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,048
We can always improve on what we do here

788
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
He told me and I'm happy to take that challenge on

789
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
But when I asked him about possible reforms in Cleveland

790
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,008
Reforms that are being discussed and implemented all over the country

791
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,312
Vigorously whacked each one aside

792
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,128
Slowing down police interactions with suspects

793
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,408
And hopes of avoiding the need for

794
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Perforce

795
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
Everybody wants to talk about

796
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,296
The escalation it's just really sexy word for talking

797
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:43,392
You know it is good that's what guess what

798
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
That's what we've done since the beginning of time

799
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Bias

800
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,584
Steve would like to see one study linking implicit bias to police actions and reactions

801
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Racial profiling

802
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
I'm not going to sit here and say that that doesn't

803
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
Happened somewhere else

804
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
And a world I am going to sit here and say

805
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
In the city of Cleveland

806
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
There's no way that it

807
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,408
It's not supported in fact

808
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Right

809
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,248
Are you supports policy

810
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Is coming out

811
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
Nothing is going to be atrocious

812
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,440
More restrictions on how and when police can use a gun is going to endanger his officers

813
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
Cuz they'll think twice

814
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
Don't be afraid of getting in trouble for doing it wrong

815
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
And then it'll be too late

816
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
The common complaint among police

817
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Tasering people

818
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
You know why you can't teaser juvenile

819
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Okay

820
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Yellow

821
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,872
Tamir rice nobody wants to talk about it but to be racist 5-foot 791

822
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
All right

823
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
Annie's 12 years old

824
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
Does Steve the Tamir rice case is the perfect example of how people misunderstand and willfully distort what the police

825
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,904
Still other fixes make no sense

826
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:55,072
To me the way Steve talked about the Tamir rice case was a perfect example of why so many people in Cleveland believe the police has

827
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
0 capacity for self-reflection

828
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,656
Much less self-correction

829
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,008
The officer who shot Tamir was new Young still on probation

830
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:08,896
I pointed out that Steve himself as an experienced officer had avoided shootings by lowering his weapon

831
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
You just giving me a couple examples

832
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,808
So why is he saying in the Tamir rice situation any officer would have done the same thing

833
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
You wouldn't have done

834
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,928
And you're telling me right now you would I absolutely would have done the same

835
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,488
Would not have done the same

836
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
You're telling me you wouldn't

837
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
You want to get into rice we're going to get in the train tracks

838
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
So it began

839
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Steve reiterated as he has many times

840
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
The number one camera was a big kid

841
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
As if that made him blameworthy

842
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
A child in a man's body

843
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Bottom line

844
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
There's no denying that

845
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Nobody can dispute

846
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,040
Number to Tamir rice noodle exactly why those

847
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Policeman

848
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,368
We're driving that marked police car towards him

849
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Right

850
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
He is a product of the street

851
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,000
He is not a product of

852
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Loving

853
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Home

854
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Hang on

855
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,752
I did hang on and it got worse

856
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,544
The salvaging of Samaria rice

857
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,848
But I'm not going to dignify by repeating here

858
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,664
Steve has said unkind things about the rice family

859
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
In the past

860
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:19,808
He also helpfully suggested they should use the money they got from a lawsuit to educate kids about the dangers of

861
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Guns

862
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
He wasn't worried about his tone or its implications then

863
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
He's not worried now

864
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
He believes the factor with him

865
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:31,584
We disagreed about whether the police drove up to close to Tamir whether they drove up

866
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,216
Too fast with her Tamir pulled the gun from his waistband with of the shooting of Tamir rice was a mistake at all

867
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
Okay we can disagree till the cows come home

868
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,080
Poem about what should have happened or why it

869
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,408
And my guess is we probably would

870
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Supported in fact

871
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,528
That's fine but I think we can all agree it was a

872
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
Horrible

873
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,088
Horrible outcome right

874
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
They want I know you have I know you have

875
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
So what I'm

876
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
Wondering is

877
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Do you see any fixes

878
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Is there a thing where you're like

879
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,864
Sure isn't change that I think could have avoided

880
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
That's that isn't only on Tamir

881
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
They haven't they haven't

882
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
It's absolutely artem

883
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,336
It's on any suspect get shot by the police

884
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
Actions by suspects

885
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Cause reactions by police office

886
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
Justified react

887
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,832
Did police take away any lessons then from the Tamir rice case

888
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
Sure he said we always learn a lot

889
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
So what is it

890
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
I don't know

891
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,584
It was in fact the only time I stumped him in our 6 hours together

892
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
I asked him several times

893
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,448
And he could not come up with one thing that wasn't two mirrors fault

894
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
It sounds like you're saying there's nothing that needs

895
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
2 Chainz

896
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
That's what needs to change

897
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:50,432
That's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that those changes need to be based in reality

898
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
But what should the changes be

899
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
Not La La Land

900
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
Why do we fix a tan

901
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
Focus

902
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
On

903
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
Tamir rice

904
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,952
That's the beer question to me

905
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,024
Is we want to change our entire profession

906
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
Based on

907
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
A couple different

908
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,912
When you're saying why are we fixating on these desk

909
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,728
Because people are like enough is enough is enough is enough

910
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
They're saying it's one one is two

911
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,360
Too many one accident like this is too many let's fix

912
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
Can you race was not an accident

913
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,736
Tamir rice was pulling a gun out of his waist

914
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,832
All right we're saying you shouldn't have died for it

915
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,880
He shouldn't have died

916
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
I this is what I'm saying I think this is what we're all asked

917
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,280
But what's frustrating is

918
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
We don't go

919
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,656
When somebody calls us and tells us that somebody should have rec center with a gun

920
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
We don't go

921
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
That's the only way to fix it

922
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Right

923
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,384
Black panther hat

924
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,967
I think Steve might actually believe what he's saying here

925
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,295
The police are never to blame for harming someone in the line of duty

926
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,903
If you end up dead or hurt it's always because of something you did or didn't do

927
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,975
It follows then that the only ones who need to reform

928
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,999
Are the citizens

929
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
The name of Cleveland's 1500 patrolman

930
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
Steve Loomis is folding his arms

931
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,679
Inside his petulance is also a threat

932
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,983
Not like how we do business fine

933
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
. arresting people

934
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
See how you like your sitting at

935
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,687
It's the same stance some police officers have taken in Chicago and Minneapolis

936
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,735
New York and Baltimore

937
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Cop out

938
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:45,119
Speed limit says Cleveland's problem isn't rotten police or poorly trained police or faulty policies

939
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,679
Problem he says is understaffing

940
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:54,079
He's not wrong even people who can't abide Steve Loomis agree that Cleveland Police Department is overburdened and under

941
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,871
Plaid and poorly paid

942
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,711
This of course is the limit of law enforcement everywhere

943
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Civilians

944
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
We need your tax dollars

945
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,063
But we don't need

946
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Is there oversight

947
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
A Cota here

948
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
A few weeks after we spoke

949
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,863
Steve Loomis was replaced as Union president have been voted out of office

950
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,447
And I'm not saying these things are necessarily connected but

951
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:25,311
8 months later the team in charge of overseeing police reforms in Cleveland release some stats

952
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,639
Showing the during the first five months of 2018

953
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,735
Police use-of-force in Cleveland has decreased by nearly 40%

954
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
Compared to the year before

955
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:38,623
It was too soon to claim victory the report said that it was encouraging

956
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Aramis Spencer

957
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
Okay

958
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
We are here on this

959
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
Motion to suppress

960
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
5 months after he been arrested

961
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
Aramis went to court for hearing

962
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,983
By now the city of Euclid knew a civil lawsuit was probably coming

963
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:59,103
Which is why after all this time before criminal charges were still hungered in his case File

964
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,919
It's all predicted the city was unrelenting

965
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
The prosecutor was not going to drop them

966
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,271
Definitely not the resisting arrest

967
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
That's the linchpin charge

968
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
The resisting

969
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,903
The one that could really mess up air masses civil case

970
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,279
Because of Aramis gets convicted of resisting that could justify the officer's use-of-force

971
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,631
Not necessarily the excessiveness of the beating it doesn't give him carte blanche

972
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:25,727
But it does allow the officers to do what they have to do to subdue a suspect

973
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,847
Tavares has to eat that resisting charge it could shrivel his civil claim

974
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,151
That's why the city won't budge on the resist

975
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
And wireless won't budge either

976
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,783
Instead today Aramis is here on a motion sensor

977
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Suppress

978
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:45,439
He's trying to get all the charges dropped by claiming that the police had no Reasonable Suspicion to stop him in that hallway

979
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,279
And then after they made the faulty stop they had no probable cause to search him

980
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,839
What you make the actual blunt they found on him

981
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,631
The fruit of a poisonous tree

982
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
That's the legal metaphor

983
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
So no legal stop no legal arrest

984
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
No case

985
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,103
When I walk into the courtroom Mary case of the city prosecutor said to me

986
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,151
You do know this is just a hearing right

987
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
I do I said

988
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,991
Then she and the other lawyers left the room

989
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
For a while

990
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,063
I sat waiting in the empty jewelry box

991
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,135
Hermes the two cops are masses mother all set on the benches

992
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
No one said anything

993
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
I wrote in my notes

994
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
It's like a tomb in

995
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,839
I heard a ruckus to the wall behind me where the prosecutor's office is

996
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
People were shouting

997
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,447
After while the lawyers filed back into the courtroom

998
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Looking peeved

999
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,287
Mary case in a couple other lawyers sat on one side

1000
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,591
How the other Aramis and his defense attorney

1001
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
The local guy Paul had enlisted

1002
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Spiros gonakis

1003
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
Judge Deborah lebarron announced

1004
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
And

1005
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,367
As I advised all the parties I have syroco made from the cereal

1006
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:50,207
Podcast who is asking to record these

1007
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,767
Proceedings with casein

1008
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
Thank you.

1009
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,607
You're at this time the city would request

1010
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
A continuance of this hearing

1011
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
We have some concerns with respect to this

1012
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,519
During being recorded for a public podcast

1013
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,823
It seemed I had been the cause of the Ruckus

1014
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,663
We have an interest in protecting the city of Euclid

1015
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,551
Any flicker of an ocean I had that the city's intentions were forthright

1016
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
Withered now

1017
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,903
Before I figured Wilshire there triangulating

1018
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Just like Paul

1019
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,023
It also assumed that they were at least Prosecuting Aramis in good faith

1020
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,559
Because they believe the cops

1021
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
Believe he committed these crimes

1022
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
And deserve punishment

1023
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:36,031
But you don't try to kick a reporter out of a public proceeding unless there's something unsavory about what's about to happen

1024
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,359
Judge LeBaron deny the prosecutor's request

1025
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
For continuance

1026
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
It again

1027
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:46,527
Hearing would not touch on anything that came after the search so nothing about the resisting or the beating

1028
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,855
This was only about the validity of the stop in the search

1029
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:56,255
Mary Kay Satin Spiros gonakis took both cops through it Moment by moment that's where the law tends to snap into place

1030
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
An instant

1031
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
First up with officer Shane Rivera

1032
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,911
He explained that he and his partner officer Michael amiott

1033
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,519
I've been working an off-duty detail that day at the Richmond Hills Apartment Complex

1034
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Grammys live

1035
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,151
He said they've been working this particular detail for two years there been problems in the building

1036
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,943
Drug trafficking break-ins

1037
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,527
Beginner usual soup of the building starting at the 5th floor

1038
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
The top floor

1039
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
Working their way down

1040
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:25,695
The Saltair Missy said as they came down the stairs to the 4th floor who's knocking on a door

1041
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,743
And when he was

1042
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,047
Knocking on the door

1043
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
Call if anyone answered the door

1044
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
No one answered the door

1045
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:37,471
At any point did the individual take keys out open the door to the apart

1046
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,799
Usain Aramis looked suspicious right then

1047
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
Reasonably so

1048
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,639
Why would you keep knocking on a door if no one's answering

1049
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
This is what burglars do in the building

1050
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,503
Knock and then when no one answers they kick in the door

1051
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,855
Felt as I approached I asked him if he lived in the complex he said he did

1052
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
And I asked if you knew

1053
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,207
Who I'll look at that particular requirement

1054
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
And he said he did not

1055
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
And

1056
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,839
Aramis was squirming at the defense table

1057
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
Shaking his head

1058
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
Stifled

1059
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,215
He told me he was knocking at his friend's apartment door

1060
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Because you wanted a cigarette

1061
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,335
His friend wasn't home but his friend's wife was there asleep

1062
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,151
Emma said she eventually woke up and did open the door

1063
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,991
He said she saw him being beat up and that the police told her to go back inside

1064
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
And she did

1065
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,831
But Hermes can't say anything about that now

1066
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
She's not taking the stand

1067
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,975
The Lord didn't want the prosecutor to get a crack at cross-examining Hermes prior to trial

1068
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,767
So he's got to suck it up

1069
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,351
Every defendant I spoke to while I was in Cleveland eventually asked

1070
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
What do I get to say my thing

1071
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
When do I get to explain to the judge what happened

1072
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
The answer

1073
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
Often

1074
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Is never

1075
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,591
Very anxious and nervous and

1076
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,407
Japanese hands in his pockets as soon as you saw it

1077
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,247
He was advised a couple of times to take his hands out of his pockets

1078
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
Did he take his hands out of his pocket

1079
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,671
Yes but it kept putting back in and say run

1080
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
Three four times

1081
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,535
And I'm how did you react to him putting his hands back in the socket

1082
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,911
Nervously I mean makes police officer nervous

1083
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,007
Because typically when people keep reaching into their pockets it's a

1084
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,615
Indicator that the Apache band or a possibly weapon on their person

1085
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,407
Soon it was faris's

1086
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,247
Oscar Rivera wedding Spiros gonakis I represent Hermes

1087
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,575
I'm going to ask you a few questions on cross-examination

1088
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
The right

1089
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,487
Put my hands in my pockets while I asked questions I don't want to make you nervous

1090
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,559
I don't have any contraband.

1091
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,215
Heroes is a spirited attorney and energetic performer

1092
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,311
Spiros tried to show that Hermes wasn't a menacing figure in that hallway

1093
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Is this the guy

1094
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
Knocking on the door

1095
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,991
Knocking as opposed to

1096
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
He wasn't doing that

1097
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
Knocking on the door

1098
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
Knocking on the door

1099
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
He wasn't screaming

1100
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,207
Let me in

1101
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
What are you doing

1102
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
What's going on

1103
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Okay

1104
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,095
Next up officer Michael amiott

1105
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,167
He seemed more comfortable on the standing officer Rivera

1106
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
Eden so nervous

1107
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
It wasn't defensive

1108
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,799
Propose mr. Spencer he was still at the door I walked past

1109
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,871
And as I approached him I could smell the odor marijuana

1110
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,895
They got stronger

1111
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
Westerly coming from him

1112
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
And I stop

1113
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,039
This is key to making the Stop Kosher

1114
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,855
The smell of raw marijuana emanating from Aramis

1115
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
6%

1116
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,671
It's what allows them to detain Aramis

1117
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,231
The prosecutor is cemented in the record

1118
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,327
It's in your experience as a police officer can you smell raw marijuana

1119
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
In a bag inside someone

1120
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,959
And has marijuana smell the same regardless of what

1121
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,007
Amount

1122
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,055
Sometimes it stronger than others

1123
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
Know what I smell right now

1124
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,151
Reasonable suspicion

1125
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:02,783
The officer amiott did not smell an unlit blunt wrapped in a baggie and Aramis his jeans pocket

1126
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
It's not impossible you smelled it

1127
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:10,207
But the level of confidence he's exhibiting here that he can smell any amount of marijuana in a person's pocket

1128
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,791
In the hallway of a building where I am certain marijuana is not scarce

1129
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,631
No one in the courtroom seems to register any skepticism about that

1130
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
Apart from Spiros

1131
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,007
You guys are basically

1132
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
That's unnecessary

1133
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,711
I'll take that back

1134
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,367
Officer amiott says after he smelled the marijuana he asked Aramis if he had any drugs on him

1135
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,719
Saving equals hands up like this I said you have any drugs on you put his hands up like this

1136
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
Okay and

1137
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
What do you do if your placenta

1138
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
And did you find anything

1139
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,215
Yeah I went into his pocket on epoxy was reaching into

1140
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:57,823
It was a small bag of marijuana was probably a side wasn't very big wrapping a baggie

1141
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,871
Each efficient beat of this hearing

1142
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,943
The cops are chipping away at Hermes his chances for success

1143
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,479
Criminal and civil

1144
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,527
Aramis is a scary door knocker

1145
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,087
He smells like marijuana he seems nervous

1146
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,135
He keeps putting his hands in his pockets

1147
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
He lets me search him for drugs

1148
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,463
Is all very neat

1149
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,535
And all very different from what Hermes says actually happened

1150
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,583
Then comes one more

1151
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
A to Z right at the end

1152
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,191
Mary Casey squeezes it in during her closing

1153
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,263
The testimony wasn't he patted the outside of the pocket first

1154
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Faded pat-down

1155
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
He felt a ball

1156
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
Objection

1157
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
Services like whoa whoa whoa a bulge

1158
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,503
Where does Bones come from

1159
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,551
The Bulge could suggest a weapon

1160
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,367
Which could give officer amiott reason to go into Hermes

1161
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
The pockets we can make

1162
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,463
Research legal which can make the charges stick which could hurt the civil law

1163
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
Siri says wait up

1164
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,327
Mei himself never said anything about a bulge

1165
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
Event that did not happen

1166
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
He said

1167
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
And there was a ball

1168
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,543
The judge says I heard it

1169
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
I wrote it down right here

1170
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Just telling you

1171
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,383
That's in my notes

1172
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,711
So no further argument

1173
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,039
It was over Mary Casey looks very pleased at the end

1174
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,343
Chatting animatedly with the other lawyers at

1175
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Her table

1176
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
Chino's

1177
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
Everyone in the courtroom knows

1178
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
And who you going to believe contest

1179
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,023
The judge tends to presume the cops are telling the truth

1180
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
So her side virtually always wins

1181
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
Spiros knows it too

1182
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,191
Expected the police to say most of what they said today

1183
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,751
But the Bulge thing that was a new one

1184
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,055
Out in the hallways grosses still arguing

1185
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,103
You can't just invent testimony

1186
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,247
Play pattern

1187
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
Did you hear anything about

1188
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,391
Where did not say that he felt a ball

1189
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Stress is right

1190
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
I have the tape

1191
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,999
Despite what the judge thought she heard

1192
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
Officer amiott did not mention a bulge

1193
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,095
Balls or no balls

1194
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,143
Girls tries to boost Aramis spirits

1195
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,591
This bulge is going to be an issue

1196
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,919
Five network will form

1197
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
He just can't even if he can stop you

1198
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Marijuana

1199
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
Does it mean he can go inside of your pocket

1200
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
Reasonable Suspicion means he can

1201
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:25,279
Keep you there and figure out what's what's going on right he can catch you down for officer safety

1202
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:30,911
But that would have been had a much through conversation on direct examination as to I patted him down

1203
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703
Over the top I felt a ball

1204
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,983
We thought it was a weapon

1205
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
The Battle of the Bulge

1206
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,383
Let me know about that

1207
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Just lying down

1208
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,735
Aramis is Mom Kali the only one who laughed at my joke

1209
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,063
Aramis himself is brimming with frustration

1210
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,855
It's been 5 months

1211
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,927
He's having the fight criminal charges he considers illegitimate

1212
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
Because of what happened in the hallway of the building management stuck a 3-day notice on his apartment door telling him he had to move out or else

1213
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,351
Hbase eviction

1214
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
He said they told him the incident was a violation of the buildings rules

1215
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
I got an extension still

1216
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
He said his girlfriend was harassed

1217
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,359
In front of the building he thinks it was the same officers who stopped her

1218
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,431
He said she told him she stayed with Aramis upstairs

1219
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
The restaurant Warren

1220
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:22,623
And today he's just listen to police officers tell a version of the original incident which Bears little resemblance to his own

1221
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,951
He said they asked him to stop from down the hall

1222
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,023
Before they even got near him they said stop don't move

1223
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,351
He says he never told him he didn't know whose door he was knocking on

1224
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,423
Anyway why would he be knocking on a door of a person he doesn't know

1225
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,519
They never ask me that question who is Dory this is the never ask me that

1226
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,919
Dachshund they stopped me and asked me search me for weapons they never ask me anything about any drugs anything's

1227
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
Weather today

1228
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,247
That's completely false

1229
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,039
They lied under oath

1230
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,367
I'm sitting here watching them off

1231
00:55:54,623 --> 00:56:00,767
They lie

1232
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,215
Judge LeBaron deny dermis is motion to

1233
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
Suppress

1234
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,287
Which means that resisting charge is sticking

1235
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
Not good

1236
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,895
Yeah it's always something like that the police always have

1237
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
Scratch with a Prosecco

1238
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
Paul cristallo hadn't gone to the suppression hearing

1239
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,063
He was still trying to remain invisible and you could

1240
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,135
But Spirit-filled him in and he read the judge's opinion

1241
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Which amounted to

1242
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
The stop

1243
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,719
Search all legal

1244
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,255
Xi'an get to the balls

1245
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,351
She wrote the based on the suspicious door-knocking in the smell of marijuana

1246
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
For good

1247
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,655
If it's not

1248
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,727
Smelling marijuana for the smell of alcohol

1249
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,263
It's

1250
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,591
He made a furtive movement

1251
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
With his hands

1252
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,687
He kept moving his hands

1253
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,759
And I wasn't sure you know that's that's

1254
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
Find a baby he's got a weapon

1255
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,367
He was acting nervous and I think in fact they even

1256
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,927
Testified that he was acting

1257
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,719
I mean it's just

1258
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,607
But that's your script

1259
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
Everybody says for the flu

1260
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,167
Everybody smells

1261
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,239
Another phrase you hear a lot in these cases

1262
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,031
Reaching toward his waistband

1263
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,311
That's where Guns live

1264
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
Waistbands

1265
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
In a written report that you could officers wrote that Aramis was quote fighting with officers and pulling both arms together toward his waist

1266
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Panaderia

1267
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:32,415
And a little lower down more strikes were delivered until Spencer stop fighting and stopped reaching toward his waistband

1268
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
Aramis had no weapon

1269
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
I know nothing tucked in his waistband

1270
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,351
Why then in the midst of a fight would he be reaching toward his waistband

1271
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,911
Because waistband is a magic word

1272
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Furtive

1273
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
Like odor of raw marijuana

1274
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,543
A plant's a strong seed of reasonable suspicion

1275
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,103
The blossoms into a tree of probable cause

1276
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,151
Which can produce untainted fruit

1277
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,991
Justified use of force in response to resisting illegitimate arrest

1278
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
I asked Paul

1279
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,367
Back when he was working for insurance companies defending cops

1280
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,183
Whether he done the same thing Euclid was doing now

1281
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,487
When they could see a civil lawsuit in the distance

1282
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,839
Would he meet with City officials are cops about doubling down on the criminal charges

1283
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
To try to stop the civil case from getting traction

1284
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,759
City Hall

1285
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
Office

1286
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,135
Flying together

1287
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
When you're trying this kind of reluctantly is this

1288
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,999
Is this why

1289
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,143
Violet custom button that's that's like I shouldn't be like why are you

1290
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
Because

1291
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
I mean

1292
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:59,199
Letting you know I'm doing my job you know what I was doing and I was doing my job

1293
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,479
Antilla

1294
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
And I don't regret doing my job and you know it

1295
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
I think it's part of

1296
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,487
Letting the police

1297
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
Dynamic is

1298
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,495
How much of an airtight defense is the best offense if you

1299
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
And I said hesitantly a reluctant

1300
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
Only because

1301
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,615
NIU.

1302
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,063
But you know I mean I'm not proud of that

1303
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
OIC

1304
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:42,463
Yeah yeah yeah no I didn't I didn't I didn't ask it as a way to be like aren't you I didn't mean to

1305
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,279
I was going to know you.

1306
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:48,607
I always were asking practically it was like are you talking from Once

1307
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
Do you know

1308
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Or you just

1309
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
Like I suspect

1310
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:57,055
What's going on are you like no I know this is what's going on because I

1311
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,759
Is it isn't surprising what's with problem

1312
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,783
Surprising is

1313
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,063
How

1314
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
It remains

1315
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,111
It cast

1316
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Source

1317
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,695
Of aggravation

1318
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,423
It's still hard to watch it is only to see this happening

1319
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,215
Courtroom people

1320
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:31,359
Making payments on the stand that aren't necessarily accurate they know it

1321
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:38,015
But they have it of course

1322
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,087
It's upsetting to see if a police officer lies

1323
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:47,487
What's more upsetting is when a system of laws and procedures kicks in to support and sanitize those lies

1324
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,559
So that it looks and sounds as if Justice is happening

1325
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:56,959
But even wager that the officers in the prosecutor and the judge they all swear with conscience is clear

1326
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,287
The Aramis is hearing was fair by the book

1327
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:07,455
If Aramis wants these police officers to be held accountable for beating him he's now gotten the message the criminal court is

1328
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,015
Probably the last place you should look for help

1329
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,951
A few months later I got a call from Paul on my cell phone

1330
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Oh my God

1331
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
I know

1332
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,607
I was driving in a car heading to the airport in South Carolina

1333
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,887
The connection was terrible

1334
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,423
Who's this is so cute

1335
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,775
Literally is like

1336
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,615
This is that Miracle because they were going to come off the resisting

1337
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,175
A video that appeared on the internet

1338
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,759
Oh wow

1339
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,599
A white police officer pummeling a black guy in the street

1340
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,183
After traffic stop

1341
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:54,303
A woman watching from inside a building across the street had recorded in on her phone

1342
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,839
Her child was next to her

1343
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:00,959
You doing okay Mommy

1344
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,847
What's the biggest doing

1345
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
The officer beating the motorist

1346
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,223
Michael amiott

1347
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
The you could weed smell her

1348
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,087
The video bounce all over the internet

1349
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,879
Made its way into national news

1350
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,183
What happens to a case then

1351
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,487
When everyone's paying attention

1352
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
