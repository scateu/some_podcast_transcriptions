00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,720
Previously on serial

12
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
Taking my hand out

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Good grief

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
If anyone was standing outside

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
Who had shooting

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
We did this

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
A little wonder how long

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,080
Going on in Pakistan and Afghanistan

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,920
Talon bow to come home person bike

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:55,808
You're the officer is on your face how do they get their pasta too. I thought it was kind of like

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
Call that guy

22
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,488
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

23
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
One story told week by week

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
I'm Sarah Koenig

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,704
The way Botox to Mark about his time as a prisoner

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
It's almost as if it's divided

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
Their ZR1

28
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,080
When he's Gathering Intel planning a escapes

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
Focused on getting away

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
And then the rest of it

31
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
And the rest of it

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
Four more years

33
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
What his purpose is less Sharp

34
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
Hope is blurrier

35
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
There's less action

36
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Now he's got to endure

37
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
And that's in large part because after you're one

38
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
AfterBuzz 9 day Escape

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
The Taliban put him in a cage

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
And

41
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
There is no way I'm getting out of that cage

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
This is a metal cage or wood cage or what

43
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
Can iron bar cage

44
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
Made for what purpose

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
For keeping me

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,016
Beau says it was six parts

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,856
Four sides with the top in the bottom made of quarter inch bars

48
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Does collapsible

49
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,488
When they moved into new location they rebuild the cage and whatever room they put them in

50
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Both in padlock it together

51
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,144
BOCES if he stretched out his arms he could touch opposite sides of the cage with his fingers

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
Figured it was about 6 feet wide

53
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
Explain stuff like this

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
I can picture it

55
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
I can understand what he's describing

56
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
But at some point I realized

57
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,712
I don't actually understand what is going on

58
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:34,368
Looks like the whole thing with overlay with a scram where exactly is he who exactly is holding him

59
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,464
I couldn't tell what the Taliban in the colonies wanted or expected

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Why is he being moved

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Why is he being ignored

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,888
I didn't tell his treatment was senseless and haphazard or if it was part of a plan

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
Most descriptions are vivid that's not the problem

64
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
The problem is they're mainly from inside a room

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
Oh couldn't see what was happening outside

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,944
So I could make order of it because Bo himself couldn't make order

67
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,880
There's another guy who has a very good idea of bows place in haqqani World Order

68
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
His name is David Road

69
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,560
Davidson investigative reporter for Reuters now but back in 2008 he was on leave from the New York Times

70
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Researching a book about Afghanistan

71
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,728
Arrange to interview a Taliban Commander about an hour's Drive south of Kabul

72
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,408
And headed over to the same people and pretty much the same place at close to the same time as bow

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,528
Once I heard David story so much of bows story clicked into place for me

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
ProLogistix locations

75
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,768
Many aspects of David's experience are really different from Bose

76
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
David the civilian first officer journalist

77
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
Two already knew a lot about Afghanistan and Pakistan

78
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,240
He got free after about seven months versus nearly five years

79
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
And a huge difference

80
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
David wasn't alone

81
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
He was taken with two Afghan

82
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,408
Asada driver anti-hero translator

83
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
So he had someone to interpret whatever he didn't understand

84
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,856
Also David wasn't blindfolded all the time really only when he was being moved to a different location

85
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
He wasn't chained or tied up

86
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Inside the compound he could walk around in the courtyard

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
He could have conversations with his guards

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
And I'm not bringing all that up to suggest some sort of grim hostage contest

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
Only to point out that while David was imprisoned

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,519
She wasn't in the dark he wasn't in solitary confinement like Bo

91
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
So he had an awareness bow didn't have

92
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
About the system he had entered into

93
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,271
After they were carjacked to David and Assad anti-hair were taken around Afghanistan for a few days

94
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
And then they were told to get out of the car and start walking

95
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Over the mountain

96
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
The next morning is clear to David where he is

97
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
For one thing the car that Picks Them Up is driving on the left hand side of the road

98
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Like they do in package

99
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,423
And soon after that I saw a road sign in Urdu the national language

100
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Pakistan and I

101
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
New weed walk

102
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
Into the tribal areas over the mountains

103
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
And I knew we were

104
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Doomed

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
And that's

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,455
The worst place you can be taken in the Afghanistan

107
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Pakistan region

108
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,831
David knew how utterly dangerous the tribal areas in Western Pakistan were

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
This place it's really just over the mountain

110
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
It's right near the border

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
And if you're imagining a wild

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Desolate inaccessible Terrain

113
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
It's not like that

114
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,399
David said compare to rural Afghanistan in Fat City like miramshah

115
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,471
The capital of north waziristan where the haqqanis are based

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
The time in or near miramshah

117
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
There are more paved roads more large buildings more schools

118
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
There is

119
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
You know a market

120
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
With people selling

121
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
Goods from Pakistan proper I mean my

122
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Kidnappers you know brought me

123
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Bottled

124
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Nestle water that was manufactured

125
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
From a plant in a Inn in Lahore Pakistan one of the main

126
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
Cities you know but they were able to buy it in the market

127
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
In The Travelers I bought me

128
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Copies of

129
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,335
This the most well-known English language newspaper in Pakistan Dawn

130
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
Another one's called the news

131
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,711
And they would be 2 or 3 days old but they could buy all these things

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
I'm in the market

133
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
In the middle of the tribal areas

134
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
There's kids

135
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Stairs

136
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Farmers

137
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
You know what donkeys in there

138
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Bring in

139
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Their crops

140
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
The cell

141
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
There's tons of

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
Toyota station wagon

143
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
People driving their own also service taxes and you know became clear in those first few hours and then days and weeks that this was a

144
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Taliban mini state that

145
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Auction

146
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Open legged

147
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,639
Hino repaired roads and ran schools and

148
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
Had some sort of basic

149
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
Form of healthcare it wasn't

150
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,343
Is completely backward an area as a as you know is usually described

151
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,463
And it's not like the Taliban are sort of skulking around dodging any Pakistani military press

152
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
David says they're fully aware of each other may be wary at times but also like waiting to each other

153
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
As I drove around the tribal areas was there a Stan North and South David said there be regular checkpoint

154
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,871
Solana road that would normally be mad by a Pakistani security or Army

155
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,759
And instead there be young Taliban fighters with kalashnikovs letting traffic through not letting traffic through

156
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
Driver of David's car had to have the right password to get by

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,231
One one time I was being driven in a car and we ran into a pack of signing Army resupply Convoy

158
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,327
And I thought this is this great opportunity maybe you know the Convoy will

159
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,655
Let us all get out of the car and we can make a run for it

160
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
And instead you know

161
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,359
Ark are the Taliban car just pulled over to the side of the road I remember in front of us with a car full of civilians

162
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
The civilians had to get out of the car

163
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991
Hazard to put their hands up on the Pakistani army Convoy went by

164
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
In the Pakistani soldiers did seem to be really afraid

165
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
That there would be a car bomb or some sort of attack

166
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
From one of these

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
And I'll vehicles on the side of the road including ours

168
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
But you know they just drove by us

169
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
They never forces get out of our car

170
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
And then

171
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
The

172
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,983
A man driving my car he was slick the number to commander of the haqqani network is name is boughten a Connie

173
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
He explained to me that that

174
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
Tencent agreement with the Pakistani army

175
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:19,711
That the economy Vehicles just had to pull over to the side of the road that no one had to get out of the economy car

176
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,295
And in return the pakistanis would not inspect

177
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,671
The car and that if they know which one how do they know which is a haqqani car and which is it

178
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
No idea I just remember

179
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,071
When I watching battery and haqqani the number to come out of that kind at work

180
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Smiling and waving

181
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
Two Pakistani soldiers as they drove by in their trucks

182
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
You know in my heart sinking

183
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
When I thought maybe they were going to rush

184
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
Oh my God so they're just it's just like

185
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,991
The word just like impunity is just jumping into my head like just

186
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
It's a it's a truce

187
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
So it's

188
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
You know and

189
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,951
Equation for x and I'll try to give you a 50 or version but

190
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
The easiest way to explain fascism

191
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
Seems like anyone I asked to explain what gives

192
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,775
Annie's operating so freely in Pakistan

193
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
I have to take a deep breath first

194
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
Because it is fraud it is complicated

195
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,015
And to do it justice it would take a long time so I'm just going to give you the basics of what I've learned

196
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,855
Here goes the haqqanis are a family-run operation

197
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,671
And they're not one thing there Islamic nationalist

198
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
There a militant group

199
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
And they have businesses

200
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,095
New York Times story compare them to quote The Sopranos of the Afghanistan war unquote

201
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
They've got their own alliances their own source of funds

202
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
But they're also part of the Taliban

203
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
They use the same stationary I'm not kidding about that

204
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
One expert told me their statements come out under the Seal of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan same as the Afghan Taliban

205
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,807
Counties are the most militarily effective part of the Taliban

206
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,159
And they're the part of the Taliban that's most under control of Pakistan

207
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
One expert told me quotes

208
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
You know they're just very very close to

209
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
The Pakistani

210
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
Sun quote

211
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
Connie family is Afghan

212
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Are pashtun

213
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
The Roots rev Coast Prada

214
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Cats in Afghanistan

215
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
But they're headquartered in Pakistan

216
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
Back in the 1970s they were fighting the Afghan government and then later switch to fighting the Soviets when they invaded after

217
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Amistad

218
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
And by the way we do us like to that they were fighting the Communists from the early 80s we gave them millions of dollars to help them

219
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
I'm trained fighters in North waziristan

220
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
We helped build them up

221
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
As for Pakistan

222
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,047
They tolerate all this because the haqqanis are useful in them

223
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,191
They're useful proxies in Pakistan's decades-long effort to influence events inside Afghanistan

224
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
To keep Afghanistan a manageable neighbor

225
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
And

226
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Stay With Me

227
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,687
They're useful because they help prevent Pakistan's other neighbor India

228
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,015
I'm establishing any serious foothold or influence in Afghanistan

229
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,087
Pakistan has always seen India as its biggest threat

230
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Here's David's

231
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
Valiant 30 second explanation

232
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,999
The Pakistani military their goal is to

233
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
Stop India

234
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
Everywhere they can in South Asia

235
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
So the

236
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Pakistani government

237
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
Allow the haqqanis and the Taliban to operate

238
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
Because they saw them as allies they saw

239
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,359
Connie's is a force that can allow Pakistan to remain

240
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
In de facto control

241
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Of Afghanistan

242
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,735
And stop India from taking over f

243
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
97 and life

244
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Three sentences

245
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
10

246
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
And I like your 10 what are good

247
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
And

248
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
And this is also important

249
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
Connie's help Pakistan deal with the other Taliban in their country

250
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
The Pakistani Taliban

251
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,703
Because the haqqanis have good relations with the Pakistani Taliban

252
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,775
But the Pakistani Taliban does not have good relations

253
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
The Pakistani government

254
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
So

255
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,711
That was the situation back in 2009 when Beau and David were held by the haqqani

256
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,087
In the past couple years though Pakistan strategy toward the Taliban has changed somewhat

257
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
They're bombing waziristan

258
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Probably right now

259
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,767
If you've been reading the paper maybe you're caught up on all this if not I have some phone numbers for experts

260
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:24,191
David describes the haqqanis as an incredibly disciplined organized crime Network

261
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,311
They were super careful not to use cell phones or Communications devices that could be tracked

262
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
Jordan haqqani one of the top Commanders

263
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,991
What sometimes show up at a house where David was being held and he be completely alone

264
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,599
Because he figured the drones overhead would be looking for a commander moving around with bodyguards

265
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,207
David and Assad and Tasha are removed all the time

266
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,815
As far as David can tell the house to house system work sort of like a franchise

267
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,679
Each family that took them would get some share in the prisoners either some money

268
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:01,055
Or maybe they had family members who were prisoners whom they wanted released as part of a deal to exchange David

269
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Where in houses from

270
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Tudi

271
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Four to five weeks at a time

272
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,319
And is that is there a logic to the moving that you can discern

273
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,231
Is it just like we will you can't you just can't stay in one place for too long cuz going to be found out or is it like I think

274
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
I think that I mean in again I have a huge Advantage because I have these two Afghans I've been kidnapped with me and their hearing all kinds of time

275
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
Relations there talking to

276
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
The boys who

277
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
Bring in bread

278
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
And so

279
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
You know I was told now and then

280
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
Families you know would get tired of holding us

281
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Because it was very dangerous

282
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
For them

283
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
There everyone was very afraid to be a drone strike to kill me

284
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
And all their family would be killed

285
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:48,671
When they held me a densely populated neighborhoods it was cuz the nearby children they hoped

286
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,023
Would prevent you know the US from carrying out a drone strike to kill me because it would

287
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
Kill so many civilians at the same time

288
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Are those like

289
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,471
Connie family members are they like who are those

290
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,335
People who are keeping you or do they just like Bustin at anyone's house and be like we're going to hang out here

291
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Here for a while

292
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
And gear

293
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
I think they only kept us in a homes of Commanders

294
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
And family that they felt they could trust

295
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Most

296
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
Because they were constantly

297
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Terrified

298
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
House pies

299
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
They were rounding up

300
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,535
Local people and accusing them of guiding drone strikes

301
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
The young guards

302
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,215
Protective when we were staying in the intelligence commanders house would come

303
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
Home everyday with the cell phones and possessions of

304
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
Then they had executed that day

305
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
Cumbia guys pies and guiding

306
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Drone strikes

307
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
And is that like did you

308
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
Know that ad

309
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
The timer is that something you understood only later

310
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Tell me I mean

311
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Again I was learning all this stuff through

312
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Retire

313
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,399
What are the last houses David was held in Seguin

314
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
The guy who later take charge of Bose custody

315
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,055
They only had one conversation but David said Sunday and made an impression

316
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,871
He seemed more radical than my guards

317
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
He was

318
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
You know

319
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Deeply

320
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
Incredibly so angrily anti-American

321
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,719
And I can check I think that there was a joke one of his men made about

322
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
Killing me here

323
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Xiaomi my head off or something like that it was

324
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
It was much more aggressive than other

325
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Commanders

326
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
I really

327
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:42,079
The execution videos the sickness the constant toying with you about whether they're going to let you go

328
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
Kill you

329
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
And the cultural Chasm between us and Them

330
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,039
David talks about all that Echoes so squarely with with BOCES

331
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
Has the my captivity went on they were more more Angry me because they weren't getting the money or prisoners are Fame they want

332
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
And they sort of became more and more disgusted with me that I was sort of

333
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
Dirty because I was a non-believer because I wasn't Muslim I was in pure and the reason I was

334
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,103
Having stomach problems and diarrhea was because you know I wasn't a Muslim it wasn't because of the

335
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Conditions we were being held in

336
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
Eventually they should have

337
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
You know

338
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
Ordered me to stop washing dishes that was one of the things I did to

339
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Filippi's them

340
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Stay alive and then they

341
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Stop wanting to eat

342
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Near me

343
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
Because I was

344
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Assertive dirty

345
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Animal

346
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,095
In their minds and in one of the more amazing moments there was an older

347
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Man

348
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
He

349
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
He came in and he started lecture the younger guards that they shouldn't

350
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
See me as dirty

351
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Oh really

352
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
And he said

353
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
You know David is God's creation

354
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Any took this

355
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
He said he would

356
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Take this

357
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
Piece of ready withholding in

358
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
I could eat it

359
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,903
David can eat this piece of bread in and take it out of his mouth without swallowing it

360
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,487
And the man said he would take that piece of bread and then place it in his own mouth

361
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Cuz that's what

362
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
The prophet talk

363
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
Then you should treat all humans

364
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Humanely

365
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,263
Kind of so interesting why do you think he cared how they thought of you

366
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,103
Well I think that that mean this is the moment there's a civil war

367
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,687
Any Islamic world for the interpretation of this face and I

368
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
Saw a examples of

369
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,831
Islam the modern Islam I saw I practiced in in Bosnia

370
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Pakistan and Afghanistan and Iraq

371
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,231
So you there was this one older man who said that to them

372
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
But he was surrounded by these young diluted

373
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Man whose whole identity

374
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,215
Was you know that there was only this strict interpretation of Islam than anyone

375
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Who didn't

376
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,567
Follow their interpretation of Islam deserve to die

377
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,871
Anyone who live they literally told me

378
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
But anyone who lived under the

379
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,271
Karzai government in Afghanistan or the Musharraf government in Pakistan

380
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Where are non-believers and deserved

381
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
To die

382
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Michaels

383
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Those are infidels as well

384
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,767
Everyone's and they were worse they hated the maiamai to Afghan College more than I hated me

385
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Because they were

386
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
They were

387
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,935
Munafiqeen I can't remember all these words anymore but they were traitors

388
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
Did you ever have like

389
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
Substantive conversations with

390
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,943
Anyone who was holding you about the first the first three days it was all about

391
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
The Warren lady magazine

392
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
Did, 911 in my book and

393
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
And I told him about the reporting it down in Bosnia exposing the

394
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
Mass executions of thousands of Muslims in

395
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,863
I remember after I told him about my reporting in Bosnia they said

396
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
That's good

397
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
That means you're worth more money

398
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Oh man

399
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
Can I see the point of my story you missed it

400
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
But there was now I mean it was

401
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,175
You know there was no kind of rational

402
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
Conversation

403
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
Oh and David did not overlap and haqqani custody

404
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,423
David escaped one night along with tie hair from the compound where they were being held and they made their way over to a Pakistani

405
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,239
Military base about a half-mile away and they were rescued

406
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,591
David and Tahir got out on June 20th 2009

407
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
I was captured just ten days later

408
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,991
David's never met never talk to Bo

409
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
But he says he feels linked to him

410
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
In our interview he kept coming back

411
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,647
Guiltily tell how much better he had it then bow

412
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
Obviously he knows it's not his fault what happened to Bo

413
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Play Feels Bad

414
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,095
He said as soon as he heard a US Soldier have been grabbed by the same people

415
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
He worried that he'd be treated harshly

416
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
In part because David was treated well

417
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Which helped him get away

418
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,615
Sami Yusuf sari Afghan reporter told me he did hear that after David escaped

419
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:04,223
There were all kinds of rumors and accusations flying around that someone had been paid off

420
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:09,343
Infighting between economies and other Taliban without Connie's can be trusted

421
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
What news reports at the Makati suspected

422
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Taliban guards have taken a bribe

423
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
Maybe there was a traitor among them

424
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
So yeah

425
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,071
It does seem they weren't planning on letting it happen

426
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:27,007
Then again maybe bows rough treatment had more to do with the fact that he had tried to escape from them right away that first week

427
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,359
The haqqanis are Savvy enough to know the difference

428
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
In terms of risk

429
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
In terms of danger in terms of value

430
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Between an American journalist

431
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
An American Soldier

432
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
In the beginning

433
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,975
It seems that perhaps undine in the haqqanis were looking for a quick and easy deal to get rid of bow

434
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:52,351
Sami Yusuf side in an interview for us in Dubai with a high-level Taliban guy there

435
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,935
This guy wasn't directly involved with the negotiations for bow

436
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
But he heard about it from the people who were involved

437
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,079
What does Taliban told Sammy is that initially

438
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
They wanted

439
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Ransom Maybe

440
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
Prisoners from an Afghan jail

441
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
Which is what they'd also been asking for an David Rhodes case

442
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,319
But then somehow the Taliban gets word from The Americans

443
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
And it's not clear how or from whom exactly

444
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
But the story is

445
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,232
They get word that the Americans aren't going to pay Ransom

446
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Just True by the way

447
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,584
And furthermore that they're not going to free any prisoners

448
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
Because they're not too concerned with getting blowback

449
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
Tri-State can tolerate the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Afghanistan

450
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,080
One soldier in captivity isn't that big a deal for the US Army

451
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
And this message if it really came

452
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,712
But apparently Sunday and got upset

453
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
And his position was what and why are we wasting our time and our resources

454
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
Let's just kill him

455
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,160
And that's when the sky told Tammy

456
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
That someone

457
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
A well-connected person in Pakistan

458
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,024
Totes on game

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Don't kill him

460
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,400
Add that said don't worry keep the guy this is a wolf DDS

461
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,472
Don't get upset don't lose your patience today

462
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,032
This is

463
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
And after. Did you okay

464
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Economies are willing to wait

465
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200
Between spell also weights

466
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
One defense official told me

467
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,856
If you could set aside the circumstances of both capture

468
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,904
Of course you can't but if you could

469
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,976
Both would be a huge success story for the Army

470
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
Is 23 year old kid

471
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,888
No training manager is not only to survive but to resist as a p o w

472
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
The most extraordinary perhaps he does it alone

473
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
And isolation

474
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,080
There's no one else in the recent history of the army with a story like that

475
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,176
Terrence Russell as principal debriefer

476
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
Testified at a military Hearing in September

477
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:51,136
Russell is an Undisputed expert on this stuff during his career he's debriefed or interviewed about a hundred and twenty-five

478
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
5 pows possibly more than anyone in the country

479
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
The hearing Russell was asked

480
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,560
Basically how bad did Bo have it

481
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:03,424
Russell said you'd have to go back to the Jungle camps Vietnam to begin to compare

482
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:08,032
Experience and I don't know sir that I can give you a percentage

483
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
What is experience ranks at the same Echelon of the most horrible conditions of captivity that we've seen in the last six

484
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
Steers unquote

485
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,344
After Bo was rescued and they took him to a hospital in Germany

486
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
Go ask them to take the clock off the wall in the room he was in time rated like that

487
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,072
Should have taken him years as a captive to wean yourself off of time

488
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,632
Even when he was locked in whatever room

489
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,192
There might be a light on all the time or not at all

490
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,288
The clock in the calendar became bendy and troublesome

491
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
Nothing you can really understand

492
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
What do you mean

493
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
You're not in tomorrow you're not in the next week you're not here next month

494
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
And the fact that there was nothing there

495
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
I mean

496
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
You can

497
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,648
When you were able to distract yourself

498
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
Your mind

499
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
When you don't have any of that

500
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
Yeah

501
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
Repetition

502
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,776
You're my you turn into a broken record

503
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,128
Because at some point you have only so much to think about

504
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,944
Right you run out of ideas yeah

505
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
Such as will I get food today

506
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
Give it to me

507
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:08,096
Why did the girl who gave it to me yesterday look annoyed why are they giving it to me is there something I can do to make them give it to me but not make it look like I'm try

508
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Can you get it

509
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
By the way depriving someone of any discernible schedule is a time-honored method of keeping her prisoner compliant

510
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,592
Who said it was maddening the obsessive thoughts

511
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,456
Maybe you do an Abbott and Costello bit in his head or that line from the Johnny Cash song

512
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,296
I fell into a burning Ring of Fire he said he can't remember the rest

513
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
Or he'd look and look and look at the room around him

514
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Not in search of something new

515
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
Just because that's all he had to look at

516
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,176
Are you still moving

517
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
If you're thinking maybe bone went crazy

518
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
He didn't

519
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
He says he didn't

520
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
I might have been a little easier if you had but he didn't

521
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,776
In fact a psychologist we talked to who was on a Seer team that plan for Bose return

522
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:25,152
He said that they assumed if you survive captivity you're more or less psychologically healthy

523
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
PTSD Maybe

524
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
I'm not crazy

525
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
Because as soon as you start to lose your mind

526
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Your chances of surviving go down

527
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,952
If you spend save 5 years trying to get food trying to get water trying to escape

528
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
You need to keep your mind intact for all that

529
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Still sanity

530
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632
In both situation is psychologically exhaust

531
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
Because you're simultaneously bored

532
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
Afraid

533
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
And Hyper aware

534
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
A combination other pows

535
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Described

536
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Mark espo

537
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Did you tell yourself stories

538
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,200
Did you try to disappear into your imagination

539
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
And surprisingly both said not really

540
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,672
He said he would force himself to stay in the present not succumb to what he calls his fantastic storybook tendon

541
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
And that's partly what got him in trouble in the first place

542
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
Anyway even if you'd wanted to drift off

543
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
Ebony just couldn't

544
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
I didn't have a choice about it

545
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Pain he said

546
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Is a great distractor

547
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,776
He might spend an entire day just dealing with his feet

548
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,080
Or the cramps from dehydration

549
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
From starvation

550
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
His body was demanding his full immediate

551
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Attention

552
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,552
Dosas even when he was kind of ready to give up his body was stubborn

553
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Nagging

554
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
Doing its own thing

555
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,232
Only reason why I'm still here simply because my body didn't quit

556
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
What food came he ate it

557
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Body just

558
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
Maybe so cold

559
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
But his body would struggle to get warm

560
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,376
But even with that like wrapped around my shoulders

561
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
Did you ever ask for more blankets

562
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,944
Ended up giving me an extra blanket

563
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,320
I don't know I mean everybody human has some some

564
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,904
Did you know

565
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,976
Good qualities especially if somebody's

566
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,816
How to place a low placenta and travels in Hawaiian

567
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:56,704
I can't say for sure of course but I think it's possible the guy who gave both a blanket with a cook

568
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Emma Brock

569
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,848
Sammy interviewed him for Mark's company page one who's an older guy maybe 50

570
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Unmarried

571
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,272
He don't have Connie's a long time you cook for them and their people for many years

572
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:16,160
He retired and moved back to his Village from your job but he told Sammy that one day a few years ago

573
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,208
He got a call to come to a job

574
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
He's met my Melissa and Dean

575
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
Protection for remote farmhouse

576
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,608
There's no Road you have to hike way out to it

577
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,192
And I'm not sure but it's possible this place was somewhere in the show all Valley

578
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Couple hours from here to Shaw

579
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:36,128
Sunken gives them an AK-47 and tell them the whole area is mined don't leave the house

580
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,432
If you see anyone approached shoot

581
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
Inside the house by Brock says he sees his gas

582
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,416
I guess he means prisoners a blue-eyed Foreigner in one small dark room and some rich Afghan guy

583
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
In another room

584
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,744
He said they were all stuck out there in the wild

585
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,048
The two prisoners 3 guards in Iraq

586
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,864
The guards weren't allowed walkie talkies or phones

587
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,216
Couple times a week someone might show up then use a code word to be let in

588
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:05,568
In Sammy's notes by Brock sounds like he was more than a little freaked out

589
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
Kisses

590
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,432
The only thing we could hear there was noise of drones

591
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:15,808
Dangerous animal crying dangerous animal cries at night and scary deep Darkness

592
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Yeah

593
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:23,232
Yeah babies Montanez night time is quite scary you know it's very scary they have all kind of bad animals and draw

594
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
24-hour light

595
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
Making buzz buzz buzz and you are worried

596
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,680
High enough maybe there is a red or something going on

597
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,080
You could not leave everything like that you know because they were trusted by

598
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
The commander

599
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,224
Bob Rocks first menu he said was potato with gravy yogurt and naan

600
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:49,088
He said they kept one plate aside for bow since he wasn't Muslim no one else would eat off that plate

601
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
Brock said the Afghan prisoner was chatty and funny

602
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
Couldn't communicate with bow

603
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
I could see that if I wasn't doing well

604
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Wasn't eating much

605
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
Which is an insult

606
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
By the way

607
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,704
Tell Sammy he wasn't sure if Beau didn't like the food or just needed a utensil

608
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Find a spoon for him

609
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,640
And he said I mean every time of course he was trying to say something but you don't understand

610
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
I want English was not good

611
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
Then he said

612
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:20,320
Sometime I really wish I could understand he was trying to say something can next

613
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Time

614
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,696
I brought lot of thing for him and he didn't pick up nothing kuptimi Enola

615
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Like I brought

616
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,328
Pastime all I thought he may be sick or something

617
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:36,960
Understand what you're what I had in color

618
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
He says in the notes

619
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
It says

620
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
One day he was asking me something

621
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
I brought numbers of things at the NEX

622
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
Next arrival but he did not take

623
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
Either of it and was laughing

624
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Yeah I brought himself

625
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
A tablet of painkiller

626
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
And blanket

627
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,696
Yeah because he was an old man you know I was trying to understand to give him something

628
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
American was

629
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,048
American was sitting

630
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
In the beginning of the time

631
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,424
Put his head on his knees and number of times

632
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
Chrome and he

633
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,520
Remain with his head down on his knees

634
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Yeah that's what happened

635
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,432
Maybe maybe he doesn't I mean maybe was very sad depression.

636
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:25,088
He was used to coming to the door to breathe fresh air and see light

637
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
But then he gives up and stays

638
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
But then he gave up in stages place

639
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,192
There are lots of images out there many of them horrifying

640
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Of cap

641
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
Usually westerners

642
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,848
About to be executed wearing orange jumpsuits I'll Guantanamo Bay

643
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
The symbolism

644
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,432
It's so clear so loud

645
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
Talk about his captivity I hadn't realized just how present Guantanamo and other US prisons

646
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
Arby's guys

647
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
It comes up all the time

648
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,464
Digestion displays a broad political theater

649
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,560
The topic is woven all through both story and in David Rhodes to

650
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
Timmy talked to another guy named Butters almond butter and his brother abdur-rahim

651
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,824
They've spent a few years in prison at Guantanamo

652
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,664
Call Sammy his brother met bow in 2010

653
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
And he went to his room

654
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,624
And he said I should treat him like the way I was treated by American in Ghana

655
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
Montana movie and he says the American reopen tradition was so strong

656
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Mange

657
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,120
Sorry I also asking him like strange question

658
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Like what

659
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,752
You know like like asking to how many dogs do you have

660
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:52,128
How many chickens do you how many eggs you are chicken

661
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
You already know

662
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,576
Saw nonsense questions

663
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,720
Translated as well but he who could speak English little bit because he learned Guantanamo

664
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,864
I said it's some point he had a debate with Bergdahl and told him why you are

665
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,704
And I understand why you can't understand in America downstairs

666
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
I'm too fly by American forces

667
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
I'm not

668
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
A decision-maker and I will reply

669
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
It's not my fault I just did what I was told

670
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,040
Yeah I just told him you can simply say no

671
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,344
Aleve or Mandarin come here

672
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,584
Father's alma mater happens to be a guy also talked to for a story I worked on back in 2005

673
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,144
He's Afghan and he and his brother

674
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
The poet and journalist

675
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
We're living in Pakistan

676
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,288
They pissed off some important people with their writing much of which was

677
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Caracal

678
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,688
Pakistani authorities arrested them and turn them over to US forces and we sent them to Guantanamo

679
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:03,552
It wasn't much of a terrorist back then but it seems we might have turned it into one

680
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,368
Is reportedly working as an Isis recruiter now

681
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,232
David said the people holding him would tell him

682
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
We're treating you well because we're better than the American

683
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,656
We treat our prisoners better than Americans treat their prisoners in Guantanamo and upgrade

684
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
Bose case though

685
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
That rationale seem to work in reverse

686
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,080
Princeton's the guy who repeatedly tortured bow

687
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Poses a man would come into the room

688
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:33,760
I never saw his face because either Bowl would be blindfolded or the guy's face was covered with a cloth

689
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Cody Hancock

690
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
Sitting cross-legged on the floor

691
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
Both of the guy with painted legs down

692
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
Push me against the wall

693
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,720
And then cut his chest with a razor blade

694
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,816
Don't know don't think one or two cuts at a time

695
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,680
Between 60-70 cuts at a time

696
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
It hurts more

697
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
Of course if you do it slowly

698
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,248
I lost count how many Cuts after it reached 600

699
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
And I would he would he

700
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,624
What did he speak English enough to tell you why he was

701
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Is punishing you

702
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:17,792
No it wasn't speaking English

703
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,376
Flalottery

704
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
What is fisa mean

705
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
Like wife

706
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
Yeah wife

707
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,696
Donkey

708
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
Is more like

709
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
Along the lines of Revenge Type Thing

710
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Yeah for what

711
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,520
Being American

712
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,872
For all the things that Americans have done in their country for all the

713
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:09,504
We're done the guys in Guantanamo and diagram and all that

714
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,600
Stillwater boarding the dogs

715
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,464
Isolation Chambers

716
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,424
Food deprivation and sleep deprivation all those thing goes with a list of

717
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
What would you say in response

718
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,808
I wouldn't I wouldn't say anything usually with one-way conversations I just listened to them

719
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
He waited out

720
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
You like no otter

721
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
Would you at least say I understand I hear you and

722
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
Stuff like that

723
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,960
Understanding what they're saying

724
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,568
And that's what they wanted acknowledgement so that's what I give him

725
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,672
Goes in the cage against a metal cage padlock together

726
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,000
Is soulmate one last impotent attempt at Escape

727
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:29,120
He said he did it because he was so angry he could not stand the idea of these guys winning

728
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Is it wasn't a second to last year

729
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,008
One of the guys English

730
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
Got really angry about that

731
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
After the guy left

732
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
Beau decided to risk

733
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,712
Lifting the particle board away from the cage

734
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:20,320
Floor she'd realize the only fly in the cage was the shotty welding down there

735
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:26,720
He thought if he could rest the welds with spit or water you can maybe get a few of the bars free and squeeze out

736
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:32,864
Because of the cold and damp the particle board how to expand it so he gets it maybe halfway up

737
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
But then he can't get it back down in place

738
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:41,568
Hide what he's trying to do so he thinks if he softens it maybe you can shave off the edges and get it to go back down

739
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
Put water on it which just makes it swell even more and that begins a fight with a particle board at last

740
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
All night

741
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
All night he's using a AAA Battery he had he popped off the top and flattened it and sharpened it against the cage

742
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:02,048
And now he's using it to try to shave down the particle board and every noise he makes he scared someone's going to hear

743
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,632
And come in and then who knows what the consequences would be but very bad

744
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,680
I can't get the board back down

745
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
Idea of losing that one chance

746
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
Exhausted

747
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,528
Pilfer

748
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,344
I don't think I ever

749
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
I'm back from it

750
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
I never stop

751
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
It's like putting water on a

752
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
Stop trying to escape

753
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
That night thing to burn something out of me

754
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
Yeah I'm back

755
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
Something inside of me that

756
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
By his last year-and-a-half

757
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
The prisoner

758
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,832
Moses's daily conversation had funneled down to a few words

759
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
It's a

760
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
That's fine

761
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
That's good

762
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,440
I say okay

763
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,976
Or understood

764
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Does it

765
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:13,728
In 2011 a diplomat named Mark Grossman came in as the state Department's special representative to Afghanistan

766
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Pakistan

767
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,592
At that point the US government nubo was with a Connie's in Pakistan

768
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,688

Kateri the Prime Minister the president the Army chief of staff

771
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,392
According to Grossman the response was consistent

772
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
We're sympathetic

773
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976

775
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304

How hard we try

779
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,472
You had a bureaucracy that was broken

780
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
And a

781
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,592
Do you have a feeling of well he's a traitor anyway so

782
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,431
I bet you made that was probably the most

783
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Truck jokes

784
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,271
Part of dead and I'm home was just stacking

785
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,807
