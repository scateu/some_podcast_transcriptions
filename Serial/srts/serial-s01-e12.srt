Investigative

00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,736
Are we developed our storytelling jobs

00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
SOS

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,880
Beautiful 7-part series that explores the life of one man in Alabama

00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,464
As Town starts out as one thing and then become something

00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
Previously on serial

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
You left your cell phone in car with me

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
Call me call me

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
Hey now at this point

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
You know why he's leaving the car with you yes

23
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
And why is that

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
Hey

25
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,416
I just and it's going to look at this and stay all night. He must be lying

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
So coincidental

27
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,256
He told me to speak with Jay and I was like okay

28
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,328
Cuz they wanted to say hi so I said hi to Jay

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,376
And that's all I can barely recall

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
The uselessness of what we're trying to do by recreating something that doesn't fit

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
It's like trying to plot the coordinates of someone's dream or something

32
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
It is what it is. You don't have no control over

33
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from

34
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Maryland Correctional Facility

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago is cereal once

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,896
Story told week by week and this episode 12 is the final week

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
Final episode of season 1 of this podcast

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,576
It's been a year since I first contacted at 9 and I'm still talking to him regularly

39
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
I'm still asking him the basics

40
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:08,512
Still thinking I don't know that he'll remember something or maybe he'll just get so frustrated with me that he'll crack

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
I still want to know what you were doing that afternoon

42
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
I want to know who had your phone

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
I want to know what you were doing that afternoon

44
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
I don't I don't remember anything more

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
This is from Saturday night just this past Saturday

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
I mean we're down to the wire here

47
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Oh man

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
We have no ending

49
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
Do I have an ending

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,936
Of course I have an ending we're going to come to an ending today

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,312
Plus a smattering of new information a review of old information cast under different light

52
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
And an ending

53
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,224
Even notice my thoughts about Adnan case about who is lying and why

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Have not been fixed over the course of the story

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
Several times I have landed on a decision I've made up my mind

56
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
And stay there with relief

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,768
And then inevitably I learned something I didn't know before

58
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
And I'm up ended

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
Sometimes the reversal takes a few weeks

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
Sometimes it happens within hours

61
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,008
What's been astonishing to me is how the back-and-forth hasn't let up

62
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
After all of this time

63
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,896
Even if it is very weak and I kid you not into this very day that I'm writing this

64
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
Because I'm learning new information all the time

65
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
For instance

66
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
I talked to Don

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,392
8 months ago he told me he did not want to talk to me for the story

68
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
And then last week

69
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
He talked to me for the story

70
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
Do you want me to use tape of his voice or his last name

71
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
But he said I could use what he said

72
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Spoiler here

73
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,008
Does not appear to know what happened to hey or why it happened to her or whether Adnan is guilty

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
It was interesting to hear what he said he remembered

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
About the day he disappeared

76
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
And about her and about the trial

77
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
Here's what he told me

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,808
Don said he was at his house in a town north of Baltimore City

79
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
On the night of January 12th the night before she went missing

80
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
He said she wanted to spend the whole next day with him too

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,047
She wanted to call Woodlawn High School and pretend to be some authority figure

82
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Tell the office he couldn't be in school that day

83
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,935
She wanted it to be an excused absence rather than just playing hooky

84
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
But he didn't

85
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
He says he thought you should go to school

86
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
And besides he told her he had to work the next day at 9 a.m.

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,687
It was supposed to be his day off from the LensCrafters at the Owings Mills mall where they both worked

88
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,039
But John said he'd arranged to fill in for a friend at the store in Hunt Valley

89
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,647
John said he had made plans to meet up later that night of the 13th

90
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
After her work shift ended at 10 p.m.

91
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,815
When the cops recovered his car there was a note inside with Dawn's name on it

92
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Hey cutie

93
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Sorry I couldn't stay

94
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
I have to go to a wrestling match at Randallstown High

95
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
But I promise to page you as soon as I get home okay

96
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
Take care and drive safely

97
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Always

98
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
Hey

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
UPS on the note he mentions a TV interview that have been taped at day

100
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
A local station it done as soon as Elite segment on her

101
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
So the note was written on the 13th the day she went missing

102
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
The snow was one of the reasons I'd initially written to Don way back when

103
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
Sorry I couldn't stay is confusing

104
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
I didn't understand what you plan to do with the note

105
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Put it on his car maybe

106
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
But his car was so far away in Hunt Valley

107
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
But the notes dumped onto

108
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
He said he didn't know about it until I sent it to him

109
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
He didn't have a guess as to what our plan was for that afternoon

110
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
When he went missing Don was one of the first people the cops called

111
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,807
He said he knew immediately suspect

112
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,135
He said quote that was the first thought when they said she's missing

113
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
I said well okay they're going to try to blame it on me

114
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
Because she was with me last night I'm the new boyfriend

115
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
I'm obviously going to be one of the first suspect me and Anon

116
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,679
He said he immediately made sure he knew where he was

117
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,567
Have you seen this person they went missing they haven't been seen since school

118
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,639
You automatically retrace everything you did that day

119
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
Did I see them did I hear from them that they page me that they call me where was I at this time what was I doing at that time

120
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Yeah

121
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,695
But that wasn't enough

122
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,511
State of reaction to getting called by the cops on the 13th

123
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
I'm tempted to make a judgment right here

124
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
But I'm going to pull a benefit of the doubt

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
Because Anan was 17

126
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
He was stoned

127
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
He's a different person but noted right

128
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,479
Also know there was one similarity and how they reacted to his disappearance

129
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,575
He doesn't remember calling her after the 13th

130
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,903
Guess who else doesn't remember try to call her after the 13th

131
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Don

132
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,071
Like everyone else he said he wondered whether maybe she's going to California she told him her father live there

133
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,655
He says it's something he didn't think about what it happened or didn't worry

134
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
It's just I didn't know what to do

135
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Don's Alibi was solid

136
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,383
His computer-generated timecard said he'd arrived at work at 9:02 a.m. on the 13th

137
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
Taking lunch from 1:10 to 1:42

138
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Clocked out at 6 p.m.

139
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
Don's manager at the valley store with his mom

140
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
So that didn't look great

141
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
He was anxious throughout the investigation

142
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
Quote the never up until the day they arrested in

143
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
I had no idea what was going on

144
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,607
He said they never said okay you're cleared as a suspect

145
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
Who's left hanging and until they arrested him I had no idea

146
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,519
I suspected they might try to say that we were in on it together

147
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
I didn't know Jay existed until I started listening to

148
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Podcast

149
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,991
According to his diary it was December 23rd

150
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
The snowy day and she'd had a minor car accident on the way into work

151
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
And she called at 9 to come help her out

152
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,951
They were broken up by this time it came to the rescue

153
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
In the parking lot outside LensCrafters Adnan and Don converged

154
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Hayrides quote

155
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,703
Take a look at my car and told me not to drive it unanimously

156
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Mommy is going to be so mad

157
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
But I swear it's not my fault

158
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,199
Don told the cops back then that he Nan Nan had a perfectly nice conversation

159
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
A trial he said an unfit some again like

160
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
Okay well I just want to make sure you are an okay guy

161
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
Done told me the same

162
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Quotes

163
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,487
We sat and talked and just as everyone else described him he was very polite articulate

164
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,863
Just really the typical what you would expect of the ex-boyfriend meeting the new boyfriend sizing each other up

165
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,959
We joked we spent a good 10-15 minutes talking after we checked out the car

166
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
A trial for whatever reason this episode is firmly time-stamped as having happened in January after hey

167
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
And Don it's her dating

168
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
It's clear from the diary was December 23rd

169
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,831
Navigate Stones testimony at both trials he's a state's Witness

170
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Is milk toast

171
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
He just says it was cordial

172
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
Which made me wonder why the state even called Don

173
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,095
But according to Don prosecutor Kevin urick might have been wondering the same thing

174
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
Don said quotes

175
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
When I testified they pulled me in a back room and let me tell you how fun that was. The prosecutor afterwards yelling at me because I did

176
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Not make Adnan sound creepy

177
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
He said

178
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
They wanted me to make him sound creepy

179
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
So creepy that I felt intimidated which I did not

180
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,319
He just was very personable he was funny he was everything that I already said

181
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
He was somebody that I would have hung out with if I knew him in school

182
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,767
Don's memory is that you're a gelded him after both the first and second trials

183
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
Oh he was irate done said

184
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,887
When I say yelling he was literally yelling about it at me

185
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,751
I ran this by Kevin urick but he said he was not authorized to talk about the case

186
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Don says he loves her

187
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
But he still loves her

188
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
Is that something that goes away he said

189
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,759
Even though they only officially dated for 13 days

190
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
He said she meant a lot to him

191
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
She was totally unshy he said

192
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Confident

193
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
She pursued him he said for all of December whenever she saw him at work

194
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,815
He said she'd ask him when he was going to take her out constantly she asked him

195
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
Followed him into the lunchroom on his brake tester damn

196
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
Using someone else at the time but then that ended

197
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
And so on New Year's Eve they made their first date for the next day

198
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
He fell for a pretty quickly says

199
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,663
Not not like this girl

200
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Choose aggressive intelligent

201
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Assertive is a better word than aggressive

202
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Genuine nice person

203
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Anything I've heard anybody say about our sins

204
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,463
It's not like I want to talk bad about the dead it's just being honest it's

205
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Hard for me to explain

206
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,583
You didn't like her you didn't like her because she was so likeable

207
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,679
But then you couldn't even be annoyed because she wasn't annoying

208
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Thompson hay actually change them

209
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
Change the way he thought about himself

210
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,407
He said he'd come off a couple of bad relationships girls who cheated on them

211
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,759
She basically in no uncertain terms told me to knock it off he said

212
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
I have worth

213
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
I don't remember the word she used

214
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,183
I can't paraphrase it at this point but I am worth having self-esteem

215
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
But I should think that I am good enough

216
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
And I took it to heart

217
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
Especially after I found out that she had died

218
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,431
I'm sorry that it's so late in the game here

219
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
I didn't even know that this exists

220
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
Yeah that's okay that's okay

221
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
Just heard from

222
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,439
And speaking to him all the sudden I was hearing J's perspective

223
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
At least this guy's perspective of Jays perspective

224
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
He was scared

225
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
I mean like terrified

226
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
This guy's name is Josh yesterday not use his last name

227
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:57,311
He said he worked with Jas Southwest video cornstore Josh's 21 at the time

228
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,687
They were close friends he said but Josh would give Jay rides and they smoke weed together and hang out a little bit

229
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,527
Just said that on the night table first picked up by the cops

230
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,111
So late at night on February 27th and to the morning of the 28th

231
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Jay called him at home

232
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,743
And ask him to come into the store cuz he didn't want to be alone there

233
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
He was that scared

234
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
He was

235
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
I mean

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Frightened out of his mind and not of the police

237
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Like they were the

238
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,543
The secondary fear I mean he he was afraid to go in the jail but not like

239
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Like he was afraid

240
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,271
Admin I guess it's how you say his name I don't know that's it

241
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,111
Josh does Jay actually never told him a nun's name

242
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,439
But Josh is listen to the podcast so he knows the name now

243
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
The back and you didn't

244
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,071
He says Jay told him he was afraid that people were after him

245
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
People connected to the murderer

246
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
Across the street from the video store was

247
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
Parking lot for the Amtrak commuter train

248
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
And

249
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
Parking lot was usually empty in

250
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
In the evening

251
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
Well that particular night there was a van

252
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
In that parking lot

253
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Which I'm

254
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
Pretty positive had nobody in it but

255
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Jay was afraid

256
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
I mean like to the female almost in tears

257
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
You didn't

258
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Want to go outside

259
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
It didn't even want to look out the door

260
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,959
Because he really thought the van that was across the street was like people waiting to get it

261
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
But the people you're talking about

262
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
Like is it only in retrospect that you're that you're thinking it's like Adnan people or did he say that to you

263
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
He said it was

264
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Today's date

265
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
I guess at 9

266
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Threatened

267
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,207
Right but you're saying you didn't know he never told you the name of the

268
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,815
I'm just trying to imagine is it possible that it was somebody else entirely who he was

269
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Afraid of

270
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
I guess it could have been

271
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
But I mean

272
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,263
Whoever you was afraid of his obviously the person that committed the crime

273
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Right

274
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
So I'm saying

275
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Did you

276
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,199
Did he express to you at the time that this was

277
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
A person with Pakistani

278
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903
Relatives or I definitely said that it was somebody to

279
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
You think I was

280
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
Middle Eastern

281
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,303
Josh says Jay told him it was the ex-boyfriend who killed Hae

282
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
Was Josh's impression that Jay had called the cops himself at night

283
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
Because he told Josh the cops are coming to get him

284
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
He seemed anxious that it was taking him so long to get there

285
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:41,663
Ssj was pacing checking his watch they kept asking him to look outside and see if the van was still there

286
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,551
I tried J testifies that the cops showed up at the video store on their own that he didn't know they were coming

287
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
It is taped interview with the police that same night February 28th

288
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,487
Jay doesn't mention a white van or that he's terrified of a nun's people

289
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,839
Just tell the cops that he talked to Adnan either yesterday or the day before

290
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
And then turn on was threatening him in a general way

291
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Your tape from that frippery 28th interview

292
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Detective Ritz talks first

293
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
What was the last conversation you had with

294
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,807
The most recent conversation you had with intent

295
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
That conversation

296
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
I'd learned that you guys were looking for me in

297
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
How did you learn that

298
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,071
Watch people told me I'm crazy mind told me

299
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
Calm down everything will be okay

300
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,127
Where did this conversation take place

301
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
I believe in front of my house and its pot

302
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
Other than you say know what f*** you do watch give me wrapped up in this

303
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
What did he say

304
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Xiaomi

305
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
Not going to happen they don't know s***

306
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Drinking all said during that conversation

307
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
He told me that he knew somebody I mean

308
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
Icing involving lightly whacktivity

309
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
Keep on the west side

310
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:31,231
The gist of what he told me was that you need Westside Hitman so I mean

311
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Olin College

312
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
You let me know

313
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Around about weighted

314
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
What if you said something for the police that

315
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Yeah cuz I told him I mean I was like

316
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,343
Okay so the Westside Hitman

317
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,183
It's so strange I find Josh's version of J's fear

318
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
How much more believable than J's version of J's fear

319
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
Which makes me wonder if it's all just in the delivery

320
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,727
When she first told Josh weeks before that he knew something about the missing girl who was all over the news

321
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
I said something about you know

322
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,271
Like him not being really involved or whatever you know and then he's like dumb and you understand I helped

323
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Bury the body

324
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
It seemed like he was kind of bragging in

325
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
And I mean that

326
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
Kind of the guy that Jay was

327
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
It's not that

328
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
He bragged about

329
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Stuff that he did it

330
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
Sometimes he made up things that

331
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
And so that's kind of what I thought he was doing

332
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
Now it's like why would you say that

333
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Did you tell

334
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
Somebody that you really don't know that well

335
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
How do I didn't believe in

336
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
If I had done it I certainly wouldn't

337
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
Me

338
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Didn't you know maybe like my best friend

339
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Tonight

340
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
That's somebody that you

341
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
You work with it a p*** store

342
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
The virgin of the crime that Josh has Jay eventually told them it's pretty close to the version that Jay's friend Chris told me

343
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
2

344
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,311
That Jay was out somewhere and that Adnan came to him

345
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,895
And show them the body and said something to the effect of you got to help me

346
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,063
Josh says you can't remember where Jay said he was when this happened but he is certain the words Best Buy we're never attached to the store

347
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
Josh went to that Best Buy all the time

348
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
And he says he definitely would have remembered that

349
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,279
He said when you heard in the podcast that Chris had mentioned the pool hall thing

350
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
That sounded right to him but he can't say for sure

351
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
Josh says he also had the impression like Chris

352
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,263
Trade it all gone down later in the day not mid-afternoon

353
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
Cast of the first Jason afraid the cops were going to figure out he was involved through fingerprints or DNA or something

354
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,271
But this time went on he seems more and more afraid of the guy who did it

355
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
That he was threatening Stephanie

356
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
It was you better keep your mouth shut or else

357
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
He says J told him the threats were getting more forceful

358
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,791
The Josh J was so not the type to be involved in a murder

359
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
Baby tried to act tough he said but he wasn't

360
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,983
He said he himself had friends who got in serious fights or who been locked up for Grand Theft Auto

361
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,799
But Jay was not in that category at all he said

362
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
He's a nice guy

363
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
It wasn't the type of guy that you

364
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
Did you really got the

365
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
To do something real

366
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
He wants in the Killer

367
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
And he wasn't

368
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
A song

369
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
If anything he was kind of the opposite

370
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Like you feel like he was

371
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
In way over his head

372
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Yeah

373
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
Remember feeling bad for him

374
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
And it was there any point made out of meat

375
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
Sound energy or something but like was there any point where you like

376
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
Go you should go tell the cops then if you know who did this

377
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Go tell the cops

378
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
No not really

379
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,111
I know it's probably what I should have said but I didn't really believe him

380
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
And

381
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,927
Like I said

382
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Comes to life

383
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
Reputation

384
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,375
I am on the street you don't want to be the guy that's like I'll go snitch

385
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,471
You know you don't want anybody see your week and all that stuff in the cell

386
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
I didn't ever say go to the cops

387
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
I mean that would be like

388
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Best thing to do

389
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,991
Justice would never quite made sense to him when he never entirely understood

390
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,807
Was YJ would help Adnan bury hay

391
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
Even if I didn't call the cops but definitely wouldn't

392
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,951
Rio grab a shovel and help him Dig A Grave

393
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
I know that's that's what

394
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,863
Part about the story is you just figure like there's something that's not computing

395
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,727
Hear it. Definitely never sounded right which is why I never believed him

396
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Until the cops actually picked

397
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,359
Josh says he only remembers seeing j one more time after that

398
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
Play DJ came by the store to pick up his check

399
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
When Josh asked him so what happened

400
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
Josh says Jay told him he couldn't talk about it

401
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
In preparation for this episode

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
Julian Dana the producers of the show

403
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
Went back over everything we had

404
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,960
All the police files the attorney files the interviews I've done sell records

405
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,800
They did one final sweep just to be sure weed Wade everything

406
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
Because old details can have startling new meeting

407
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
After a Year's worth of research is behind us

408
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,504
They came across a couple of things they wanted me to know

409
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
First and foremost

410
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Anisha call

411
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
I'd ask them

412
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:50,208
Is there any other viable explanation for the Nisha call uninstall record

413
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
Hey Julie

414
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
We had always been under the impression that the Nisha call was a No Way Around It call looks terrible for his looks

415
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,424
Terrible for him it's

416
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
2 minutes and 22 seconds

417
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,592
Remind you the musical is the one that happens at 3:32 p.m. on January 13th

418
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,920
Is that girl in 9 ad been flirting with who live near Silver Spring

419
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,576
Keyshia Cole is the one that's always stuck out to me and I think most people who've looked at in on case closely

420
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
Because it happens on the afternoon that hate has appeared at a time when a non has said insisted even that he were

421
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Was not with his phone

422
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
The Jay had his phone while he was in school

423
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,192
I told the detectives that I had called some girl in Silver Spring that afternoon

424
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
And briefly put on the phone with her

425
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
That's why the call is so important

426
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,664
Not only does it put together with his phone in the middle of the afternoon

427
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,248
It puts together with j in the middle of the afternoon

428
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
Corroborate Jay's story

429
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,416
I've always had some suspicions about this call because Nisha said to the cops and a trial

430
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
But there was a day when on the phone

431
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:00,352
Benicia has consistently said it happened toward the evening at the video store where they worked

432
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,936
Jaden have the video store job on January 13th

433
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
He started that job at the end of the month

434
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,872
So I never bought the idea that the 13th was the day she talked to Jay

435
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
But even so it didn't look good for an ion

436
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,504
Because who was calling Misha in the middle of the afternoon then

437
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
Jaden Anisha

438
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,904
So for me this call has remained one of the pillars of the case against Adnan

439
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
That's what Julie means when she says no way around it

440
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,376
But now I think that you should call might be moving from the No Way Around It this looks bad for add-on column

441
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Into

442
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,192
No I'm not too sure

443
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,800
Announces niches number was programmed into his cell phone

444
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,080
So he's always said to me

445
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,384
Maybe the button got pushed accidentally

446
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,408
Like a butt dial

447
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
And then the answering machine picked up

448
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,552
The problem with that explanation besides how convenient it sounds

449
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
Is it there was no answering machine on that line

450
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
That's what niches has a trial

451
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:02,816
This call shows up not just on the call log but on an AT&T bill he got charged for it

452
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,656
So this was our Quest or really dating Julia Quest

453
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,312
Define out is it possible this call would have shown up in an oz Bill even if it went unanswered

454
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
This proved so elusive

455
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
First we got one answered then another and another then another

456
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
AT&T was not helping us

457
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,904
Finally figured out exactly what they needed to answer this question

458
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,256
An AT&T customer service agreement Circa 1999

459
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
They found one

460
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,400
In a class action lawsuit against AT&T that included as an exhibit

461
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
The very document we need it

462
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,848
Luckily that class action lawsuit was filed in New York so Dana was able to go down to the

463
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
The old records

464
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,480
Department

465
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Supreme Court

466
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
Or something like that yeah

467
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
It look like like a Mad Hatter's

468
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Like the archive

469
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,536
Are you the first humanoid

470
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,888
The Dana goes down there pulls the service agreement takes pictures of

471
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
The contract

472
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:16,544
Send the first picture the first picture says on the contract that says we do not bill

473
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
For unanswered calls

474
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,944
The Nisha call had to have been answered

475
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
If it shows up on the bill

476
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
There was fine print to the fine print

477
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,928
And when did a flip through the contract the last page she found

478
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
A loophole

479
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
The loophole says

480
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,584
AT&T won't charge for unanswered calls

481
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,192
Unless the call isn't terminated within a quote reasonable time

482
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:49,568
So if you call someone and it rings and rings and don't hang up within a reasonable time

483
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,384
AT&T will charge you for that call

484
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
Even if it's not answered

485
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
So what is a reasonable amount of time

486
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,296
Or rather an unreasonable amount of time

487
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,672
That loophole actually still exist today and the unreasonable amount of time today

488
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,744
Is 30 seconds or longer they'll charge

489
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,096
We saw one contract from 99 that specified 60 seconds or longer

490
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,912
So it stands to reason that 2 minutes

491
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
We're probably covered

492
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
They probably did charge

493
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:25,152
The folks at AT&T told us the only reason a contract with a very back then in 99 was if the state had passport

494
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Make it there legislation to address it

495
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
We didn't find anything in the Maryland rules about it

496
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,880
So after all this work we feel pretty confident that AT&T would have charged

497
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,464
Furcal that rang and rang for more than 2 minutes in Maryland

498
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,024
In 1999

499
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,584
So either way it's if it's 2 minutes

500
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
2 seconds

501
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
It's probably unreasonable

502
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,472
It's probably time to be listening to

503
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,544
The phone rang I got to say without

504
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
Trying to figure this out

505
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
I know that's a long and perhaps

506
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Way too detailed way of explaining it

507
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,856
All this adds up to something important

508
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:11,488
It means the Nisha call could conceivably have been a butt dial but no one answered

509
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,072
It means there isn't only one explanation for the Nisha call

510
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
There alternative scenarios

511
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
It could be that a non called Misha

512
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,496
With somebody else to call Nisha

513
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,360
Or maybe or someone else call Nisha by accident

514
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
A butt dial

515
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
And no one was ever the wiser

516
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Because no one ever picked up

517
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
And if there are alternative scenarios then that means the list of things we know actually definitively know

518
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,464
Facts we can show about the evidence against Adnan

519
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
That list

520
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Just got shorter

521
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,240
The only hard evidence in the case against Adnan

522
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
Is his cell phone record for January 13th

523
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,384
That's what the cops and prosecutors used to corroborate Jay statements

524
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:06,272
Julie looked at that same record all over again the call log and the cell tower map

525
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Teased it all apart

526
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,112
To see if they could figure out what happened

527
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:15,488
To figure out if there was anything else I could know about what Jay and Adnan were doing that day

528
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,304
We talked about the call out a lot already

529
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,400
We already knew it didn't match Jays explanations of where they went and when

530
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:29,056
But when Julie left again she realized when she tried to assign the calls some semblance of a narrative

531
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
Her picture of the day crumbled even more

532
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,456
Instead of answering any of her questions the call log raise the bigger ones

533
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,528
Such as was everyone lying about that day

534
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,880
My original question going into this whole Endeavor this whole story

535
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Was

536
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
Either json or anions lying

537
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
But what if it's not either or

538
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
What if it's both

539
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
And

540
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
The college evidence is screwy right from the beginning

541
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,824
Jay said that when he had an unmet up that morning when a non drove over to Jay's to give him his car they done shopping at the mall

542
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,920
Various things but not that they went shopping

543
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,248
What seems most likely according to what an Untold his

544
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Attorney at the time

545
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
Is it an on Hangout with Jay until about

546
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
12:45 1 p.m. and then went back to

547
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
School

548
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,744
There's a 12:07 call and a1241 call

549
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,072
The first thing that our out west in Ellicott City

550
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,656
The next exit our back East for Baltimore City

551
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
They're pretty far apart from each other

552
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
Text Julie

553
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
Going to Ellicott City

554
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:38,432
And then going into Baltimore city where the phone is pinging off of like Edmondson Avenue area which

555
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Actually

556
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Assertive

557
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Near

558
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Drug strips

559
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Where his car was dumped

560
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,928
That sort of area of Baltimore

561
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
That's not mentioned

562
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Buy at 9

563
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:58,144
So I don't remember what we did I know we didn't go shopping

564
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,680
I'm not really sure

565
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
I feel

566
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
More

567
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Concerned

568
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,824
And suspicious I feel suspicious

569
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Okay have being like

570
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Huh

571
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,224
Cuz I can back where I can see where the phone was moving

572
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
I know Jay story about

573
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
Security Square Mall is not true

574
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
Because of the phone if they had the phone

575
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
But I don't think it done gif

576
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Is true either

577
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Yeah

578
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
End end

579
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
Can I also add that at

580
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,240
At one point John says to the detectives that she remembers

581
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:39,616
One of those phone calls she answered and talked to J&J it said that she was downtown with an on

582
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,224
The prosecutor at trial said we don't really know what they were doing

583
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
But it doesn't matter

584
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Because he was in school at that time alive

585
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
And that's true

586
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,976
But still the phone record tells us that there's something they're not telling us

587
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Why

588
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
And is it related to what happened later

589
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,704
The next call is the incoming 236 call the supposed Best Buy call from the phone booth

590
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,544
That were pretty solidly convinced wasn't the come and get me call

591
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
I do have something of an update there

592
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:16,992
We've not found evidence of a phone booth outside the Best Buy on the sidewalk like Jade rosin is Matt for the cops

593
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
Anecdotal reports

594
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,624
That there was a payphone inside the best

595
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,952
We haven't been able to verify these reports but

596
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,560
We did get a look at the 1994 architectural plans for that Best Buy

597
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,192
The plants are the teeny little rectangle on the left as you walk in

598
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Labeled

599
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Payphone

600
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
So maybe there was one

601
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Inside

602
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
The call log

603
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,248
Julie spent a long time thinking about the 321 call it opened a whole new mystery for her

604
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,576
Because it's confusing on about three different levels

605
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
It's an outgoing call from a non cell

606
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
To Jen's house phone

607
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,048
Jay and Jen both talked about some call that afternoon that comes into her landline

608
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,608
Someone supposedly Looking for Jay

609
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,192
Jen said she remembers Jake getting phone calls while he's at our house

610
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,752
Jay says he remembers getting phone calls

611
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
While at the house

612
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Both of them also reference

613
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
A landline

614
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,944
Jay says I get a call on the landline and that's when I leave

615
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:23,552
Meaning write this incoming landline call is Adnan calling in

616
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Looking for Jay

617
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,976
Why would it not be calling you on the landline the whole point of him giving you the cell phone was so that he could call you on the cell phone

618
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
It doesn't make any sense

619
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
But there is a 321

620
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Call

621
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Made from the cell phone

622
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
To Jen's house

623
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
Here's the second confusing thing

624
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,616
Jay eventually told the cops the 321 call was a call he made

625
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Did Jen

626
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
Asking if she knew whether this guy Patrick was around

627
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
Jay was looking for weed from Patrick

628
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,112
Jen by the way testified this never would have happened that Jay would never call her asking about Patrick

629
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
But anyway

630
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
And here's the third thing

631
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
The confusing kicker

632
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,304
Both Jay and Jen also say Jay was at Jen's house

633
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,376
Until about 3:45 p.m. that day

634
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
That also has always confused me

635
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
AJ is still at Jen's house until 3:45

636
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
How is he calling John's house at

637
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
321

638
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
Why would he be calling the house that is

639
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Sitting in

640
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
Unless Adnan has

641
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
Unless a dozen

642
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
MSU doesn't have

643
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,112
I'm not saying who has the phone right now

644
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
The founder

645
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
But it leads me to believe that there is a possibility that Jay doesn't have it

646
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Phone

647
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,840
So what's the evidence that Jay does have the phone

648
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:45,728
Jen tells the police that she saw Jay with the phone that afternoon she's an image of the cell phone in her mind

649
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
Sitting on the coffee table at her house

650
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,152
At 3:21 the tower that spanked isn't the one that covers Jen's house

651
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
If she doesn't have the phone though

652
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Then who was the phone

653
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
And more to the point if Jade doesn't have the phone

654
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,136
And what was going on that afternoon

655
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,952
Then I have no idea what was going on

656
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,816
There were discrepancies unresolved

657
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
All throughout the afternoon and evening right up until the end of the night when there's a big one

658
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,824
Beginning and he does bring it up at trial on it too long

659
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
What is odd

660
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:28,224
Jen and Jay tell different stories about where she picked him up on the night of the 13th

661
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
And about where and when they got rid of his clothes and Boots

662
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
Jen says she picked her up at Westview Mall where she saw Adnan to

663
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
That didn't happen

664
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,328
He says she picked him up at his house and he dumped his clothes that same night the 13th

665
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,424
The first time he tells that he says he threw them out in the trash at his own house

666
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,032
But Jen says she tossed his clothes and some dumpsters the next day

667
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
There would have been a terrible ice storm happening but maybe

668
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
Different stories

669
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,248
Unreconciled

670
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
And they actually assertive

671
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
Both kind of digging on it

672
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Yeah I know it to it

673
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
And I

674
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
Somebody's wrong

675
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
And I

676
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,048
Don't believe it's an oversight

677
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,376
But I cannot work my head around

678
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
What is the

679
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,264
What is the lie that is minimizing what

680
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Right

681
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,128
What's the utility of which liability of which lies yeah

682
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:33,760
You can fly that same question what's the utility of which lie to this entire case

683
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
There's so much that is murky

684
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
All you can do at a certain point

685
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,112
Speculate

686
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
And believe me we have

687
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
Angelina I speculate about all sorts of things

688
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Like crazy we speculate

689
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
Rest assured that in the privacy of our office

690
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,912
We turned over every possibility no matter how remote

691
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,752
99% of what we speculate I cannot report

692
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Because

693
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
But we can't back it up speculation

694
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,640
But here's one I can tell you if recently discussed

695
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,712
We loop-de-loop all the way back to motive

696
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,064
I know I dismissed the mode of the state supplied way back in episode 2

697
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,136
But we put it back on the table just to see where it took us

698
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
Here we got

699
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,232
We've always said Anan was over The breakup

700
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,512
11 a month already

701
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
I just for argument's sake let's say he wasn't over it

702
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,912
Inanna hey broken up and gotten back together a few times

703
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,008
Break up in mid-December maybe a non-sexual change your mind again

704
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:32,640
They're still friendly several people said to me they couldn't tell or didn't even know that had another broken up

705
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,968
Or said and I was still referring to her as his girlfriend

706
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,528
Or said he told them he thought they get back together

707
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,344
Don said he never quite knew what the deal was between them

708
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,000
But judging from his diary by January her romantic feelings are completely absorbed by Don

709
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
Remember the first date is January 1st

710
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
But maybe a non didn't feel the full force

711
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:57,216
How she moved on until they got back to school after Christmas break

712
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Richard Dana realized recently

713
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,336
That first week of school in 99

714
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,688
Anon was absent two out of four days and then Friday was a snow day

715
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,760
So maybe he doesn't get it that he's really lost

716
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
Until that first or second week back at

717
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
School

718
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
Christina

719
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,696
Maybe that's when reality sets in for him and maybe that's when

720
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
Yeah maybe that's when the

721
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
The emotion synonym

722
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,584
And so does kind of lose it

723
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
And so maybe he doesn't lose it

724
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
But who else does this

725
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,776
Hayes Ordnance friends whom I spoke to

726
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
Says they saw it like this

727
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Set the time

728
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,664
I don't even speculate now that they're adults that maybe it could have been like this

729
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
So who are we to put this Theory forward

730
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,856
This is a very obvious problem with speculation especially of the emotional variety

731
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
You can't prove it

732
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
So you have to drop it

733
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
So where does this leave us

734
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:02,496
There's no point in trying to come up with a most likely scenario for what happened to hey

735
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,056
Because you could pause it a hundred scenarios

736
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
And so what

737
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
Arrest of more facts that are facts

738
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,968
Even the soberest most likely scenario

739
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,272
Holds no more water than the most hare-brained

740
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
An equation of a nonce case

741
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
All speculation is equally speculative

742
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
Most likely

743
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,488
How about most logical

744
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,864
Dana has always been very logical about a Nas case she's the mr. Spock of our staff

745
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Herzing is

746
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,192
Let's say you didn't do it

747
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
But if you didn't do it

748
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,800
And my God that guy is ridiculously unlucky

749
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Imma let her lay it out

750
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Nonna's always sad

751
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,176
It was his idea to loan Jay the car

752
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Because

753
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
He wanted dad to go get Stephanie

754
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
A birthday present right

755
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,624
So that's pretty crappy lot that you loaned this guy who ends up

756
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,208
Pointing finger at you for the murder that you loaned him your car

757
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
And cell phone the day that your ex girlfriend goes with

758
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,632
The next thing is that it seems pretty clear to me

759
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,192
They did not have to pay for a ride after

760
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
High School

761
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
Because

762
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
We've got

763
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
At least two of

764
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
Their friends saying they overheard him ask

765
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Four rides okay

766
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,736
Did not himself tell the cop that died he asked

767
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
Center for a ride

768
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,832
And in his first interview with the detective

769
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
She says to them

770
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Anon plan

771
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
Was he getting his car by telling her that

772
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
His car was broken down and asking

773
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Perfect ride

774
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:37,216
When's the next the next piece of bad luck is the Nisha call I mean even if the Nisha call could

775
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Potentially be a butt dial

776
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,360
It's still a possibility

777
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:48,480
That sucks for you that your phone butt dialed a girl that only you

778
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
No one would call

779
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
On this day that your ex-girlfriend goes missing that you happen to loan your car and your phone out to the guy who end up pointing the finger at you

780
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
That sucks

781
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
And then the last thing that I think really sucks

782
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,608
For him if he's innocent

783
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
Is

784
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,728
Jstory and the cell phone records

785
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
Matchup

786
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,080
From about 6 to about 8

787
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,432
Which is when Jay is saying that you are burying the body

788
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
And

789
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,272
That's the time of the day when you just have no memory

790
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Of where you are

791
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
And you have your dad saying you were at the mosque

792
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
And maybe Bilal your your

793
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
You're useless eater

794
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Panera test

795
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,864
You never testified at the trial with testifies in Grand Prairie

796
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,888
After Dark

797
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
At the mosque

798
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,008
But you would not you don't really remember where you were that evening

799
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,848
And that Blank Spot in your memory

800
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:52,480
That's the that's the window of time when J story actually does seem to be corroborated by the cell phone records

801
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,648
Seem to be corroborated yes but J statement only roughly matches the leakin park calls and 8 calls

802
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
Really roughly

803
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,744
The geography matches but not the timing

804
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
But I take your point

805
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
So I guess

806
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
I guess

807
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,680
It just it in order to make him completely innocent of this

808
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:17,568
You just have to thank God that is like you had so many terrible coincidences that day there were so many

809
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
You had such

810
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
Padlock

811
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
That day is not on

812
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
A lot of people sent this way

813
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,600
I've heard from people who say just so quickly

814
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,136
Is Tony guilty

815
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Newsflash people lie in murder cases

816
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
On the witness stand what to do

817
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,888
Did we just spend a year applying excessive scrutiny to a perfectly ordinary case

818
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:47,520
Call Jim training back up he's the former homicide detective we hired to review the investigation

819
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,848
Unremarkable

820
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,503
We took a magnifying glass to any murder case would we find similar questions similar whole similar inconsistent

821
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,903
He said most cases sure they have some ambiguity

822
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
But overall they're fairly clear

823
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
This one is a mess

824
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
She said

825
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
The holes are bigger than they should be

826
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,631
Review cases lawyers

827
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
The forensic psychologist

828
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
They told us the same thing

829
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
This case is a mess

830
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,039
Rabbit holding in our office

831
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:36,159
Back out in the world those lawyers from the University of Virginia law school Innocence Project Clinic

832
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,231
I've been coming up with their own most logical explanation

833
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,279
But you couldn't be more different from Dana's

834
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,423
I haven't reported anything about it up to now but over the weekend there was a development of sorts so now I can tell you

835
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,263
Deirdre Enright and her students have a motion in the works

836
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
To test the DNA from anons case that wasn't tested

837
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
The swabs from his body

838
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,735
The material from under her fingernails the hair is found on her body

839
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,319
Emotion like this you have to give a viable reason to test the

840
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,647
The stuff you have to show how it could potentially exculpate you

841
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
And deirdre's reason is

842
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,999
She thinks the DNA might not some other guy

843
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,887
The other guy started way back when date and I went down to Charlottesville last February

844
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Mario one of her students

845
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
Start looking online for

846
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031
Possible signs of a serial killer basically

847
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:29,663
I already told him about another strangling of young woman who was also found in the Baltimore Park different Park

848
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
Thing led to another and It Came Upon yet another case

849
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Cold Case

850
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
I stumbled Upon a

851
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
A website

852
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
That

853
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,671
Categorize all the unsolved murders in

854
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,487
In Baltimore County and she was there

855
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,607
I know your computer's not open now.

856
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Anneliese

857
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Young Circle

858
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,471
I believe she was also Korean

859
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,567
227 when she was killed strangled in her apartment

860
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
In Owings Mills

861
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,687
Tucson on December 13th 1999

862
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
Exactly 11 months after he disappeared

863
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,551
I can see why Mario was interested

864
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,599
So is that your get so will you look into that now

865
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
Absolutely

866
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,719
Slater I got a message to call Deirdre

867
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,999
Huge news

868
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,863
Deirdre Enright Sarah

869
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:29,311
Huge news in this is attorney huge not necessarily reporter huge but anyway

870
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:35,711
The news was that she spoken to someone in the Baltimore County Police Department to ask about this unsolved case of

871
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,479
Anneliese Lee

872
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,319
So I'm going to tell you quickly because I have to get on the call at 2:30 okay

873
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,159
But so I called Sergeant something

874
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,791
Sergeant something told her that they now had a suspect for this Owings Mills case from 15 years ago

875
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,607
They tested similar DNA and a match came back

876
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:56,703
Tube this other guy who done other crimes mostly burglaries

877
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
These at my guy was in prison a lot

878
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,663
And he said he had a really tiny window of being out and about and he was very active while he was out and about

879
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
And so

880
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
He said

881
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,319
During that time that he was out we linked him to to rape

882
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,599
Anna murder

883
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
Animoto

884
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:20,511
And all of them appeared to be burglary but he always have sex with people

885
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
And he said

886
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,863
That he got out and became active

887
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,447
14 months his release date is January 1

888
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
99

889
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
Oh my God

890
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Right

891
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,103
So what's his name

892
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,687
He wouldn't tell me his name out loud

893
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:42,527
But I'm already accidentally referred to him as Ronald

894
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,319
And did he bury his victims

895
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:49,695
I didn't he was like he I think he felt like he was telling me too much already

896
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,535
Deirdre later learn this guy's name was Ronald Lee Moore

897
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,095
Ronald Morris dead now he killed himself

898
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,655
But it seems like he committed lots of crimes

899
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,775
He been in prison in Baltimore for a while on assault and burglary convictions

900
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
According to a Baltimore Sun article in 2007 he was supposed to get transferred to a different jail in Anne Arundel County

901
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
So you can be prosecuted for a different crime

902
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,063
But the Baltimore officials released him by accident

903
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,391
He was arrested about a month later in Louisiana

904
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
Burglary

905
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,487
I figured out who he was and that he was wanted back in Maryland

906
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,607
This is the guy the Baltimore County cops linked through DNA

907
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,167
To the death of Anneliese in Owings Mills

908
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,799
And this is the guy that Deirdre and her gang are naming in their motion to test the DNA from a nonce case

909
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,151
It's a long shot that they'll be anything testable in those samples

910
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,735
And it's a long shot that if there is it'll match anyone but hey

911
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,063
And most long shot of all that if it does match someone else

912
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
That someone else happens to be Ronald Lee Moore

913
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,511
As I have several times she always shoots right back

914
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
What makes more sense

915
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:02,143
That little 17 year old never been in trouble with the law Adnan kill someone

916
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:07,775
Or that Ronald more rapist and murderer who got out of prison 13 days before he disappeared

917
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
But he killed someone

918
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
Right I know I say

919
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407
What about Jay

920
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
He knew where his car was

921
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
He had to be involved

922
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
How does that account for J

923
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
Big picture Sarah

924
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
Take picture

925
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,791
Meanwhile Adnan post-conviction petition is still alive in the Maryland Court of special Appeals

926
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:35,423
His attorney Justin Brown is working on a way to bring the issue of the Asia Alibi before the court again

927
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
I spoke to Asia recently

928
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,359
She told me she stand by her memories of seeing an on that January afternoon in the public library

929
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
And she stands by her affidavit

930
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,735
Post-conviction purposes

931
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,551
Asia's Alibi is still a big deal

932
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,367
It sure would seem to point ineffective assistance of counsel

933
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:01,279
It's funny though knowing what we now know about the state's garble timeline and that he was maybe still alive at 2:45 or 2

934
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
3 p.m.

935
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,631
Aces Library Alibi doesn't pack the same punch for me

936
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
As it once did

937
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,287
Deirdre and Justin Brown have been giving it done conflicting advice lately about how best to

938
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Proceed

939
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
What to push for and when

940
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,967
But on Saturday is for the go-ahead to file the motion to test DNA

941
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
It was an emotional decision for him

942
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,087
Anything about my case I want to know it

943
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,487
I don't want anyone to be able to say what you do want to know so boom we went and found out I want to know

944
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,327
And I wanted you to

945
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,119
But I'm the one that asked for this

946
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,423
You guys had it sitting for 16 years

947
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,959
You never tested it

948
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
It's impossible

949
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
You guys never tested it

950
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
I want to see what it says

951
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,479
Just nothing about my case and I'm afraid of

952
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
Back to a non question

953
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
Do I have an ending

954
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,423
I was just thinking about everything I said I'm pretty sure she probably has people telling her like look

955
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
You know you know this

956
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,359
You're going to try to find out

957
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,175
I don't think you'll ever have 100%

958
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:27,295
Or you not inside any type of certainty about the only person in the whole world you can have that

959
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,599
And I mean for what it's worth whoever did it

960
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,391
And I will never have that I don't

961
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:39,839
Anon told me all I wanted was to take the narrative back from the prosecution just as an exercise

962
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,655
People could see his case without makeup on

963
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
Look at it in the eye up close

964
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
And make your own judgment

965
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
He told me

966
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,359
I don't think I should weigh in the middle

967
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,623
Just go down the middle that you know

968
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,695
Already but I check these things out and do things

969
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
These are the things that look bad against us

970
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,071
The things that you noticed a cousin really have an answer for

971
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,655
You can even go point-for-point

972
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,983
Lssu leave it up to the volume

973
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,871
Appreciate announce blessing to take a powder I'm not going to

974
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,199
Janus right to be skeptical

975
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,759
What are the chances one guy got so unlucky

976
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,575
But everything lined up against him just so

977
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,903
Because yes there's a police file full of information

978
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
Circumstantial information

979
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,071
Let's put another file next to that one side by side

980
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:48,959
In that second file let's put all the other evidence we have linking and onto the actual crime

981
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,239
The actual killing

982
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
What do we have

983
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,847
What do we know not what we think we know

984
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,871
What do we know

985
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,455
If a college does not back up Jay story

986
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,527
Phoenicia call is no longer set in stone

987
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Don't think about it

988
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,391
All we're left with is

989
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,183
Jay knew where the car was

990
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
That's it

991
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
And that all by itself

992
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
This is not a story

993
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,375
It's a beginning but it's not a story it's not enough

994
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,215
To me to send anyone to prison for life nevermind a seventeen-year-old kid

995
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,543
Because you mean the state of Maryland

996
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,103
Based on the information we have before us

997
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,919
Don't believe any of us can say what really happened to her

998
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
As a juror I vote to acquit Adnan Syed

999
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
I have to acquit

1000
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,135
Even if in my heart of hearts I think Adnan killed Hae

1001
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
I still have to acquit

1002
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,719
That's what the law requires of jurors

1003
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
I'm not a juror

1004
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,887
So just as a human being walking down the street next week what do I think

1005
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,727
Do you want me to swear that Adnan Syed is innocent

1006
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,751
I couldn't do it

1007
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
I nursed out

1008
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,591
I don't like that but I do

1009
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,407
I mean most of the time I think he didn't do it

1010
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,735
Four big reasons like the utter lack of evidence

1011
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
But also small reasons

1012
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,415
Things he said to me just off-the-cuff for moments when he's crying on the phone and tried to stifle it so I wouldn't hear

1013
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,951
I just a bear fact

1014
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,279
Why on Earth would a guilty man agree to let me do this story

1015
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
Unless he was cocky to the point of delusion

1016
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
I used to think that one has friends told me

1017
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:27,519
I can't say for sure if he's innocent but the guy I knew there's no way he could have done this

1018
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
I still think that was a cop out

1019
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:35,199
Way to avoid asking yourself uncomfortable disloyal disheartening questions

1020
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
But I think I'm there now too

1021
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,319
And not for lack of asking myself those hard questions

1022
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,135
But because as much as I want to be sure

1023
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
I'm not

1024
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,559
First told me about Adnan case

1025
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,399
Certainty one way or the other seems so attainable

1026
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,959
We just needed to get the right documents

1027
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,287
Spend enough time talk to the right people find us a lullaby

1028
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,639
And then I did find Asia and she was real and she remembered and we all thought

1029
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
How hard could this possibly be

1030
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
We just have to keep going

1031
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
And now I'm more than a year later

1032
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:14,111
I feel like shaking Everyone by the shoulders like an aggravated cop

1033
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,927
Don't tell me it's a nice guy

1034
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
Don't tell me Jay was scared

1035
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,047
Don't tell me you might have made some 5 Second phone call

1036
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
Just tell me the facts ma'am

1037
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
Cuz we didn't have them 15 years ago

1038
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
We still don't have them now

1039
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:49,183
