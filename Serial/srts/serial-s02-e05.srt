Immediately saw that there is no way I'm getting out of that cage

14
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Previously

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,352
I'm cereal this is a metal cage or wood cage or what

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
Made for what purpose

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
For keeping me

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
And I

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
New Wok

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,640

Very scary how kind of bad animals andronis 24 hour light

Making buzz buzz buzz

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,400
Unforgettable impunity is jumping into my head

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,448
I'm going to take a video of you

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:18,336
You need to think about what you're going to say

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,992
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told me

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
In very early July of 2009 just a few days after but went missing

30
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,072
A woman named Kim Harrison winter local police department in Portland Oregon

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
And I had to go to the microphone

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
Because I don't have it

33
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
A person out in front

34
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
It's pretty big Police Department I think it's part of it

35
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Excuse me can I

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
Talk to somebody I need to report a missing person

37
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Hamsa

38
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,016
Yeah it me at the time I know this is they're going to think I'm insane

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,112
I feel what you're saying is I'm reporting a missing person out of

40
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
Mest Afghanistan

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,232
Well I didn't really want to say that right off the bat because I knew I wouldn't get

42
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
The person missing was Bo

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Of course

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Person missing from a place roughly seven thousand miles away

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,472
Who is this person and I said well as sub soldier in the

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,080
Can't. He's a military personnel why would you do that full it's complicated

47
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
So complicated

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Here's what happened

49
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
Kim is a close friend of bows

50
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
They're like family to each other

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
He's friends with her kids

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,392
Full list of Kim in Army forms as a person to notify if something happened to him

53
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,024
June 30th 2009 Army officials came to Kim's house to tell her he was missing

54
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
Kim is not a person to sit by

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
That is not her nature

56
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
That first day she thinks

57
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
How can I fix this

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
What can I do who can I call

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
And then she thinks

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Interpol

61
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
The friend who happens to be high up at Interpol

62
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
The international police force

63
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
She calls him and he says maybe our pole can help

64
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
Turn on Military non-political

65
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
They have Cooperative agreements

66
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,136
The police and more than 180 countries including Pakistan

67
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
They've been helping investigate the Mumbai terror attack

68
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:15,328
But it happened about seven months earlier which meant they've been looking into Taliban activity in India and Pakistan

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,168
Interpol can actually move around in Pakistan in ways the US military cannot

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
So

71
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Interpol

72
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Worth a shot

73
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,640
To get an investigation underway for bow Interpol would need to issue something called a yellow notice

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,760
Interpol's version of a missing-person report that gets distributed to police departments all over the world

75
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,392
To get that going out you need to establish the situation as Official Police business

76
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Somewhere

77
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,000
Anywhere apparently which is why Kim ends up at the Portland PD

78
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
She needs them.

79
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
To file a missing-person report

80
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,656
Interpol intern can generate the yellow notice about bow

81
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
And they do they make a report

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Kim sends Interpol photographs of Bones and stuff

83
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Is fingerprints on it

84
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
DNA samples

85
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,200
The best thing she had for that was a Halloween mask you warned they all went as Alice in Wonderland characters

86
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
What was the Cheshire Cat

87
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
So she sent the Cheshire Cat mask

88
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
The Interpol

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,416
Is all ready to go the last thing they need before Interpol can issue the yellow notice

90
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Is permission

91
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
From

92
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
The Department of Defense

93
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
How to say can we do this really have to get permission because he was a military personnel

94
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
And they denied permission instantly

95
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
Kim has notes she took from that time and in them it says the dod denied the yellow notice 12 hours after it was requested

96
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,247
A certain Colonel calls her and tells her the dod was working in concert with the FBI and the CIA

97
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,623
And that Interpol involvement could complicate jeopardize And Delay the investigation in the search

98
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
And PS

99
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
It was quote in her best interest to not get involved

100
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
Point is

101
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Who's annoying

102
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
They were just like incredulous that I was

103
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
Just causing so much problem for them

104
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
I mean that's why they saw it

105
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
I might display

106
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
Squeaking nagging

107
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
Hino not behaving female

108
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
She keeps going

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Women

110
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
Later that same day but Sunday Kim calls the colonel bag

111
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Somehow gets his home number

112
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
And he reiterates

113
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,207
He does not foresee the yellow notice going forward

114
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
Congressman Chico

115
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,839
Call the senator maybe they can pressure the military to change the decision

116
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
No dice

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
That was that

118
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,751
The question Kim is left with to this day

119
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,335
Is what is the dod headset to Interpol yes

120
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Go ahead

121
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Creative work

122
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
Possibly gotten home sooner

123
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
When I heard the story the question I was left with was

124
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
What the heck

125
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,647
Chili Kim huffing it to the Portland PD is not the way this is supposed to work

126
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
So how is this

127
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Bus to work

128
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,071
That's a bunch of people who worked on behalf of the military to get Bo home

129
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
Some on the record someone background

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
And they all talked about how much of a doozy this one was

131
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Otherwise just know handbook

132
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
You had a US prisoner of war

133
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
There's being held in the friendly nation of Pakistan

134
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
By the designated terrorist group of the haqqani

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,503
On behalf of the lawful combatants

136
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Like the Taliban

137
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
It's not like there was a Cadre of people inside the United States government who had experience on how to untie this

138
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Killer not nobody had done this before

139
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
How do you how do you manipulate an entire country

140
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
Together

141
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
An enlisted Soldier home

142
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
How do you do that

143
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,079
You don't

144
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,943
Of course it wasn't a military operation that finally got Bo home

145
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
It was diplomacy

146
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,575
We negotiated with the Taliban and traded him for five minute of gitmo

147
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,671
And that in itself is a fascinating story and we'll get into all that

148
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
But for this episode

149
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
I'm going to lay out the twisty-turny and often emotional pass that came before the president sign off on that trade

150
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,959
Because before the most powerful person in the United States to call the buzz fade

151
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,055
Use my hands of well-meaning people much much lower down the chain

152
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
Or not in that chain at all

153
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Because that's where the search for Bo lived

154
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
4 years

155
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,551
The same day but walks away the dust one goes into effect

156
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
For about a month and a half

157
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,463
There's this intense no-holds-barred military and intelligence effort inside

158
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,815
All this equipment hundreds of people redirected to search for bow

159
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,655
The nerve center for all that activity was back in the States

160
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
In Tampa Florida

161
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,751
That's where us Central Command is headquartered

162
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
Going to centcom

163
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,639
Centcom has a group of people whose whole job is to find missing or captured people

164
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
Guarantee are not public relations but Personnel recovery

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
I talked to two people who worked in the pr office at that time

166
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Intel analyst

167
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,439
And they might search for anyone who's been reported missing from a conflict Zone

168
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,255
Not just US military personnel and not just America

169
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
Could be a contractor someone working for an NGO

170
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Hiker foreign Nationals

171
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Recorders

172
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,239
Imagine their office as a super high-tech workspace

173
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Like the way NASA looks in the movies

174
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
It's not that sexy

175
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,407
It's definitely not sexy

176
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
That's Andrea not her real name

177
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
And she'll

178
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Also not heard

179
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
They told me the office is

180
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Cubicles

181
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Computers

182
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Telephones

183
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
International did not want to talk

184
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Specifically about Bose case

185
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Since its ongoing in military

186
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
What they told me applies to his

187
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
And two lots of other cases they work

188
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
Also these women didn't want to use their real names

189
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
Because anything bro related is so sensitive so hot

190
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
They worried they might suffer repercussions

191
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
Personally if the public knew they tried to bring boho

192
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,479
Anyway their job didn't stop when the dust one was called off

193
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
They kept going

194
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Until it was over

195
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
5 years later

196
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
Again Andrew Michelle can't talk about the poor

197
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Particulars of bows

198
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
But they were pretty candid about what made their job especially tricky

199
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
I said there were a bunch of fact

200
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,423
First of all at that time Andrea and then Michelle we're kind of it for Afghanistan

201
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
In terms of personnel recovery

202
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
DOD had a good system for recovering downed pilots in Afghan

203
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,919
But other than that there was no solid system in place to track people who went missing

204
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
Cassandra

205
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
They should have had two people

206
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Or more sitting there in Afghanistan

207
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Waiting to just support

208
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Personnel recovery events

209
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,303
But instead everyone in the theater where dual had it or triple how did you know they had different jobs

210
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
And so when an event occurred they'd

211
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,911
You know they could help but they certainly weren't

212
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Experts

213
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,519
And when that differed from say operations in Iraq and relax

214
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,359
What was the how do you compare laxatives what was in place

215
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
In Afghanistan versus what was in place in Iraq and 4 / Saturday

216
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,807
Iraq had a personal recovery division setup and they had upwards of

217
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,671
15 people sitting in the same room with the only job full-time job of

218
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,047
Is my only wish that we could have had something like that and I've got a

219
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
We ask for many many times

220
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
That's Michelle

221
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
I can't even begin to

222
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Describe the

223
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,847
Leading of establishing a cell like that over there that would have helped us immensely

224
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,455
Many more people had gone missing from Iraq than from Afghanistan

225
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
So it made sense Rock was much better equipped for these events

226
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,879
But still with that man is that a certain point mashona and realized

227
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
We can't do this job from Tampa

228
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,535
I started rotating in and out of Afghanistan usually for months at a time

229
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,887
So they can manage their cases from the ground

230
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
When someone goes missing

231
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,775
PR team turns on every intelligence asset they can those assets

232
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
People

233
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
Human Torch

234
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,895
Are human intelligence or sigint signals intelligence

235
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
Communication to pick up from cell phones are like

236
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
Electronic messages or geoint geospatial-intelligence

237
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Images of a landscape

238
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
And their job ideally is to layer all this Intel

239
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
To get the clearest picture they possibly can of where the person is

240
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
And then if you can get that far

241
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Hand that information off

242
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
To the people who can actually do something about it

243
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
Either militarily can we send in Special Forces for instance

244
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,823
Can we engineer an escape of some kind or drone strike to set the hostage free

245
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,199
Or diplomatically can we get our ambassador and whatever country to try to negotiate for a hostage

246
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Orb

247
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
A civilian

248
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,855
Remember when Bill Clinton went to North Korea in 2009 got those reporters at a prison there

249
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Bose case

250
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,719
All of that work all of those potential Avenues

251
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
We're stymied by the defining fact

252
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
Geographical situation

253
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
News in Pakistan

254
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
In Afghanistan

255
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
.

256
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Which Andrea Michelle Harper

257
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
DOD owns the battlespace

258
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,871
Meaning they have control they have authority to direct operations and use whatever assets they need

259
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
That's why the dust one for both could be as far-reaching and aggressive as

260
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
Once you no longer own the battle

261
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,159
You have to start relying much more on other US government agencies that might be operating a package

262
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
Pretty much any three-letter agency that has a Personnel recovery

263
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
NGA DIA

264
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
CIA FBI NSA

265
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
It's a CIA that has Authority for us operations in package

266
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
So you really need the CIA

267
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Now it becomes a more

268
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
We're doing a lot more ask

269
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
For help

270
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
The priorities

271
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
Are all the other things that are happening inside of that country

272
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,879
Less important than this thing that we need right now

273
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Or are you jumped

274
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,719
Trump for instance by current event

275
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
That often have

276
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Current events

277
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Politics on the ground and whatever country

278
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
Get in the way of your PR mission

279
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
During Bose case

280
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
We had some very rough patches in a relationship

281
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Pakistan

282
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
2011

283
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
One former counterterrorism analyst told us quotes

284
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,199
You couldn't possibly have a busier backdrop and in Pakistan

285
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,111
That you're started with the Raymond Davis debacle number that one was bizarre

286
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
Davis was a CIA contractor who open fire on two guys riding a motorbike in the middle of a crowded intersection in the hor

287
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,631
Several people were dead by the end of it caused a huge uproar in Pakistan he was thrown in jail

288
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Then you have the US LED NATO air strikes on the afghanistan-pakistan border that killed 28 Pakistani soldiers

289
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Economy is based in Pakistan attacked our Embassy in Kabul and NATO headquarters 16 people

290
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,807
And that same here the us raid in about a bad that killed Osama Bin Laden

291
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
Yeah you really can't go to the table and start talking about

292
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Maybe humanitarian releases

293
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
On the tail end of

294
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,071
You know you don't lateral operation into a Sovereign Nation

295
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Not the best time to ask for help

296
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,215
Those friends and family were also agitating on their own

297
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,359
And it's certain points their unofficial efforts became intertwined with official search business in Curious ways

298
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
In ways that actually approach success

299
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
Camphor campylobacter

300
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Weekend

301
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
Kim lived in Idaho when I was a teenager

302
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,159
He spent years hanging around with her family and they were sort of home base for Beaufort long stretches

303
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
It stay with them work at

304
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
The tea Shoppe they ran

305
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,071
Kim is the audit out who actually loves teenagers and she loves Bo

306
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
She understood worried about him

307
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
She do anything

308
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
For I'm just as you would for own kids

309
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,287
Pretty early on in the search for bochum was shut out by the military

310
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
Scheming

311
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Calling people she studied Maps

312
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
How can I get into Afghanistan

313
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Audriana Paxton I get my bag.

314
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
Password like I really felt like I'll go

315
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
Like I'm going to go over there and talk to you PacSun please I'm going to

316
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,743
Do you work with peace organizations I'm going to go over there and try and go on the television

317
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Stupid

318
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Naive

319
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
I don't know what I'm thinking

320
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
This point there's got to be something

321
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
How hard you get with the like I'm going to go to pek

322
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,031
Cancel my passport

323
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
For my own safety I'm canceling your path

324
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
It wasn't a Sinister move by the government or anything like that just

325
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Someone concerned about her safety

326
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Who's parents were also active

327
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Throughout trying to figure out what they could do

328
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
They decided not to speak to me on tape for this story

329
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
And an aside here I read nothing into that decision apart from their best intentions for their own family and for others

330
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Hostages still in caps

331
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959
Maven completely gracious to me throughout this process

332
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
And I'm grateful to them for

333
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Anniversary

334
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,383
Perhaps things like what I'm about to tell you about Kim or happening to both parents

335
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
I just don't know for sure

336
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,063
Anyway Kim says in November of 2009 she did something

337
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
Which I can't talk about

338
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
Which sort of paid off

339
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,071
In one way and that was a got my name and telephone number to someone very obscure in Afghanistan

340
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
And he

341
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Turned out to be someone that worked with the Taliban

342
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
About 6 weeks later Kim is at home in Portland and her cell phone rings weird number she doesn't answer

343
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
But didn't understand

344
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
A single syllable of it

345
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
And voicemail on my iPhone

346
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Spell he didn't leave a message

347
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
I left a message in the third call I picked up

348
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
I thought I was on my phone

349
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Weird sir

350
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,655
Wrong number you know Direct Mail you know

351
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
I did pick up

352
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,055
M&T speaking in past due is very obscene

353
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,127
I was not able to understand except for he said

354
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
So

355
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
That's where I went

356
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,295
You know this is what is going on

357
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
And my room was Adam like this

358
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,927
Person you know

359
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,255
Making faces at him as a missing to pass my

360
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
What do I do so

361
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,983
I told him and I said email email you know and he's going to email email

362
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Okay

363
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
So he hangs up

364
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
I hang up I go online I try to find ways of pronouncing

365
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Like phonetically

366
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Letters

367
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
Write for my email like how I say

368
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
Kim blah blah blah

369
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:34,207
Where he'll get that butt

370
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,023
He called back like 10 minutes later

371
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
And

372
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,119
I'm trying to give him my email address with an ax

373
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
He's over at like 3 or 4 times

374
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
And if it worked

375
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
I had no

376
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Hope

377
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Hang up

378
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
30 seconds later playing I can email

379
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
It's not a single letter of

380
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Of

381
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
Are letter forms except for booked all

382
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
The rest is in

383
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
So she cuts and pastes the message into one of those online translator sites to decipher

384
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
And what did it say complete gibberish the translation was like horrible

385
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,311
Happy happy celebrate Victory now

386
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,431
Hello haha Bridge

387
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Tomorrow Bergdahl

388
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
That's not what it actually said just a friend stands

389
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Understood the gist

390
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
This guy had information about bow

391
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
And he wanted something in return

392
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
So I decide I will I cannot help you I will find someone right now I will make phone calls I will find some

393
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Very simple English

394
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Soon

395
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Can calls a friend

396
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
What should I do

397
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
A friend tells her

398
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Uni the FBI

399
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,359
She contacts the FBI and eventually the FBI translates the message

400
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
He was proposing a deal

401
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
And the deal was

402
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Tube chair

403
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
When heat when he had access to where

404
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,879
The locations were for where by would go

405
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
And where he was at any given time yet access

406
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,351
So he said I can give you information we're both going to be so that you guys can go get them in exchange

407
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,959
And I want out of the country I want how many family and how many eighths family members

408
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
It sounds too good to be true right

409
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
But incredibly this guy checked out

410
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,407
Kim can't say how the guy was connected to both situation

411
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
Or what proof he provided

412
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,807
But apparently he checked out to the extent that the FBI began exchanging emails with

413
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,879
They would do threaten copy

414
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Vaguely tell me what it meant

415
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,071
I had stress them copy and paste it in my email and send it from my email address I'm like my computer

416
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,607
And not

417
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:53,471
Different location because of their guarantee he's watching my at the end and he would know with somebody else

418
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
So you are basically

419
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,079
The FBI at this point is communicating with

420
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,431
The sky through you very clear that

421
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
I have to

422
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,295
Get the emails if I'm not getting emails and he's going to stop

423
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
So

424
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,183
Horse meat you know what lol I was willing to do whatever I'm sure I'm here on this is just

425
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
At least

426
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,047
He knew he was also communicating with the government

427
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,911
When she got that first call Bo had been a prisoner with the Taliban for about 6 months

428
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
He's going through the worst winter of his whole five years

429
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
He was the coldest

430
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
The sickest hungry

431
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
Of course Kim didn't know any of that

432
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
But she was hopeful

433
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Maybe this could spare him

434
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
The best scenario

435
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,623
They'll give him location of flying and Superman up and take him home you know

436
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
And

437
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
That would be great

438
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
Announcer what happened

439
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
Kim doesn't entirely know

440
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,863
Because your communication with the FBI was a one-way proposition

441
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
Thermometer to her was

442
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
Need to know

443
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
For good reason

444
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
All Kim does know is that for two years running

445
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,359
She signed releases so that the NSA could monitor

446
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Phone or computer TV

447
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
Good follower if they wanted or hang out in front of her house

448
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
And then after that two years was up

449
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Nothing

450
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,599
So just kind of fizzled away

451
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
After a while

452
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
From my perspective

453
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
I found out what happened

454
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
The FBI cultivated this source for a while

455
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
And then passed him along to the Department of Defense

456
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
And it turned out this guy

457
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,192
Call Kim on her cell phone one day

458
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,496
Because of some secret thing she did

459
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
On her own

460
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
To get her number to the Taliban

461
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
This turned out to be one of the best leads they ever had in Bo's case

462
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
One person tasked with finding bow told me quote

463
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
I thought for sure that was the answer on quote

464
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
But they could never quite make it happen

465
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
The guy wanted to bring his relatives over

466
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,488
And if you bring nine people to the US under some version of Witness Protection

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,304
What government agency is going to have to take care of them

468
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
For their whole lives

469
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,168
And my source told me none of the agencies raise their hand

470
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,752
Even so Visa papers started to be drawn up just in case

471
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
And then the guy withdrew

472
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,616
You didn't respond when asked for details about his family member

473
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
The paperwork

474
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,224
Over the years when they go back to the drawing board it.

475
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Trying to think up solutions for finding Bo

476
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
Someone would always write this guy on the list

477
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
What about him

478
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
He was willing once

479
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
You still there still active

480
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Trying again

481
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
But no one Pursuit at

482
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
When Intel expert

483
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
If you have all the tools you need

484
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
You can find someone in less than 30 days

485
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,080
So you can rescue them in 30 days but you can at least find them

486
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
Abo's case. He did not have all the toys

487
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,528
Was never able to say with 100% certainty where Bo was

488
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,392
The US didn't have reliable human intelligence sources on the ground in waziristan

489
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
Connie's have that area lockdown so tightly

490
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,280
And you're so good at propagating misinformation

491
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,120
That they either couldn't get in till or couldn't trust what until they did get

492
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
How to figure out Bose exact location

493
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Which neighborhood

494
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
Which compound

495
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
They need it for instance

496
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
Drones

497
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
And the drones have to be what's called unblinking

498
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
You can't look away

499
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
He doesn't have

500
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,040
Drones operating in Pakistan so you have to ask other agencies to take a look for you

501
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
Such as the CIA

502
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
And occasionally they would

503
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
They might give them a few hours here there

504
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
It wasn't nearly enough

505
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,352
Because unless Sabo happens to get escorted to the Train on that day at that time you're not going to see him

506
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
You need to watch and listen

507
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
Solidly for say a week

508
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,288
The catch was going in and out what they're saying maybe you follow one of those people

509
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
In other words of the drugs give you a much better chance of

510
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Pinpointing his location

511
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,224
And with the location you can at least plan a Rescue Bots

512
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,064
One former DOD employee told me quote

513
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
It was literally two years

514
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
Of asking for drones and quote

515
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,096
CIA declined to talk to us for the story they referred us to the dod

516
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
What was going on

517
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,960
CIA or the NSA or other agencies

518
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
They have their own boss

519
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
Their own priorities

520
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,360
These parties aren't General and a cereal there specific

521
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
They're written down they must be approved by the president

522
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
For the CIA their priorities were things like

523
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
Targeting top Al-Qaeda and haqqani members

524
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
Well Hast recovery might have been on the list on their radar

525
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
It certainly wasn't at the top

526
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,000
Umberto's specifically wasn't on anybody's

527
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
It's understandable that the CIA can't just turn over their resources and manpower to a PR mission that isn't there

528
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,032
In some instances these other agencies were doing the best I could under the circumstances

529
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,944
This tension is shot through all of these hostage cases

530
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Are we doing enough

531
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
The answer to that depends in part on where you're sitting

532
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,416
If your Andrea Michelle this is all you think about all day

533
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
Getting your hostages

534
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
What else can we do

535
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
They said they had to fight

536
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Complacency

537
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Malaise

538
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
Because their priority wasn't everyone's

539
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,936
Even if on paper it was supposed

540
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
Michelle said they'd have to get Wiley sometimes

541
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
Just to get the meeting today

542
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,360
Specific

543
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
General

544
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,200
In his exact and I've been talking back and forth

545
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,760
I don't know if I can get

546
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,672
Really good friends with she worked with

547
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,888
We have sorry lost out there and she needs time with his General and can make that happen

548
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,288
Cuz she calls me she's like I think I can get that done for you but he really likes Johnnie Walker Black Label

549
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
If you can

550
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:54,688
Maybe but not on his desk maybe throw in some beef jerky

551
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
I think we can make that happen

552
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
Things like that you're like unbelievable

553
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,184
Just to get in front of someone to talk about significant

554
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Personnel recovery event

555
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
I'm sure I'm sure

556
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,520
They do the most basic things just to remind people that yes

557
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
There are American hostages

558
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Is in Syria

559
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
Ernest and Pakistan

560
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
They put up posters

561
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
Make a rubber bracelet

562
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
Chris Michelle

563
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
Adrian I'd gone to a

564
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:35,136
Is Veterans Day or poww Mi a day but we

565
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
She'd made

566
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Shirts

567
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Or us

568
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
To this event

569
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
We're walking in and

570
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
A colonel stop doesn't

571
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
What the hell is that on your shirt

572
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,872
This is Bernthal and he's been missing for about that

573
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
Are you kidding education

574
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,272
Bulletin I can't believe that story

575
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
It's it's insane and it's

576
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
You're the one that breaks my heart is Coleman

577
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,976
She gave birth in captivity why are we not talking about

578
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
That's Andrea

579
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
Caitlan Coleman and her husband Joshua Boyle

580
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
Disappeared in Afghanistan in 2012

581
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
Kaitlyn was pregnant at the

582
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,496
You just made spit makes my heart hurt

583
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
And

584
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
You asked

585
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,896
The America the average American on the street who she is no no no

586
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
I just want to talk for a second

587
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:37,856
About this very human thing that overlays again not just bows case but all these hostage

588
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
Pittcon Rutherford

589
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
He's a young guy in Canadian

590
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,768
He was freed from the Taliban last week

591
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
After more than 5 years

592
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,376
You've been traveling in Afghanistan when he went missing

593
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:55,520
And the day he was released the Canadian press covered it not the details of how and why just the fact of his

594
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
Return

595
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,872
Any online comments immediately or things like this

596
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Who goes on vacation to Afghanistan

597
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,808
Boneheads or this headline should read idiot rescued who cares about the

598
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:14,464
I'm tempted to be all sanctimonious and say that's awful how can people be so awful

599
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,536
Truth is I thought things like this

600
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,352
I mean it's great there home but you know also

601
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,424
Throne damn fault I admit it

602
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,216
And I'll wager we've all thought things

603
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,384
It's not unconflicted which makes us no different than a lot of the people charged with finding

604
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Caitlan Coleman arc on Rutherford or Bowe Bergdahl

605
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
The only difference is

606
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,160
Those people are not supposed to think like that circumstances of capture are not supposed to come into play

607
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,584
Adrienne Michelle told me repeatedly they really do not care about circumstances of capture first you get the person

608
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
Max and then come consequences judgement punishment

609
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Not the other way around

610
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
Because there isn't a hostage situation out there

611
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,336
It doesn't involve some aspect of wrong place wrong time

612
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
Some element of human error

613
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
The surprise of their job was

614
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
Their colleagues didn't always feel the same way

615
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
I think the biggest shock for me was

616
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,576
The salesmanship

617
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,904
I didn't realize that I was going to have to

618
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Convince them

619
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
That supporting

620
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,584
My mission was something that they should do

621
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
I just I didn't think that that would be an issue

622
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Hand wipes

623
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
When you're standing before your peers

624
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
In addressing

625
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
The meeting and 1st

626
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,432
And foremost you have to get over the misconceptions

627
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
Circumstances of capture

628
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,528
And this Rings true to a lot of

629
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
If you know you hear this

630
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
The comet

631
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:49,184
He's just a journalist you should have been there anyways why should we help them

632
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
Ro they were just hiking

633
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
Why would they be hiking there they can hike

634
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
In Colorado

635
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,888
Even that the kid that walked off base

636
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
Yeah I can't even begin to

637
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,776
Tell you the amount of times that we heard

638
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Why should I care

639
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,944
For she did this or this is

640
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Bose case of course

641
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,768
So why should I care attitude was

642
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Doubled

643
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Maybe even cubed

644
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,376
Are the information that he walked off on his own

645
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
For the hardship you put other soldiers through

646
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
Are the rumors of treachery

647
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,056
Lieutenant Colonel Jason a Marino retired

648
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
Also worked on post

649
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
You know if you ask

650
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
People about Bergdahl

651
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
If they were

652
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,528
Completely uninformed it was so that's the traitor

653
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
If there's someone

654
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Informed it would be

655
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
Oh that guy yeah I heard it was a pressure

656
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:58,560
And if they're a little better informed it would be well people say this but I hear he was a traitor I mean

657
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,912
The refrain was was almost always that the guy is a traitor even know

658
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,192
Actually wasn't

659
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,216
Eddie Albert

660
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
The trader

661
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
So that attitude

662
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
Was everywhere up and down the chain of command

663
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,224
Jason said he was once in a meeting with a general and they had to cut it short

664
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,808
Because a general got so worked up about the fact that Bo had walked off

665
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
The general was emotional about it Jason said

666
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,208
It's not that people refuse to help or refuse to do their jobs

667
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,024
Everyone I talk to who is involved in both cases

668
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
Said so many people tried so hard on this

669
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
It's just that you start to wonder

670
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,448
If his attitude is lurking all the way to the

671
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
The top

672
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Then what ideas are not getting through

673
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
What's not even getting

674
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Opposed

675
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,384
Because someone Lowdown fear saying something unpopular

676
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
Several people told me that for quite a while

677
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:55,136
Bose case languished because no one working on it was influential enough to make big decisions

678
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:59,488
Who are you who are you

679
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,048
Well I

680
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
I am an intelligence analyst

681
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
I have been

682
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
1999

683
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
Is it a person to call Nathan

684
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
That is not his real name

685
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:18,944
You don't want to use his real name because although he's no longer in the military you still working for the military sometimes

686
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736
And what he did in Bose case

687
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
Was so out of school so not done

688
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,112
Are you worried about the consequences for his current job

689
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,696
Nathan did not work directly on Bose case not officially

690
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
He was very close to it

691
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
Watching from the sidelines

692
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,608
Watching all these people not be able to accomplish much of anything

693
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
4 times along the way where

694
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
Various plans

695
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Options

696
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
2

697
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
Get him freed

698
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
But nobody could

699
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
Position or at least

700
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
But they could they didn't

701
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,040
Again we're not talking about why Nathan got so personally frustrated

702
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
But know that he did

703
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,160
Especially when it came to what officials were saying to both parents

704
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Bob and Jani Bergdahl

705
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
This whole telling them every day or

706
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
I once a week or once a month

707
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
We're doing everything that we can

708
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Right

709
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
That's not enough

710
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
You need to do more you need to be doing

711
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
What it is you can't

712
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
The only way to make that happen

713
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,568
Nathan's estimation with push the topic up

714
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,640
Higher than the captains and Majors were working on Bose case

715
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
I needed to go as high as it could go

716
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,784
Until it reach someone who could afford to expend political capital on Bo

717
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
Meaning ultimately the president himself had to get involved

718
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
So Nathan start thinking about

719
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
How do you catch the president's attention

720
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
He did what an Intel analyst does

721
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
He thought what assets haven't we tapped

722
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
And it came to him

723
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
The berghoff

724
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,704
He thought he could get both parents to push the buttons

725
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
Maybe Bo's case could get unstuck

726
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
About a year-and-a-half into the case

727
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,128
Nathan sent a message to the bergdahl's on Facebook

728
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
He said to them the things that nobody else seemed to want to say

729
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,016
Like what were the bun things you could say that

730
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Refinish it bad

731
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
You know that

732
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
I'd listen to

733
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
It's not as

734
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
This is difficult

735
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
And here's why

736
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,840
Nobody wanted to they want to tiptoe around

737
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
Nathan said contacting them was the

738
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
The scariest thing he'd baby ever done

739
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Because he wasn't a high of guy

740
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
Wasn't even his job to look for

741
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,360
And well it wasn't illegal he wasn't telling them anything classified

742
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Contacting them

743
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
Was so on

744
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
Professional in the world

745
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
She comes from

746
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
It's

747
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
You don't want to get personal info

748
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
Typically with an analyst

749
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
You definitely want to keep your personal feelings out of it

750
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,184
You start injecting bias in there

751
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
Starts becoming a problem

752
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
In most cases

753
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
This was definitely a case though that's

754
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
You needed to be personal

755
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
You needed to

756
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
There needs to be a face on

757
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
The bird dolls where the sad

758
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,128
Scared Fierce determined parents of a p o w

759
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
Nathan says he made it plain to them

760
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,480
You have more power than you know

761
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
People will take meetings

762
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
People will return your calls

763
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
At least give you 5 minutes

764
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:11,488
Bob was no slouch he knew how to use his 5 minutes he'd studied the conundrum of his son circumstances

765
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:17,888
Begin to learn Pashto poured over Islamic law read about pashtun tradition to see if there was some loophole he

766
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,448
Can find some argument he can make for bows release

767
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,520
He understood the history and the politics of the region

768
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,592
And he was already knocking on doors and asking questions

769
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,152
Nathan tried to leverage that

770
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,224
Why don't you go talk to somebody to join Chiefs

771
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
And I'm in bed

772
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
Weather going to tell you no

773
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
So

774
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
He he would and he eventually

775
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
Eventually

776
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:52,448
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is the principal military advisor to the Secretary of Defense and to the Press

777
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:58,848
President who didn't have 25 media companies writing an open letter urging action by the secretary

778
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:05,248
State that sometimes happens for foreign correspondents he didn't have Ransom insurance as employees of private companies

779
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,624
His parents weren't switch DC players there are people who lived in rural Idaho

780
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
Bose case wasn't going anywhere

781
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,584
They needed someone heavy to think Bo was were thinking about and then they needed that person to give it a push

782
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
So that was the plan

783
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
Apply pressure in Myriad ways

784
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:29,056
Make it so that people with influence just happened to start hearing about Bowe Bergdahl from various sources

785
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Get them to perk up taking interest

786
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,176
And then that way inch closer and closer to the present

787
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
Nathan began talking to the bird dogs regularly

788
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,576
Maybe monthly maybe weekly depending on what was going on

789
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
E-Sword guiding them

790
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,720
You know that person or that group or that commander who says he's doing everything he can

791
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Well

792
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
He could be doing this

793
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,352
And were they then going back to that commander and saying

794
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,936
What if what if you tried apps have you done that

795
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Yes

796
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
There was a manipulation

797
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
Indian going on

798
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
That's what makes this bird gif

799
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Were you telling them here's what you need to

800
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
Yeah

801
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688
Your face looks worried when you

802
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,992
You say that responded I am quite worried

803
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,528
New York

804
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
It's just messy

805
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Just message

806
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,648
A question might be

807
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,000
Is the United States could pay blood money to get the CIA contractor Raymond Davis

808
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
Out of a Pakistani jail

809
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
They maybe do something similar for Bo

810
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,912
Some sort of Ransom issue payment that isn't Ransom

811
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
I'm making that up but that seems like a good question right

812
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,312
I feel like you're kind of running this

813
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,968
I don't know Scrappy 2nd and secrets

814
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,344
Mission almost that's like a she was like the shadow of the thing that's happening at the office

815
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Yes we're running support

816
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
Right-wing supporter totally unofficial

817
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
Totally unofficial

818
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Nathan said

819
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
It worked

820
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
I can't be specific about how it worked

821
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
What is it work

822
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
Bob's Rolodex filled up

823
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
With people at the Pentagon and also the White House and

824
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
State Department

825
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,872
And Nathan believes the continued pressure created a sense of urgency about those case

826
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,688
And got it on the desks of the people they were aiming for

827
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
It was another part of the strategy

828
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
G2

829
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
To make noise

830
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Sometimes public

831
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
In a way they hoped would keep those safe

832
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
When the ubl raid

833
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464
Osama Bin Laden raid happy

834
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
That threw everything up

835
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
And I would

836
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
What's going to happen

837
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,864
Is there going to be retaliatory

838
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
It's on

839
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,960
Sergeant Bergdahl they going to take him out in the street

840
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Luke Walton

841
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
You want to do that then here's this

842
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,360
Nobody knew what was going to happen

843
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,920
That's about the time that Bob put out that video

844
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
I'm father of capture

845
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
US soldier

846
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
Robert Burke

847
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
These are my thoughts

848
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
I can remain silent no longer

849
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
May of 2011

850
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
Just a few days after the bin Laden raid

851
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
Bob released a video on YouTube

852
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
Futurist Melissa Holguin and haqqani is

853
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
What is main message was straight

854
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
The Pakistani government

855
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,984
Address the Pakistani Armed Forces

856
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
I personally appeal

857
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
General kayani

858
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
General Pasha

859
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
Our family is counting on your professional integrity

860
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
And honor

861
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
Secure the safe return of our sun

862
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,624
Pasha was commander of Pakistan's intelligence service

863
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Psoriasis

864
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
Kayani was the Pakistan Army chief of staff

865
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
We are

866
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Fat urination

867
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
Diligently help

868
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Our son

869
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
Be freed from his captivity

870
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,728
There's another striking thing about this video

871
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
And that is

872
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
Bob is asking something of Pakistan

873
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
So directly

874
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,128
American officials would not

875
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Are Soldiers there

876
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
We know they know he's there

877
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,272
Somewhere in What's called the fata

878
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,320
Federally administered tribal areas

879
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:57,952
And all this time the US is setting aside billions of dollars in Aid and Military Support to Pakistan

880
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:05,120
According to a recent Congressional report between 2002 and 2014 we gave him roughly Thirty billion dollars Ulta

881
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Big money

882
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
Get we don't seem to be able to say

883
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
Hey Pakistan

884
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
Give them back

885
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Why is that

886
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
Well again lots of experts later

887
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Now I see why

888
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,200
Diplomacy isn't a snap your fingers kind of business

889
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
It's a long game

890
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,064
And in the long run would like to stay on decent terms with Pakistan

891
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
For some important reasons

892
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:32,000
Pakistan have nuclear weapons which would really like them to keep a lid on it also like to keep our air and ground supply lines

893
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
Open in Pakistan

894
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:39,680
Get stuff for people in Afghanistan Pakistan Al Qaeda leaders and somehow

895
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:46,080
Continue many influential people in our government would also like our drones to keep flying and some

896
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:51,968
Killing people inside Pakistan as well and we've got long-term development goals are to

897
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:58,368
We'd like to keep helping pakistanis with education and clean water maybe because we're just nice like that but more like

898
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,768
Likely because we want to keep them on our side because of Pakistan goes away of say Iran becomes our enemy

899
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
Plus those nuclear weapons

900
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,376
That's the scenario would very much like to avoid

901
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,496
So when we might risk our relationship with Pakistan in order to take out Osama bin Laden

902
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,056
We're not going to jeopardize it not to that degree

903
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,592
41 US servicemen

904
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,920
We are not going to come out publicly and boss Pakistan around

905
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
If if we could do that

906
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,504
Or call their leaders a bunch of liars

907
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,904
Ambassador Marc Grossman who is the state Department's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan

908
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,744
Meetings with high-level Pakistani government officials

909
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
But he didn't expect them to do much

910
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,096
He said expectations are low

911
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,912
But you do it because it's right and you never know what's going to happen

912
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,008
And he said if you say to the bird dolls and to the public

913
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
We're doing everything we can

914
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,360
Then you better be doing everything you can

915
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
2012-2013

916
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,551
Couple of army generals decided to do something

917
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
Separately

918
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:05,183
One of the generals realized the PRT Matt centcom was willfully understaffed

919
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
Wasn't getting anywhere

920
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,767
You signed an elite unit to the task

921
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
A Delta Force

922
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Big deal

923
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Which helped

924
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,215
Leaving so the pr team never got the until it hoped for

925
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
And then another Jenner

926
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Soon-to-be 4-star also got involved

927
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
General Bob Bergdahl also met with

928
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,735
Around January of 2013 were briefing General Campbell

929
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,295
On our different projects

930
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
At the end of the Brave

931
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
General Campbell

932
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,695
Said you know hey this is all great I want you to know that

933
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,351
My top priority is getting Sergeant Bergdahl home so if there's anything you guys can do to help out at appreciate

934
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
Attended the meeting

935
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,935
That's Jason a marine again

936
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,519
He recently retired from the Army after 27 years

937
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,359
Jason is one of the most celebrated soldiers of the Afghanistan war

938
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
He was there in 2001

939
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:02,015
Commanding a special forces team that fought alongside Hamid Karzai in southern Afghanistan

940
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
The army of a Man action figure out of them

941
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,415
Jason is as close as you could get to putting GI Joe on the Bergdahl case

942
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:14,047
His Stellar career nearly unraveled last year in connection with his work on hostage recovery

943
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327
Which maybe you heard about

944
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,911
Last year he testified before Congress about among other things

945
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,959
The dysfunction in US hostage policy

946
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,567
Back in January 2013 Jason was leading a team of strategist

947
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
The Pentagon

948
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,175
That was supposed to find solutions to some of the Army's biggest problems

949
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,039
This group work for General John Campbell who was in charge of operations and plans for the Army

950
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,599
My producer David Chavez interview Json

951
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
General Campbell just seemed

952
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Almost

953
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,511
Haunted by the fact that

954
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:49,119
That we had gotten Bergdahl home it was just the way he said it to us

955
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,447
That this wasn't just idle banter it was really

956
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
If there's anything you could do

957
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,079
You know more emotional than than a tactical sword

958
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,943
Yeah absolutely with General Campbell it was a heartfelt

959
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
Do you know how do we get him home

960
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
That struck me

961
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
And after the meeting

962
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
I grabbed a couple of my planners

963
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
And

964
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Yeah I said to him

965
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,607
It seems like something is really f***** up here

966
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
Man. That was just the feeling that I had

967
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,543
Jason and his team decided to do an audit of Bose case

968
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,359
Who was doing what all those years why I hadn't work

969
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,943
What they found is that the effort seems to be moving along to track

970
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
Socom was trying to put together plans

971
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,087
So, Special Operations Command which runs elite units

972
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Think Delta Force or Navy Seals

973
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,463
And then Jason said they could see that the state department was on it

974
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
Trying to work with Qatar

975
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
Trying to get the Taliban to the negotiating

976
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
Table

977
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:57,215
A meeting seed had with FBI and others Jason learned but wasn't the only one being held hostage by the haqqanis

978
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,543
There's Caitlan Coleman and Josh Boyle and their child

979
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
And there were others also nearby

980
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,943
Warren Weinstein was being held by Al-Qaeda he was subsequently killed in a drone strike

981
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:13,855
Knowing about all these others shook Jason pretty hard I was in uniform for 27 years

982
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,927
Yeah for me the notion of not leaving a soldier behind

983
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,231
Do you know that you internalize that

984
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,023
And for me it was just always

985
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,863
A false assumption that America doesn't leave Americans behind

986
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,655
I I've never been

987
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
Put in such a ridiculous position before

988
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,311
Wait through these Americans that nobody gives a f*** about

989
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,871
Nobody is doing anything to get them home

990
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,247
Are greater bureaucracy is treating their families

991
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,831
Horribly while telling the families to just shut up and wait

992
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
I mean

993
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:51,487
Tamia it was bordering on criminal how we're treating our common citizens

994
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,071
Jason's Mission had been to try to figure out how to get bow back

995
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,119
Now he added another mission

996
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,655
Why not try for more Hosta

997
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
So Jason's team comes up with a couple of alternative

998
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,615
He start shopping around one idea in particular and gets pretty far with it

999
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
But then

1000
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:15,295
He can't tell who exactly is in charge of a new headset, that is soon so calm had it yet so

1001
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:19,135
Dokkan that assumed the state department had it and months later

1002
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:24,767
I after a lot of meeting so I finally figure out that the state department assume that the military had

1003
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:30,143
Wow it was this big lupus and come to friend is so come so come to front of the state department

1004
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,983
And the state department really just referring to DOD

1005
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:40,383
But there wasn't anybody there asking the question Steven figure out that it was that big of a mass

1006
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,199
Jason took the problem to a congressman

1007
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:47,551
Which rather surprisingly led to Jason being investigated by the army

1008
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
Country that was all dropped

1009
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,647
The congressman representative Duncan Hunter

1010
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,951
A veteran of both the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars

1011
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,023
Proposed legislation to try to fix hostage policy

1012
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,631
Other people have spoken to in government say Jason's assessment Leeson bows case

1013
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Wasn't quite Act

1014
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,775
That the various agencies were more aware of each other's plans and Jason gave them credit for

1015
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,895
But still everyone I talked to agreed with Jason that our system for dealing with us

1016
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,175
Just wasn't great

1017
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,991
Cooperation between agencies with Shaggy

1018
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
Policies were sometimes

1019
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,319
Inconsistent people weren't on the same page

1020
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,159
It was especially clear after reporter James Foley was killed

1021
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,695
Gruesomely and publicly

1022
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Syria

1023
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
A couple of months after Bill came home

1024
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:33,887
December of 2014 President Obama ordered a review of how the US deals with

1025
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
She says

1026
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,983
And six months later he announced an update and hostage policy

1027
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,031
Saying that he'd met with the families

1028
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,127
Acknowledge to them in private what I want to say publicly

1029
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,759
But it is true that there have been times where are government regardless of Good Intentions as let them down

1030
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
I promised them that we can do better

1031
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
When I first started looking into this question of what did we do to get bow back frankly I didn't think it would be all that difficult

1032
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
To answer

1033
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,679
Silly me baby but still at least I thought the answer would be linear

1034
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,983
The chain of events would reveal itself

1035
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
One link leading to another attached to another

1036
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,639
Instead I found a bunch of people whose stories were all pretty different

1037
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,687
Baidu central theme was the same

1038
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Frustration

1039
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
Why are we doing more who's blocking this effort why

1040
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
They describe struggling

1041
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Against

1042
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,695
Tangle of competing interests they couldn't control sometimes can't even see

1043
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,767
It sounded as if there was a scandal to uncover

1044
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,119
And maybe there was dishonesty and even malevolence in some corners

1045
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,679
But mostly I think it's because the truth is

1046
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
There's a limit

1047
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,031
There have to be limits on how much we risk how much we give up

1048
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,567
I got one person back

1049
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
For long-time balloons

1050
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Small

1051
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
But of course he wasn't worth it

1052
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,527
He was tucked in among so many other crises

1053
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
A small fire

1054
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,135
Smoldering among all these giant fires that also need to

1055
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
The time to deal with him is when he becomes something else

1056
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:07,839
Something useful way to put out a bigger fire

1057
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:13,471
Family was always against a rescue attempt

1058
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
He said he studied the afghanistan-pakistan Border in minut detail on Google Earth for 2 weeks after bow went missing

1059
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,175
Based on where he figured Bo was

1060
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:28,063
He thought a rescue in a place like miramshah even for an elite special operations unit wouldn't be viable

1061
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
Was just too dangerous

1062
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:34,207
Quote we thought it unethical to risk the lives of numerous individuals

1063
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:39,071
Especially when we knew back-channel communication was possible or even actually happening

1064
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,143
We Believe glow would agree with that ethic unquote

1065
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,263
Mark talked about not exactly this

1066
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,567
They talked about how much should have in soccer

1067
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
Device to find him

1068
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,383
And that initial dose one.

1069
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,991
Mo said in an Ideal World which he gets isn't the one the military lives in

1070
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,295
But if he could have directed the initial

1071
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
You would have made it voluntary

1072
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,415
And he would have been okay with soldiers who hadn't volunteered

1073
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,487
Because he gets that they didn't understand his true motives

1074
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,863
Right

1075
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:20,031
What's happening because from what they're looking at

1076
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,087
But what if they had known exactly why I walked

1077
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
What specifically boaz seeing

1078
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
Would it make any difference

1079
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Next time
