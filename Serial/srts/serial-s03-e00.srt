1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,096
I spent more than a year inside the criminal courthouse in Cleveland Ohio

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,912
I want to tell you quickly about this one case I watch

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,936
Early on

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
The case was set for trial

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
Was about to start

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,288
The judge

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,104
You telling the defendant that he might be wise to just

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Skip the trial

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
I plead guilty

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,456
Is risking a lot of prison time

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,480
Have you thought about

12
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,784
The judge was listing the charges

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,392
Counting all the years that defendant might be looking at if we were found guilty by a jury

14
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,952
So does it make sense

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Taurus

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024
Additional

17
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,328
28 years

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,168
In counts 1 and 2 alone

19
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,520
I believe he's charged with either three or four kidnappings is that correct

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
The numbers kept growing

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
36 years

22
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
42 years

23
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
For the kidnapping charges alone

24
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,200
Adding to the tension

25
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,016
Is that the defendant had a lawyer standing next to him

26
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
But he didn't want to use them

27
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
He wanted to represent himself

28
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
The judge was telling him

29
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,232
Awful idea you're already screwing this up

30
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,792
How prideful can you be

31
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,096
The defendant name is Greg Rucker

32
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
Was in his early twenties

33
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,192
He pleaded guilty instead of going to trial

34
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Who's going to do maybe

35
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
560 years

36
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
The judge kept Adam

37
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,408
Sure you don't want to change your mind we're about to choose the jurors

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
I thought for sure Greg Rucker would cave

39
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
It was such an onslaught

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
Priester there in his jail scrubs and Crocs

41
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
Quiet but firm

42
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
He knew what he was doing he wanted to trial

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
Besides me there was only one other person in the gallery

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
A friend of Greg's

45
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
At riding young guy named Drake

46
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
During a break he stepped out into the hallway I followed

47
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
Craigslist started appealing to him

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm very concerned

49
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
For your friend

50
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Bright

51
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
The lawyer also thought it was Madness

52
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
For Greg to go to trial

53
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
She said to drink if you have any way to talk to him

54
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
I am I tried but

55
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,320
Drake started talking about Greg's basketball game

56
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
How he digs in

57
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
Fights Back even when he's down

58
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,744
Which I could see was making the lawyer wonder whether Drake was grasping the gravity of the

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Situation

60
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,096
That Type of Way some years it's not a game

61
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Dino

62
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
But I mean

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,472
I hope that'll be smart about it

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
The lawyer said he told Greg

65
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
Look if you plead you can get out from under this case

66
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
And still be in your 20s

67
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
Set of getting out when he almost 60

68
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
It seem crazy to me

69
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
The great to get Decades of prison time

70
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Because

71
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
His alleged crime

72
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,904
Was mugging three people early one Sunday morning

73
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
At gunpoint so that's bad

74
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,000
He wasn't holding the gun

75
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Another guy was

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Co-defendant

77
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,352
Didn't use the gun no one was injured

78
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,680
But Greg was charged with seven very serious felonies

79
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Including three kidnapping

80
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
Probably not the kind you're thinking of

81
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
The kidnappings were for hindering people's freedom

82
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Wild it robbed them

83
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
Drake was sure he was in a cell

84
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
He said yes Greg had committed other crimes

85
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Before they talked about it

86
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
But this one he told drag

87
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
He wasn't there

88
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
It wasn't him

89
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
I believe for a fact you didn't do it

90
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,560
My thought was if Greg Rucker was risking that much prison time and if he was so sure

91
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Where is case that he wanted to argue it alone

92
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Without the interference of a lawyer

93
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
Either Greg Rucker was innocent

94
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
He was bonkers

95
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,992
Next day trial again Greg decided to let his lawyer represent him

96
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,112
Good idea everyone agreed the state brought out all the victims and they were Charming

97
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
A guy who only Beloved ice cream business

98
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,304
Married couple delivering Plain Dealer newspapers

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
The wife of the couple Victoria with a teacher at a Christian School

100
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,240
Her Labyrinth sweater and hair Arrangement reminded me of Holly Hobbie

101
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
She presented as wholesome

102
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
A kind

103
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
She called the man who stole her car

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,480
Stuck a gun in her husband's face who made her feel like either he or she or the both of them are about to die

105
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
She called them the white gentleman rights could have been it was white

106
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
And the black gentleman

107
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
Choose the perfect State's Witness

108
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Except

109
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,768
She couldn't identify Greg Rucker

110
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
No I did not

111
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
Her husband also couldn't identify Greg

112
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,959
Another guy who been mud by this Duo have been riding his bike when they came up on him

113
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
He can pick out Greg

114
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,567
Can I buy a hundred percent safe for sure

115
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
No one saw Greg Rucker

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Also there was no physical evidence against him

117
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,039
I know police body camera security footage of caught him on phone

118
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,391
I started to think okay what are the chances I would wander into a wrongful process

119
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Execution right off the bat

120
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
There's no way

121
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,815
On the other hand after two days of trial the state's case did seem kind of weak

122
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Maybe cracker was innocent

123
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Who's right

124
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Vista trial

125
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
The den

126
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
There was a third day

127
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
That morning the prosecution introduced jailhouse calls between Gray

128
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
His co-defendant

129
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
In these recordings

130
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,503
Great sounding

131
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Guilty

132
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
Super guilty is how he sounded

133
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
Talking about how the cops are onto them how he might avoid being identified

134
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
On top of that the co-defendant

135
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
Adobe thick tongue fell out with a superlative widow's peak

136
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,887
Testified that indeed Greg had helped him commit these robberies

137
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
Greg's one Alibi with

138
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
His former girlfriend

139
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
Did him no favors

140
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
Her testimony may not much sense at all

141
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Sono

142
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
By the end I realized

143
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Not around 4 Prosser

144
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Secretion

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Eyewitness

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Irregular process

147
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,599
And yet inside this regular prosecution

148
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,415
I seen a Litany of things that shouldn't be allowed

149
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,743
Was like a checklist of almost all the stuff reformers complain about

150
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,303
Extra charges loaded onto a case

151
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:59,423
Pressure to bleed Chevy police work a police officer possibly lying on the stand

152
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,519
11th Hour evidence shoehorned into a trial overworked attorneys

153
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Dozing jurors

154
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,895
And finally an outsized prison sentence

155
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
But no one was stomping their feet too hard about any of that

156
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
In the Cleveland Courthouse this was a nothing case

157
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
No not really watching

158
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Besides

159
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Why would anyone care

160
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
Greg was guilty

161
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
Did you listen to serial before you probably know that our first

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Season was about a murder case in Baltimore

163
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,471
Ever since that story aired people have asked me in the people I work with

164
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
What is that case tell us about the criminal justice

165
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,407
An answer is the case of Adnan Syed wasn't typical in any way

166
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
Defendant with no criminal record

167
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Private defense

168
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
Attorney where is Duvall a six-week trial

169
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
The vast majority of cases don't even go to trial

170
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,695
I don't think we can understand how the criminal justice system works

171
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
By interrogating one extraordinary case

172
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Ordinary case

173
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
This is her where we need

174
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
To luck

175
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,959
The season of Serial we do just that we take a look at the entire criminal justice system

176
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,287
A year inside the criminal courts in Cleveland Ohio

177
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,871
We chose Cleveland because they let us record everywhere

178
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Courtroom

179
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
Back hallways judge's Chambers the prosecutor's office

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,111
Then we followed those cases outside the building into neighborhoods to people's houses and in prison

181
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,695
Every case we looked into there came a time when I said

182
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Wait this can't be happening

183
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
And then it did from This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial

184
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
1 Courthouse

185
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Told week by week

186
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
You'll see what we saw
