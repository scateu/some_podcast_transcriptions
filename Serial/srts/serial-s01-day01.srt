1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
Hello serial listeners

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,816
Hurricane Ike year

3
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,376
This week I'm going to do something I haven't done before

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,960
Which is duck back into Adnan Syed case for a few days

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,776
Report on a court proceeding that's happening in Baltimore

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
If you have no idea what I'm talking about right now

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Quick

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,200
Go listen to season 1 of Serial and then come back to me in roughly

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
10 hours

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,808
What's happening this week is not a new trial is a hearing

11
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,416
It's actually a continuation of anions petition for post-conviction relief

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
That's something you try only after you've exhausted your regular Appeals

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
The last ditch effort

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
He first file that petition

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,888
How in 2010 I think

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,448
Long before I got interested in this case

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:47,104
In fact I think the very first time I talked to a nun was right when the court had ruled against him had denied this petition

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
But he appealed it

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
And that's when it started to get interesting

20
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:56,832
In Broad Strokes Adnan was arguing that his defense attorney at the time of his trial was incompetent

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392
But she made mistakes that were so bad

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,184
But he should get some form of relief

23
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,024
Maybe his conviction for killing Hae Min Lee should be overturned

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
One of those mistakes in unclaimed

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
Was that his attorney never contacted a potential Alibi Witness

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
Asia McClain

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
Remember her

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
EBay after season 1 of Serial ended some new stuff came to light including some new evidence regarding Asia McClain

29
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,504
And about problems with the crucial cell tower testimony at Adnan trial

30
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,088
And over the past year the wheels of Justice rolled

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
Slowly slowly like they do

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
And finally this week

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
The Baltimore City circuit court will hear this new evidence

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
We're here with some new Witnesses have to

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,864
To say about what happened or didn't happen

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
Adnan original trial

37
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
16 years ago

38
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
Right now it's Tuesday February 2nd 2016

39
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
The night before the hearing starts

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
Soon as I'm done recording this I'm getting in my car and driving to Baltimore and I'm going to show up at the courthouse at 8 a.m. tomorrow like they tow

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Told me to

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088
And I'm going to watch and listen and I'm going to tell you what happened

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392
That week by week but day by day

44
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm fascinated to see who exactly will testify

45
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
What they say

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,072
How old are you to have all these people back in one courtroom

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
All right

48
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,936
Now we're going to refresh your memory about the case of Adnan Syed

49
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,264
And then after that it'll magically have turned into tomorrow

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
And you'll hear me calling my producer Dana chivis

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,664
To tell her and you about day 1 of an Ontario

52
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,552
This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Adnan Syed

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,952
An inmate at a Maryland Correctional Facility

55
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
I definitely

56
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,840
I just and if someone can look at this with a all man you know he must be lying

57
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
So coincidental

58
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
What did he tell you

59
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,520
She told me that she broke his heart during extremely wrong

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,592
Anyone who treated that way

61
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,224
Why would you admit to doing something that drastic if you hadn't done it there is no way that

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
She was at Best Buy at 2:36

63
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
You getting the Charming sociopath you're just not that lucky

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Believable

65
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,032
But I think I think you might be that technicality

66
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,456
It is what it is

67
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,952
Hello

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
Hi

69
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Can you hear me okay

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
I can't hear you

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Are you recording

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,960
I am recording I am also recording here in the studio New York so let's

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Sound

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Hi

75
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Where are you

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
I'm in a hotel room

77
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
I am independent

78
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Posit

79
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
Of the hotel room like in night

80
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
Got some pillows behind my back then

81
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Either like I'm flanked by the

82
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:18,559
Two very racy bathrobes

83
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
And they're hanging on either side of me

84
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
But it's it's it's making a good little

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Sound Studio Hair

86
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,775
Like The Classy podcast host you are

87
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Everybody swellegant

88
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
So how'd it go

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
It was

90
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,599
Hi. I found it I found it fascinating I found all of it fast

91
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,207
Yeah like who were the who were the players in there today

92
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Who were the first people who testified in like

93
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Yes

94
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
So the first half of the day was

95
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Establishing

96
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Christina Gutierrez Adnan trial

97
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
Back in

98
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
In the original criminal trial

99
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Had been

100
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
Declining in a bunch of ways to physically

101
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
Professionally financially

102
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
So they were like two attorneys

103
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
Who had worked with her

104
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
In the from the mid-to-late 90

105
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
And you know 99.

106
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,095
Who testified of like how bad it got

107
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
And it did seem like it was pretty bad from there

108
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Like that she was

109
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Physical pain

110
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
She was passing off

111
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Cases to people

112
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
Cuz she was overwhelmed

113
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
In the courtroom scene

114
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
Definitely not

115
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
How she had been which is Kai

116
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Legendary

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
You know sought-after

118
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Very success

119
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Defense attorney

120
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
And that she just was

121
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Like her

122
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Powers were

123
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Definitely waiting

124
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
And sort of more to the point

125
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Was

126
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
This question of

127
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Why would she not have

128
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
I've called

129
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
Why would she not have looked into Asia map

130
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Clean as a

131
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Isabel Alibi Witness

132
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Her clients right now

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
And is that

134
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Is there any

135
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Strategic reason why you would not

136
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Check into

137
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
To this person

138
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
For her for her not

139
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
To call Asia map

140
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Okay

141
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
And

142
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,791
And then you know the big witness of the day was

143
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Asia McClain

144
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
Tell me about Asia like what did what did she say what was that like

145
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
It was

146
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,591
I have to say like it was kind of it was kind of intense in the courtroom when she was

147
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
When she was testifying

148
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
You know anyways

149
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
I don't even know totally how to type but likes

150
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Cereal was a

151
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,343
Heart of her testimony so that's very strange

152
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
A little bit surreal like is this happening

153
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,999
Great Moments

154
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,399
When I the way that I first learned about the case right was just like

155
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
There's been this miscarriage of Justice like there was this

156
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,823
Key witness who is never heard from and she would have provided the perfect Alibi and

157
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
And she was never heard from and it's just like

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
You know this gross negligence

159
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
And so it all remember this like this is how we only have the whole thing was just like we just need to find this girl and find out what she

160
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
It will say

161
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,695
Yeah I was like she has a key to this thing over feeling like that

162
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
Yeah like this can't be that hard and then we do track her down and then it's it's not

163
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
That's simple right it's not at all. Just you

164
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
It's so much more complicated than her whatever

165
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
Just to see her so strident

166
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
In the courtroom

167
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,199
And she's pretty striking looking also she's too beautiful and yeah and she's kind of tall

168
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Very high heels on

169
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
She looked

170
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
You know very put

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Together in

172
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Bright red lipstick and

173
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
And

174
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,183
And so it was just it was like wow

175
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
There she is

176
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,791
It was just like a lot of drama in the room when she was test

177
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,887
Testifying by the what was the thing she was saying that was

178
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Called English drama

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
I think because there had been so much

180
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Talk about

181
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
And about what she

182
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
Might have said would have said

183
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,991
You know parsing everything she said parsing her letters parsing her affidavit

184
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
Parsing the stuff that she said to me

185
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
And then to just hear her say these

186
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Things that sounded

187
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
But very straight

188
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Forward

189
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Which were what

190
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,351
Which are kind of a resting like I don't know she was just saying like

191
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Shih Tzu

192
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
She was very sure of herself

193
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,263
And very sure about what you remembered which is like you know this

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,079
Same thing we've been hearing right which is like I remember

195
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Yunnan

196
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,735
I was in the library that was on public library after school on January 13th 1999

197
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Starting in about

198
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
10:45 or so

199
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
I was waiting for hours for my boyfriend

200
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
Pick me up he was super late

201
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
I was super bored

202
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
As soon as school ended I remember I walked in

203
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
Send WeChat you know like this whole thing we chatted for 50

204
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
1820 minutes

205
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
Blink did it land like when she when she died

206
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
Glad she seemed very normal

207
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
You know and then she said these like very

208
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,687
Idealistic things that

209
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
I think that's probably also what

210
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,647
Met people what kind of emotional labor she said I'm trying to find it and they're just so simple the things that she said that she was

211
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Sarah Blake

212
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,767
Anons attorney Justin Brown said why did you want to testify

213
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
And she just said I felt for justice to be served

214
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
We should put all the information on the

215
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
The table I just thought it was

216
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Baidu

217
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:50,079
I was scribbling like crazy in my notebook I was like to serve the scribblings I was like just

218
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,735
Super focus on writing and so is everyone around it was exposed

219
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
In the room but

220
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
More I was trying to see what an honest face

221
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
Was doing could you see his face from where you're sitting in the back of his head or what

222
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,351
I was trying to see if he was even looking at that who is testifying and

223
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,935
You know I couldn't tell to me it seems a lot like you was just a

224
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Looking down

225
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
Looking straight in front of them like at the hospital in front of him he was very very

226
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Still

227
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
The entire

228
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
RC Willey

229
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
Yeah like barely moving like

230
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
She would shift

231
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
Occasionally but almost like he just became a stone

232
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,391
Deja today on the stands

233
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,231
Was it still was it did you find it was still is compelling what she was

234
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,327
Saying that simple things you had to say was that still has compelling to you now

235
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Today

236
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,471
Hearing her explain her letters like things in her letters that seemed a little like what does that mean

237
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,799
And so she should have went through the letters

238
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,127
So she said

239
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,735
This is this is pretty detailed but there's a part of one of her letters where she says

240
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
If you need me like maybe I can help you account for some of your

241
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
Unaccounted for time

242
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Between the hours of 2:15 and 8

243
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
APM

244
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,559
You know what she says I don't want to get here yet and that's also one of the things

245
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
In the original

246
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Eviction hearing

247
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
That judge Walsh rules

248
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Noted in his

249
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,775
Opinion where he's staying right just sounds like she's offering to lie

250
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:29,663
It sounds like she's already with my Saturday with a nod

251
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
This is a very big window of time so it what she saying like all the

252
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
And so

253
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
Anand attorney had her explain like what what do you what do you mean by that and she said oh well I had been to a nun's house

254
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
That day

255
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,839
To tell his parent to tell his family like

256
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
If you

257
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
You know what I knew

258
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
And

259
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
And they told

260
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Me he was struggling to account

261
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
For that afternoon

262
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,175
Like he couldn't really remember what happened after school between school and going

263
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
The mosque at 8 around 8 so that was the. Of time so she was saying

264
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
I can account for this little slice of it

265
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Of that.

266
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
If you need

267
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,719
It's just like she writes the letter in the first place

268
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Yeah

269
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
Sprint

270
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,959
Christina we're not interested but it just felt like I got it okay to it all seems like very straightforward and clear

271
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
Haha she came out really well for the defense

272
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,871
And we have yet to see what the state's going to do to her tomorrow like that will continue

273
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,991
You tomorrow they started and you could see like they are going to go really hard on her eye

274
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,575
Oh really

275
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,183
Because of how they even started I mean the prosecutor is tough

276
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
He's tough

277
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm not totally sure what they're what their plan is with Asia but I think

278
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
I think what they're going to try to do is

279
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
I don't either going to try

280
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,727
Credit her exactly but I think what they're going to say is

281
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,287
You think of yourself as a person with a really poor

282
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Precise memory

283
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,943
But here appear some ways in which we're going to show you that your memory is

284
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
Restasis used

285
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
I think it is and so

286
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
I'm totally speculating here

287
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
But to show that if you had gotten on the stand

288
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Back at Adnan

289
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Trial

290
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
This testimony wouldn't have worked very well

291
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
It wouldn't have changed

292
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Gett the trial

293
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Because he has a permit

294
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Here's all these ways I can

295
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Kohl's in what

296
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
You're saying

297
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
In your test

298
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
Insurgents

299
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Starting to poke holes

300
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,735
He was he wasn't starting to poke holes yet like he didn't get that far but you got late and then we stopped

301
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
But he was

302
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,063
Clearly trying to

303
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
He was he was sort of laying the foundation

304
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
For her

305
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
Do not remember stuff

306
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Oh look at the questions that she's going to have to flounder a little bit and then yeah ultimately

307
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Say something with either not satisfying or leg of Camilla X she had to say like I'm I don't remember I'm not sure

308
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
I don't remember I'm not clear I could

309
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
I could speculate if you want but I don't know I don't I'm not sure and it but and they didn't have anything

310
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
Student have they weren't directly related to

311
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Statement it was like

312
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Did you play sports

313
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,159
Yes I did I play volleyball and basketball woke did you have basketball practice that day

314
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
Think so I don't

315
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
I'm not sure I don't think so though

316
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,327
So you had basketball practice or you didn't know it was like that

317
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
But a lot of it all

318
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
Just like wow so you think they're doing this because

319
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
Do you think they're doing this

320
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
To say

321
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
You remember you're remembering a different day

322
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
I think it's possible that's where they're going but you think maybe that's

323
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
The direction they're going in

324
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,135
I think I got any Insurrection I go in if I

325
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,255
All right so you're going back to the courthouse tomorrow it's starting again 9:30 tomorrow morning

326
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
All right

327
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
So you will check

328
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
Back in with me yeah I'll call you tomorrow

329
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
All right

330
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
Bye
