00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,784
The Justice Center in Cleveland Ohio takes up a whole city block downtown

19
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,112
It's a cluster of concrete towers built in the 1970

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
I can head here but I'm just going to say it

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464
The buildings are hideous

22
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
Practice

23
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,656
Justice Center houses in one location everything at justice system needs

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:16,032
The city and county courts the county jail Prosecutor's offices Sheriff's Office

25
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
And headquarters for the Cleveland Police

26
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,432
Roughly speaking the building functions like most hierarchies

27
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,992
Vertically in this case from the bowels up

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,064
The main court tower is 26 stories high

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
To the elevator really runs the play

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,976
The persons arrested in Cleveland are coming into the Justice Center from the basement

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,304
Weary cops escort suspects from the underground parking garage

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Booked

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Apache floors to the jail

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
Once I get a court date the writing up to one of the courtroom

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,336
The lower floors are for lesser crimes less hollowed proceedings misdemeanors housing court

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
The higher floors starting about halfway up the building are felonies

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
Detectives wearing lanyards off and get off on the 9th floor for the prosecutor's office is the court stenographers

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,440
Always courteous drag their squat wheelie cases on and off the elevator

39
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,560
Navigate chat for a few floors with the officers from the sheriff's department in search of a coffee and a muffin

40
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:16,192
Defense attorneys are riding up and down all morning muttering to each other can you believe

41
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Griping about Judges

42
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
Elevators are not over hearing

43
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,616
Elevator Mainstays of course are Crime Victims

44
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
And their families

45
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
And defendant

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Their family

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Sometimes

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Those families are one in the same

49
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
I'm feeling optimistic

50
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,952
I appreciate that an elevator car and a government building is one of the few places left in our country where different kinds of people

51
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
Are forced into proximity

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
I like to think that we can all stand so close to one another

53
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216
What are sensible heels and Timberland boots and American flag lapel pins and fake eyelashes an Axe Cologne and Orthopedic insert

54
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
Teardrop tattoos in to go coffees

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
And when the elevator doors open up

56
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
Spilling us out onto our floor

57
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
The fact that no one is bloody tarieven Interiors

58
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,992
The small pleasing reminder that we're all in this together

59
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
Other times the shoulder-to-shoulder closeness only magnifies the obvious

60
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
We're not the same

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Got it all

62
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Coming up from the lobby one morning

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
Young black woman is holding a little portable speaker

64
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
The white people in the elevator give each other

65
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
I don't want to reciprocate their looks

66
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,848
Instead I decided to my duty to break the tension by saying the lamest thing I possibly can

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
To be clear that wasn't my plan

68
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
Just what came naturally to me apparently

69
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
Soundtrack for the elevator

70
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
Just even bother with it this time

71
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Now I keep my head down

72
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
The weather looks the black people are probably giving each other

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
This place is primarily black and white

74
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
The majority of the courthouse staff is black

75
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Clerks are mostly black

76
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
What's their managers are white

77
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,288
In the sheriff's department most of the sea

78
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Security guards are black

79
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Most of the deputies

80
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Are white

81
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,968
Most of the attorneys are white almost all the county judges are white and their bailiffs are white

82
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
Most of the defendants and Crime Victims

83
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Are black

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,136
In the Cocoon of the elevator everyone's polite to each other

85
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Pretends nothing is weird about this

86
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,024
But if the elevators were calibrated to detect a power imbalance in the load

87
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Like a socially-conscious clothes dryer

88
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
Baby perpetually on the fritz

89
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago it's cereal

90
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Courthouse told week by week

91
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
Entertaining

92
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,303
If you listen to serial before you probably know that our first season was about a murder case in Baltimore

93
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,399
Ever since that story aired people that's me and people I work with

94
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Question

95
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
What does this case tell us about the criminal justice system

96
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Fair question

97
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,335
And to answer I usually say

98
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
Because the answer is that cases like that one there not with filling Americas

99
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Cortland everyday

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
The defendant in that case

101
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Adnan Syed

102
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
Was charged with first-degree murder

103
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Kid never been in trouble before

104
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
His family had an expensive defense

105
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Attorney

106
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
And rarest of all his case went to trial

107
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
It lasted 6 weeks

108
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,935
None of that is typical of the vast majority of cases moving through the criminal courts in this country

109
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,775
And even if it were I don't think we can understand how the criminal justice

110
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
System works by interrogating one

111
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Extraordinary case

112
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Ordinary cases

113
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Are where we need

114
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
We need to spend at least a year

115
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:46,367
Watching ordinary criminal justice in the least exceptional most middle-of-the-road most middle of the country place we could find

116
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Cleveland

117
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,023
When I first began reporting this story I called the former US attorney there for advice

118
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Explain what I want to do

119
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
He said Cleveland's not a bad choice

120
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
And then he said

121
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Please don't be mean to Cleveland

122
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
You can be mean to the criminal justice

123
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
System but please don't be mean

124
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
To Cleveland

125
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,847
I told him I didn't plan on taking cheap shots at the mistake by the lake

126
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Because I'm a classic

127
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Recorder

128
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,735
Anyway we could have gone to lots of cities and the problems would look about the same

129
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
Minneapolis or Atlanta or Pittsburgh or Sacramento

130
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,879
Same sorts of crime same struggle for fairness

131
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
Attempts at reform

132
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,231
Who scored so it's really hard to record

133
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
You might need permission from the states

134
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Supreme Court hello Illinois

135
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
Another place is recording of any kind is Barden courtrooms

136
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
What is your

137
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Problem Pennsylvania

138
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Cleveland OH

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,055
They let our producer manual joji and me wander the courthouse

140
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
Unencumbered

141
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
With microphone

142
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
Extraordinary

143
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
We spent more than a year in the Justice Center

144
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
Following criminal cases of all sizes

145
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
Tiny ones reporters don't usually pause over

146
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,623
Like weed possession or driving under suspension

147
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Have your cases

148
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
Assault armed robbery

149
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
The most serious crime there is

150
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Aggravated murder

151
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
Every case Emmanuel and I followed

152
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
There came a point where we thought

153
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
No

154
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
This can't be how it works

155
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
I never liked

156
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Oh

157
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
Oh my God

158
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
This is how it works

159
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
This is how it happened

160
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,919
People have been through the system work in the system maybe they know what I'm talking about

161
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Millions more don't know

162
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,807
This season we're going to tell you the stories of the cases we followed

163
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
Sometimes they're going to overlap they might span two or even three episodes

164
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
You'll see what we saw

165
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
From the inside

166
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
First case we're going to talk about is small

167
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
It's a bar fight

168
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
We're starting with this one because it's a simple

169
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
It is also an example of the system work

170
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
I want to show you what that looks like in this Courthouse

171
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,871
Teva Baseline for what's considered functional Justice in Cuyahoga County

172
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
So

173
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Here we go

174
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,015
A bar fight walks into a Justice Center

175
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,743
Let me show you this video I want to get your impression of it

176
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,327
One morning last spring Russ bensing defense attorney

177
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,911
Take me to little side room off the hallway on the 20th floor of the Justice Center

178
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
You want to tell me about a case he's got

179
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
I'm calling the defendant Ana

180
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Is not her name

181
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,383
She's charged with assaulting a police officer which is a 4th degree felony

182
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
Russ's drafting me until one person focus group here

183
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,063
He wants to know whether an outsider like me will interpret the video the same way he does

184
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
I just stand in for a juror

185
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,999
Okay so just explain what we're looking at okay this is the surveillance tape of the bar this incident occurred in a bar

186
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
There she is right

187
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Lower left

188
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Corner

189
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,935
Yeah yeah long hair

190
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
Annie's White young looking small

191
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,079
She's wearing librarian glasses skinny jeans

192
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,639
Boots and a t-shirt that fits her just so

193
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
Even in this terribly granny video she's attractive

194
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
She's leaning on the corner of the bar

195
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
She is

196
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
And she somebody approaches

197
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
The Greer

198
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
And smack your ass

199
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
That what you just did

200
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,191
And I had gone out that night with her friend and some other guy to a small Corner Bar on the westside of Cleveland

201
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
When I met Anna she told me it's not the sort of place usually hangs out

202
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
It was our first time there

203
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,151
Just a little rougher people are there older people

204
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
Cheater girlfriend noticed these two women down the bar looking at them

205
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:30,367
I just noticed her and other girl like constantly staring at us but we still stay there for about an hour

206
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
And that's when

207
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
Did they talk to you right now no

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
It was why were they looking

209
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
I have no idea

210
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,119
I personally think it's because we were pretty

211
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
So I go and get a drink and

212
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,567
This guy is smack me on my rear end

213
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
And

214
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
The guy you have been talking

215
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
No just some random guy at the bar

216
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Are you serious was a random guy

217
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
I figured you knew that guy

218
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
No I did not know him

219
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Messages

220
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
Cuz men are dogs

221
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
They can be dogs

222
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
And I

223
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,327
You know at first I was like haha you know stop

224
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
And then

225
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,751
He kept doing it and I actually got mad and I you know I got in his face and in the surveillance video there's

226
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
A perfect view of all this

227
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
First one guy touches her butt and lets it go

228
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,455
But a second guy touches her but she pushes him back and playful way

229
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
Then the first guy starts in again hitting harder

230
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
Smacking her ass

231
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
3 * 4 * and it turns lips are footed M as in cut it out he stops R6

232
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Find her a police officer walks slowly onto the screen he's not seeing any of the slapping Heat

233
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:50,751
Just come from the bathroom downstairs they've been working on the Block and come in the bar to pee meanwhile back at the counter

234
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:56,127
Smack the guy has anima 7th time and it spins around to confront the ass clapper

235
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
At that point one of the women who'd been staring at Anna from down the bar stocky blond she storms over to Anna

236
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,879
Gets between her and the a slapper and immediately gets into it with Anna

237
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
This is what Russ wanted me to say

238
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Hannah was provoked

239
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
Other Woman answers

240
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
The picture frame

241
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
And they start arguing and then they go out at

242
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:21,727
It's not clear if anybody threw the first punch or what but Anika's decisively for the ladies throat

243
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
And then it's just a mess

244
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
The people around them are trying to break it up but it is not stopping she's thrashing around she could swallowed up in the crowd

245
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Bunch of people

246
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,295
Knock it to the ground where this person picture

247
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Oh my God

248
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Well

249
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Well

250
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,047
All these boozy patrons are piling in people are grabbing and has long hair and her head is getting yanked around

251
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
Countries pull to the floor

252
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
It's awful to watch

253
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
The most disturbing woman to me is when the blonde ladies friend

254
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,775
Takes off her eyeglasses places next to her beer

255
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
Readies herself by sweeping back her hair and then she doesn't just kick Anna she gives her a ferocious stomp like she

256
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Trying to kill a rat

257
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,855
And it gets back up or maybe she's dragged back up I can't even tell if she's fighting anyone in particular anymore

258
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,695
And later tells me she's got the heart of a fighter but maybe not the skills

259
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
That looks about right

260
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
Someone behind Anna's got his big arm around her neck

261
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Can I see the cop

262
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
There's a cop right there

263
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
People are still grabbing her

264
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Is flailing

265
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,895
There is where she swings

266
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
And hits

267
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
And hits the cop

268
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783
Looks like she got some on the left side of his face

269
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Then the cop who's a big dude

270
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
He's on top of her

271
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
Take her to the ground cops are

272
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
After that it's four nights in the Cleveland City Jail

273
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,815
$5,000 bond to get out in a fourth-degree felony charge

274
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
Assault on a peace officer

275
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
The video ends

276
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
So

277
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
You're on a jury you see that you can Victor

278
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
No I wouldn't convector

279
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
I mean I don't think I would

280
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,455
Just technically she connected with the cops face but to me it looked accidental

281
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,319
That is the answer was hoping for a solid not guilty for his client

282
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,927
Better yet he like a not-guilty tenants with righteous indignation which I can also provide

283
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
How does a video we just watched add up to a felony charge

284
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
A young woman tries to stop a man from hitting her ass

285
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,447
She's been verbally and possibly physically attacked by some puffed-up buttinsky from down the bar

286
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,543
End up fighting for all she's worth defending herself all 110 lb of her

287
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
Against the pack of strangers

288
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
Cop stops and she hits him from the looks of it by accident

289
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,503
The cop is not injured by the way and is the one who ended up scratched and bleeding

290
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,855
I get the bad behavior abounds in this episode and Anna's included

291
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
Felony assault

292
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
To become a spelling for this

293
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
That cannot be right

294
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Russ thinks it's not right

295
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
You think that the system got this one wrong

296
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
Transkei should not be happening at all

297
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
He tells me today his plan is to go big

298
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,775
I know that they offer me a misdemeanor assault on

299
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
In this case

300
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
But he doesn't want to settle for a misdemeanor assault on this one

301
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
He's got the surveillance tape

302
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Which way is like a closed circuit morality play

303
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,575
He feels like that alone ought to be strong enough evidence to force of course correction on the part of the state

304
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
To undo what's already been done

305
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
China's race

306
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,767
Whiteness is not really part of his calculation here but at least it doesn't work against her

307
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:31,167
After many decades in this business Russ says he's accepted to shameful truth that as a general rule and never help

308
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Abs2b black

309
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
It never hurts to be white

310
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
So today I'm going to try to see if the Stapleton

311
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Dismiss the charges

312
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Okay

313
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,919
He's going to ask the prosecutor to drop the whole thing

314
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
This is what I've come here to see

315
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
Houses adversarial system going to turn now

316
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
How's it going to play out

317
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,903
Russ gathers his stuff we leave a little conference room

318
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,023
I follow him as he goes to look for Anna he told her to be at the courthouse this morning by 9

319
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,423
Siri are you doing what's your guys doing

320
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,287
Shannon Russell Bennett Attorney for 41 years

321
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,687
He's head of the Cuyahoga criminal defense Lawyers Association that's how I met him I went to a meeting of the group and Watchtower

322
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
All these people rushed him afterwards

323
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
As if you were wearing a pin that said when your case now ask me how

324
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
It's like that all the time with Ross

325
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,695
He walks around the Justice Center and people just come out in for advice

326
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
Ping pong in the details of their cases off of them

327
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Attorney Krause in the hallway

328
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,167
So my guy was caught transporting the two kilos from Chicago to Cleveland he says

329
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Okay but he doesn't admit to being the guy that made the secret Apartments

330
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,919
Yeah yeah okay Russell say rocking a little on his heels

331
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Wearing the coins in his pants

332
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,575
Then Hillside the case while they need or the new ruling out of the 8th District I hadn't heard about

333
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
Russ has no personal secretary no law Clerk

334
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Just him

335
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
You like the action here Alexa kibitzing

336
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
I need the master of doleful TGIF Courthouse red party

337
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
Die here something about Justice

338
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
And this building

339
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
I like Russ

340
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
The colleagues like him too

341
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
Not clear whether his clients like him

342
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,615
He can sometimes be a bit of an asshole to his clients

343
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
Actually they call him all day long

344
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,015
I didn't show up at the courthouse today and is confused about where he's supposed to go

345
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Rust-Oleum

346
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
To the Justice Center

347
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
Where the court is

348
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
You've been here before

349
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
What

350
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
You don't have a warrant you don't have to get down here okay

351
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,631
What's the defense attorneys in this building R Us has some paid client

352
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
He also has a lot of assigned clients

353
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,751
People who can't afford to hire a lawyer so the court provides one

354
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
That's how they do it in Cuyahoga County

355
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
30 to 35% of indigent defendants get a public defender

356
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
The rest are assigned to private attorney

357
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Like Ross

358
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,063
Russ is the difference between how he treats his paying clients and his non-paying clients

359
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
Come down to hand holding

360
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
The actual lawyer in part is the same he says

361
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
What is bedside manner change

362
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,071
The paying customer but he might visit them in jail just to check in make sure they're doing okay

363
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
He's not doing that with an assigned client

364
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
I'm guessing a paying client

365
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
He's not talking to them like this tell you what Mike

366
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Okay

367
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
I've been doing this for 41 years I'm going to be willing to bet that I can do a better job of researching the law that

368
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
And you can't so let me take that weight off your shoulders

369
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
He hangs up

370
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
F****** believable

371
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
Anna is also in the same case

372
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
But so far she hasn't annoyed him is nice to her

373
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
He beats her up on the 20th floor

374
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
She's sitting in the waiting area under the TV

375
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
There's one on every floor

376
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Set to the Food Network

377
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Always

378
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Anna looks small and nervous

379
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,623
I'm not allowed to record their meeting that would violate attorney-client confidentiality

380
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,463
Wrestling Turtle conference room so we can explain what's happening today

381
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
Pre-trial conference

382
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
Sounds formal but it's not

383
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,423
What means is that rest will track down and his prosecutor and they'll have a quick conversation about the case

384
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
And it was going to get to be there for it

385
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
She just has to sit and wait under the TV for us to report back

386
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,663
I don't know whether Anna knows this yet but rest for sure knows it

387
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,503
Prosecutors will almost always pursue a case that involves a cop

388
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
That's the way it is

389
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
Law enforcement code

390
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
The next time I see Russ he's eating a piece of carrot cake that was on offer in a judge's Chambers

391
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
He's had his pre-trial with the prosecutor on Anna's case

392
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
I made the mark

393
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Request for dismissal

394
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,031
Meaning rest ask the prosecutor to drop the case

395
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Santana

396
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
She said

397
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,151
That was laughable and

398
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,967
Power probably be marked with a felony

399
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
Probably be tried

400
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
When she wouldn't even knock it down to a misdemeanor to a misdemeanor assault

401
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,463
What she doesn't have the power to do anything she has to take it to her supervisor

402
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Hoosier heart marker

403
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,887
Hard marker means

404
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Yeah I just like it sounds so it's not going to

405
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Reduce much

406
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
Russound matter-of-fact about this

407
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
I need a sort of

408
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,663
He's not shocked that his dismissal request was shot down

409
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
He is offended about the way it was shot down

410
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
As the day wears on and I follow rush around to his other pre-trials on other cases

411
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,719
The kid caught driving a stolen car a sex offender who violated a registration requirement

412
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
Guy nailed for having drugs and a scale in his car

413
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,375
Russ keep circling back to how the prosecutor on Anna's case

414
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Call his requests last

415
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
It couldn't shake his irritation

416
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Tell me about it

417
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
Tell other people waiting at the elevators about it

418
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
Irritated because he didn't make this dismissal request for Lowe's

419
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
He's been doing this a long time he's good at it

420
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,135
He knows how disinclined prosecutors are to drop a case

421
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
How rarely that have

422
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
You wouldn't ask for a dismissal without good reason

423
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
Protocol it laughable feels disrespected

424
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,399
Doesn't really know this prosecutor her name is Jennifer King

425
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
Is Hershey's a good lawyer but she's a little young

426
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,567
Maybe she doesn't yet understand that if you call a person's Ernest markwest laughable

427
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
Back in the professional relationship

428
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
I talked to Jennifer

429
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Burger King

430
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,783
Perhaps unsurprisingly she had a different take on why they got off to a scratchy start

431
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,391
Jennifer's been in the prosecutor's office for 3 years in the general felony unit

432
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
She's got a huge inviting smile

433
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,303
She told me Russ's request for dismissal didn't sound like much of a request to her

434
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Chillin like a stone

435
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,679
The defense attorney came to me at the first creature outside you're going to dismiss this

436
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
You didn't say will you dismiss as he said you were going to dismiss us I mean he was asking

437
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
Did he mean you guys are going to end up dismissing this like by the time I'm through with you you're going to wish you never like it was like

438
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
Or was he saying

439
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Hey can you dismiss

440
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Would you take from it

441
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
I took from it as being pretty aggressive

442
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,744
Hey I know you're going to dismiss this cuz

443
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
This cases

444
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Is crap

445
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
And

446
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,632
You all are just charging random girls

447
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
In this fight

448
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
Jennifer felt like Ross was telling her how to do her job

449
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:36,128
You know a young female prosecutor who has never worked with an older male prosecutors probably been practicing longer than I've been

450
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
Why you no comes at me and says

451
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:44,832
You're going to dismiss this case I never told her you're going to dismiss this case

452
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
Never thought I would never say that to any prosecutor I would never I am not a confrontation

453
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
Why not

454
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,776
Belabor this but rust remembered yet a different interaction in which he thought Jennifer misinterpreted him

455
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
He says he tried to fix it after that first meeting told her you didn't mean any offense by anything he said but his quads

456
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
I apology didn't go over well

457
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,552
He knows it's hard to be a female attorney in this building especially a young one

458
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
Female attorneys get short shrift he says

459
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
There's a bias against them principally among older white men I eat a lot of the criminal bar

460
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:31,424
Jennifer told me whatever her personal feelings about a defense attorney she does not going to take them out on the defendant

461
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
That does not influence my mark

462
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,312
I thought maybe Jennifer would be a little sheepish about an escape

463
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,640
But they were Prosecuting it at all much less is a felony

464
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
The Jennifer mantis case was uncomplicated

465
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
And I was facing a felony because punching a cop is a felony

466
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,648
Jennifer head watch the same bar surveillance video that Ross had

467
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
And that I had

468
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,976
She said so yeah you can see what

469
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
But what you don't have an audio

470
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
You don't hear the officer saying

471
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,400
Police break it up and she still flailing

472
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,472
She's still kicking and she punches and officer who

473
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
Trying to keep people from being harmed

474
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
Right in the face

475
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
And I mean her arm comes around so we see

476
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
Yes there's an assault there

477
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,528
Did that did that punch look deliver it to you or did it look like somebody

478
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
Kind of flailing around

479
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Try to defend

480
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,768
Somewhere in between I mean it ain't no it wasn't a dude stop straight punch to the face I see you kind of a thing but then again it wasn't just like her

481
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Arm flung back and happy

482
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
Hit him in the face

483
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
Either mean she is

484
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Aggressively

485
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:40,032
Fighting at that point and yes there's lots of people on the floor and there is another woman kicking her butt really

486
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:46,432
If she just stopped at that point nothing probably would have come of this she probably would have been charged with

487
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,832
With any sort of assault for the record Anna says she never heard the off

488
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,880
Officer say stop or Break It Up

489
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:58,720
She said she never even knew police were in the bar until someone arrested her

490
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
But that's Anna's word over cops

491
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
Jennifer will take the cops

492
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,728
Rust

493
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,288
Thinks this whole case is built on a misunderstanding

494
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
Starting from the very beginning

495
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
When a cop arrested

496
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Did Anna

497
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,224
Pointed out that the cop didn't watch the surveillance video that same night

498
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
So you must have thought Anna was the troublemaker

499
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,112
And his police report he writes that anocote initiated the fight

500
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,976
Rest of the cop didn't know Anna was being harassed by some skeevy dude in a baseball cap

501
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Didn't know the blonde lady got in Anna's face

502
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Banana got stomped while she was on the floor

503
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
The cop had known Russ said

504
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
I don't think he would have charged

505
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
I don't think anybody

506
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,800
Really knew the full story of what happened

507
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
Is that true though

508
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,176
Police wearing body cameras that night in the bar

509
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
Listen here

510
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,136
This is Anna's friend Kristen who is sitting next to her in the bar

511
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,512
Christian talk to at least three different officers that night including Sergeant Timothy Gill

512
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
The cop who got hit in the face

513
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
And she told him all the same story

514
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Same accurate

515
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:15,520
Story so then he wouldn't stop so she got pissed off like y'all chill the f*** out

516
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
And then

517
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
The other girl with guy in her face like

518
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
Jumped up right away

519
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,968
Don't talk to my friend like this and then start going at it with her

520
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
Does body camera footage is part of the evidence and Anna's case

521
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
I listen to all of it

522
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,928
I got to say it contains some gems for us as case

523
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
The officer did know what

524
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,328
And yet and it is the only one who gets in any trouble that night

525
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
Which seems extravagant Leone

526
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Unfair

527
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,728
1 points are aware of the lady who got in her face

528
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,568
They're going to file a report saying that lady assaulted at her

529
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
That doesn't have

530
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
I never even talk to that lady

531
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
She wisely hightailed it from the bar right after Anna was

532
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Detained

533
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,368
In his report Sergeant Gill will describe the other woman not as an assailant but as a quota mutual combat in

534
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,696
As for the a slapper he did stick around

535
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,536
There's this whole exchange between Kristen and Sergeant Gill where he asks her

536
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,608
With the guy look like he was smacking your friend

537
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,192
Kristen DiMera she's like I don't know and then go says

538
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
Just give me what you got

539
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Increasing cost it up

540
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,080
Jesus that's him right there in the red jacket

541
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
Jacket on outside

542
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
The guys taken outside

543
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,504
Patted down put in the back of a cruiser

544
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Anon

545
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
The police let him go

546
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
Why would they do that you ask

547
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:39,488
Well maybe because back inside the bar at the remaining Patron say oh guy in the red jacket

548
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,376
I talk to this fellow afterwards

549
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Troy

550
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
He's nice

551
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
I felt badly about what happened to Anna

552
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
We all

553
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
As as

554
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,592
You know there was about four or five people that say we never seen that

555
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Do you know

556
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
He wouldn't do something like that

557
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,688
You know him

558
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
No

559
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
But

560
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,272
He would have

561
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,112
Just stay like that so he wouldn't that's not how me want to do that

562
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,184
Troy believes this is why the a slapper was let go

563
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
Because they all voucher

564
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Okay

565
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,656
So the male cop is believing

566
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,752
For men or six men over the women who say

567
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
He slapped her ass

568
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Also

569
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
The cop himself Sergeant Gill the victim

570
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
She doesn't appear to care that much about being punch

571
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,576
Consensus from the bar patrons is of the punch was essentially an accident

572
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,160
I don't think anyone should get Hall Downtown including Ana

573
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,720
Biggest arch in gilsum sloppy pushback

574
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,768
You got to rest her seriously

575
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,072
Sergeant Gill struggles

576
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,144
In this tape Sergeant Gill is in the background saying

577
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,544
Let me make this perfectly clear nobody wants to arrest the gal

578
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:03,200
Nobody wants you arrested West 104

579
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
411

580
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,064
It's hard to hear but he says will I press charges

581
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
Do I think it's the biggest eel in the world

582
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
No I don't

583
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,744
He says the same thing to Anna who's outside the bar sitting in the back of a police cruiser

584
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Half handcuff

585
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,584
One cup of slipped off and was dancing Every Witch Way

586
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,936
His tone with her is not exactly apologetic but it is conciliatory

587
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,288
Fieldhouse sweetheart don't worry I'm not going to press charges

588
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
I'm not going to press charges it doesn't matter if you're fine

589
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,064
But I have to take you to jail because you hit a policeman but it doesn't listen to me

590
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,184
I'm not sure why Sergeant Gill is saying he's not going to press charges

591
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,792
Sergeant Gill isn't the only decide on this is the first link in a chain

592
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
Here's what's going to happen

593
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,912
A detective will come by the bar tomorrow and look at the surveillance tape

594
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
He'll see what he needs to see

595
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
Bananas are made contact with sergeant killface

596
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
And that'll be probable cause

597
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
Felony assault Ibiza

598
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
The prosecutors will take it from there

599
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,456
City prosecutor Anthony County prosecutor

600
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,552
Sergeant Gill could stop the whole thing right now as he's talking to Anna

601
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,624
He could let her out of that Cruiser Center home to bed

602
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
Instead he says this

603
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,024
Which is the most confounding sliver of audio from the whole night

604
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
Searching girl says I know you didn't mean to punch me

605
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
I understand

606
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
Accidental

607
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
You got to go

608
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,848
I'm sure it was purely accidental

609
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
Maybe he's just trying to calm her down

610
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
Regardless and it is not placated

611
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
Possible nothing could have placated or just then

612
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,624
She told me she was a little drunk and very angry sitting in the back of the

613
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Land Cruiser

614
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
Cop car

615
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,768
4 hours for no f****** reason

616
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,656
Bull shark

617
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
What's the new life primary

618
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
Analyst a slurry of invective

619
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Protest

620
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
1 hour she kept it up

621
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
After how is she not scared to talk to Cops like that

622
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,528
She said I hate to say it, white girl

623
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
You know I'm saying

624
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
Sometimes you can get away with things and you can say things

625
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Do understand what I'm saying

626
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
I didn't understand what you were saying

627
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Really

628
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
And the cops on the receiving end of this

629
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
These aren't even the cops who arrested her

630
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:41,152
Never went into the bar or anyting they happen to be on duty down the block when someone deposited and in their back seat

631
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
By the time the driver to the gesture

632
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,016
The center and Shepherd are from the garage onto the elevator

633
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
They're arguing like family

634
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Tired and familiar

635
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
We don't know we know just why am I here

636
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,256
Wendy wintersteen

637
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,096
I can't answer this

638
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,216
Define but you still have to go through this

639
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
You still have to go through this

640
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:15,968
The message to Ana from the police officers that night was we know you don't want to get on this train but too late

641
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
You're already on it

642
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
Don't worry though. For you

643
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
Eventually

644
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,464
Play Sergeant Gill said to the bar patrons after one of his rhetorical q and A's do I want to do it

645
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,000
Now I don't

646
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,560
He added she'll get her day in court

647
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,120
That's coming up

648
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
After this

649
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
This is the road to hire

650
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Brought to you by ZipRecruiter

651
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:49,248
What is the CEO of caffe Alterra

652
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,624
Stuff but cost a lot less

653
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Alter has been around since 1980

654
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:01,024
It was one of the first organic coffee companies in the United States

655
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,352
I mean the USDA certification for organic

656
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Didn't even exist

657
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:11,264
When they started it was just a handshake agreement that said we didn't use pesticides we didn't use fertilizers

658
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
How old were you in 1980

659
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,152
I wasn't even born in 1980 I was born in 1988

660
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,368
They wanted to switch it up to some trendier roasts and run the business more smoothly

661
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,696
But that still needed to hire a director of coffee

662
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,560
Someone who could buy coffee beans roast them and taste them for quality control

663
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,120
But that person was really hard to find

664
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,728
Because there's not many Roasters in the country that are on our side

665
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
There's

666
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:48,896
Probably only a few thousand individuals that would have the skills and the ability to do this

667
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
It's definitely like finding a needle in a haystack

668
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,040
Because Dylan is smart and so very modern

669
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088

In his heart of hearts

691
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,368
Rustix the real reason the prosecutor's office is pursuing this case against Anna

692
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
Is because

693
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
There was a cop involved yes

694
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
Because she's already got a record

695
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,304
No felonies but she's got some misdemeanors

696
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,144
From Florida there's a driving under suspension a DUI

697
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
And some local conviction

698
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Including a recent one

699
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Looks pretty bad

700
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,592
A case that started out as two felony theft charges but got dropped down to mr.

701
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
So it is not clean

702
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
But there a lot of clean records in the Justice

703
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Most of the defendants

704
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,600
Many of the victims to have had some prior entanglement with the law

705
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
And even if it's small stuff

706
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
Marijuana possession or trespassing

707
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
You get the stink on you

708
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
Would have come to think of is this

709
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,072
You get a whiff of bad citizenry about you

710
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,144
An odor that causes the presumption of innocence to shrivel

711
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,704
Russ understands why I understand

712
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,312
Because everyone who works in this building has become accustomed to the likes of you

713
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
You are the usual

714
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,176
And now it feels natural that the courthouse is where you belong

715
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,784
Tell with the aroma of Prior misdemeanors clinging to Anna's file

716
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
The prosecutor moves from the laughable stage of negotiations

717
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
To a solid

718
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
M1 assault

719
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
First degree misdemeanor

720
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Justice

721
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Protected

722
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,376
Russ knows the whole system is primed for him to take this misdemeanor offer

723
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
Facts of the case be damned

724
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Everyone here please

725
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,264
96% of convictions in this Courthouse

726
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Confirm please

727
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,640
All day that's what people are doing brokering haggling Angling

728
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Plea deal

729
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,760
The tenancy even among defense attorneys Russ's is to go along with the flow

730
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,832
We're trying to get rid of cases if somebody is offered to plead with

731
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,416
We don't okay that that's a win

732
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
In defense parlor

733
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,048
The feeling will be while she has a prior record anyway

734
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
So a plea to a misdemeanor is

735
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
No concert

736
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,496
I remember one judge told me

737
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
And this is

738
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
One judge told me

739
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,640
If Miss County innocence is a misdemeanor

740
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,504
What that means is if they don't have

741
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040
The evidence against

742
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Askew

743
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Village play.

744
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
2 misdemeanor

745
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
Okay

746
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
If they can't prove you guilty

747
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
They'll give you a misdemeanor

748
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,304
Everyone around here prosecutors defense attorneys judges even defendants

749
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,144
Internalize this idea that a misdemeanor is a little consequence

750
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,240
Lorelei Cress sometimes has to remind himself how mangled the principle that

751
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,568
The prosecution can't prove its case they should drop it

752
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
Not simply shrink it until it looks harmless enough to swallow

753
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:37,504
What's more if Anna does plated this charge just to make her case go away

754
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,344
The judge understandably is going to treat her as if she did in fact

755
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Assault a cop

756
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
And

757
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
She's going to give her a hard time

758
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
I'm about it

759
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
Just going to lecture her

760
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,840
And you know when your kind didn't do any

761
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
That that's just

762
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,936
I don't

763
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,384
But I just don't want to put her in that situation where she is belittled and accused of doing something

764
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
She didn't do

765
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Because she didn't do it

766
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
Interjects the states offer recipes with her

767
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,880
Again provocation accidental hit the glaring unfairness of it all

768
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,184
Why should his client plea to any kind of assault

769
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
I'll take it to trial

770
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Another decision made

771
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
Now Russ is having cold feet

772
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
Because I'm having sex

773
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Thoughts about

774
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
You know

775
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
What about what about trying the case

776
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
Speakers for

777
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,080
Annie's cases no longer about what really happened in that bar

778
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,128
It's become a risk-benefit analysis

779
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,688
The surveillance video is great evidence

780
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,784
Rose has a slim concerned that the state might try to bring in the body cam video

781
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
Where Amazon at are

782
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
She said some ugly things in it

783
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,184
It's not incriminating or anything but it doesn't help her look sympathetic

784
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,328
And regardless of how well the child goes for Anna there's always at 5% of juries who do something weird

785
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Like Invicta case like this

786
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
Does get convicted then there's the matter of the room

787
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
20b

788
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
Judge Maureen Clancy

789
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,872
Judge Clancy used to be a prosecutor just got a reputation as law enforcement friendly

790
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
Give me a test answer

791
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,808
Praying this judge was an unlucky draw in about 20 other rooms rest wouldn't worry about Anna getting sent to jail for this

792
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,624
But this room it is conceivable

793
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
Those are the risks for Anna

794
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
But then admits

795
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
There are risks for him to

796
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
In rejecting the misdemeanor assault

797
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,656
Risks that shouldn't matter when you're considering what's best for your client

798
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
But in reality they do

799
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
I know that when I tell the price

800
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Shakira.

801
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
She's going to trial

802
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
And I'm relatively certain I'll get

803
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Blowback

804
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
You know why are you taking

805
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
What's time

806
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
And not pleading this out to him this term

807
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
I wouldn't certainly get it from

808
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
From the project

809
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,880
Pewter it wouldn't surprise

810
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
The Drudge

811
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
I know but I will

812
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
In what form

813
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,096
I'll be viewed as

814
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Somebody was complicated

815
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Necessarily

816
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,496
Like you'll just be seen as an irritant now and

817
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,592
Well it is an obstructionist somebody who is in

818
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,384
Heating the disposition

819
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Cases

820
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,456
I I will be

821
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,832
I am not going to say subject ridicule but I will be regarded as an extra

822
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,392
I said you know I do it

823
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
You don't want to get a

824
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
Butaton for that

825
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,048
Reputation is everything around here

826
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,120
It's a closed and somewhat circular communities as Courthouse

827
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
Everyone knows everyone

828
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Word gets around very fast

829
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
If you're a pain in the ass

830
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,800
Grandstand if your boat rocker you slow dockets down

831
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
It can affect your business

832
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:46,688
Kalix Minot refer clients to you and judges might not assign you cases

833
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:51,808
About half of Russia's income is from assignments some like Anna's some appellate work

834
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
By 1 they don't pay much

835
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,416
Not exactly pay-by-the-hour there's a pcap

836
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:02,304
According to the court rules the most you can get paid for Anna's case is $800 whether he takes it to trial or not

837
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,888
The minimum he can get paid as curiously specific 250

838
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
$6

839
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,520
The best way to make money as an assignment attorney is a treat it like a volume business

840
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,848
Take lots of cases resolved them quickly but not too quickly

841
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Patches

842
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,176
Judges control the assignment

843
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
Which can lead to a kind of settled self-inflicted pressure

844
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Maybe I won't file this motion or take this case

845
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
The trial

846
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
Because that might annoy the judge

847
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
And then he might know assignment cases

848
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,792
Rose has a good reputation I doubt he's in real danger of reprisal

849
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,632
But if his Courthouse veteran is worrying about whether he'll be seen as an obstruction

850
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
A little kiss like this

851
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,728
Measuring a less secure attorney might do in his place

852
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,736
3 weeks before the trial date Raza Nanna make a last-ditch counter-offer

853
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
How about disorderly conduct

854
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
An M4

855
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
What are the smallest charges in the courthouse

856
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
Just went up from say a speeding ticket

857
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
The state rejected

858
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,536
Note to Jennifer this was definitely an assault

859
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
So it's either take the M1

860
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
Or try to beat the felony charge

861
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Trial

862
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,288
We are here today in the cape

863
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,616
Hair shows up for her trial wearing a new dress you got at Marshall's

864
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,688
Navy blue with white piping around the collar cap sleeves

865
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
String of Pearls sparkly flats

866
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
Looks like an attorney

867
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,576
Which he later told me was the look she was going for

868
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
Julie the tags on the dress and hopes of returning it

869
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
Who is Shakib

870
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,000
Russ is there of course standing with Anna at the defense table

871
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,560
The prosecution's table across from them

872
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
No Jennifer

873
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
But some other guy

874
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
A young prosecutor named Jonathan

875
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
I want to know Jonathan characterizes the crime before

876
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
Disorderly conduct a misdemeanor of the fourth degree

877
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
Disorderly conduct

878
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
A misdemeanor of the fourth degree

879
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,735
Since Jennifer was busy on a murder trial

880
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
It's about a week ago she's handed off the case

881
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
Jonathan McDonald

882
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,623
Jonathan watch the bar surveillance video

883
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,951
And this morning before his trial began russaw Jonathan back in

884
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
Court Chambers and first thing he said to rest was

885
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
You got your disorderly conduct

886
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
Anna takes it

887
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
In the courtroom she pleads guilty

888
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Happily

889
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,471
Jonathan gives a judge a quick synopsis of the case

890
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
It was a fight he says

891
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
It was chaotic

892
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,591
Multiple people were touching Anna

893
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
She was flailing

894
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,943
He closes it out with a fourth degree use of the passive voice

895
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
Sergeant Gill he tells the judge

896
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
Was struck by a blow

897
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,087
Diablo and I would agree with the defendant

898
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
Sergeant kill himself isn't there

899
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,439
You come by earlier in the day but he had to leave

900
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,975
Another officer was there

901
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,303
Does Clancy double checks with them like you're cool with this outcome

902
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,631
The officer mentions and already spent four days in jail

903
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
Does I mean

904
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
I would say that

905
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Adequate

906
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:53,311
Judge Clancy find a $200 and send her on her way with the gentle

907
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Good luck to you

908
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
Architect you

909
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,807
Everyone suddenly seem so chill about this felony assault on a peace officer

910
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,159
Just weeks earlier Jennifer had firmly rejected the M4 disorderly

911
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
What happened

912
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
What change

913
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,791
Obviously the prosecutor for one fresh eyes on the case

914
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,375
In this instance I've attached to a guy who gets along well with rust fencing

915
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,215
The personalities aside rest later told me it's also the timing

916
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,775
The eve of trial can be a magical time

917
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,079
Arrest on a Samuel Johnson quotation

918
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,663
The prospect of going to trial concentrates a man's mind wonderful

919
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
Clarity descends

920
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,295
Sometimes you learn things about your own case that you hadn't quite seen before

921
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
My credit sucks May

922
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
And I think that's

923
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
That's probably would have

924
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Here

925
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,487
That they they just took it

926
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,535
I'll look at it that you know

927
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
Can you realize certain things about it

928
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,399
Not a tribal situation

929
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
In fact I told Jonathan

930
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
I said

931
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,055
You can find 12 people in your office who would convey

932
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,919
Would all agree that she should be convicted to this and he said touche

933
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,503
Did you say that after we did the deal

934
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Did the police

935
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,903
This point I was sincerely confused about what to make of Anna's case

936
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,743
Just in a fundamental way it was this thumbs up thumbs down

937
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,559
Is this an example of the system

938
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,119
Working or not working

939
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Oh it is it that I think

940
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
It achieved the right

941
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,239
Results so it's an example of

942
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
The system work

943
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,543
Yeah I had this gone to

944
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
Trileptal

945
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
Would be a Santa Ana

946
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
The system

947
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Never should

948
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,711
To be perfectly blunt she never should

949
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Irish twins

950
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,087
Setting aside the trust believes Anna didn't commit a crime

951
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
And that she just plead guilty to one

952
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
The system worked

953
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
I talked to Jennifer about this to

954
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
Xi'an Russell green

955
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,583
She said she was glad the case went to a prosecutor who had a good rapport with ra

956
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
That she was fine with the result

957
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:59,007
Anyway Jennifer set at the end of the day the difference between the initial offer of misdemeanor assault

958
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
And the final offer

959
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
Disorderly conduct

960
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,175
Really the difference between the M4 and the M1 is

961
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,223
So negligible but it's like

962
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,319
Caso4 and it worked out the justice system work

963
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Please just point out no

964
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
An assault versus a disorderly

965
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
I'm sorry no

966
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,559
If it were your record or my record by Jennifer's record we were talking about

967
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
The difference is not negligible

968
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,679
This is what rankles me most about Anna's case

969
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,495
The breeziness with which everyone's looking back on it now

970
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
Clapping the dust off their hands and saying

971
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335
Great that's done

972
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,663
Small crime smoke a small punishment all in proportion

973
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,687
Justice is served

974
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
But they're not saying maybe because you're not seeing it

975
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
Is the extent of Anna's punishment

976
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
Which one you take a minute

977
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,159
The catalog the consequences was not small

978
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Did not fit

979
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
I'm going to do that now take you through

980
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:56,351
It said it when they say she got a fine and was sent on her way it could have been worse

981
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
You'll see why I'm arguing that it was worse

982
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
Quite a lot worse

983
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,055
First off and I sat in the back of a police car for at least an hour

984
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
Belligerent yes but also distraught

985
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,175
Then she's booked into the Cleveland City Jail

986
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Which is

987
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Disgusting

988
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
Disgusting

989
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Agreed

990
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
I've seen parts of it

991
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,855
And I spent four nights there

992
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,415
I can say it fast four nights in jail

993
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
Or I can say it like it fell to Anna

994
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
Thursday night

995
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
Then Friday night

996
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
Saturday night

997
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
And Sunday night

998
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
Your bar fight

999
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
4 Days of Night

1000
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
It was loud in there

1001
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,031
People shouting and arguing up and down and across the cells

1002
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:41,151
And I slept on a mat on the floor no blanket no sheet a pathetic little sponge on a stick

1003
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
For a toothbrush

1004
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:47,295
Because Aunt has white and skinny and it said people assume she was a heroin addict and gave her a hard time about that

1005
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
Color clock in a junkie

1006
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,391
Messing with each other just to pass

1007
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,183
The time everyone's board

1008
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
There's no TV

1009
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:59,839
They gave you maybe like a magazine that's an interesting light

1010
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,703
Where to eat in Cleveland by

1011
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,311
Why do it their food cycling you're just sitting in there like

1012
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,359
Finally Monday,

1013
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
And Anna sees a judge

1014
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
Who sets her bond at $5,000

1015
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
That's a lot

1016
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,271
The judge had other choices

1017
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
Anna could have been let out of jail was just a promise to come back to

1018
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
Court

1019
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
But this was $5,000

1020
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Full payment

1021
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
Which antigen have

1022
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,559
Instead she paid a bondsman a fee of $500 to post the bond for her

1023
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
Money she doesn't get back

1024
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,399
If she hadn't been able to Muster that fee

1025
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,703
Should have been sitting in jail for months possibly

1026
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
A condition of her bond is Court supervised release

1027
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
Certified pre-trial probation

1028
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,407
Every Wednesday she's got to come back downtown

1029
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
Check in

1030
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,223
I pee in a cup for drug test

1031
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,039
These visits are on top of the pre-trial

1032
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,135
All told anime more than 20 trips to the Justice Center for this

1033
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
She does not live close by

1034
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,815
The judge find her $200 for the disorderly conduct plus court fees

1035
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,887
Which she has to pay because she put guilty she was convicted

1036
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:11,007
If the state had dropped the charger she going to trial in one these fees would disappear

1037
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,335
I showed them the rest asked if he could explain the itemized list

1038
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
14 different fees

1039
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,455
Summit names that suggested deep respect for catch-all accounting

1040
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,991
Reparations

1041
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,527
County operations

1042
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,319
Court special projects fund

1043
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,111
And then call Dad fee

1044
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,415
Russ had no idea what the stuff was

1045
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,511
You're laughing why

1046
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
Oh my

1047
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,863
Steep is what it is

1048
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,727
Anarosa Court a total of $784.50

1049
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,287
On top of the 500 she paid the bondsman

1050
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,639
Russ said there's a way you can petition the court to waive the fee Savannah can't pay

1051
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:53,247
But she doesn't ask him to and he doesn't offer technically is not a lawyer anymore

1052
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,807
List of fuse was a surprise to Anna to

1053
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,831
Have you seen this

1054
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
Before this number

1055
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,159
Did you know about all these fees

1056
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
Nope

1057
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
No I mean I plan to pay it I'm just

1058
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
You know

1059
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
You have a job

1060
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
No

1061
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
Just lost my job so

1062
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
Just crazy

1063
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,407
Free I'm getting hungry Sarah

1064
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
She's pregnant

1065
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,503
She just found out

1066
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
She's happy about it hoping for a girl

1067
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,391
A month later and it was working at McDonald's

1068
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,975
Online account with a Courtney well as turns red

1069
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:39,839
Indicating that the county clerk has handed over the bill to the Attorney General's office for collection

1070
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
All this

1071
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
Synonym for disorderly

1072
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,175
A felony judge I was talking to for a different story in the series

1073
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,503
Tell me he was thinking of giving a defendant serious time

1074
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
What's Sirius timeout

1075
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,879
Explain to someone with common sense

1076
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,951
Even one day in jail is devastating life-changing

1077
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,255
Someone who's got no common sense

1078
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,583
Maybe they do 3 years 5 years means nothing

1079
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
They go right back out and commit more crimes

1080
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:19,519
Annuity man punishment is relative what it takes to teach you a lesson depends on what you're used to

1081
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,847
But there was a more disturbing invocation as well

1082
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,639
When it prowls this Courthouse

1083
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,175
Send throughout our criminal justice

1084
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,735
That we are not like them

1085
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,063
The ones we arrest and punish the ones with the stink

1086
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
They're slightly different species

1087
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,415
Senses dulled and toughened

1088
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:41,279
I don't feel pain or sorrow or Joy or Freedom or the loss of freedom

1089
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,583
The same way you are I would

1090
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,679
This little case for the state of Ohio wasn't little for Anna

1091
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:53,311
In our interview she couldn't bring herself to watch the bar surveillance video of that night it was too upsetting

1092
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,663
She teared up a couple of times thinking about what a horrible year it has been

1093
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
She blamed herself

1094
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
She's been stupid to go to a bar like

1095
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,783
She said the people she didn't trust

1096
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,135
Anna doesn't have money just have a stable job

1097
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,671
She's really young

1098
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Just 21

1099
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:15,327
And I didn't feel the stress and outrage and shame of this case less than I would have

1100
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
I think she felt it more

1101
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:28,127
Before and his final day in court when she ended up taking a plea

1102
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,711
Russet had only one interaction with the judge regarding Anna's case

1103
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
He was coming to her Chambers by her bailiff

1104
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,831
Who told us that judge Clancy had a question for him

1105
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
Press waited around for 20 minutes

1106
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,951
Annabelle came out and just relay the question

1107
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,767
Curiosity the judge would like to know

1108
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
Was the defendant in this case related to a County judge

1109
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Retired

1110
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
Team last name

1111
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
Bristol the bailiff

1112
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
No

1113
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
No relation

1114
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,311
Bristol need is almost a year after it happened

1115
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,407
What is the answer to Ben yes and it was related to the retired judge

1116
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
It would have been dismissed

1117
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,783
If they found out she was a judge's knees are related in some way

1118
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
I don't think she even would have been charged

1119
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
Is that how it works in Cleveland

1120
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:19,583
