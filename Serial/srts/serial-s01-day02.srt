1
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:05,888
Hello

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,424
Are you back in your boudoir

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,032
I am I really like it in here now

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,592
I might just stay in here is all night

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:20,480
Alright so today was the second day of the hearing

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
Yes

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
How to how did it go for Egypt

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,208
They really went after her you know today was mostly the states

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
Cross-examining her and they really

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
Attacked her testimony

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
In a bunch of ways

12
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,936
One of the things I brought up was this whole snow issue

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
Because remember when I

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,056
Talk to her on the phone that time you know when I

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
Was reporting the store and she called me

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,200
She said she remembered that day specifically January 13

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
1999 the day he goes missing the day he goes missing she remembered seeing and not in the library and she said to me be

18
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,208
Because of the snow remember that yeah yeah right yeah she was like I remember cuz it was this

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
The first snow of the year and there was all the snow

20
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
And

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
The state today

22
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
The prosecutor

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Chi

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,704
Was like

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
Are you sure you have the right day because there wasn't snow that day was there like he should have reference what she had said

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Said to me

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
And that was

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,760
That was something we had a question about 2 cuz she was very clear with you she got

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,064
Snowed in at her boyfriend's house

30
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
And then the next two days were snow days

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
So she's very clear that she ties his memory

32
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
I2

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
To the snow right

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Oh yeah yeah

35
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
Shireen wondered about that

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,376
Yeah because we looked up the weather right and it hadn't snow

37
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960
It hasn't snowed there was a horrible ice storm that had started

38
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,592
Like in the wee hours of the next morning but there wasn't snow it was it was it was terrible weather and it was like a

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
Big emergency in Baltimore

40
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
But it was an ice storm

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
And so she kind of

42
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
I mean

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Cheat

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
She did a fairly good job with it I mean she just said like

45
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,024
Yeah I don't know I know it was bad weather I'm not sure if it was snow or ice or whatever I just remember it was like

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Hazardous bad weather

47
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,144
School was canceled after after that Jews like and I remember

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
I was happy about it because I had used the excuse of bad weather as a reason to stay later

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
At my boyfriend Derek's house

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
And my mom bought it

51
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,968
And then she was like and I remember it because I stayed out later I was happy that

52
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Dance school is can

53
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
Today's

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
So it sounded pretty specific

55
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
.

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,232
I don't know but I have to say she was very cool and collected about it it wasn't

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
She didn't seem frazzled or freaked out or she was just like I don't know about it was snow ice I don't know it was bad weather huh

58
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,544
Yeah she seemed totally she seemed completely confident in her memories even when I was thinking like

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
But even when I was thinking like

60
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Wait a minute

61
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
What happened

62
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
Yeah well so the other the main thing

63
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,464
That happened that least was new to me as a theory about Asia's alibi

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,584
And that made me think like wait a minute let me rethink this and in fact I

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
Asked you guys to go scrambling back to the records

66
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
That we have our detectives heldens this is the stuff

67
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Yes that you want stuff

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,616
Because the prosecutor of Inuyasha went after her

69
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
For a long time about the second

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Letter

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
That she wrote to Adnan right after he got so wasted

72
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
So we should just take a step back and explain what these letters are they that your

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Talking about so the

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,232
So Asian Road Adnan to letter she wrote in the first letter

75
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,328
The day after he was arrested I think March 1st 1999

76
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
And Analysis

77
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
Does handwritten note where she started saying to him

78
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
I've just been to your house I'm at your parents

79
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
And I want to tell you that

80
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
I remember talking to you that day January 13th 1999

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
I remember seeing you in the library

82
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
So then the next day she she writes him another letter and this one is a little bit different it's a little bit longer it's

83
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Typed up

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
She seems to be writing it in

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Like from one of her

86
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Classes at school

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
And in that one

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,655
She started reiterate again like I remember seeing you in the library that day so let me know

89
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
If you need me to

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
To speak up about that

91
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
All right

92
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
So today

93
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
The 2nd letter the type one was was the issue today so the state is really pressing her over and

94
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Over to say

95
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
Are you sure you really wrote this letter on March 2nd

96
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Because it's dated March

97
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,975
And infected stated on every page letter and at the bottom of each page it says March 2nd

98
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
And she keeps saying yes

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Yes I am yep

100
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,167
And he's pointing to things in the letter that suggests It Was Written later maybe

101
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
That suggests It Was Written later because she's got all of this

102
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Fairly specific

103
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,127
Information about anons case in about the

104
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
The crime in the way the crime unfolded

105
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
And he's suggesting like

106
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
How would you have known all this stuff

107
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:16,415
What were some of the things the prosecutor was pointing to the letter as like how would you know this or that

108
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,071
There were several things one was she notes that hey was found in a shallow grave

109
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
Another was that

110
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
She talks about someone else referencing

111
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
Fibers from Adnan on his body

112
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,943
So the prosecutor is saying like it's too soon for any of those details to have been out in

113
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
Republic 2 days after Adnan has been

114
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Arrest right that what he's going to say

115
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
That's what he's

116
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Suggesting

117
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,463
In fact he's not really correct about that because then

118
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
Justin Brown Adnan defense attorney

119
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,631
Stood up after that and showed exhibits of Baltimore Sun stories dated

120
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
Prior to

121
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Asia's letter

122
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
That talk about these

123
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
That have these very phrases in them

124
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Shallow Grave

125
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,639
Lincoln Park that you know

126
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
So that didn't hold up very well

127
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
But

128
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
But

129
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,063
There was this one thing that's in this is the thing that I was like

130
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
And that is

131
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
He's asking her

132
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
Did Adnan ever contact

133
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Do you from jail

134
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
And she's like no

135
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
And he says did he ever

136
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Call you know

137
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,167
Did he you know send you letters she's like nope

138
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
And

139
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
She says well how do you explain

140
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
Explain if Adnan never contacted

141
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Video

142
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
How would you explain

143
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Notes from

144
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
From a detective interview

145
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
With a non-friend

146
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
This is a kid named Joanne Gordon

147
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
And in these notes it says

148
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
That Juwan

149
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Told the cops

150
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
That

151
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Adnan

152
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,607
Written a letter to a girl and ask her to type it up

153
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
But you got the address wrong

154
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
NM

155
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:11,359
What does that mean like what does that say what does that imply I think he was trying to imply

156
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
That

157
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
Adnan hat had contact

158
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
Packard Asia and had asked her to

159
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Type up this letter

160
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
In this way

161
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
This March 2nd letter

162
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
But he's implying

163
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
It wasn't actually written March 2nd

164
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
And it was written

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Perhaps Weeks Later

166
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,631
That maybe he engineered that in that may be a nun asked her to write this

167
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
Type to type up this letter

168
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Ha

169
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Yeah

170
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,127
And I was able what does that mean does that mean she doesn't remember what she thinks she remembers or does that mean she's

171
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Lying

172
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
Or whatever and Anand idrees

173
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Did contact her and

174
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
What does that mean you know

175
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
And so

176
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
You know it started it starts to make her

177
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
Very pure story about being

178
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Just

179
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,095
Potential Alibi who wanted to step forward and do the right thing to like look like some

180
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Something slightly different

181
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
And so that's why I

182
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
Who asked you guys to look up

183
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,567
Notes from that detective interview with Juwan

184
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Okay so

185
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
So I'm looking at the detective notes

186
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,063
From their interview with Chauhan on April 9th and they didn't record that

187
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
Interview so I've always got to these kind of like

188
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Cryptic

189
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Detective notes

190
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,255
I'll just read those to you and this is what they say I think this is what the pro

191
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Prosecutor is

192
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Referencing

193
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
It says

194
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Adnan wrote me a letter

195
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
And remember at this time and on his in jail

196
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
So not wrote me a letter he called yesterday but I wasn't home

197
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Rodenbach

198
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
He wrote a letter to a girl to

199
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
To type up with his address on it

200
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
She got it wrong

201
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
And then there's an address

202
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
101 East Eager Street

203
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
Which is the incorrect address for central booking

204
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
And then it says Asia

205
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
What's a?

206
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
12th grade

207
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
I got one just an address

208
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
And just an adder

209
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
I was a friend of Adnan zand

210
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
But

211
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,055
I'm just saying like those are pretty cryptic and I can also see that

212
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Note

213
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
As implying that

214
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,735
Adnan ridha letter to girl and ask her could you please

215
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
Give my friends the address

216
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
So that they can write me letters

217
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
And that's all it mean

218
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
That's true that's true I mean

219
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
Right and then she did it wrong and it's

220
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,911
Like I can just imagine how this could play out in a totally innocent different way from what the prosecutor seems

221
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
To be suggesting

222
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
The one that stops me is

223
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
He wrote a letter to a girl

224
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
To type up

225
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
And I don't know

226
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
It's true it's not clear

227
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
It's not clear what this totally means

228
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
But

229
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Here's the thing

230
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,575
It raises it does make you pause right

231
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
And that's his entire Point that's

232
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
That's the prosecutors entire point

233
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,279
Is that I can throw a bunch of Suspicion on Asia story

234
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
And all of these various ways

235
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,143
And if I can do it here before you today in this hearing

236
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
That means

237
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
The prosecutor's baky did nuns criminal trial back in

238
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,079
1999-2000 could have done the same

239
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Same thing

240
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
To the state of showing

241
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,039
Look maybe she's not such an ironclad Alibi after all and if she's not such an ironclad alibi

242
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Then maybe

243
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
Christina Gutierrez did have a very good reason

244
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
For not pursuing her

245
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
It wasn't a mistake it was a strategy

246
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
That's what he's trying to show

247
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
So what did you think did you buy that

248
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Can I buy it

249
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
I mean

250
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
I would say

251
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,383
I don't think he liked proved that she didn't write the letter on March 2nd or anything like that and she seems very comfort

252
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
People just saying

253
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,967
I don't know what you want those notes about Juwan mean

254
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
But I wrote this letter March 2nd I never heard

255
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Like she was

256
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
She just was right

257
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Forthright about it

258
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
Or seemed very forthright about it I should say

259
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
And

260
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
But it did

261
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
You know it did make me think like

262
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Well

263
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
It does make you wonder what

264
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
Could have happened a trial and whether it would have been

265
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Slam dunk for a nun

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Okay so can we talk about

267
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
The main event of the day which is

268
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,919
The cell phone testimony which I've been waiting patiently to get to

269
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
I know I so wish you were there today I was like I was like Dana would be eating this

270
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:42,719
I was like drooling part way through a minute it's it was hard to get was that exciting

271
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,863
So it's really important is the thing but it's

272
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Just

273
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
It's hard to sink your teeth into in terms of emotion you know but it's

274
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
No it was I mean yeah it was interesting so basically

275
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Today there was not a big

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,015
Bombshell on this issue but I think they're setting the stage for 1

277
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,111
So which turns out that the AT&T cell tower s

278
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:16,255
Does the AT&T cell tower expert who testified at a nun's original trial in mm

279
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
It turns out that

280
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
There was this disclaimer

281
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
On those records

282
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
Anna on a fax cover sheet

283
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
For those records back in 1999

284
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
That said

285
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,871
You can't use incoming calls they're not reliable for location

286
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,431
Status incoming calls are not reliable Four Loko

287
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Kitchen status

288
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
And

289
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Why that's important is because the two phone calls

290
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
That place Adnan in leakin park

291
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
At the time that Jay said they were burying the body

292
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Are incoming calls

293
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Right

294
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
So

295
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,143
What happened was this fall just recently

296
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
That same cell tower expert

297
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
Wrote an affidavit saying I didn't know about that disk

298
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
Disclaimer about not using the ink

299
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Incoming calls for low

300
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Location

301
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
So now he's saying I'm not sure now about

302
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
My testimony

303
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
I'm not sure I could

304
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Could say that those two

305
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Who calls Play Store

306
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
The phone in Lincoln

307
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
So that guy did not testify today actually

308
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
But the defense team brought in this other expert

309
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,815
Who's who said yes you know that disclaimer was very very important

310
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,959
And they spent a lot of the debt the afternoon arguing that the state and the defense over

311
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
Basically the meaning of location

312
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
On those cell tower record

313
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
How to interpret the word location

314
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
I'm really jealous that you get to be there for that tomorrow

315
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,831
No accident because no this is actually really important at this this like cell phone disclaimer thing is is something that

316
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Bug me for really long time

317
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,231
Because it's sort of like it if if that is in fact the case that

318
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,327
You can't use incoming calls for location data

319
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Then that kind of means

320
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,471
There's a chance that that cell phone was not in Lincoln Park

321
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:07,871
When the prosecution at the original trial said it was so it's no it's a real problem for the state yeah it's a real problem

322
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,967
So this might really get answer tomorrow of weather

323
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,807
Whether that's a real thing that you can't use incoming calls

324
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Four location

325
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
That would that would

326
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
Make me really happy

327
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
I think an answer.

328
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
Seitan man

329
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
All right

330
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Alright so you call me tomorrow

331
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Yes I will
