You try to help with little boy

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Okay

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,648
Previously on serial

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,512
The tallest jury shot this little boy and not be afraid anymore sir

19
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,352
The defense attorney came to me at the first pre-trial that you're going to dismiss this

20
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,656
You sir are going to be looking

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
This is me all the way up like every time I go outside I just look at everybody diff

22
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,408
But you know what happened but you won't say nothing

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,968
I don't think that's what happened

24
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
He said that's why you're getting out

00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago

26
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
Serial one Courthouse told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig this is one of those cases

27
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,752
That is so puzzling because so many people are so certain of

28
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,360
What is our who is involved and we just have no way of knowing

29
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
What it is and what it isn't in

30
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
Yeah one breakage and all that one break a change at all

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
This is a prosecutor named Brian Radigan

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,696
He's talking about the aavielle Wakefield case the one where the baby was shot in the car

33
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
Get another prosecutor in charge of that case they're the ones who saw 13 count indictment against Avon homes

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
They're the ones who argued a year later to let him go

35
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Eddie Cibrian

36
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,312
But they haven't solved it like why why does it have to be this one

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
Why does it have to be the five

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Gold

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,712
When I asked to interview someone about ivl's case

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,272
The County prosecutor's office easily could have said

41
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
This is still an open investigation we can't comment

42
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
But they did not do that

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Instead they give me Bryan

44
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
And Brian told me a lot

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
I went to Brian chiefly to find out why the case fell apart

46
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
Did they release Davon Holmes because of Sumter

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Kalaty

48
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
Or did they release him because wrong guy

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
First responder the reasons they thought it was Davon to begin with

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Initially they had anonymous tips that it was Davon

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,688
People who said this is what I know but you didn't hear from me

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Just said

53
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Now this my information you'll never find me if you bring me in a court or if you try to put me on paper record me I'll deny that I ever

54
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
But you don't meet me in this park at

55
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
And I'll tell you

56
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
I mean really like the stuff you see in the movies

57
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
In the movies that's exciting

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
In real life

59
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Not so great

60
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:23,264
Brian said he was hoping to persuade one or two of those people to become Witnesses by the time the trial rolled around

61
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
They have the jailhouse statement from that guy who I'm calling John the guy who'd known Davon since he was little brothers were friends

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,552
Brian told me more about what John said he also told me they didn't really find it credible

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,928
Since some of the other people John had mentioned in his statement didn't seem to have a connection to Davon

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Are older one thing

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,352
Brian's office was also looking into the guy obvious father thought was responsible for the shooting

66
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
But they didn't have enough evidence to charge him with anything

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,544
And Avon they also had his cell phone records putting in the neighborhood at the time

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,944
His own neighborhood they also had a statement to the detective sandwich he said he'd been up the street at the Family Dollar when it has

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
Davon told me he'd never made

70
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
I didn't add up to much

71
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
But then they got the landscapers ID

72
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,000
The landscaper remember was the guy who finally chose de Vons picture out of a photo array

73
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
Third time around almost two months after the shooting

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,167
As I thought it was the landscapers ID that made the prosecutors

75
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
Feel comfortable

76
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
Like they're looking at the right person

77
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
Landscaper came off as genuine believable

78
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
Brian told me the landscaper he came to them

79
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
He showed up one day at the Justice Center

80
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
For the elevator up to the 9th floor

81
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Tilapia the prosecutor's office

82
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Brian gets a call at his desk

83
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,135
Is a guy says he wants to talk to you

84
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
So I show up to the front I say Hi how are you in on the interviews myself and he says I've got some information I want to talk to somebody about

85
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
So I call the homicide unit I didn't talk to him again

86
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,215
We want to be Witnesses so I call the homicide unit they come over here they pick him up

87
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
And they talked to him

88
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
And when they're talking to him

89
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
There was

90
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
There was a belief at the beginning

91
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
From

92
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,551
The officers handling the case that this guy knows who it is but

93
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
He's not going to pick him up

94
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
Brian says this guy it was like a lot of witnesses they deal with

95
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Wanting to do the right thing

96
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Afraid to do the right thing

97
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Waffling

98
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
She came down here

99
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
A number of times and contacted the homicide unit or number of time saying

100
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Listen I'm

101
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,775
I wanted to do this I wanted to come forward but I do not want to come to court

102
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
I do not want to testify

103
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,919
I got kids he talked to us he wanted us to move them out of

104
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
Where he was living because he was afraid of living in the neighborhood Evelyn and

105
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
But he wasn't but he still was working in that neighborhood afterwards and in those have been so he had

106
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Kid his own concerns

107
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
But I think if

108
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
If you ask him again he would still believe that

109
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Devon Holmes was the one

110
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
And do you think David Holmes is the one

111
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
I I think that there was

112
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
Pretty strong evidence

113
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
That we found

114
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
During the course of this and

115
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
That he was not

116
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
He's not

117
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
Now we turn to part two of our conversation

118
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
What made the case against Davon collapse

119
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,903
No I just want to know the amount of evidence Brian had laid out

120
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Does not seem like it should be enough to take a person to

121
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
Trial for aggravated murder

122
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Much less convince a jury to convict

123
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
A person of aggravated murder

124
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
But it is enough

125
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
Nothing would have been a slam dunk for the state but

126
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
Assuming a landscaper showed up to court and testify

127
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
It's not far-fetched to think Davon might have been convicted

128
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
Easily could have gone down for this murder

129
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
What about a month before the trial was supposed to

130
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Start

131
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:50,623
They were made aware he doesn't want to say exactly how but they were made aware of a phone call

132
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
And exonerating phone call

133
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,535
We had some evidence of somebody else that we believe is involved in the case

134
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
On a recording that they didn't know

135
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Was being recorded

136
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Saying that

137
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Devon was not there

138
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
Was it because I asked him to get a job

139
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
It was not

140
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
It was not

141
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,455
Again Brian didn't want to divulge too much about this recording

142
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,551
He thinks that if this case is ever going to be solved this call might be the key

143
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
Didn't want to say too much about it

144
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
But what surprised me was

145
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
It didn't come from the detectives

146
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
It didn't come from their side

147
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
The most I can say is

148
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
The recording came to them

149
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,167
Once it did they all sat down in a conference room in the prosecutor's office

150
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
Defense attorneys Brian the cops

151
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
And they listen to this

152
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Call

153
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,103
It was between someone who knows and cares for Davon

154
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
And the young man I'm not going to name

155
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
In the call nobody identifies the shooter

156
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,063
But it was pretty clear the young man knew what had happened the day I'll be always killed

157
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
Brian says he understood right away that he had to take it serious

158
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
When you actually hear somebody say it

159
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
When they don't know that they're being recorded

160
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
And that

161
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
That changes things

162
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
They're only a few weeks from trial at this point

163
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Now they scrambled

164
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
They needed to verify that the recording was real

165
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
But the people in the car were who they said they were

166
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,895
Not the call itself wasn't theater

167
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Manufactured to Spring Davon

168
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
Once I did all that they reassess

169
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Do we still think Davon Holmes is the guy

170
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
They weren't sure

171
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Maybe not

172
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
They decided they couldn't proceed

173
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Filed a motion to dismiss

174
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
The phone call ended the case against Avon

175
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
But it also gave Brian new evidence to work

176
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
The young man in the recording

177
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
He sounded involved in some way

178
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
Call the detectives he knew in the 4th District

179
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Do you know anything about this guy

180
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,175
Funny thing they said is matter of fact we're looking at him for a carjacking

181
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Also for shooting

182
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
Brian says can you hurry it up chop chop and they do

183
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
Pretty soon that got him in custody

184
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
They charging for the carjacking

185
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
And for the other shooting

186
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,279
Even though these wouldn't normally be cases for Bryan's unit since nobody died

187
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,607
Brian prosecute someone tries to get the guy to cooperate

188
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Start squeezing it

189
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,727
I'll help you out on a plea if you help us on the Ave Wakefield case

190
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
12 years is better than tape

191
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
30 years right

192
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
The guy won't talk

193
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Don't talk won't talk

194
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Brian tried for months

195
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Nothing

196
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
Last fall the guy pleaded guilty in those cases

197
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,855
Tag robbery and attempted murder and was sentenced to 17 years

198
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
Brian knows that this guy serving time for something entirely else might be the closest Belk

199
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
Creep towards Justice and ovules case

200
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Kind of sideways Justice

201
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:46,751
Will Al Capone embrion headset which is a funny thing from to say because Brian looks a lot like a young Al Capone

202
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
It's unsatisfying I know

203
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,895
Crime isn't solved that's unsatisfying obviously

204
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
But also Dave onset accused for a year

205
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
That shouldn't have happened

206
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,159
The Justice Center about it people said yeah that's a shame at least I corrected it

207
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
No one was demanding an inquiry into what went wrong or yelling for reform no hand-wringing

208
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Bismarck resignation

209
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,751
What you going to do judges say they can't control what cases are prosecutors bring to them prosecutor

210
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
You say they're relying on the detectives detective say their information is only as good as what the public cost up can they help it

211
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
People lie or withhold

212
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
I got it

213
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
When no one feels fully responsible for the outcome

214
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
When blame is spread out and diluted

215
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
A situation like avons becomes easier to shrug off

216
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
What are you going to do

217
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Starts to feel like an answer

218
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Rather than an urgent question

219
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,335
I ended up spending a bunch of Time with Brian ratigan hanging around while he did his job

220
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Because I like them right away

221
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,735
And also because he is one of the most powerful people in the Justice Center

222
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
He'd never admit that

223
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
Police seized it

224
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
But it's true

225
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
Prosecutors are the most powerful people in any Courthouse

226
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
Defense attorneys will tell you they'd rather have a fair prosecutor and an unfair judge

227
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Been a fair judge and an unfair Prosecco

228
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,191
Because of all the people who shape a criminal case the prosecutor has the most discretion

229
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,031
Especially at The crucial beginning when the thing is still germinating

230
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
The prosecutors deciding home to charge and with what crimes

231
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Is also deciding what the plea deal is going to look like

232
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,319
And don't tell the judges in the building but often the prosecutor is more less deciding the sentences people get

233
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Because of this big Power they hold

234
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,743
Prosecutors of late have been the focus of blame for a lot of the problems in our system

235
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
And the focus of Reform effort

236
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
And that's not undeserved

237
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
What is incomplete

238
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:55,007
Mostly prosecutors I've talked to it's not that they're gunning for cheap assembly-line Justice

239
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:00,127
Or for unprecedented discriminatory devastatingly High rates of incarceration

240
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
It's that

241
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
That's the job we've given them

242
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,039
I feel like I can't explain this without telling you some history of how we got here

243
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
I want to explain it

244
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
So here goes

245
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,975
Our worst modern era of crime in the US if you look at the FBI stats

246
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
Began in the 1960s and 70s

247
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,143
Most people now agree we were under policing and also under incarcerating

248
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
And we swanway way the other way

249
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
Cops made more arrest which meant more prosecutions

250
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,455
But the huge increase in arrests and charges did not respond to a commensurate increase in the number of prosecutors

251
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
Or the number of cops but that's another story

252
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
This one statistic really hit me

253
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
In 1974

254
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:47,999
They're around 17,000 local prosecutors dealing with around 300,000 felony process

255
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Secretions

256
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
By 2007

257
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,887
The number of prosecutors had jumped to about 32000

258
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,519
A significant increase but they were dealing with nearly 3 million felony prosecution

259
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,591
A tenfold increase from 1974

260
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
The upshot

261
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
Vastly more prosecutions handled by relatively fewer prosecutors the only way for them to

262
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Keep afloat plea bargains

263
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
As1 Cleveland judge said to me

264
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,999
Plea bargaining isn't part of the Criminal Justice System it is the criminal justice system

265
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Kaiser Chiefs

266
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
Balita more convictions and to more incarceration

267
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
And we've given prosecutors many tools to negotiate these please lots of Forces help this push toward

268
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Harsher criminal justice

269
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
Economic forces the forces of racism and discrimination

270
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,271
Unfortunate US Supreme Court decisions politics and more politics

271
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
For the one you don't always hear about his legislation

272
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
In the decades post 1970

273
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,767
Most states began revamping their sentencing guidelines and their criminal codes

274
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,119
A lot of crimes are being defined both more broadly and more specifically

275
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,471
Theft fraud burglary robbery assault sexual assault kidnapping

276
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
They're definitions expanded

277
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Which made them harder to defend against

278
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,407
And They Carried more serious penalties same with laws about guns

279
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Especially about drugs expensive criminal codes allow prosecutors to expansively charge

280
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:22,463
Because a single criminal act doesn't have to be singly charged you can pile on as many charges you want doesn't matter if

281
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,559
They overlap so long as each one requires you to prove something slightly different

282
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,423
That's how an armed robbery can end up charged S8 felonies

283
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
It sounds like Echoes bouncing around a canyon

284
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
Committed theft while having a deadly weapon

285
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:42,431
Committed theft while having a deadly weapon and either display the weapon brandished it indicated that he possessed it or used it

286
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,063
On top of all that you've got sentence enhancement what are known in Cleveland is Speck

287
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,135
You can tuck inside particular charges

288
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Repeat offenders facts

289
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:56,511
Gang specs guns back to the most in Cuyahoga County

290
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,863
Usually one and three-year mandatory prison time for the use of a gun

291
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,983
Even though the use of a gun is baked into the definition of many charges already

292
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
The result

293
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,871
Is it kind of indictment shock and awe

294
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
Charging like this

295
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
What's known as stacking charges or just

296
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Overcharging

297
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Induces please

298
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Of course it does

299
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,927
Because the prosecutor can accordion the indictment however he needs

300
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
If you play will drop everything but the felonious assault

301
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,839
Or you go to trial on the phone formidable indictment

302
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:36,191
And chances are if you go to trial you're going to get convicted of something

303
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,031
Just a visual of a long indictment is a signal to the jury

304
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Look at this list

305
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
He must have done

306
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Something

307
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
I want some charges probably are going to merge at sentencing

308
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
As a rule the more stuff you're convicted of

309
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
The longer your sentence is going to be

310
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
So yeah

311
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
You played

312
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,511
That's why the prevailing practice in most Prosecutor's offices is to charge crimes as harshly as they can

313
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,583
They might swell prisons and eviscerate entire neighborhoods

314
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
It is efficient

315
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
All of this brought me to Brian ratigan

316
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
I wanted to know something very basic

317
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
How does he make his decisions

318
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
How much of what Brian's doing is coming from Brian

319
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
His own sense of what's right

320
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
How much is beyond his control

321
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
The job we've given him

322
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Yeah

323
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
Brian works in the major trial unit

324
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
Homicides mostly

325
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,767
In his office he's got a mini fridge and Annie - desk and window with the blinds drawn that overlooks Lake Erie

326
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Nothing Fancy by Longshot

327
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
Case files and boxes of evidence of child around

328
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Complaining chair

329
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Brian looks chart though

330
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
He wears a suit everyday

331
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
He never knows when he might be pulled into a courtroom

332
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:52,991
By the way his beard stubble scrapes against his collar you understand he's enduring the costume not enjoying it

333
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
He doesn't appear to Revel in his power

334
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
He favors the aw shucks variety of dominance

335
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
From what I can tell Brian is universally respected in the Justice Center

336
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
He's forthright

337
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
His compassion you can't take a joke

338
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
38 married to little kids

339
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Irregular amiable guy

340
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
Today's I spent with him he had 20 cases on his docket

341
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
One aggravated vehicular homicide

342
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Rape case

343
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
When phone is assault which

344
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
You normally wouldn't. But the guy assaulted three police office

345
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
The rest

346
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
Murders are aggravated murders

347
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Mostly drug deals gone bad

348
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,623
Some b******* like retaliation thing out

349
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Yep

350
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,743
All day people are knocking calling texting

351
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
He's getting updates on cases

352
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Giving updates on cases

353
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
He decided yeah

354
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Iraq

355
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,519
Brian takes a call from Ray Diaz a homicide detective

356
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
He's working on a shooting case

357
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
Have an outside of nightclub on the Westside

358
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
Detective Diaz tells Brian they're about to interview a witness

359
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
Gregory call me when you're done

360
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
That this is a guy that we've been

361
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,767
He was with the defendant and we've been trying to get him to come in and then do an interview and every time he says he's coming in heat

362
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
Cancel Zoraida never ride or

363
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
Weed shop in his house and he's not there

364
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,959
So we last week I print out a subpoena for the two homicide detectives

365
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,543
They want serve them and so he just called and said he's going to be here today so

366
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
This is excellent timing

367
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895
Brian has a pre-trial on that case this afternoon

368
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
Right now. He's about to have a meeting with two other detectives on another case

369
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
They just walked in

370
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
AR

371
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Harada

372
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
Articles and Rhonda Gray

373
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
The same one from Dave on the case

374
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
I know

375
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
They wouldn't let me record them

376
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
They were there to talk about a case that it made the news

377
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,679
Wasn't kind of shooting you usually hear about in Cleveland

378
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,519
It started as a squabble between strangers on a city bus

379
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Then spilled onto the sidewalk

380
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,127
When older man had shot and killed a younger man

381
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
Brian explain to me that this case was unusual for them because the entire episode was recorded by

382
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Security cameras on the bus

383
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,903
This is one of those rare cases where you

384
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
You see the whole story

385
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,767
90% of our cases were not watching them

386
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
Unfold

387
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
The answer for if something is caught on

388
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,775
You know my camera whatever usually it's from a distance and you don't care the dialogue and you don't get to see everybody's reaction you don't

389
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
Have seven different angles are nine different angles of it

390
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
You know this is like the the outlier

391
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,247
Crazy I can't believe I have to watch this whole thing and see

392
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
All the decisions that were made that led to this guy dying

393
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Is your watch

394
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
You're watching like God just didn't you want to tell him what to stay out the bus

395
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Stop the bus

396
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
This incident happened three and a half weeks earlier

397
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
The older guy was in jail

398
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
But he hadn't been indicted yet

399
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,679
The meeting with detectives this morning is to figure out how they're going to handle it

400
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,239
What charges Brian should present to the grand jury

401
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
This is a tricky one now

402
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,919
Because Brian can see how the whole thing unspooled now he's not sure a crime even occurred

403
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
The stories in the newspaper had quoted police as saying that the older guy the shooter had been harassing passengers on the bus

404
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
But the bus videos for the opposite

405
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
The older guy the shooter

406
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
He was the one being provoked

407
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
It's possible this was self-defense

408
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
We got a conference room

409
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,655
Does big screen set up so they can watch the footage from the bus

410
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
Brian had mentioned something about 7 or 9 camera angles

411
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
I thought he was joking

412
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
He wasn't

413
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
For exactly this reason

414
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,431
Crime city buses in Cleveland or wired up like itinerant Bank Falls

415
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,759
The British were watching starts from before the beginning

416
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
When everything was calm

417
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,623
Okay what happened when they thank you thank you

418
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
The older guy the shooter

419
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
His name is Abdul Rahman

420
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,767
I gotten on the bus at Public Square

421
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Right near the Justice Center

422
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
He's in his early 60s but he looks older

423
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
Is that a long grey beard a loose sweatshirt

424
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
A scruffy

425
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
He's not homeless but he might have been mistaken for homeless

426
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,407
You see mr. Rahman sitting in a window seat by the rear doors of the bus minding his own business

427
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
He's holding what looks like a folded newspaper or magazine in his hand

428
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Any younger guy sits down next to him

429
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
They don't know each other

430
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,672
But evidently the younger guy starts insulting mr. rahkman

431
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:22,816
You can't make out what he saying but other passengers told the cops later that he was complaining to mr. Rahman that he smelled that

432
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,888
The younger guy is not the one who gets shot by the way

433
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Mr. Rahman gets up

434
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
I still leave a seat

435
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Younger man blocks him

436
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,384
Ryan's watched all this before but he can't help wishing it won't go the way it's going to go

437
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
Skechers keepsake

438
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
John Adam

439
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,552
Skip said there's an open spot right up there just go sit there

440
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
The younger guy is being an a******

441
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
Ginning up a confrontation

442
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,744
Is Brian pointed out assholery is not a criminal offense

443
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
He finally lets mr. Rock montage

444
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,376
Mr. Rahman stands by the bus doors

445
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
But it doesn't move to a different part of the bus

446
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
You still arguing with the younger guy

447
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Who started get physical now

448
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
He slaps the folding Magazine from Mister Rock Montana

449
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
ASRock mybatis rather gracefully to the floor

450
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Fix it up

451
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,552
You say you're going to get shot

452
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,880
It's not clear but you can hear mr. Rock monse

453
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
I like my freedom

454
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:26,816
I'm not going to fight with you start name-calling

455
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
B**** you b****

456
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Younger guy says

457
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,168
Call me another b**** I'm the f*** you up

458
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,008
It's familiar this scene

459
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,080
A bunch of strangers getting into it on public transportation

460
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,664
And the whole time you're doing the bystanders trigonometry

461
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
How long till I stop

462
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
Should I say something

463
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Where are we

464
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Should I move seats

465
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:53,696
At this point a woman named Rachel asked the men to Canna she's sitting nearby with a few other people

466
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:59,840
Including her boyfriend Andrew Easley the man who's going to get killed in about 2 minutes

467
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:06,240
Rachel says to the guys arguing hey can't you see my niece is sitting right here

468
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
Get your ass off the bus and come down and he does this Rock Mine gets off at the next stop

469
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,712
Then he lingers on the sidewalk

470
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
You just want to scream walk

471
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:23,648
Walk the extra 5 blocks for god sakes but he gets back on the bus

472
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,976
10 seconds later the younger guy says this

473
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
It is especially hard to hear but it's important

474
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:36,192
Because it's possible this is what jacked up the situation

475
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,264
He says I got a CCW

476
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,848
CCW stands for carrying a concealed weapon

477
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Gun license

478
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
He's implying that he's armed right now

479
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Legally

480
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
He does not have a gun but presumably mr. Rahman doesn't know that

481
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,624
Then the younger guy pulls the cord to single he wants to get off at the next stop

482
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
He says to mr. Rahman

483
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Get off the bus

484
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,536
Let's Take It Outside you and me

485
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
He's up in Mister rachmones face

486
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Sex laughing at him

487
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,424
Mr. Rothman pulls a gun

488
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
His own gun

489
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
He's got it in his right hand

490
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
And he pointed at the younger guys head

491
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
Rachel and the other people in the bus

492
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
Start freaking out

493
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,736
The bus pulls up to the stop

494
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,296
Rachel muscles her way to where Mr Rock MineZ

495
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
The doors open

496
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
And then she kicks him Square in the butt

497
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
Straight off the bus

498
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:33,024
Onto the sidewalk

499
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,608
Her boyfriend Andrew Easley is right behind her now

500
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
He steps off the bus

501
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Is tall and lanky

502
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Dressed all in white

503
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
Long white shorts

504
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
White shirt white hat white sneakers

505
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
He strides toward Mr Rahman

506
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
Is walking backwards now

507
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,712
Is Rahman holds up his gun again

508
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
Waves it around a little

509
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,064
Andrew easily Retreats quickly back onto the bus

510
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,648
Were the younger guy who started all this is hovering by the open doors

511
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:05,280
Then you hear Rachel and someone else say something you especially wish they had not said

512
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
Which is

513
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,144
That's a water gun

514
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Mr. Rahman is walking away now

515
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
But Andrew and the younger guy go after him again

516
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,336
Finally right as someone on the bus says something like

517
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
Why do you all go to beat up on this old man

518
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
Mr. Rahman shoots Andrew Easley in the Torso

519
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
He falls

520
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Someone starts screaming

521
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
Mr. Rahman jobs away

522
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
The police have statements from some of the people inside the bus but the statements aren't as reliable as the Myriad recordings we

523
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
You just watched

524
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,320
The detectives can see for themselves how the thing cranked up emotionally block by block

525
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,624
As a bus traveled East on Superior Avenue

526
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:09,536
I miss rockman's house they found a gun it fell out onto detective Ackles his foot when he was looking through mr. Rock men's clothes

527
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,632
They don't have casings but they're 99% sure it's the same gun from the bus

528
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Through question what happened here

529
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
Abdul-rahman used his own gun to shoot Andrew Easley

530
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
The question is

531
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Was it a crime

532
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,712
Okay princess so really the issue is did he have a choice

533
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Are these two guys coming after

534
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
What are the detectives nudges back says

535
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
I feel that argument won't work

536
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
I promise Rahman could have made other choices he could have gotten off the bus earlier

537
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Brian says

538
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,072
When he gets off the bus the last time he's walking away

539
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
He's not re-engaging

540
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
And he's got you guys have

541
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,056
One of the detectives suggests Brian might change his mind when he sees this one last video

542
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
We watched it later

543
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
One more camera angle

544
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,712
The part that detectives wanted Brian to see

545
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Is mr. rockmont posture

546
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Right at the end

547
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,624
Nobel point is I mean he's going backwards

548
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
But he is doing that we're boxing Shuffle

549
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,280
It's true he's doing a boxing Shuffle

550
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
Like he's fixing a fight

551
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,656
I learned mr. Rahman wasn't always called mr. Rahman

552
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,984
Decades ago he was called Ricardo Spain

553
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
And he was a heavyweight fighter

554
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,128
He mostly lost his professional bouts 23 losses at a 26 ft

555
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
One of them

556
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,040
And Now ladies and gentlemen man your battle station with against Mike Tyson

557
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Atlantic City

558
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,720
1985

559
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
Auto believe that that's actually where inside a minute

560
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Yes it is

561
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,120
38 seconds

562
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
Which is not the fastest Tyson ever knocked a guy out

563
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,312
Now I understand why the detective wanted to be sure Brian saw that last video

564
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Because it does make you wonder

565
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Was a former heavyweight

566
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
Who can still muster a boxing show

567
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,504
Really afraid of those two guys on the bus

568
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
After the meeting with the detectives

569
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
I'd say Brian was leaning slightly self-defense

570
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
But he's still not sure

571
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
And because he's not sure

572
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
He's going to let the grand jury make that call tomorrow

573
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,840
When they present the case for indictment

574
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,192
Technically of course the grand jury is always supposed to make that call

575
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,032
They're the ones who vote on whether there's probable cause to charge someone with a crime

576
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
But well for you lawyers and Legal Eagles

577
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Ham sandwich I know

578
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,944
For the rest of you I will spare you the ham sandwich cliche and just

579
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Explain

580
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,296
The grand jury is supposed to be a Citizens check on government power

581
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,392
But in practice grand juries usually vote the way prosecutors want them to vote

582
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:49,280
Probable cause is a Lolo standard you just have to show that it's logical to believe this person might have committed this

583
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Describe

584
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,656
A grand jury presentation there's no judge no cross-examination no defense

585
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,568
In fact in Ohio according to the State Bar quote even if a prosecutor knows of information which would help show that they could

586
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Cute person is innocent

587
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,664
He is not required to present it to the Grand Jury

588
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,040
How weird is that the cops in the prosecutor tell the grand jurors what they think happened

589
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,112
The prosecutor presents them with a proposed indictment

590
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
Hear all the charges We Believe fit this crime

591
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
If you guys agree

592
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
Sign right here

593
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
Brian's got to figure out

594
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
What charges is he going to ask them to vote on tomorrow

595
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,960
Like what will you write up in the indictment in terms of the charges to think

596
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,800
Murder I think is the high-end that it would be and

597
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:39,712
Below that is voluntary manslaughter and I think it goes between those two and involuntary manslaughter is basically like heater

598
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:46,112
The energy of passion or I are you being provoked it's it's it's a crime that's that's provoked but

599
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
And that's your

600
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
You're deciding on This Is Us

601
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,352
No I'm not the decider I am not the designer I don't decide anything except for what see what I'm going to wear today

602
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
It's

603
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,032
I'm sure he has to run stuff by the bosses down the hall usually saw at Wadala who supervises unit

604
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,104
Brother MO is also in the major trials unit

605
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,920
But the idea that Brian's not deciding anything

606
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,040
Because he could play this various ways

607
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,112
Find could show the jurors One camera angle

608
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Or 7 camera angle

609
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:26,048
He could present all the statements from the people on the bus or just the ones that say mr. Rahman was the aggressor

610
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,120
He could put murder on the proposed indictment

611
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,424
And never mention the word self defense

612
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
But this one he tells me he really can see it either way

613
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
Crime or no crime

614
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,640
So his plan is to put the whole megillah in their laps

615
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Let the grand jurors decide

616
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992
He's going to show them all the camera footage

617
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,296
Read them all the witness statement

618
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
He talks at 3 with a paralegal

619
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Nida

620
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:54,464
He's preparing the materials for the grand jury

621
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,072
Should we do the video before we talk about what each one says or play the movie

622
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
What do you think

623
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
I think I want to play the video first

624
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:09,056
See that he doesn't want the camera footage to be colored by the statement

625
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
So it's going to be footage first

626
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
And he decides

627
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
He is not only going to mention self-defense

628
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,760
He's going to explain self-defense

629
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Tell them what the legal elements are

630
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,648
I might have you throw something together for me real quick on self-defense

631
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
Stuff

632
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
He goes and gets the pages

633
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:36,704
It's whatever self-defense the following elements must be shown in this is out of a hot spring court case

634
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,032
Slayer was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise the

635
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Two situation

636
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,920
So you're had a Bonafide believe that he was imminent danger of death or great bodily harm

637
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712
You didn't instigate it

638
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,784
You had a genuine fear that you'd be killed or badly hurt

639
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,344
Duty to retreat

640
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
And you tried to get away

641
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,952
But if you just want to add in those two things

642
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
I'm going to give it to you and then you can

643
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
Why later Brian tells me

644
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,400
He's thinking he's not going to put murder on there

645
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
Just the voluntary manslaughter

646
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,544
This is not set in stone yet but I believe it's just going to be voluntary manslaughter

647
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
I don't think there's going to be a murder charge

648
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,968
When did Becca decided I think that that's what it's what it's going to be

649
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:25,600
There's clearly some education here there's clearly some you know he's being prodded

650
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,160
All right I mean I think you can see that in the video it's

651
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
And it's

652
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,024
Clear from the beginning the guy the kid wanted to let him get out of the seat

653
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
I mean there's some

654
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
She didn't start this so

655
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Nnnn it could be

656
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,288
I mean here and in really for my perspectives like it's not it if

657
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,664
It's not so much matter what I think right now it's it's kind of what

658
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
What the grand jury is going to think

659
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
I can also I'll play for them in

660
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,112
You have a point of view that you're going that's going to come across for sure

661
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
How you present things how you

662
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:07,840
What you stress what I mean it's probably hugely influential I don't mean it in a creepy way I just mean like

663
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:12,192
Yeah I think so but I also try to be fair to the process you know I mean I don't want

664
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
Down to just say

665
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,056
What do you think what do you think

666
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,616
You know because I know what what's the point I might as well just

667
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,944
If it was if I was going to do that way

668
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,760
Why even do the whole thing why

669
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,552
Wiper the video from y

670
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,672
Talk about what each witness in their size why talk about where they are in the bus I could just go in there and say

671
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
You know we shot them you should have shot them

672
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Indictable murder

673
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
You know if

674
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,376
In a case like this I think it is so important to

675
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
Give the full picture

676
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
And

677
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
If they have the full picture

678
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
They should be able to make the decision based on that

679
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Not not on what I say

680
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,408
Afterwards I went down to the first floor Atrium to get a snack

681
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
Bedroom has a little cafe and tables and chairs that you have to choose carefully because they are frequently sprinkled with bird poop

682
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
Now you know

683
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,232
I was chatting with the manual and then we started talking to these three defense attorneys we knew at a nearby table

684
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
I told him about the rocmon case

685
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,608
About how much material Brian ratigan was going to show the grand jury

686
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
Interfaces

687
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Onelook

688
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Furious

689
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Another was smirking

690
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,800
One of them rolled his eyes at me but I might be making that up

691
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
Regardless the chest was clear

692
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,944
He's putting on a show for you it's never like that they said

693
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272
They never have that much evidence before they go to the grand jury

694
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
People get indicted for stuff in 90 seconds

695
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
No discussion

696
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
I knew you were coming

697
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
Sucker

698
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,512
Are all people who know Brian rattigan

699
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Who respect them

700
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,632
But such was their disbelief that actual fairness could be at work upstairs

701
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
That was kind of loud as possible

702
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
I told Brian about this conversation

703
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
A little awkwardly

704
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,152
Hebrews just like all you got played sister

705
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Why

706
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,992
Because then I'll be busted

707
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Ted

708
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
Jack Bob

709
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,880
Your secret's safe with me I did not tell

710
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
But I did want to know

711
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,488
What did Brian think of what the defense attorneys were saying

712
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:17,376
The prosecutors and cops are taking cases before the grand jury office seeking severe charges

713
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
Based on thin information

714
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,496
Before the crime has been investigated in any real way

715
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
His answer was

716
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Yeah that does happen

717
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,920
Sometimes you do get cases that are solid right from the get-go

718
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,480
Or maybe get lucky with evidence I put this rock monkey

719
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
And again sometimes there's just not

720
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
There's just not enough there

721
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
And

722
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:44,256
Or we we think we have enough and then you learn information on later on I'm going to get remember a lot of times to your underwear

723
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Time crunch

724
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,096
He's talking about speedy trial rights for defendants

725
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
Also if they don't indict within 10 days

726
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,520
The defendant get a preliminary hearing before a judge to determine probable cause

727
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,080
What's the prosecution does not want

728
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,944
That is a whole procedural nonsense that you do not want me to get into right now I promise

729
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,040
But what it all means is that they are in a hurry to get cases to the grand jury

730
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,856
Brian told me it's all about speed

731
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,880
Unfortunately

732
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,512
Again speed might not be a problem if you didn't have 13,000 felonies to process

733
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
But you do

734
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,888
So yeah it's obviously not ideal when investigations aren't fully cooked

735
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
But Brian said

736
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
Sometimes you've got a major crime in front of you

737
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
If somebody is arrested for it and

738
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,848
I'm going to make a determination I mean

739
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,176
What you going to do if you if you really think that you have the guy

740
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
That you have the right guy

741
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
Do you want them out on the street to

742
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
You know say it's murder

743
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,392
You want on the street to go do another one or

744
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
Just so you know I think we've got enough here

745
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,512
You know it sounds so

746
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
It's not perfect

747
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,144
And sometimes because of that he said they make mistakes

748
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:00,544
And sometimes because of that this is me talking now with cases like Dave on

749
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
But what are you going to do

750
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
More after the break

751
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
This is the road to hired

752
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Brought to you by ZipRecruiter

753
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,768
Gretchen heebner is the co-founder of kodable

754
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,864
Take me to computer game starring little aliens exploring the galaxies

755
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,984
Family

756
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
The buses are fun

757
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,592
But secretly they're helping kids learn to code

758
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,664
By teaching them everything from algorithms to JavaScript

759
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
The game work so well

760
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,088
But it's now the center of a computer science curriculum that's in tens of thousands of elementary schools across the u.s.

761
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
Does the game became more successful

762
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
Gretchen.

763
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Okay

764
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,232
We need to step up our graphics

765
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,304
I actually did all of our artwork up until

766
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,608
Three months ago are you trained artist

767
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
No

768
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
Basically I sat down and was like okay I need to learn illustrator

769
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
How are characters got their shape

770
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
Okay what's going to be the easiest thing for me to animate

771
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,760
Something without arms or legs

772
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,832
In order to find someone who could draw arms

773
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,904
Gretchen posted an ad for a game artist on ZipRecruiter

774
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:25,536
She really loved that she could pose deal-breaker questions but all her candidates had to respond to like

775
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,840
Why do you care about educational games

776
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
A lot of people

777
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,216
One sentence or one word answers

778
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,776

This afternoon the main thing Brian's got is a pretrial

806
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,968
Humble back of the hallway pretrial

807
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:52,064
Which is precisely where I'll get to see the most powerful guy in the equation

808
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Brian

809
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,904
Do the very thing a half-century of legal tinkering has

810
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Remind him to do

811
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Negotiate a plea

812
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:03,072
The case is the one that detective Ray Diaz called about this morning

813
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
It's a nightclub shooting

814
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
The defendant name Dominique Williams

815
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
I've been at the M&M Saloon

816
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,824
And when the place went out for the night Williams allegedly shot and killed a guy right outside

817
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Bunch of shots

818
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
Fairly close range

819
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:22,272
As Williams was running away an off-duty police officer working security at the club started after him

820
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,808
William shot at him

821
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
Didn't hit him with the cop shot back

822
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
And hit Dominique Williams in the butt

823
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,952
Who's arrested on the spot

824
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,000
I got was found under porch nearby

825
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,816
Detective Diaz calls again

826
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
And tells Brian about the witness he brought into interview

827
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,192
Witnesses a friend Williams was at the bar with

828
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
Apparently

829
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,496
The friend talk

830
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
Docker

831
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,616
So we've got he's identified

832
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,688
He identified Williams as a shooter then

833
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Okay

834
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,136
All right well that's a pretty good statement for us then I guess huh

835
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:07,072
When you when you come up Ray can you are you going to do you think you'll be done with him out by what time is it

836
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Should have said I want 15

837
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Okay

838
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,240
Brian's pretrial in this case starts in 15 minutes

839
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,824
Does Carl puts Brian in a stronger position to negotiate

840
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,688
On the way to the elevator Brian sees his supervisor so I would Allah in the hallway

841
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
Kissimmee Swift update on this new evidence

842
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,576
What's good

843
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
We take the elevator up to 16

844
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
Head to the pre-trial area

845
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,256
Brian finds Dominique Williams Attorney Craig Weintraub

846
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,096
He's been assigned this case along with another attorney who didn't show up today

847
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
They sit down

848
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
Craig starts to talk about a possible plea

849
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:49,056
He doesn't know about the ID witness cops are interviewing downstairs at this very moment

850
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
We got to present an offer to you is that the deal

851
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
Well

852
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
One thing I should tell you

853
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Diaz the Gotti

854
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
That

855
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
Williams was with

856
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
His body at the bar

857
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,463
That we were able to track him down he just interviewed him today

858
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,023
And he IDs your guy says yeah yeah

859
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
Walk outside

860
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
Walk out before your guy

861
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
And then

862
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
Wine walks out

863
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,239
He says that then I see you and I don't walk out

864
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
But the victim

865
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
Derek yanetta

866
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871

Yeah okay

873
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,631
And so now that he's seen sunlight

874
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,727
Where did he go by the way why did he disappear and

875

What's been his story occamy hasn't stuff forward to say oh my God I witnessed a homicide

876
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,871
Understanding is that

He's been in contact with Diaz and stuff and just as

878
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,271
Start em up like five or six times to come down things to do

He doesn't want to be a rat is going to rat on your guy

880
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
Currently he has

881

Brian is used to Craig Weintraub probably done about 10 murder cases with him

882
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,559
Fun fun fact about Craig Weintraub

883
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
Who represented Ariel Castro

884
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,679
The guy who imprisoned three women in his house for 10 years

885
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,727
Aftertaste like that

886
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,775
Maybe you either quit the law

887
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Or

888
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
You stick it out

889
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
Why is crack your way through the day

890
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
Whenever possible

891
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Regardless

892
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,503
I know you're talking about now he was the guy

893
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,087
Walked in and I saw him link being led by Diaz yet

894
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
A cane and a dog

895
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
You think I couldn't see

896
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,183
Get it

897
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,719
Brian plays along

898
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:48,351
He was being mad by Diaz those are props you'll get rid of before the trial

899
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,471
I'm going to get them into the courtroom were going to practice how many steps straight how many steps to the right

900
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
You know guys do

901
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
We do best

902
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,335
They start talking numbers

903
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Sounds like an auction

904
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
But that's how they're negotiating this plea

905
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,015
First figure out a prison sentence Dominique Williams can live with

906
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,367
Then figure out the charges will have to play to that'll add up to those numbers

907
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
I was looking at a range of like

908
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,535
Maybe 12 to 15

909
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,119
You don't get Smiles on their EC

910
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,167
Yeah I know you're not going to

911
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:28,031
I was going to rain to 12215 until you found this guy slithering around

912
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
Brian laughing because

913
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Laughable

914
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
There's no way

915
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,479
12 to 15 is more like armed robbery time

916
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,575
What do you think about him at number is on this

917
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
Flat timer or

918
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,975
It's going to be a big number if it's not going to be a life tail and I mean that stuff

919
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
That's the issue here

920
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
I'll Translate

921
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,607
What time means the number is the number

922
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
20 years is 20 years

923
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,703
Murder charges in Ohio

924
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
Kanye West called a life Tale

925
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,311
Murder starts at a mandatory 15 to life

926
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,127
Aggravated murder starts in a mandatory 20 to life

927
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
Williams is charged with both kinds

928
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,223
Which come with a raft of gun specs

929
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
If you get a life Tale

930
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
Se22 life

931
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,623
Means you have to serve 20 years before you can apply for parole

932
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,439
Which you're not likely to get at least not the first time around

933
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,511
So 22 life could mean 20 years

934
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,839
Or it could mean you spend the rest of your life in prison

935
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,655
Dominique Williams is 27 years old

936
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,959
Understandably he wants flat time

937
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,823
For that to work they're going to need to reduce the charges to some kind of manslaughter

938
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
What do you think

939
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
Realistically

940
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,455
Centanni's I mean it's not twenties

941
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
That was before

942
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,439
The other guy said yeah he's the one that shot them and I watch them yeah it's not so it's not a good fact

943
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,791
I mean I really think it could be a manslaughter with

944
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
Are range of maybe

945
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
14 to 20

946
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Potentially

947
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,847
But Peter is May I forgot I've got I have a police officer I got to worry about 2

948
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,431
So keep that in mind I mean that's you know that's

949
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,759
Where you're talkin if you if you want to range you're talkin

950
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
High twenties in the mid thirties probably

951
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
Or he just

952
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
Takes it on the Shenandoah murder

953
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
I got the light tail

954
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
Alright let's figure it out you

955
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,607
Whatever number they settle on

956
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
They're confident the judge will go for it

957
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,775
By the time we get back to Brian's office the detectives on the Williams case or waiting for him

958
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
To tell me more about the witness interview

959
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,151
Is Ray Diaz and also detective Jody Remington

960
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,247
Tourneau

961
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
Something

962
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Yeah

963
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,599
Brian and the detectives are easy with each other

964
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
No errors are formalities

965
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
You can tell they were together a long time

966
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Did you know

967
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
He said that he tried to eat

968
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,863
People been talkin but

969
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,519
Watching how closely Brian works with detectives all day

970
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,847
Give me an appreciation for why the system finds Prosecuting a

971
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
Cop so excruciating

972
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
Brian is had to do it

973
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:20,063
Just a month-and-a-half ago he prosecuted a Cleveland officer after he shot and killed the teenager 18

974
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,599
The broken into a store

975
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,159
The cop was charged with negligent homicide

976
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
A misdemeanor

977
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
Brian took it to trial

978
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,999
Not with relish

979
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
You're Nobody wants to do them

980
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,863
Let me know what if judges don't want them

981
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,215
Costumes on defense attorneys a lot of the police that are asking him don't want them

982
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
Because they're hard

983
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,103
Legally there complicated

984
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,175
Because cops are allowed to kill people in certain circumstances

985
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,759
But also for Brian they're morally complicated

986
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
Brian supports police officers

987
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,367
He knows how many guns are on the street

988
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
He thinks their job is harder than it's ever been

989
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,767
We also doesn't think that eighteen-year-old deserve to die that night

990
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,607
By Prosecuting the officer brydon feel like he was taking a side

991
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,399
He felt like he was doing his job

992
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,191
But at the trial

993
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,519
The police made it obvious they did not feel the same way

994
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
You were in that room

995
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,151
What was the thing that seemed the weirdest U&I

996
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,015
Me at the table by myself and like 40 police officers on the other side

997
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,343
Wasn't it I mean it it was weird

998
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,647
It was strange you know and then I had

999
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,951
One detective they came and sat with me

1000
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
You know that's weird

1001
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,279
I mean I know

1002
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
I know that

1003
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:40,191
But that's you see what I mean know how easy it can turn into

1004
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
Us vs them

1005
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
How they can

1006
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Alex

1007
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
But it looks like we've turned on them

1008
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
The all-around discomfort of that

1009
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
The police feeling attacked

1010
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,503
Brian feeling is a glaring at him like he's a traitor

1011
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,159
Plus the public perception that the government suits on the 9th floor will never really give their all to Prosecuting their Pals and blue

1012
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
Cuyahoga County recently changed its policy local cases of police shootings are now farmed out to

1013
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
Prosecutors from another County

1014
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,703
Incidentally the judge in that case found the officer not guilty

1015
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,311
And the judge was endorsed for re-election by the police union soon after

1016
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:24,479
Neither outcome surprise Bryan

1017
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:37,279
Back to the Dominique Williams case nightclub shooting

1018
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
That's what they think Williams is sentence should be

1019
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,399
I know you guys usually don't give a s*** but

1020
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,751
What are you guys thinking for a number for Williams

1021
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,455
I'm always open when I come to that

1022
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,647
Our victim did something before this to

1023
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,671
Bring us about

1024
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,743
He may have I think the problem that

1025
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
Dominique Casas

1026
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,119
I mean shoot some five times he's not armed

1027
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
And then

1028
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:19,007
He knowingly run from a police officer who's identifying himself and he has to

1029
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,567
Audacity to turn and shoot a policeman

1030
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,151
They're talking flat time and I I mean

1031
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
I don't know

1032
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
A mile baseball saying

1033
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,015
Twenties is a no-go I mean your

1034
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:34,367
And now that the one witness has identified him and said he's the shooter

1035
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,159
So I mean

1036
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,743
I'm not on the case so I don't know if it's my place to speak but yeah 20 seems low

1037
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
That's Chris Schroeder another prosecutor

1038
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
I was waiting to talk to Brian about a different murder case

1039
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,983
Executed this guy outside and then he shot the cop as he was fully

1040
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,775
Then shoot twice at the officer

1041
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:57,663
Find to Casey's on that side but I know the policeman thought he shot nor

1042
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,735
But even even this

1043
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
We brought in today

1044
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
Chat history over

1045
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,135
In traffic

1046
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,487
So it's it's if you want flat time it says

1047
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
At least 30

1048
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
Right I mean

1049
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
I would

1050
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Okay

1051
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
After the detective left

1052
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,871
Brian and Chris Schroeder discussed a double homicide

1053
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,919
Is that guy wants to plead

1054
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711
Chris said it'd have to be something like

1055
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
40 to life

1056
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
50 to life

1057
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
It's going to have to be a high Highmark he said

1058
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,903
I found these huge numbers shocking

1059
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,439
I'm not even sure why

1060
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,559
Obviously I know people get multi-decade sentences life sentences all the time

1061
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,655
Maybe it was because I just been reading about Germany's sentencing practices

1062
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,215
We're sentence for the very worst crimes

1063
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,031
Usually last about 15 years at most

1064
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,871
Or maybe because I've now seen and talked to people

1065
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
Young young people

1066
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,967
We were staring at the prospect of 10 years

1067
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
14 years

1068
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
Never desperate

1069
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
And I talked about this for a while

1070
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,695
I told him about my conversation with Charles Wakefield

1071
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Ariel's father

1072
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,303
He wanted the person who killed aavielle to be punished

1073
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:22,911
He also considered what happened to his daughter a quote-unquote accident

1074
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,495
He knows whoever shot her didn't set out that day to murder a baby

1075
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,775
It was a mistake

1076
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,871
By Justice Center standards his Vengeance was very conservative

1077
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,967
I can't remember how it came up at so she's kind of throughout the number like 10 years

1078
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:40,319
And I was really surprised cuz I was like you don't person get convicted for that murder

1079
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,135
There's no way 10 years is coming out the other end like

1080
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,463
You know anybody who's interested in me like that that seemed

1081
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,535
She could balance the scales in his head

1082
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,607
With that with a ten year sentence like that seemed about right to

1083
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,423
Do you think I'm 10 years for a little for killing

1084
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
Kelly kid

1085
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
I mean

1086
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,199
I don't know what the fair is such a weird

1087
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:11,551
Saying cuz I feel like I'm a person right to like me

1088
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Say it

1089
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,135
An 18 year old or 7

1090
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:15,903
18 year old

1091
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,231
Maybe 10 years is fair Because by the time that person is

1092
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,791
Closing in on 30 years old

1093
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,351
Totally changed and matured and like realize like

1094
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,423
Woohoo I'm a lot of horrible choices

1095
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,447
I don't know that

1096
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,215
You're going to

1097
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
Have a difference between

1098
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:35,359
30 and 50 or 30 and 60 or 30 and 70 in terms of a danger to the

1099
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
Republic

1100
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,175
I did that but that shouldn't be some aspect of

1101
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Of

1102
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
A significant part

1103
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Report to

1104
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
And I don't know that

1105
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:47,135
Ten years after taking a life of somebody is a not I just don't I mean

1106
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
I understand that there's going to be

1107
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:56,095
There is going to be that change and hopefully there is there's that real late realization like in your late twenties or something like holyshit I

1108
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
F***** up

1109
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
Yeah I f***** up

1110
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
But

1111
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,471
I don't know that that's

1112
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:07,871
Just because you have that realization then you should be able to get out there should be some aspect of a punishment with the Punisher

1113
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,199
For I don't know any years and years for like

1114
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
It's not just that it was a baby

1115
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Okay

1116
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,575
It was a

1117
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,159
Blatant disregard for everybody's safety on that street

1118
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Thank God we all sing

1119
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
Make a chat okay

1120
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,791
At this point I feel like even I need a reminder

1121
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
It is not Ryan's job to sentence anyone

1122
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
That's for the judge

1123
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,215
But certainly Brian is teeing up the sentences people get

1124
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,519
He's thinking about sentences

1125
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,591
It was also striking to learn what Brian was not thinking about

1126
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Deterring crime

1127
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,431
Or who exactly is getting locked up

1128
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,271
He doesn't come to work every day thinking about criminal justice policy

1129
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
That's not what's guiding him

1130
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
You know

1131
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:56,511
Deterrence and laws and how to fix communities and all that type of stuff like

1132
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,791
I try not to

1133
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:02,911
I kind of think of it that way I think it's just we're better off worrying about our

1134
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,191
Are victims here

1135
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
Because

1136
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
When I'm

1137
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,775
Talking to somebody that

1138
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:12,639
They had their son killed or their daughter killed her mother raped and murdered

1139
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
They don't care about the deterrent

1140
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
They don't give a s*** about

1141
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,015
Somebody else's kid or whatever

1142
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
They care about what am I doing for them

1143
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
And

1144
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
That's what I that's how I try to keep it

1145
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
So I try to think of what can I

1146
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:30,303
The best thing I can do for these people you know sometimes it's a play sometimes going to try whatever

1147
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,607
Hit some

1148
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:39,007
I don't know that we ever if we deter people we hope we do I mean that's why

1149
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,823
We have some of these sentences and things like that but

1150
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:47,455
And we've got gun specs now for people that if you commit a crime with a gun you're going away from our prison

1151
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:52,063
And we have one of your guns back some 3 year and 5 year and 8 year specs and

1152
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:57,439
I think they're great but I don't know if it's a limited amount of guns that are on the streets you know I mean

1153
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,279
But isn't the touring the night sky from picking up a gun I don't know

1154
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,887
Brian is using all the legal and procedural tools at his disposal

1155
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,423
All the tools we've given him

1156
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,703
Resolve case

1157
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,495
Mostly through please

1158
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,591
But he doesn't know if what he's doing is making Cleveland any safer

1159
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:19,199
You can't consult research that'll tell him what sentences equal what result

1160
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:24,575
Or a Statewide database showing whether sentences are being applied equally without racial bias

1161
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:31,231
Because and I know I mentioned this before but it Bears repeating because it is a massive black hole in our own understanding of

1162
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,023
Marrone criminal justice system

1163
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:37,631
But there is no comprehensive data on sentencing we don't keep track

1164
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:44,543
What we do know is that overall more and more prosecution's longer and longer prison sentences

1165
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,359
Well they do have some effect on crime

1166
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
But not that much

1167
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,711
It's very little bang for such a huge box

1168
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:57,087
That's why Brian concentrates on the only result he can really see day today

1169
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,415
We just want some measure of Peace descends on a crushed family

1170
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,719
So that's what he aims for

1171
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,815
A punishment big enough to trigger the healing power of Retribution

1172
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,143
I mean that's the way you have to look at it he said

1173
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
Because if you look at it any other way

1174
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:17,055
Did lose your mind

1175
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:29,855
Dominique Williams wasn't going to agree to 30 years flat time he also rejected an offer of 20

1176
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
Need a life

1177
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,927
Instead he took it to trial

1178
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,463
He was convicted easily

1179
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
He's now serving sentence

1180
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
35 years to life

1181
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,375
And the grand jury vote on the abdul-rahman case

1182
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,935
They know build the voluntary manslaughter

1183
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,031
They did not think he should be charged with a crime for shooting and you're easily

1184
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
Seems they decided

1185
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
It was self-defense

1186
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:56,991
After spending about 7 weeks in jail this rahkman pleaded guilty to illegally having a gun

1187
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,039
He was sentenced to two years probation

1188
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,903
Brian met with Andrew Easley family to tell them about the grand jury vote

1189
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
He said they were unhappy about it

1190
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
But that he thought they understood it

1191
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:12,863
Many months later I interviewed and release older sister Jacqueline

1192
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
She did not understand it

1193
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,471
Should watch the security tapes from the bus

1194
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,591
She didn't understand why the prosecutors didn't charge the two people whom she thought inside of the thing

1195
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,431
Andrew's girlfriend Rachel who kicked Mr Rahman off the bus

1196
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,759
And the younger man who'd initially believed Mr rahkman

1197
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
And she didn't understand why mr. Rahman himself wasn't charged

1198
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,439
She didn't think he was acting in self-defense when he shot her brother

1199
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,279
The two people that did put their hands on their shoes

1200
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
So you had every reason to shoot

1201
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,631
If it was self-defense

1202
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,727
You know they come to Peyton you slapping you kicking you

1203
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
Okay yes offense

1204
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,055
Running touch

1205
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,103
My brother and say one word to you

1206
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:01,503
Could you understand how a grand jury could watch those same tapes and come to a

1207
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
Different conclusion than you did

1208
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Nope

1209
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
We didn't ask what how you know

1210
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
Why but you know they really that

1211
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,791
Give me an answer ASAP now all we do is present

1212
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,583
And it's up to the grand jury

1213
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
It's all I got

1214
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,727
Now

1215
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,031
I don't know I mean I know a lot

1216
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
A lot about

1217
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,871
Did you justice system politics

1218
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,895
But now

1219
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,759
I asked Jackie what would have been different for her family

1220
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
What would have felt different

1221
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,367
Mr. Rahman had been indicted for murder or manslaughter

1222
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
She couldn't say exactly

1223
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
It might have helped some she said

1224
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,511
But it wouldn't have helped a great lot

1225
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,583
Either way her brother would still be gone

1226
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,911
The pain of that would still be radiating through her family

1227
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
Even so she said

1228
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
She wanted it

1229
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:12,159
The best outcome you can hope for when a crime happens to you is that your pain is acknowledged

1230
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,719
But the person who harmed you is punished

1231
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:20,607
