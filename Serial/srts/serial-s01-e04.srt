00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
Previously

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,048
Material

3
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,376
While you're digging your body you're going to find somebody else

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,168
That's looking for

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:13,312
I walked along the edge of the log expecting to find a body real soon I never saw one

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,712
Lincoln Park MI where is that do you know where it is have you ever been there what shopping

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,272
Alex friend of mine

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,904
Normal for me to leave school to go do something and then come back

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
This is a Global Tel Link prepaid call from

10
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
An inmate at Maryland Correctional Facility

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago and serial one story told

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,248
Week-by-week I'm Sarah Koenig

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
Remember how last time I ended by saying that the detectives had other leads in the

14
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,720
Does case besides mr. ask the guy who found his body

15
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,280
But they were also starting to look at at 9

16
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,608
The reason we know that is because of this memo

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,448
The memo was dated 12 February 1999

18
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,544
Trump detective Darryl Massey to detective Greg mcgillivary

19
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,128
This memo he's talking about is regarding an anonymous call

20
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
That's detective Ritz on the witness stand at trial

21
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,040
He's talking about how they got this Anonymous call three days after his body was found

22
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,880
The call came in to detective mascia Baltimore County cop

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
The car must have been an accident of some kind because Massey's report described him as an Asian male 18 to 21 years old

24
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,376
So it's unclear whether Asian in this case means East Asian like

25
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,192
Korean or South Asian like Pakistani

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
But anyway

27
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,544
Mystery caller says look at the ex-boyfriend

28
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
The caller for their advice with boyfriend

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,968
I'll take him to the the Beckham to Linkin Park on past occasions for sexual encounter

30
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Project including the phone interview to call it further stated that the victim broke off the relationship with her boyfriend about a week before she

31
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
She was reported missing

32
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
The caller hangs up

33
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,792
Then a few minutes later the same guy calls back and says oh yeah

34
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
By the way

35
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,168
This time to call a remembered about a year ago the suspect informed friend of his

36
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,752
Francis passarelli Asian male 17

37
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
Enterprise season

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
If he

39
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,896
Ever heard his girlfriend he would drive her car into a lake

40
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,504
This time the color mentions a friend of an oz

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Vasarely

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
Actually the name of this friend is Yasir Ali

43
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
The color says Yasir might know something

44
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,488
Hang up again the cops can't trace the call

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
It's out of range

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
Anonymous call The Detectives

47
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Call I don't know anything quote

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
Wanted to get rid of the car where was he do so

49
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
Ali indicated somewhere in the woods possibly in Centennial Lake or the Inner Harbor on quote

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
Who has ever gotten to the bottom of who made this Anonymous call the cops in figure it out another term

51
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
He didn't figure it out figure it out 2

52
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
For a while I couldn't let it go because it seemed to me that whoever made this call he must be the key to the whole

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
But so far I only have gases that I can't responsibly say out loud

54
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
Today after the Pizza Hut tok on February 16th

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,528
The detectives do some paperwork that will ultimately crack the whole case open for them

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
They get a subpoena for a non cell phone records

57
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
The results of that sir

58
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,536
Subpoena include a list of all the calls dialed and received this phone on January 13th

59
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
The day he disappeared that list will become a piece of paper

60
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
All the thousands in this case

61
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
Will become their map

62
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Snow following

63
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
I called I called like Footprints the front door

64
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,344
Would you look at that call log from January 13th

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
There are 34 calls that day

66
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
Obviously the first thing they have to do is figure out who all the phone numbers belong to

67
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Home cell and pager numbers

68
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
Once they do they realize

69
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Wait a minute

70
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
One person was called six times that day

71
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
Much more often than anyone else

72
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,823
The person is an 18 year old girl named Jennifer pusateri

73
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Is not a friend of Adnan

74
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
She's a friend of Jay

75
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Remember Jay had a nun's car that day

76
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
And his new cell phone

77
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Eason Chan

78
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
Got to swear you won't tell nobody

79
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Forgot to tell you

80
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,231
That's Jen talking to detectives about the night of January 13th

81
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
All right but I got to tell you I got to tell somebody I can't

82
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
Sounds like

83
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Feels Like Home

84
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
At 9

85
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Shohei

86
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
That's what I want to say

87
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
What do you mean okay

88
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
By what

89
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
How when

90
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Where are you know

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
If you want to figure out this case with me

92
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Now is the time to start paying close attention

93
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
Because we've arrived along with the detectives

94
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
At the heart of the FAE

95
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
This interview with Jen happens on February 27th 1999

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
The day before on the 26th the cops have gone to find Jen at our house

97
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Explain to come downtown

98
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Tok

99
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,967
Jen is Thoroughly we doubt she says she can't right now she's busy maybe later

100
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
Jennifer and go CJ

101
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
He's at work at a video store

102
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
She tells J

103
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
The police want to talk to me what do I do

104
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,463
A trial Jen says

105
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,839
He told me to go down there and tell them what I do tell them enough to keep me out of trouble

106
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
And tell them to go see Jay

107
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Send them his way

108
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,495
Bojangles downtown to see the cops later that night

109
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
And she lies to them

110
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
So she doesn't know anything

111
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,663
I seen the detectives notes from that interview and they're remarkably uninteresting

112
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,527
By the time she left that night Jen thought it was possible she was about to get charged

113
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
A trial she said the last thing detective megillah very said to her that night was quote everyone's a suspect and no one's ass

114
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Respect

115
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
So the next day she goes back to the detectives

116
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
This time she's got reinforcements

117
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
She's got an attorney with her plus her mom

118
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
They turn on the tape recorder

119
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
Who what where when why

120
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,311
That's why when you said that

121
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
Having said that

122
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
A broken heart

123
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
Did he say anything else

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Emotive

125
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
Hey broken nose heart

126
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Anime

127
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
He strangled her

128
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
Which of course they already knew

129
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
But then Jen's information gets a little muddier

130
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Yes and where it happens

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
He told me

132
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,727
He told me is what he told me he asked asked me what we should do

133
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
He said you think we should go to the police now

134
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
And tell them right now

135
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
And I said

136
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
I don't know

137
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
I said

138
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
What was your involvement

139
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
You involved

140
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
And he said no he said show me her body

141
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,231
And asked me if I would help her bury his Burberry and I would help him

142
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Carey Hart body

143
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
And

144
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
I said what did you do did you help him

145
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Do you know where the body is

146
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
No I just

147
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
Take me to someplace in the city and I drop them off

148
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
I told you that I went down

149
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
From a different place in the city

150
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
And I don't

151
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Number where they said they went

152
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
I said how did

00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735

Yeah when you don't like when was this done and over with

155
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Yes

156
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
He strangled her

157
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
In Best Buy parking lot

158
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
I don't know how we got the Best Buy or anything like that

159
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
I saw the body in the trunk of a car

160
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
Anon asked me to help bury her but I didn't I refused

161
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,407
I took him some place and later picked him up someplace at some chicks house

162
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
He told her that all this went down at the Best Buy parking lot off Security Boulevard Woodlawn High

163
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
High School

164
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,719
Winter of 99

165
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Almost everyday

166
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167
Elementary School in the same class at Woodlawn they graduated the year before in 98

167
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
It was a freshman at UMBC University of Maryland Baltimore County

168
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
Resetting biochemistry sorority

169
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,639
When he disappeared gems on winter break

170
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
She's working part-time as a lifeguard

171
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,783
What are the jobs at F&M a discount store

172
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:02,463
Jensen on January 13th been hanging out earlier in the afternoon at her house after she got home from work

173
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,583
Oyster House sometime between 3:45 and 4:15

174
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
They plan to meet later that evening

175
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,543
But then Jenna got the message Jay was running late he wanted her to pick him up in the parking lot of Westview Mall around 8 p.m.

176
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
She goes there and she sees them together

177
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,967
She says J get out of a non scar non says hi to her

178
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
She says he seems to be acting normal

179
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,111
Jay gets in her car and that's when he tells her about the murder

180
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,767
After they driven a little ways Jay mentions shovels the shovels and none had used to dig in the park very hey

181
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
That they were Jays shovels

182
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
From his house

183
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
Jamison Smith at

184
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
You are an adult the shuttle

185
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Vegetables

186
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
I don't know how many they were

187
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
But he's mentioned to me that he knew that were at my put the shuttles

188
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,455
Back to Westview Mall to the dumpsters back there

189
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
So the Jake and retrieve the shovels and wipe the handles clean in case of fingerprints

190
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
After that

191
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
JK back out of my car

192
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
Usually shooken up

193
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
He was like you have to take me to go see my girlfriend now

194
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:14,399
Next day Jen said she drove Jay to the F&M store the same one where he worked

195
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,983
So that he could throw out the clothes and boots he was wearing the previous night

196
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,543
He pitched into a dumpster behind the store

197
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Tops points out

198
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,943
Forgot I was telling you he didn't kill anyone and didn't help dispose of a body

199
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
He sure is taking a lot of precautions

200
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
He clarifies

201
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
Jay wasn't alone when the body was buried

202
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
Jerry was a long body

203
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
The Martian

204
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
My understanding

205
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Yeah

206
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
It wasn't until today

207
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,175
I was just don't think that I don't think that you would lie to me

208
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Fishball

209
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,343

00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Llcj health

211
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Find a cop asks

212
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
We run on and Jay best friends

213
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
More like casual acquaintances

214
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
What's the detective talk to Jen everything happens very fast

215
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
The same night the video store where you work sexual p*** video store which come trial

216
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Attorney will stress with relish at every opportunity by the time

217
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,695
Turn on the tape recorder it's 1:30 in the morning on February 28th

218
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,303
I am willing to answer questions and do not want an attorney's this time my decision

219
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,191
Cheney interview room and initially he pulls a Jen he tells me nothing or less

220
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
He walked in the mall that day

221
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,847
Got his girlfriend a bracelet for birthday around with Jen's younger brother

222
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
Touchwood Nan sometime in the afternoon

223
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
Then after two pages of notes like that it says

224
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
All right I come clean

225
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,135
At least that's what I think it says the detectives handwriting is messy so maybe it says

226
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
A bright I came down

227
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
20 minutes later they start taping

228
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Tells him a whole different story

229
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Gwinnett more or less matches Jen's

230
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
Except for one major difference

231
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,287
One major piece of information about this crime that the cops are still missing

232
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
They do not know where his car is

233
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
I've been looking all over the place for it they can't find it

234
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
Now J tells them

235
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
He knows where it is

236
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
During the

237
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
Interview prior to turning the tape on

238
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,279
Miguel ran myself that you'd be willing to take us out and show us where the vehicles Park

239
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Call are you still willing to do that yet

240
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
So that's huge for them

241
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Jay will take them to the car

242
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
He does

243
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,799
Once they're finished at headquarters they all drive out in the middle of the night to where the car is parked

244
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,383
Put a grassy hill behind some row houses off Edmondson Avenue

245
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
Within a few hours they'll have a warrant for anions arrest

246
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,767
We know what you AJ did we talk today

247
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
What do you mean like what do you mean j a story isn't true

248
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
He says he doesn't know why either very mention J's name and connect

249
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
Action with his own arrest you just confused

250
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:42,527
You know what we talkin about

251
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,903
Stop playing

252
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,023
It's not like there was some secret feud between Jay and Adnan least not that I know of

253
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,143
There's no drug deal gone wrong neither had bad mouth the other Stone the others girlfriend

254
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,727
It sounds like they didn't even know each other very well

255
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,823
When I first asked him what their friendship was like what J was like as a person

256
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
I normally have to reach

257
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
He was like

258
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
It wasn't that into sports

259
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
Okay

260
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
White people music

261
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
Listen to

262
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Heavy metal

263
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
I just you know just

264
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,359
Call like a huge long conversation that we ever had other than

265
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
Like a specific subject

266
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
New York

267
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,855
Would necessarily like

268
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,719
We wouldn't necessarily be kicking it per se is a non speak for

269
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
Yes we smoke weed together but we weren't close

270
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
Close with Stephanie Jay's girlfriend very close

271
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,775
Turn on says that's the only thing he can think of now that might have turned against him

272
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:14,175
Stephanie was smart to the top athlete at the school and she was beautiful by any standard she look like a model

273
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,807
She came from a family of achievers who did not approve of Jedi but had no problem with an on

274
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
Stephanie's relationship with a non affectionate they were with each other of the constant talking on the phone the prom

275
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255

277
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,631
I don't know what thinking maybe Christina Saturday or someone said

278
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Christina was a lawyer

279
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,471
Like you know what I was talking about clothes I was

280
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Persephone

281
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
They were like you know

282
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
Aha moment

283
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,367
I'm thinking about all the things

284
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
You know that took place between us

285
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,999
Mad at me

286
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
Anon says exactly

287
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Because they weren't good enough friends for betrayal

288
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
He says it was more a feeling of Injustice

289
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,663
Toll-by-plate

290
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,503
Maybe the police will put them up to this maybe somehow he got caught up

291
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
I kind of like

292
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,047
Don't know I don't know if there's a part of me that I don't want to make an accusation against someone else

293
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
Not being sure that could happen to me

294
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,495
A year after Adnan was arrested and the case came to trial

295
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
J walk up to the witness stand

296
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,383
There was a moment when Agnon muttered something to him he says he couldn't help himself

297
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
The judge called the attorneys after the bench

298
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,831
I was just informed by my Sheriff that the defendant made a comment to the witness as a witness approach the stand

299
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
Indicating that he was pathetic the judge said

300
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
Mr. Syed

301
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
But up until now he's been perfect

302
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Don't spoil it

303
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
In the first

304
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
Turn to someone he didn't even know all that well to help him with this murder

305
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,687
Say why would Batman call you

306
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:29,343
Criminal element of Woodlawn he says

00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,975
Is that a real or perceived perceived

308
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,559
Call Paula Steele body

309
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
Pictures of really know me know that I'm not like that but

310
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
Application

311
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Because of the contact you have with

312
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
Helping him get his marijuana

313
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
He thinks that you're in that element that

314
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
Godly daddy willing to assist in

315
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Disposing of the body

316
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Robert Jessica

317
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,671
Domino's online order where

318
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
In her closing argument at trial

319
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,839
Prosecutor Casey Murphy pose this

320
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
Question to the jury about Jay

321
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Think about it she said

322
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
Do you really believe that the defendant meaning Adan

323
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,407
Go to one of his upstanding Magnet School honor student friend or friend from the mosque to assist them with this app

324
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Of course not

325
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
Someone who behaves a little more dangerously than those people

326
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Can you just someone who took risks

327
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
The defendant hopes that you will look at Jay and say

328
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
I don't believe him

329
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
That is why the defendant chose J

330
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,839
Because if something went wrong the defendant could point the finger at J

331
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,471
This idea this is what J's more less trying to communicate to the cops

332
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,335
Ask him if you're actually not the type of guy who knows where to bury a body

333
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Then why did you help

334
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Why didn't you go to the police instead

335
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
He gives you his car keys

336
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
He gives you his cell phone

337
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
Called you a time that he's going to call you

338
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
50 Cent

339
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
When you do absolutely nothing

340
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
How many

341
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,887

So I mean it wasn't

347
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
You're selling marijuana

348
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
So if I go to the cops

349
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
Say hey this guy's going to kill her

Donut crazy

352

But they're just drug dealer in

353
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,487
This is where you get to s***, this is how we deal with

354
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
And he's got a rap sheet this long and

00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Morning

359
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
Dog sit down

360
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
Cristiano find my own house

361
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
It's not this

362
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
I mean seriously man I've been coming home

363
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,439
Elena Street in the snow

364
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Walking to my own house

365
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
These are place to do that jazz

366
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
They didn't trust any

367
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
In my mind I don't think

368
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,127
It never crossed my mind I could be getting shot at and I wouldn't be let's call the cops

369
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
Okay they say

370
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,295
So if you didn't want to go to the police yourself how about making an anonymous call then

371
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,391
You could have done it right after he shows you the body as you're leaving the Best Buy parking lot

372
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
You're driving off the parking lot

373
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
Why don't you stop your car and say

374
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Call the police

375
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
Someone who just committed a murder there's a body in the trunk

376
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,007
Young Stan Lee

377
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
I call it is

378
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
Are you afraid of if you make Anonymous phone call you can give a description of her car

379
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
You give me the tag number

380
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Yes

381
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,464
If you have any questions you can ask me on Facebook

382
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
I'm trying to understand

383
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Why you go through all this

384
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
Adjust bike shock and then

385
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Happy Valley

386
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
Part of it so I couldn't

387
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,384
J what he has over you or

388
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Your involvement

389
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
Is beyond belief

390
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,880
Other than you being afraid of the police either he has paid you something or

391
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
Like I said he knows I sold drugs I mean

392
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
That was dumb

393
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
I mean

394
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,376
If you get me locked up for that I mean

395
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,752
I'm sure if I ratted him out for killing hey did he wouldn't hesitate to turn me over selling drugs

396
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
Training else that you'd like to add to this

397
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Feel bad

398
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
Boy unique names

399
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
I feel bad

400
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,048
GameStop by Arrowhead

401
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,800
He says I just feel bad about it that's all I got to say

402
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
The cops have a struggle with j

403
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
The struggle with j

404
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,904
She's the biggest mystery of this whole case for me

405
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
The cops interview him at least four times that I know about

406
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Two of those are on tape

407
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,912
And J also tells the story a trial not once but twice cuz the first proceeding ended in a mistrial

408
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
So at least say six

409
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
She's told what happened

410
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
And each time some details chef

411
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,664
Some of these discrepancies seem small to me and understandable

412
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
But summer significant and confounding

413
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,088
And that distance between wear a certain detail starts and where it ends up

414
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
How far it slides

415
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Wyatt slides

416
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,744
I spent Untold hours trying to measure that distance

417
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Trying to weigh it

418
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,584
4 Clues as to what might actually be true

419
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,424
This is from taped interview number one

420
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,264
The cops are asking about what he in a non did that morning of the 13th

421
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
Picture of where you get from that

422
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Are we headed towards Russia Mall

423
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Shopping together

424
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,272
Interview number two

425
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
March 15th

426
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
2 weeks later

427
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
And where did you go

428
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
We went to Security Square Mall

429
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
That's a different Mall Security Square Mall

430
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Couple miles away

431
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,352
I put this one in the category of probably not a big deal right

432
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
Maybe Jay misspoke when he said Westview initially

433
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
They're a bunch of little things like this

434
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:15,104
For example when they're driving around that afternoon after they've ditched his car at the I-70 park and ride

435
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,688
For the first trial Jay says they both got high in a duns car

436
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,248
But the second trial he says only he smoke

437
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Anon didn't want to

438
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,088
Then they're more significant changes

439
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,416
But still you can chop them up to Jay trying to protect his friends

440
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
Or trying to protect himself

441
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
And the first taped interview

442
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:37,888
Chase's they're grabbing some food at a restaurant when officer Adcock called and not asking if he's seen hey

443
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
The next time he tells it

444
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
He says it when that call comes that a friend's apartment

445
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,336
A friend whose father happens to be a homicide detective in another County

446
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,968
Jshealth akachi actually been to her house three different times that day but didn't want to get her in trouble

447
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,832
In the first tape statement Jay says he refused to help dig a grave for her

448
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
Two weeks later he says they both got the whole

449
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
But then

450
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
There are other changes

451
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Bigger changes

452
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
Where is harder to judge why the details chef

453
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
This one for instance

454
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:15,520
In the first taped interview Jay says Adnan only told him that same day that he was going to kill her

455
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:20,128
AJ says that an ion has started talking about it beforehand

456
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
Four or five days before

457
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
I think I'm going to kill her

458
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,272
He said he said that a lot

459
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
Conversate with him several occasions you said that

460
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,696
And he says his help with the murder on the 12th

461
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232
Night before he disappeared

462
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
In this version

463
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
Jay tells Jen about Advance 2

464
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Take us back to the first version again

465
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
And then you didn't really take it seriously

466
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,344
There's a whole side tripping on Andreas probably take that afternoon after has been killed

467
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,904
Smoke some weed in Patapsco State Park

468
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,744
That trip disappears by trial just dropped out of the narrative

469
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Whereabouts in between the time he drops it on back at school at midday and when he meets back up with him later that ass

470
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Afternoon

471
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:21,568
The stories about where he is are so messy and so confusing that I can't even keep the different versions straight

472
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
But none of these discrepancies

473
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
Gives me or I think the cops

474
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,736
As much pause as its next one

475
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,832
This is the mother of what the cops called Jay's inconsistencies

476
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,696
It's about where it done first showed him his body in the trunk of a car

477
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
Here's from taped interview number one

478
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,608
Jay says Adnan called them about 3:45 p.m. saying come pick me up

479
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,400
I went to pick him up

480
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,496
Orthodontist Avenue strip and yeah

481
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Pop the trunk opening

482
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,176
Edmondson Avenue off of the strip

483
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:03,808
Any cross streets on Edmondson Avenue where you go meeting I don't know my name

484
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,416
A strip is a small outdoor drug Market just like a block we can buy drugs

485
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
Jay tells the cops

486
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:14,048
But it takes me about 15 or 20 minutes to get to location on Edmondson

487
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:19,936
Later when the cops drive out with Jay to get his car chase chosen the spot on Edmondson Avenue

488
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,752
It's just a few blocks from where they ditched his car he said

489
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,824
Listen to what he says on March 15th

490
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
And why

491
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,944
In route to your house if you receive a phone call from Aetna

492
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,016
Yes on his cell phone which is in your possession

493
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
And

494
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,856
The conversation was what

495
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
That picture said

496
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
Come and get me

497
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
Best Buy

498
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Best Buy

499
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
Just like John had originally told them

500
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
This is a problem for the cops

501
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
This change

502
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
Because it's not something you forget

503
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,800
Where you were when you saw a dead body in the trunk of a car

504
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
It's not a slip of the tongue

505
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,152
But it's not clear what the calculation is

506
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,224
Edmondson Avenue versus the Best Buy parking lot

507
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
What's the advantage of one place over the other

508
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,576
Why tell this lie

509
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
Maybe he's just saying it because it matches Jen Story

510
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
Or did he lie to Jen in the first place and then forget

511
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
Better friend whose work for a long time in the Baltimore judicial system

512
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
She knows a lot of cough

513
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,936
But you reminded me when I was telling you about this case

514
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
Cops are the most skeptical people in the world

515
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,080
They pretty much assume everyone is lying to them all the time

516
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
Richard macgillivray aren't newbies

517
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:37,760
Mcgillvary came from a law enforcement family his father had been catching the homicide unit in fact

518
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,160
And Ritz was known in the department and in the State's Attorney's office as a skilled and meticulous investigator

519
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
So they're not suckers

520
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,536
They're taking careful note of the changes and Jay stories

521
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
That's why they keep going back to him

522
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632
Clear up the inconsistencies

523
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,728
In a second interview confronts J

524
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
Taking off a list of the main things he lied to them about

525
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Enchantments to all the lies

526
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:07,200
But even so what struck me is that they don't really press him on any of it

527
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,784
The most forceful mcgillvary gets is in this Exchange

528
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
About the location of the trunk pop

529
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
He

530
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
Actually kill her

531
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
Add Best Buy to my house

532
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Do you know

533
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
You weren't present for that picture

534
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Why did you lie

535
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
About

536
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
The location

537
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,616
Somebody had spotted him doing what he was doing and what have you

538
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Actually

539
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
Sister murder

540
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
Why would you lie about

541
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
Because I'm a location

542
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
But you did lie

543
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,792
Chasing I figured there were security cameras at Best Buy so that's why I lied

544
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Has anyone be associated with a

545
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
What is he talking about

546
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
This is nonsensical

547
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
What he told the Edmondson Avenue version

548
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,824
He was already deeply associated with it

549
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,152
And if there were cameras at Best Buy parking lot

550
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
When that help his story

551
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,808
They showed his car or non walking around or putting his body in the trunk

552
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
But mcgilvery let's It Go

553
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Lausanne to another point

554
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,024
Just so you know as best as we can tell from workers at the store and from the former landlord

555
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,888
There probably weren't security cameras in the Best Buy parking lot back in 1999

556
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,960
There's certainly no mention of any security footage in the police report

557
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:43,712
At the end of both of J's tape statements the detectives come out with it

558
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
Are you telling us the truth right now

559
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672
On February 28th after Jay's told them off tape that he doesn't know anything about the murder

560
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,256
Your story has completely changed since you first came in this room

561
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
All the information that you provided during the center

562
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Is it been a complete route

563
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
And then Jay reinforces at

564
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
All right

565
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
I believe that concludes his interview

566
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Remember

567
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Okay

568
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,904
But of course 2 weeks later big swaths of his story of changed

569
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,720
So I asked him again and March 15th

570
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
Detroit

571
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Interviews if you

572
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
He's giving us right now

573
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
Is that true

574
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:37,984
To the best that I can possibly human being at this point in time member that is true

575
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
Did you

576
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Kill

577
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Palin

578
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,176
Were You There When Adnan still there

579
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,976
I put it to Bill Ritz when I talked to him briefly on the phone

580
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:05,376
A story kept changing catching inconsistencies and he was having to explain them and clean up a store

581
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
Dory

582
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,704
Ultimately

583
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:16,128
Chris said they believed a story because quote we were able to investigate and corroborate what he was saying I'm quote

584
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,688
So how exactly did they corroborate it

585
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,856
