It's called from This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week I'm sorry

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
The last year I spent everywhere

23
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,728
Working day trying to figure out where a highschool kid was

24
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
For an hour after school one day in 1999

25
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Or if you want to get technical about it and apparently I do wear a high school kid was for 21 minutes after school one day

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,808
299 this search sometimes feels undignified on my part

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,904
Ask about teenagers sex lives where how often with him

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,864
I'm not a detective investigator

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:46,240
But yes every day this year I tried to figure out The Alibi of a 17 year old boy

30
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:52,896
Before I get into why I've been doing this I just want to point out something I never really thought about before I start working on this story

31
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,248
And that is really hard to account for your time and a detailed way I mean

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
How to get to work last Wednesday 4 instead

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Drive Walker

34
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Bike

35
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
Is it raining

36
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Are you sure

37
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Did you go to any stores that day

38
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
If so what did you buy

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Who did you talk to

40
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
Name every person you talk to

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
It's hard

42
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,960
Now imagine you have to account for a day that happens 6 weeks back

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,520
Is that the situation in the story I'm working on

44
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
Which a bunch of teenagers had to recall a day six weeks earlier

45
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
And it was 1999 so they had to do it without the benefit of texts or Facebook or Instagram

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
Just for a lark I asked him teenagers to try it

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
Do you remember what you did on that Friday

48
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,232
I can't remember anything

49
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
No

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
I can't hear anything that fall back

51
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
Pretty I'm pretty I'm pretty sure I was in school

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
I think no

53
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
That's Tyler he's 18

54
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Not clue

55
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
Albion School

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Actually I can't work that day

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,832
DIY work that day and I went to school as that it

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,952
Actually on second thought

59
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Didn't I didn't I didn't

60
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
To Sam's friend Elliott

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
You seem to have better recall

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
Actually I'm a God movie that night later

63
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
22 Jump Street

64
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Okay

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
And what did you go with friends

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
Sam Manny

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,296
Did Shawn Carter bunch of people

68
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
Okay to Sam says he was at work

69
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
So that it wasn't that nice then

70
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,864
When kid did actually remember pretty well because it was the last day of State Testing at his school

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Nightclub

72
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,752
That's the main thing I learned from this exercise which is no big shocker I guess

73
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
Is that a fun significant event happened that day

74
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
You remember that

75
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
Plus you remember the entire day much better

76
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,504
If nothing significant happened then the answers give very general

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
I most likely did this or I most likely did that

78
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
These are words I've heard a lot lately

79
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Here's a case I've been working on

80
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,280
Almost 15 years ago on January 13th 1999

81
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
A girl named Hae Min Lee disappeared

82
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
She was a senior at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County Maryland

83
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,775
She's Korean too smart and beautiful and cheerful and great athlete

84
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Field hockey and Lacrosse

85
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
She was responsible

86
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
Ready for school she was supposed to pick up her little cousin from kindergarten

87
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Drop her home

88
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
But you didn't show

89
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,855
That's when Halley's family knew something was up when the cousin school called

90
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,023
Body was found in a big Park in Baltimore

91
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,887
Maintenance guy who discovered her there

92
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
He noticed a bit of her black hair poking out of shallow grave

93
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,799
The cause of death was manual strangulation

94
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Did it with their hands

95
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,199
A couple weeks after that I'm 6 weeks after she first went missing

96
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,063
Ex boyfriend was arrested for her murder

97
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
He's been in prison ever since

98
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:24,863
I first heard about this story more than a year ago when I got an email from a woman and Rabia choudry

99
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,727
Best friend

100
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,639
I used to be a reporter for the Baltimore Sun

101
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,735
And she come across some stories are written about a well-known defense attorney in Baltimore

102
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Could been disbarred for mishandling client money

103
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
It was the same person who defended Anan

104
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
Last major trial in fat

105
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,375
Not just botched it actually went through the case on purpose so she could get more money for the appeal

106
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Later she been sick

107
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,127
I don't get emails like this

108
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
I read a few newspaper clips about the case lookup a few trial records

109
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
The case was like a Shakespearean mashup

110
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Young lovers from different worlds

111
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Supporting their families

112
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Secret assignation

113
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
Jealousy suspicion and honor besmirched

114
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
Exactly but a Muslim all the same

115
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
The Final Act of murderous Revenge

116
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
A regular old high school

117
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Across the street from the 7-Eleven

118
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,079
Hi how are you I am I seeing your name correctly

119
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Rabia

120
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
She's surrounded by paper

121
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
Files BlueStacks binders crappy looking boxes

122
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,575
I'll court documents in attorneys files from add-ons case

123
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Some of the papers were warped and discolored

124
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
How do they look wet they look like wet

125
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,559
You have been yeah this event damage because because the boxes have been in a car on and off

126
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
For 15 years

127
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
Herself mostly does immigration stuff

128
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:09,823
At the corner of a much larger open space that I think is a Pakistani travel agency that's hard

129
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Tell

130
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Sing this little strip mall

131
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,527
Across the parking lot there's a new Pakistani restaurant and African Evangelical Church in Indian clothing shop convenience store

132
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
On the sidewalk outside I found a teeny weeny bag of marijuana

133
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
Baltimore county is like this at least on the west side

134
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,279
Through a lot of middle-class and working-class people go many immigrants included

135
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
To get the kids out of the badass City

136
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Nevada city is close by

137
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,983
Is 40 too short and she's got a beautiful round face Rain by hijab

138
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,567
She's adorable looking but you definitely shouldn't mess with her

139
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
She's very smart and very tough

140
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Crush you

141
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,711
Her brother's side with attributes office to the first time I went

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
He's 33 and mortgage broker

143
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
More laid-back and Rabia

144
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
They told me about Adnan Syed

145
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
The friend

146
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
Not just a good kid but an especially good kid

147
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Smart

148
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
Kind goofy handsome

149
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Arrested for murder

150
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
So many people who knew him were stunned

151
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
He was like The community's Golden Child

152
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
We'll talk more about that

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
He was an honor roll student

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
Volunteer EMT

155
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
He was like on the football team he was a

156
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Star

157
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
Star runner on the track team

158
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
He was

159
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Homecoming King

160
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
Healing prayers at the mosque

161
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
So he was

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
New Adnan to be you know

164
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Somebody's going to do something really big

165
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Later fact-checked all these accolades of course

166
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
Mostly right though she sometimes gets a little loosey-goosey with the details

167
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,471
Anon wasn't empty but he didn't volunteer his paid for it

168
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
He was on the track team but it wasn't a star

169
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,847
He did play football and he did leave prayers on occasion

170
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,687
He wasn't homecoming King but he was Prince of his junior prom

171
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Minnesota high school is majority black

172
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
You pick the Pakistani Muslim

173
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
To get the picture

174
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
He was incredibly likable and well-liked

175
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
White kid

176
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
This conversation with Robbie inside

177
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
This is what launch me on this year long

178
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,839
Obsession is maybe too strong a word what's a fascination

179
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
What does case

180
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,983
By the end of the shower you're going to hear different people tell different versions what happened the day Hayley was

181
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Killed

182
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Let's start with the most important version of the story

183
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Told me first

184
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
And that's the one that was presented at trial

185
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
The state's case against Adnan what like this

186
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
TNA been going out since junior prom

187
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
Wasn't supposed to be dating at all was born in the US but his parents are from Pakistan

188
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
What if Muslims

189
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
No drinking smoking a girl's all that

190
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:47,007
Even though they were also

191
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
What teenagers do so long as they didn't get caught

192
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,639
Has relationship with a secret

193
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
The state use this against him in two ways

194
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
First

195
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
He put everything on the line

196
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Relationships

197
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
This girl

198
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,231
So that when she broke up with him eight months later he was left with nothing and he was outraged

199
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
He couldn't take it

200
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
What do what a liar he is

201
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Duplicitous

202
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
Play Sturgill Simpson at home and at the mosque but look what he was up to

203
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
Start remember the prosecutor's closing argument at trial

204
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
His family didn't know that he actually drank

205
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
He smoke

206
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
He was having sex

207
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
This was proof of bad character

208
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Someone who could be a murderer

209
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
But that says if it not guilty of anything

210
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
Is it being a normal kid with immigrant parents

211
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Selective prosecution

212
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Had

213
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,095
Painted anion as a totally like a bipolar or like a maniacal dual personality

214
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
I mean I'm the same way I lie they could paint the same thing because I was

215
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
Was actually homecoming King which I don't know if my sister even knows

216
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
So I mean I was dating a girl that was

217
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,551
Why is homecoming King bad is that such a good thing

218
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,159
It's a damn it's a mixed-gender so so I was in the same boat

219
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
My parents

220
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
My sister didn't know about this at all I mean

221
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
It right now 10 years more than 10 years later she's fine

222
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
Hangout

223
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Admit on one side like my family thinks I'm a virgin but on the other hand I played

224
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
But it's

225
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,455
Like that right there I mean it's kind of making her feel uncomfortable

226
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Saint Raphael found the whole thing

227
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
As for physical evidence

228
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
There was none

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Nothing

230
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
Apart from some fingerprints in his car which should not have been in many times

231
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
There was nothing linking him to the crime

232
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
No DNA no fibers no hair

233
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
Matching soil from the bottom of his boots

234
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,727
Instead with a hat on a Nan was one guy's story

235
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
I got MJ

236
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,823
He's the third person you need to remember in this crime story

237
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
Besides Hannah.

238
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,759
Was a friend of an on-site been in school together since middle school they weren't super close but no friends

239
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
Turn on smoke together

240
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
The story Jay told police had problems

241
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
Because it kept changing from telling to telling

242
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
By the time I left his office at first day I understood only one thing clearly

243
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Understand

244
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,871
What is it was somebody is lying here

245
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Give me a gun really is innocent

246
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,783
What did he did do it and he's got all these good people thinking he didn't

247
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Someone is lying

248
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
And I really wanted to figure out who

249
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,263
In the early morning of February 28th 1999 was arrested by Baltimore City detective

250
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
He's asleep in his bed when they showed up at his house

251
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
They took him straight from his untidy bedroom

252
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
Turn interrogation room at homicide downtown

253
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
What are non didn't notice it just hours before they picked him up

254
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
The cops had interviewed his friend Jay

255
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
This is a taped interview of Jay

256
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,463

Specifically the Colonel's conference room

259
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,983
The police recorded two taped interviews with Jay and I'm going to play you the second one from a couple weeks later only because the sound quality is much better

260
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
Just a warning that the tape is a little upsetting to hear in parts

261
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Why don't you go ahead and tell us

262
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199

00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
Free stuff

364
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
You helped him.

365
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
How long did it take you

366
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
Did they take the whole

367
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
25 minutes

368
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Audi

369
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
Did you make the home

370
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Maybe

371
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,167
Wasn't very deep at all

372
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Equal work

373
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
I want to say that but

374
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
So those are the key points

375
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
Anon told Janet

376
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
She did it

377
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
We buried her

378
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,159
A story wasn't just the foundation of the state's case against Adnan

379
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
It was the state's case against Adnan

380
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
It's cold

381
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
Describing a crime of passion hair

382
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
This is something much darker

383
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,191
Methodically map out the death of your friend

384
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,263
Strangle her with her own hands so close up like that

385
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:30,175
A killer but a master liar and manipulator psychopath probably

386
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,647
Maximum Security Prison in Western Maryland

387
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,207
He calls me at my request about twice a week

388
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,535
Direct me from a bank of eight payphones in the Rec Hall

389
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
Pretty large room where other guys are sitting at tables with middle seats

390
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Attached to them

391
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,191
Playing chess or cards using a microwave or watching TV

392
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
And get a little loud sometimes

393
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,359
Once I asked if all 8 phones are always occupied he said because guys have been in for a long time

394
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
How to call

395
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,991
21st in person I was struck by two things

396
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
He was way bigger than expected

397
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
Barrel-chested and tall

398
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,183
Minnesota sightseeing

399
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,815
30 to life in prison becoming larger and properly bearded

400
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
And the second thing what you can't miss about Adnan

401
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
Is that he has giant brown eyes like a dairy cow

402
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,031
That's a promise my most idiotic lines of inquiry

403
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
Could someone who looks like that really strangle his girlfriend

404
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Idiotic

405
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,575
You first heard a story of the crime I didn't mean for it to happen like that

406
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
He said

407
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
It didn't happen

408
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
None of this is true

409
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
At all

410
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,255
He said he had nothing to do with his murder and he doesn't know who did

411
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
He was announced first serious relationship with a girl

412
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,447
He said he loved her in the way of high school love but then also in the way of high school got over her

413
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,543
So that when they broke up for good sometime before Christmas break of senior year

414
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
He says he was sad for sure but not obsessed

415
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
I just sometimes wish like they can look into my brain

416
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,831
I see how I really felt about it and no matter what else I'm going to say they were seen that this guy had no

417
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,184
I have no ill-will towards whatever the motivation is to kill someone I had absolutely

418
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
You know what I mean

419
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
Don't you ever say why

420
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
Soulmate is mad

421
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,960
Going to never come with any type of proof or anything

422
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Everything

423
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,056
I was never mad at her that I was ever

424
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Angry with her that I have a threatened

425
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:42,016
Yeah that's the only thing I can really hold on

426
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
He's adamant about this you can hear it right he's staunch

427
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,984
To go back and tell his version of what happened that day

428
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
CJ story

429
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
Everything becomes a lot in maschera

430
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,432
Yes he hung out with Jay on the 13th both during and after school

431
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
He doesn't remember exactly where they were

432
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
What time it was

433
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,136
January 14th and folded like any other day

434
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
Normal mostly uneventful day

435
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
He says there are a couple of things that do stand out though

436
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
Stephanie's birthday

437
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
Stephanie was one of a dog's best friend

438
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
And also J's girlfriend

439
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Stephanie a birthday present

440
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,032
Stuffed reindeer which is given to her and second.

441
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Miss a friend English class

442
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,688
It occurred to me that days at

443
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
I was going to ask your boyfriend

444
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Did you get hurt

445
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
So sometime during the day

446
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
4 News

447
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
Hold up for a second

448
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,816
Stephanie of a president

449
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,168
Well. Stephanie was very close friend of mine

450
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
It was just

451
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
I just got to make sure that

452
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
She also got a gift from him

453
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
You know she had mentioned

454
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
She was looking forward to getting

455
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
We have to get to kiss that I gave her

456
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
So it just as I would with any friends

457
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
I just kind of

458
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
We don't want to check on that

459
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,928
You didn't get her a gift

460
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Can I have free periods

461
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
Jordan schools

462
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
It was not abnormal for me to leave school to go to

463
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
And then come back

464
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
So I went to this house

465
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
What happened to

466
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Get a present for Stephanie she said no

467
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
My car

468
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
And just come

469
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,624
Pick me up after track practice

470
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
So then what happened

471
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Well then

472
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
When school is over

473
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,816
I would have went to the library

474
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
I know that

475
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:08,960
I use chat with other music but if I was going to check my email using the library computer

476
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Sometimes I would go there

477
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,336
Because track practice didn't start until around

478
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,152
Maybe 3 or 3:30 ish

479
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
So I can start right after school

480
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,296
So they would appear to sign up almost like an hour hour and change

481
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,464
This hour and change after school this is the crucial window

482
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,792
This is the time when the state says hey was killed

483
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,680
School got out of 215 people remember seeing her after her last class heading to her car

484
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
Story on the cell phone records

485
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,800
She was dead by 2:36 p.m.

486
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
So sometime in those 21 minutes

487
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,664
Between 2:15 and 2:36

488
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
She strangled

489
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,784
Obviously the same window and non needed to account for

490
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Dakota

491
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
My case lived and died in those 21 minutes

492
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:06,048
Well maybe the library but nobody testified at a trial

493
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
To track practice

494
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,168
He does remember being a track one day when it was snowing which might have been that day

495
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,264
The coach testified that probably was there but he can't be a hundred percent sure

496
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
As a rule he didn't take attendance

497
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,152
After school is when his memories become nonspecific

498
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,040
Usually we did this are we probably would have done that

499
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,904
Did come to pick up at 9 after track that pardoned on seems to more less remember

500
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,744
Was Ramadan so it would have been fasting all day and hungry

501
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,328
It probably would have been closer to time for me to break fast

502
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
He would have came to pick me up

503
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,656
Everybody went to go get something to eat

504
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,240
So sweet after I eat and then I would have had to have gone

505
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
Did home by like around 7

506
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,688
Or usually like the last 10 nights of Ramadan my father would spend the night at the mosque

507
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
A lot of times I would take your food

508
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,600
Pixel format how to take it

509
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
Evening prayer

510
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,672
Did you ever

511
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
Leave the campus

512
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
Before the end of track track

513
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
Did you ever

514
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
You sure

515
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
I want to say that I'm 99% sure

516
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
The reason why I can't see hundred is because

517
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
I mean I understand that it comes across as

518
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:28,992
I don't know if it does or doesn't but it seems like I remember things that are beneficial to me but things that are beneficial thing that I can't remember

519
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,600
It's just that I don't really know what to say that a lot of it

520
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
I do remember it

521
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,952
Missing pieces that comes from what other people have sex

522
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
You know that they remember write any kind of

523
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:59,456
Ananda is problematic because

524
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,784
If he's innocent right it's any other day of course he doesn't remember

525
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
But you can also read it as

526
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,880
How convenient he doesn't remember the day

527
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
Story

528
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
Because he has no story

529
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
Definitely understand it's going to look at this to say all men must be lying is so coincidental

530
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
He doesn't remember what he did

531
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
I mean I completely understand that

532
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
Can I get that

533
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,664
Just feel like I said

534
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,736
There's nothing casual I can do

535
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
You remember that day

536
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,576
Nothing I can do

537
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,928
You know to Make Me Remember transcript

538
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
Telephone records

539
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,520
And it is what it is you're not you not have no control over

540
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
Is a long ordeal

541
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,576
Cell phone expert testified for 2 days

542
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
Lifetime when you're discussing cell tower technology

543
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Their absences and some bad weather close the courts

544
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
So six weeks before both sides rested

545
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
The jury

546
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
After just a few hours including a lunch break

547
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
They convicted in on a first-degree murder

548
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,288
Chaudhry was there in the courtroom when it happen

549
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
She said his mother was crying

550
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
She was crying

551
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,248
I hadn't slept through the whole trial so the first time she fully understood that the case came down to those 21 minutes

552
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
Was during closing arguments

553
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,624
When the prosecutor brought out of dummies head and strangled it in front of the jury

554
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,720
After the verdict Robbie went to see a nun in lockup

555
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
And so I went to go see her

556
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,840
I was at the first time I actually had a conversation with

557
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
I'm about

558
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,752
It what's going on and I was like the whole thing was turning on these 20-25 minutes like

559
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
It'll where were you at his

560
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:07,200
But you disappeared in January you know in March were asking me like where were you after school for 20 minutes on a specific date

561
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,992
What days are the same to me you know

562
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,832
He mentions that there was this one girl

563
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,160
An alibi girl

564
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,256
Block I could offer is he that I remember he's like as a girl I go to school with

565
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
Who is Asia McClain

566
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
Music right after I got arrested

567
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
She wrote me a couple of letters

568
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,472
And she said she was going to see my family

569
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,544
And she said she specifically remembers me being

570
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,360
At the library at the public library right after school

571
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,712
The Woodlawn Public Library is just across the parking lot from Woodlawn High School

572
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,272
Not technically part of the campus but it might as well be

573
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,600
He said I gave those letters to Christina Gutierrez to my attorney

574
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:49,184
He's like but you know apparently we didn't really check out so he's got to know

575
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
So they're not helpful to us

576
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
So this is the first time I heard of

577
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
The scroll

578
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,424
Asia McClain I had never heard of her before nobody had mentioned her before

579
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
Floor like

580
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,056
I wasn't Florida the time because I thought

581
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,896
I saw If he if this girl Road and the attorney

582
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
What criminal defense attorneys not going to check out a potential alibi

583
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,344
So I asked him I said you have a copy of this letter she said you have a caucus and send me a copy

584
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
A nonsense letter Sarabia and Heritage

585
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
The first letter in the first of two

586
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,328
Is dated March 1st 1999 that is one day after I was arrested

587
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
The top of the letter she notes

588
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,424
I just came from your house an hour ago

589
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
I hope I spelled it right

590
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,336
I'm not sure if you remember talking to me in the library on January 13th

591
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
But I remember chatting with you

592
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:45,760
She says we aren't really close friends but I want you to look into my eyes and tell me if you're innocent

593
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,856
If I ever find otherwise I'll hunt you down and whip your ass okay friend

594
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,232
My boyfriend and his best friend remember seeing you there too

595
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
That's what are number one

596
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,376
March 2nd another letter this one's typed

597
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Chattier

598
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:07,008
Pieces of evidence

599
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Students are saying

600
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Teachers are saying

601
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,848
Visit to his house

602
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,688
I don't think I Met Your Mother I think I Met Your Dad

603
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
Does he have a big gray beard

604
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
They gave me and Justin soda and cake

605
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,088
There's a whole bunch of people at your house I didn't know they were

606
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,904
I also didn't know that most want to take their shoes off in the house

607
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,256
I got it and I can take mine off my everyone out cold

608
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,584
Why haven't you told anyone about talking to me in the library she asked

609
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,680
Did you think it was unimportant you didn't think that I would remember

610
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Or did you just totally forget yourself

611
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,592
Remember seeing Asian Library

612
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
Then he remembers about it it's so high school

613
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,296
To go out with a friend Justin and Justin had confided that Asia was

614
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,624
A proper young lady in other words just wasn't getting any

615
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,744
Has Justin about teenager with her new boyfriend

616
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
Maybe the new guy was getting lucky

617
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,120
Rabia call Deja app

618
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
It's been a year since she wrote the letters

619
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
But she agrees to me as she told me

620
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,800
That day after school I went to the line Public Library

621
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:17,920
Amazon was sitting at a computer checking email or something and I sat down next to him we started chatting

622
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,528
And I thought was very popular boy in school is a handsome and piano

623
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
Popular with the ladies

624
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,904
So she was speaking to her boyfriend shows up a little bit later with a friend

625
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
And she's her boyfriend is really angry at her cuz he's like why are you talking to hit Outlets high school kids in a while you're talking to him

626
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Family hitting on you

627
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,216
And she remembers specifically that that day she went home with her when she went to her boyfriend's house

628
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
With him

629
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
And they got snowed in

630
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
And I still really have late at night

631
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,688
And she remembered that for the following two days schools closed

632
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
Associate very specific details about

633
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,040
Why should remember that day

634
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,600
Even wrote out an affidavit on the spot

635
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:03,232
She says she in a non spoke for about 15 to 20 minutes while she was waiting for her boyfriend to give her a ride

636
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,048
We left around 2:40 unquote

637
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
Remember hey supposed to be dead by 2:30

638
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,168
The kicker

639
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,312
No attorney has ever contacted me about January 13th 1999 and the above information

640
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,896
Benefit of the doubt for a second

641
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,224
Maybe at 9 never actually showed the letters to Christina Gutierrez

642
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Attorney

643
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Sure he said he did but

644
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Well I know

645
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,696
Deep inside Gutierrez notes on the case I have boxes and boxes of such stuff

646
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
There's this in her handwriting

647
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
Asia-plus boyfriend

648
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
Saw him in library 2:15 to 3

649
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,240
Date of July 13th more than 4 months after annan's arrest

650
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,336
This is written by one of the chairs as law clerks who visited in jail

651
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,408
Call Asia McClain saw him in the library at

652
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
3

653
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
Is your boyfriend saw him too

654
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
Library may have cameras

655
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,624
Yoy with the person never heard from a trial

656
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,208
Solid non crazy detail-oriented Alibi Witness

657
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,280
In a case that's so sorely needed Alibi Witnesses

658
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,632
I can't ask Christina Gutierrez cuz she died in 2004

659
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,936
Put that question to a few defense attorneys

660
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,592
Especially if it's just one person then it becomes one person's word over another

661
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,920
Single witness like that can backfire under cross-examination

662
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,248
Or they might take the focus away from the weaknesses in the states

663
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,416
So there are conceivable strategic reasons why Christina Gutierrez might not have wanted to put Asia McClain on the stand

664
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,744
What is inconceivable they all said

665
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,304
It's not ever contact Asia McClain

666
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,168
To never make the call never check it out never find out if her story helps or hurts your case

667
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
That makes no sense

668
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Whatsoever

669
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
That is not a strategy

670
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Is a fox

671
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,432
When I first heard about the letters in the word mistake

672
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
Never heard from

673
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Such a slam dunk

674
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Are done

675
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
Announce family hard annuity

676
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Who filed a petition in court based on the age affidavit

677
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:14,304
His argument was an honest trial could have turned out differently if Gutierrez had checked out Asia story

678
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,608
Until when should get some form of what's called

679
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Post-conviction relief

680
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
The hearing for her story by this time

681
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
He finds an address in the west coast tries calling sending messages

682
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
Nothing

683
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:35,808
Write a letter to her get it to a private investigator

684
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:39,392
Fiance come to the door opens it part way

685
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,464
Tell the investigator that she cannot speak to Asia

686
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
But that from what he knows about the case but not as guilty and deserve the punishment he got later the investigator

687
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
Gets a call from the fiance

688
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,704
We don't have to talk to you leave us alone

689
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
So I called off the search for Asia

690
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,128
Figuring once a witness turns on you like that it's too risky to keep pushing

691
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:06,528
And then at announce hearing on the new petition it comes out that Asia had done the very thing they dreaded

692
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,856
Asia had called one of the prosecutors in a nun's case

693
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
Mexican and Kevin urick

694
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,928
And undermined her own state

695
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
This is from a recording of the hearing

696
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
Mr. eurocast testifying on the witness

697
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Sanlitun

698
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
A young lady named Asia called me

699
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
It was its I don't know what happened to her and why she would do

700
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Do this again

701
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,656
She says it's not true that it was bullied into reading that statement 15 years ago

702
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
She can't fathom why Asia would discredit her own statement like that I don't know why they weren't the affidavit was written

703
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
Voluntarily

704
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,224
I'm going to turn in a license attorney I work on homeland security is like I have no reason to make

705
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Something like this up

706
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
You know I didn't even know she existed until

707
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
On top of the convicts

708
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
So what do you think

709
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,000
Happened why would they have this sort of violent reaction to

710
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,048
Helping out an on now

711
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
I don't know

712
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
It was

713
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
Just really odd

714
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Asian Chao app

715
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,896
After all they had the original letters and the affidavit that's all that should have mattered

716
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
But it didn't look good

717
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,480
Be natural for the judge to wonder

718
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,784
Why can't the defense produces Asia

719
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,600
Why is she making this call to a prosecutor

720
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
I mean anyone

721
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:51,232
I wondered I wondered if maybe she was pressured into writing that affidavit

722
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
She was hiding something

723
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,352
Like maybe she lied in those 1999 letters

724
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,984
Maybe she didn't really see I'm not at the library that day and I just wanted to insert herself into something exciting

725
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
She was grown up she wanted nothing to do with any of it

726
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,968
234 months after I first sat down with Rabia I become fixated on finding Asia

727
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
Bloodhound on this thing

728
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:18,368
Because a whole case seemed to me to be teetering on her memories of that afternoon

729
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,208
I have to know if I really was in the library at 2:36

730
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
TM

731
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Because he was

732
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Library equals innocent

733
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,168
It's so maddeningly simple and maybe I can crack it if I can just talk to Asia

734
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,288
I read her along gentle pleading letter and send it off to an address I found online

735
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,592
I'm calling people who know her

736
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
I think might know her

737
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:46,272
I'm checking the same Loop of Facebook MyLife LinkedIn sites over and over trawling for clues about where she might be

738
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Kakashi might think

739
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,160
You're wondering why I went so nuts on this story versus some other murder case

740
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,000
The best I can explain is this is the one that came to me

741
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:02,400
It wasn't halfway across the world or even next door I came right to my lap and if I could

742
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
Bottom of it

743
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Should I try

744
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,568
I start running down all the other information in ages 1999 letters

745
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
She mentioned they were security cameras inside the Library

746
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,992
I want to see the very nice manager there are Michelle hamiel

747
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,832
Was there a security system back in 99 that could have been checked

748
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Set the time

749
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Probably

750
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Yes I'm going to say

751
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
And what system was it

752
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,304
I have no idea it was a old system

753
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
But you can probably video

754
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
It was video

755
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,960
And that was part of set up every morning you put a video tape in

756
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,520
Hello how are you guys recycling the videotape

757
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Yes

758
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Think

759
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
Ran for a week

760
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,920
So you had a Monday taper Tuesday for Wednesday

761
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
What's up what's up

762
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,088
So even if on the very day that Asia had written her first letter A Nosler had run out to find the security tape

763
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,648
It probably would have been non-existent by then

764
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,000
What about the computer using to check his email

765
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:04,608
To use a computer did people have to sign in like write their name down

766
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
They did

767
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
And what was the system that

768
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Piece of paper and pencil

769
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,544
By any chance were logged

770
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,360
Meticulously and kept for 15 years were they

771
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
No

772
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Hummer

773
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
We got nothing

774
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,344
The mystery of Ages boyfriend Derek and his friend Gerard

775
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:30,464
Winter and spring every time I went to Baltimore I went to Derek's mom's house looking for him

776
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
Vintage Rose window tinting business

777
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
And then finally

778
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
All right so you are Jerrod Johnson

779
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,728
You don't know how excited we are to be talkin to I've been looking for you for like 4 months

780
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,336
You didn't do anything but we were hoping maybe you remember this moment

781
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,920
On January 13th

782
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,968
1999

783
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Do you

784
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
Have any memory

785
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
By any miracle

786
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
That you went

787
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,464
To Woodlawn Public Library branch

788
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,048
Near Woodlawn High School to pick up Asia McClain

789
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
With your friend Derek

790
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
I have no idea

791
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Aja metoyer

792
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,472
Is that a person or book

793
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
Jefferson

794
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
No no recollection of

795
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Scratch girod

796
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
Derek was my last hope

797
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Eventually I caught him at home

798
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
Considering I woke him up he was exceedingly courteous

799
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,112
You show me a photo of Asian him all dressed up

800
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
They dated most of senior year

801
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
What's up here

802
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
Yeah

803
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
Beautiful

804
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Yeah

805
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
That's my eyes

806
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,912
But there couldn't remember that day either

807
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Shocking I know

808
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:50,080
Need to pick you up from school almost every day back then either from the library or from the front of the school

809
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,872
Because you spoke to a lot of her friend

810
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
AAA

811
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,967
It's very possible that

812
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Could have spoken

813
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
The gentleman and her on Bad Day

814
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
But it's

815
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Very hard to remember do you know if

816
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
15 years later

817
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,743
But it it's it sounds you know very

818
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
It sounds like this could have happened

819
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,119
I don't think he's not the type of person that would lie

820
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,935
I just a reminder

821
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Person you know

822
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
To get involved

823
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
With Ally

824
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,359
Scioscia

825
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,663
It seems pretty credible

826
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,135
Call my cell phone from a blocked number

827
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
You guessed it

828
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:42,047
I wish I could say that my charming persuasive letter is it prompted Asia to call

829
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
But the truth is she never got my letter

830
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,863
I had the wrong address

831
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,983
But you was calling because I followed up weeks later it with a one-line email and she was responding to that

832
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,007
A little confused

833
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:00,479
I mean I have

834
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:05,855
I recorded our conversation on the cell which is why the sound quality is so bad sorry about that

835
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183
33 year old stay-at-home mother

836
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,279
And she has not spent the last 15 years worrying about if he's guilty

837
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,119
I trust

838
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,983
Because I mean I was never

839
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:28,383
I was there a question now is never informed of anything pertaining to the case

840
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
I don't know why he was convicted

841
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,295
You just said she was spooked when the private investigator came to her house

842
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,343
I don't know if that's why she didn't Testify the

843
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Securing

844
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,207
Why she made the call to the prosecutor but you told me that when she got the knock at the door

845
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
That was not cool

846
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:50,399
Christopher if I could do it the last thing you want is a murderer being pissed off at you knowing where you live

847
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,775
Potato remarkably clear memory of what happened on January 13th 1999

848
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,127
She had an internship at the time and so she got out of school much earlier than everyone else

849
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,479
Derek was supposed to come get her at the library along with the rod that they were very late

850
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,063
Remember seeing Adnan come in after Woodlawn let out for the day

851
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:12,671
He said the table and Frank we weren't

852
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,487
Really close friends or anything like that

853
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
You know

854
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,471
Never end

855
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
I can't remember

856
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:33,151
I think I'm going to ask her how he was doing whatever and he says Finance

857
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,887
Tell about it he just

858
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,615
I just wish the best for her attitude and

859
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,711
I'm not sure why ages memory of this interaction is so clear all these years later

860
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,015
Because she wrote it down

861
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,319
The time in his letters and then the affidavit

862
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
At the detail somehow stop

863
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:20,767
Do you remember what time you were talking this would have happened in the library do you remember what time that come

864
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
Conversation would have happened

865
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,423
I don't because

866
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
I know

867
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,287
School let out around 2:15.

868
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
2:30

869
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:41,247
Cuz you would said you got out of school earlier than other people so were you there were you at the library before 2:50

870
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
Teen

871
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:47,391
Oh yeah I have a few hours

872
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,463
Yeah I was pretty scared

873
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,815
And you know and he asked me what

874
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,887
Teenager boy

875
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:08,639
Don't even start with me

876
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
I remember that day because

877
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,551
That was the best

878
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
David

879
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
No

880
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,695
Were there snow days after that do you remember

881
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,863
I want to say there was because I think that was like the first snow of the year

882
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,727
I wouldn't have even remembered if it hadn't been for the

883
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Snow

884
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
You know

885
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,919
I just remember being so pissed about being late

886
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
The First Noel

887
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
The snow is important

888
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,111
He disappeared on Wednesday

889
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
That night there was a huge ice storm

890
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
Which is unusual in Maryland

891
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,487
It ended up being a state emergency

892
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
School is closed for the rest of the week

893
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,607
They just started asking me questions about the case

894
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Wasn't there DNA evidence

895
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,703
What exactly was James Harden the whole thing

896
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
She wasn't sure of none was guilty

897
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,591
She said things I've now heard from so many people since

898
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
He seems like he cared about her

899
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
He didn't seem angry or upset

900
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
There was more proof

901
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,271
It just you know

902
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,391
I didn't want to wait in here I just started something you know what I mean

903
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,303
Yeah

904
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
I mean

905
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
32 years old

906
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
Now and I know that

907
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
You know there's people out there

908
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
Calm demeanor you know

909
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,175
And I know some people who

910
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,527
Call Mom is known as and do something

911
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:54,111
EBay regret for the rest of your life

912
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:02,559
Yeah now it's be nice if there was some technicality something that would prove his innocence

913
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,263
Stephen person I've met in my life but I think I think Asia like

914
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,847
You might be that technicality to see what I mean like your

915
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
If you're saying

916
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,199
You saw him on this day at that time

917
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
That means the states

918
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
Timeline

919
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,855
For their this whole their whole theory of the case doesn't make any sense

920
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Because

921
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
They're saying

922
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,535
He was in the car with her

923
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:38,143
At the very time that you're saying nice I'm at the library and we were talking

924
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,727
Do you know what I mean like that's exactly the window

925
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
Where they're saying she was

926
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Murdered

927
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,919
In case you couldn't hear that it was a sigh

928
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
I completely understand that Sy

929
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,271
I feel a lot of the time

930
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
Because I talked to a non regularly

931
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
And he just

932
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:03,999
Doesn't seem like a murderer

933
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,327
Few minutes after I hung up with Asia

934
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
Adnan called

935
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
On schedule

936
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
I'm good

937
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
I'm good

938
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,823
So I was just talking to Asia McClain

939
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,479
You don't sound very excited

940
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
I really don't know

941
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
This was not the reaction I expected

942
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,767
I felt like I just interviewed an ivory-billed woodpecker

943
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,327
Remembered

944
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
Instead of being excited and said it was heartbreaking

945
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
Because it's

946
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,871
I'm not making this up

947
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,639
No no I mean I I C I totally iced tea

948
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,943
I see what you're saying I hadn't thought about it

949
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,967
In that way

950
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,927
Because they were all correct

951
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
It was too late

952
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,303
The judge rules on a petition a few weeks before I spoke to Asia

953
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:49,727
The judge wrote in his opinion that Christina Gutierrez his decision not to use Asia McClain as an alibi Witness

954
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,751
Strategic

955
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,103
After all ages original letters didn't specify an exact time

956
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,223
Temperaturas could have reasonably concluded that Asia was offering to lie in order to help an ion

957
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,575
And finally he wrote his letter contradicted

958
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,135
Ava said she saw him at the public library

959
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:10,207
Said he was on the school campus the whole afternoon

960
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,559
Maybe the judge didn't understand it was on library is basically part of the campus

961
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
But anyway

962
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,423
Is legally worthless

963
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:25,823
Said she saw you when the state contends you're strangling

964
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,359
Is worthless

965
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,455
A few days after I spoke to Asia she wrote me an email

966
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,015
I've been thinking a lot about Adnan She Wrote

967
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,343
All this time I thought the courts prove it was Adnan that killed her

968
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
I thought he was where he deserve to be

969
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
Assure

970
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,535
He was our friend too and it sucks feeling like you don't know who really killed your friend

971
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,839
He was the sweetest person ever

972
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,423
If you didn't kill Hae we owe it to him to try to make that clear

973
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
We need to put this to rest

974
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,615
I just hope that a nun isn't some sick bastard just trying to manipulate his way out of jail

975
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
I wrote back

976
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Believe me

977
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
Exactly the same page

978

Coming up this season on serial

979
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:20,607
I think that there are other people involved like maybe I think maybe he was shut up I think you would shut up somehow

980
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,631
Lily Patel

981
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,935
Something wasn't going on it wasn't good

982
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,239
It was just strange behavior for anybody

983
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,543
Basically threatened me like you know what I'm

984
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:35,711
What are you thinking right now

985
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:42,111
Literally thinking like like could have gone crazy

986
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:48,511
Cuz at 9 music

987
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:53,375
