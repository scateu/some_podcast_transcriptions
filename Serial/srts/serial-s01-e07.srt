20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
Previously on serial

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
Did anybody else use

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Yeah

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,160
Hainan I remember he's talking to a girl

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,976
On the phone with her so I can read minutes

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,072
I just remember he had told my daughter he had seen

26
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:12,960
Cuz of the body of a girl in the back of such are the trunk of some vehicle

27
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
I think the guy's name was maybe Adnan

28
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
Global Tel Link prepaid call from

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
Maryland Correctional Facility

30
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story

31
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
I told week by week I'm Sarah Koenig

32
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
I heard about this other case of a kid named Justin wolf

33
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,320
Actually passing I can't remember how he heard about it. A lot of different stuff in prison

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
Talking about the cell records and how they were used in a non case in a non said that in this other case of just

35
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,048
Sell records had also been used against him

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
But then Justin Wilson conviction was overturned

37
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
In part because of the cell record

38
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,008
So I looked at this case of Justin Wolfe just to see

39
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,128
I have to say it's sort of uncanny how many similarities there are with add-ons case

40
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
All young people first of all

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,016
Justin Wolfe was a Suburban kid 18 football player

42
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,624
People thought of him as a good kid though he was selling pot and hanging around with some tougher types

43
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,184
Does next Hearts different obviously

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,048
He was convicted in the 2001 murder of a drug dealer who was shot nine times

45
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
Justin Wolfe was not the shooter

46
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,448
The shooter was a slightly older friend of wolves Barber

47
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,032
Who got a deal in exchange for testifying against Justin Wolfe

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,896
Owen Barber told the cops that Justin wasn't hired him to kill the drug dealer

49
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
What was sentenced to death in Virginia

50
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
Wolf trial attorney later gave up his law license after the bar had initiated disciplinary charges against him for

51
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
This is the technical term

52
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Being a crappy lawyer

53
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,744
And there was a witness who was never heard from

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Anyhow eventually Owen Barbara mercante

55
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
He said Justin Wolfe had nothing to do with a murder

56
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
He'd only implicated wolf to avoid a death sentence for himself

57
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,480
Let me talk to the lawyer who helped figure out the flaws in the state's case against Justin Wolfe

58
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,600
Maybe she has some tips about how we should be looking at the cell records differently in Adnan case

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,928
I looked her up her name is Deirdre Enright

60
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
And she works at the University of Virginia school of law

61
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
She runs their Innocence Project Clinic their Innocence Project

62
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Someone's been wrongfully convicted

63
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
I called her and asked how she dealt with the cell records in the Justin Wolfe case

64
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
And she was kind of so-so on that topic

65
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
She gave me a couple of names to try

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,992
Batman on every other topic I found her so help

67
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,392
She started asking me about anons case and I ended up sending her a summary I'd made of the detective's report

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
The next time we talk I asked if she'd mind going to a studio

69
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Hey you know I read

70
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Your

71
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
Synopsis of your

72
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
To jump right into your case okay if I have a million questions

73
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
Very very thin

74
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Yeah

75
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
After I started reading all this

76
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Although what you had

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
I started thinking

78
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
So everybody here is in high school

79
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Right

80
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
And why is done

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Doesn't appear to be

82
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Interest anyone

83
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,255
Done with his new boyfriend to the police considered his Alibi Ironclad he was working at LensCrafters all day

84
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
See this is how it is with Deirdre

85
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,887
A conversation with her never seems to begin exactly

86
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
It's already there ongoing her thoughts

87
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,287
Turning and you just kind of join in when you're ready and hope you can keep up

88
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
She's not a small talker or a beat around the bushes

89
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
You discuss whatever it is you came to discuss

90
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
Looking it squarely in the face

91
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
She has no time for bulshit

92
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,111
And not because she's about anything but because she actually has no time

93
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
She's one of the busiest and most curious people I've ever met

94
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,815
You know when you first talk to me about this case the first thing I thought is okay do we have a jailhouse informant

95
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
Do we have a person

96
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,215
Got way too sweet of a deal

97
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,335
What when I read through your police notes your summary of your police notes

98
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
I just kept going back to motive

99
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,479
Hunting that's a big black hole for me I still don't understand

100
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Why

101
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
You want this girl's dad

102
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Because she broke up with you people break up with people all the time prayer and I can't and I'm a little concerned

103
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
What about racial profiling here you know in other words

104
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
Right and people are saying you know his

105
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Darkside

106
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
And his

107
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
You know there was some notation about he was very

108
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Trolling

109
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
And I thought I wonder if he was really very controlling

110
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
So there's that

111
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
Then a little bit I had a

112
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
The cell phone thing for us and Justin Wolfe is

113
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
That they used to the cell phone records

114
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Say

115
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
Cabin out the period of time

116
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
When

117
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,703
The shooter is driving to the place where the victim is

118
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
And shooting him and then coming back

119
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,407
And so they they put those up on a board in the courtroom and take a look at this he calls him right before he

120
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
Commits the murder and he calls him right after he commits the murder

121
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
You know

122
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
But

123
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,159
And then you get everybody's phone records write all these kids that are buying pot smoking pot selling pot

124
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
And everybody's calling each other

125
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
All the time

126
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
So

127
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
It's a venue stop and stand back and say

128
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:05,727
Also what are they trying to say that Justin wolf in these kids he's a upper-middle-class kids

129
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Are so stupid

130
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
That they

131
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,127
Get in the car and call and say okay I'm on my way to murder him

132
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,247
Okay I just murdered him I'm coming back now I just weren't you know what I mean like

133
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Who does that

134
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
It's so you know now all these Witnesses

135
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,415
Oh no we were just calling each other to buy pot

136
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Those calls

137
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
Bitter infused with meaning by the prosecution

138
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
Siri have no meaning in space

139
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
Show me itsfunneh like you get kisses like Anna's case

140
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
I feel like

141
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
From what I can tell

142
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
You know there's nuts for gross negligence or or malfeasance or something on the part of the detectives or the

143
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,039
State Attorney's Office like everyone seems to be doing their job

144
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
Responsibly

145
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Just doesn't seem like there's an obvious like

146
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,535
Never looked at the new boyfriend they never questioned the guy who found the button

147
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
A nun on himself is not sad

148
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
Buying anything super useful to say like

149
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,567
Here's why I can prove I didn't do this like he has set out front like I can't

150
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,103
Give you

151
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Like some

152
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,967
Clenching piece of information or evidence that's going to solve this like I wish I could

153
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
Cobra Kai just don't have it like I don't know

154
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
I don't know how to

155
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Prove this

156
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
You know that's a that's why I love hearing that

157
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Because

158
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,279
Somewhere along the line I started realizing that when you have an innocent client

159
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
They are the least helpful people in the whole world

160
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
They don't know they don't

161
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
They have no idea

162
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,823
You like as soon as I realized I have an innocent client and that's a situation that I think like

163
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
Okay well I'll talk to you again when I solved

164
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Because I'm not going to need you here

165
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
Cuz what's happening with unknown is where

166
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Find something out that looks kind of bad for him

167
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
And I'll come to him with it and be like

168
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,231
Why it does seem like you maybe made this phone call

169
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,559
In the middle of the afternoon at a time when you're saying you were a track

170
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,655
But the phone number is to someone who only you know and Jay didn't know

171
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
And so like there's this phone call with this girl Nisha and it it's like this glaring thing to me in the middle of the phone records

172
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,639
I'm like that's the one that kind of looks bad for you

173
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Explain that to me how do you explain that

174
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
And then his his answer is

175
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
Had a melee or not so satisfying where he's like I don't I can't explain it like maybe it was a butt dial and like

176
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
The machine picked up and I'm like

177
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
But she's had to find that there's no machine on it

178
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,143
And he's like I don't know I don't know what to tell you but like I didn't I didn't have the felt like I was a track

179
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
And I'm just like I want to be like

180
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
You should have an anime cake

181
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
What's not surprising

182
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
Not at all

183
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
So there was a case that I had the federal capital murder case right where my client Daryl rice right

184
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,087
Is charged with killing two women hikers in the

185
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Shenandoah National Park in blah blah blah

186
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,927
They filed a motion saying

187
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
The motive in this case

188
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
It was hatred it was

189
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
He hated lesbians that's why he murdered these two women

190
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,655
So Daryl rice was easy for me not in the beginning because

191
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
His answers

192
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
Self-serving and help

193
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
The way you think

194
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
He's had time to think about

195
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Why

196
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Why doesn't have a better answer than that

197
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
And then

198
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
I started to realize

199
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Because

200
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
He hasn't been thinking about this

201
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Because you didn't murder anybody

202
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
And so

203
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
It's like I remember one day I had in there map

204
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Straight to show him

205
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,071
Like where the crime scene was versus where the lodge was first

206
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
2 square mile marker 42 points

207
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,471
And so I put I put this all out on the table and get my reading glasses

208
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,103
And then I said so when you would Camp there can you show me where you were and then he was like

209
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Okay well I didn't

210
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
I didn't Camp there I buy wild ride bikes

211
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
There in a horse sound like

212
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Okay well whatever you know

213
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
It's whatever you're in the park

214
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
In relation to the crime scene

215
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
And then he

216
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
Look at me it was so simple it and but he said

217
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
I don't I don't know where the crime scene was

218
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
So can you

219
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Show me that

220
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
And I remember thinking

221
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Course

222
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
I'm like everybody else

223
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
I think he knows

224
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Christine is right

225
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:31,199
How many likes do you only take on cases where it's super clear to everyone involved like on your side of the bed

226
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
Your side of the bar

227
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
That that

228
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,623
This person isn't innocent of wrongfully convicted

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,719
Or do you take cases where like you really don't know and you start down a road in like

230
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
Three quarter staircase it turns out he probably did it so let's not take on that one or do you are you only working with cases where you're pretty sure from the

231
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
The get-go

232
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,239
Because we're the people that decide whether

233
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
It's going to be it's going to go or not

234
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Ecos every different way

235
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,711
Right sometimes we start down the road and

236
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Very quickly

237
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
We talked to four Witnesses all of whom say

238
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Nose apps

239
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Vim

240
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
They have no reason to lie you know

241
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,439
We did not we quickly realized okay we're being happy

242
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
We are in the weeds

243
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
About a lot of things

244
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
For a long time until we figured it out to like today

245
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
We had team meetings for R4

246
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Clinic KC

247
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
And those are for cases

248
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
You know two of them

249
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,615
Are sure already two of them were just

250
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,199
Trying to figure it out but you're not going to a jury

251
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,831
You know that's relatively unusual and I'm assuming you went to a jury because he was saying I didn't do that

252
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Right

253
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Right

254
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
Enzo sometimes people say I did some of the

255
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
But I didn't do all of this

256
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,535
So I'm going to trial but he wasn't saying that

257
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,607
Yeah he's always

258
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Right

259
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Which

260
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,495
I don't know people let you know a lot of her so they're all guilty they're all.

261
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
Generally feel like especially for most of my

262
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
Career I was dealing with people and I wasn't

263
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,943
A directorate in Innocence Project

264
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
And I had a very clear sense of which of my clients did what

265
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,831
And that's because they told me it's like

266
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,951
So I put some stock in people saying I didn't do it and staying

267
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
With that

268
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Yeah now

269
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Some people would say I'm naive but I also think like

270
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,471
I've been doing this work for a really long time I don't think naive is a good word for me

271
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
You know what I mean I mean

272
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
I feel like I'm

273
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
Because I feel like I'm having this experience where

274
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
I'll read something or I'll do an interview and I'm like

275
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
Yeah there's no way

276
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
It just doesn't add up it doesn't add up and then I'll send in the very next day I'm like

277
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
My God

278
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
Oh my God

279
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Look at the phone call Tanisha

280
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
Yes or like

281
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:01,215
You know this friend said that he you know behave this way during a relationship at this other girl I just talked to you last night

282
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
It was like he was really overbearing and possessive

283
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
My God maybe you didn't know

284
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
Do you have that like this is that

285
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
Still happen to you or do you just

286
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
I know I know actually teach that

287
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
I tell people all the time

288
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,927
You are you are juggling and everything's in the air and your Frozen

289
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
And

290
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,511
You have to stay there until your

291
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Just you've eliminated

292
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Quest

293
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,935
Because if you if you come down or catch one and get attached to it

294
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
You're going to make the same mistakes that law enforcement do

295
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
And I think to when you keep going like

296
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,383
What happens to me is that

297
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
I reach a Tipping Point

298
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
I have answered

299
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
To my satisfaction

300
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
And I have answers for everything

301
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
And

302
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
Am I answers are better

303
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Then 1/4

304
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Dancers

305
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,255
So when I read what you've given me I just think

306
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
You guys just don't have it

307
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
You just didn't

308
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,215
Nobody's really doing anything bad ever eaten people are trying to run down their leaves and talk to people

309
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,543
But they don't have enough to go forward but they do anyhow

310
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Right

311
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:14,943
So people so you've got bad feelings and you've got Jay changing a story you know like

312
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,527
I look at this is this is just the case that wasn't ready to be brought

313
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,831
You don't have enough to put Adnan away

314
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Not to not to me

315
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
You don't

316
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,999
Put him away means

317
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:34,143
Well and yeah and they would say yes and I would say no and I and the reason I say that is because I look at this and think

318
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
Law enforcement and prosecutors and defense attorneys

319
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,103
We all react like if a jury will convict then that's fine

320
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
And I think

321
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Those of us who know a good case from a bad case

322
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:52,831
Should know that even if we can get a jury to convict it doesn't mean we necessarily should ask them to do that

323
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Is the

324
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
So are you not does it not happen to any more where you're just like one day you things like

325
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
For the first

326
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
However many months

327
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
Ranking of the Air Force

328
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Oh no it's not him

329
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
But

330
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
In order to revisit it in any kind of

331
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
Careful way you have to revisit everything

332
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
Brighten the good in the bad and whatever

333
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
And look at it with

334
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
And eyebrow up

335
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:31,231
And sometimes it's going to stay exactly the way it is and it's unsatisfying

336
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
I'm going to get through all this and just be like

337
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,143
Yeah an end you might and I can't pretend that that

338
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,263
I just thought of something that I think we should do unless you don't want to do it and you can just think about this

339
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
So just today

340
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,663
One of my teams and it's one of my better teams because it's a kid who

341
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
Law student who has summered at the FBI

342
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,135
And it's going to work for the US attorney so he doesn't have my treehugger

343
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
You know

344
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Everyone's innocent

345
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Instagram

346
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
But he's a really hard worker and he has a team

347
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
And we just closed their case

348
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,727
And he came to me tonight and said are you going to find me another good case and I said yeah let me flip through tonight and see what we got

349
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
I'm sitting here thinking

350
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Wait

351
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
You should assign them

352
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Oh my God

353
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Right

354
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
That's really

355
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,807
YG I literally just sitting here thinking

356
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
You know it's a lot of legwork

357
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,439
If we had a team of five students we could get those things done

358
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
You know

359
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
With people that are being supervised

360
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
So think about that

361
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
I'm totally hooked

362
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,895
I did think about it

363
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
I said yes

364
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Go ahead

365
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,831
My job unlike theirs is not to figure out if or how I can exonerate at 9

366
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,439
But sure if I wanted to take a look at the case on their own of course I welcome that

367
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
Many more sets of eyes some fresh some jaded

368
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
Could only be helpful it seemed to me

369
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,887
Went down to Charlottesville to see how they were getting along

370
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,983
Here is the sound of a law clinic getting ready to consider a new case

371
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,127
Got the scanner scanning it's little Skinner hard out

372
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,455
Man by anyone Deirdre can grab her students mostly

373
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
Couple of orchids come by the office she gets one of her daughters canning

374
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:36,927
You said the scanner smells good

375
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
And I don't have to know what laundry smells like

376
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
That's Deirdre

377
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,839
So now what we do usually in when we are cases

378
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Is we collect

379
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,703
What Mom has with inmate has what is in the court file

380
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
What

381
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,823
Paper everywhere that's what we do is collect all the paper

382
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
And then do exactly what they're doing

383
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
And then

384
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
Put the team in we say take a weekend and read it all

385
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,343
Post-conviction work often involves going back and looking at physical evidence in a case

386
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,695
Some Innocence Project only work with cases that have DNA evidence for instance

387
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,303
Children's Group isn't one of those but still she'll definitely take it if she can get it

388
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,167
1 point deer Teresa print out of an email regarding evidence in anons case

389
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,287
So this is an email in 2008 from the Baltimore Police

390
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
Saying

391
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
That

392
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,663
He believes items from this case have been destroyed

393
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
But he doesn't have a document saying that that

394
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Is true so we can't be 100% sure

395
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,831
And he's the evidence control unit

396
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Person

397
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
So

398
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Yeah that's not good

399
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,071
I think there's two things to think about there's a

400
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
That usually

401
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,167
In every state about evidence retention

402
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:55,007
And you can't destroy evidence until the case is over and done with

403
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
Doesn't mean they

404
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
Always honored

405
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,359
The other thing I'm thinking about is

406
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
I can tell you the number of faces where somebody says

407
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
I think it's gone

408
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
And then you go

409
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
And you be annoying

410
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
And you poke around and say

411
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
Can I come back there and look

412
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
And they say

413
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,927
Okay will look and then

414
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Like

415
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
So

416
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
Not Fade Away

417
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
You see how I refused

418
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Except

419
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Anyting

420
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,495
It's true I can't think of anyone more optimistic than Deirdre

421
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,079
Which I don't know I would have guessed that after doing this kind of work

422
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
For decades

423
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,967
Annoying how rare it is to reverse a conviction you naturally settle in as a pessimist

424
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,319
The opposite is true that because your chances are so low

425
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,391
You have to look on the bright side in order to do this work at all

426
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
Otherwise you can function

427
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,791
Students digest this massive amount of paper

428
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
The next step is decide what they've got on their hands

429
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
First thing they do says Deirdre

430
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
It's a given on back the presumption of innocence

431
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
It's kind of profound saying when you think about it

432
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
It's supposed to happen the first time around a trial

433
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
Seems like no one in the profession really believes that it does

434
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,551
Because you can't help it as a juror you figure the guy sitting behind the defense table must have done something wrong

435
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
So dear just team starts with the premise

436
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
But he didn't do it

437
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
And then they see where that rotates them

438
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
If they think maybe it down really is innocent

439
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,608
Figure out if there's any way they can prove that in court

440
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
Definitely

441
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,752
Because the evidence is gone the people won't change their minds

442
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,056
There's no legal remedy

443
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,664
It's just those things are just after time those things are usually

444
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Harder to get to

445
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
As a legal question

446
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Deirdre says they should only have to prove

447
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Anon isn't there guy

448
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
He's not the Killer

449
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,744
But as a practical matter she said their chances are much better if they can go a step further

450
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
State of the State

451
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
Not only is this not your guy

452
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
We can tell you who is your guy

453
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,448
The truth is when you can give the answer of who it is

454
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
It makes it a whole lot easier on everybody else

455
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
To walk away and do the things no one ever wants

456
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
To do

457
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
And usually there's some logical

458
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Explanation right

459
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,320
There is a guy there is somebody who's motivated to somebody who hated hey like

460
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Usually there's something

461
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,440
You don't have to but I always help people

462
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
You have to

463
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:28,864
Of course after looking everything over and her team might well decide that maybe it is guilty

464
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,936
In which case they would quietly pack up the files

465
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
I just keep their mouth shut

466
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
But what I'm saying is like I could happen

467
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,384
You could look at it and be like

468
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,712
To me I mean not to the world

469
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
Right I would say it

470
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
I would say.

471
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
But I wouldn't say it to

472
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,424
4 weeks later I check back in with your for students

473
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,032
Read through all the files if you guys think I'm not guilty

474
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
No I wouldn't I wouldn't have been able to find

475
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
Guilty with this

476
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
This is one of the things that was

477
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:23,648
Very hot when I first started reading this case was how precisely he was convicted under this

478
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
Material

479
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
But now

480
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
Do not see him as being guilty of this

481
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,120
I was just at this point knowing what I know I would say

482
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,984
I guess I have to put them in the person of interest category because he was an old boyfriend

483
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:44,384
Even that I would think like that but I see no evidence that he was mad mountains of Reasonable Doubt

484
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
Surprise me

485
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,880
At least one or two of them would end up on the fence

486
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,928
They all sounded so forthright

487
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,024
They said the things that trouble with the same things that trouble me

488
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,168
Shifting statements to police and how the cell tower information didn't fully match Jays narrative

489
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,520
But the other stuff AC is done with stuff I hadn't paid much attention to it all

490
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
The forensic report

491
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,616
Relative lack of forensic reports

492
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
This is Katie

493
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,992
Because in our files we have a lot of things evidence they collected that said off

494
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,344
We don't have reports for everything and we are curious about the results that we

495
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
Don't have and whether or not

496
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
Does exhaustion

497
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
That's why they're not in the files that we have

498
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
The liquor bottle for 1

499
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,888
That bottle of Coronet vsq Brandy that was on right near his body

500
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,288
It says they recovered nucleated epithelial cells from the mouth of the bottle and from the cap

501
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:49,664
But that's all it just says quote retained for future possible analysis unquote

502
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
But the future never came

503
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,504
They never tested those cells for DNA

504
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,832
Like a report on the fibers

505
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:03,232
Two fibers one reddish that was found near his head was fluorescent blue it's a little hard to tell

506
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:09,632
That was found underneath her in the soil didn't think they were tested against enough samples

507
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
They weren't test against the rope that was also found right near the body

508
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
I would think that you would

509
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:20,384
Be able to compare the fibers to the Roper compare the fibrous to whatever you can get your hands on and

510
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,248
And I didn't actually see that ever get tested the fibers were

511
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
Some things but nothing nothing came back of significance and then the fibers just fact of the fibers just kind of went away

512
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
As for the Rope which from a photo looks like a laundry line

513
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
It wasn't tested at all for anything

514
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
Deirdre says that kind of thing happens a lot

515
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,752
Investigators will say

516
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Not relevant

517
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,336
It's not connected to what happened so there's no point in testing

518
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
So another case that I had

519
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:57,248
Anything that didn't match the the purpose or the suspect that they had

520
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
They just ignored it right

521
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,184
And they would say well that's that's outside the crime scene that's really not inside the crime scene so those beer cans over there where

522
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
Too far away we're going to call that outside the clients

523
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,584
And when I talk to DNA experts about that

524
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
They were saying

525
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
Yeah I mean if you swab that and you get some

526
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,728
Some skin cells are

527
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Saliva

528
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,336
And it's just randomly get no hit on anybody will then it's

529
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,872
Then it's neither here nor there

530
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
But they were saying

531
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,992
But if you if you put it in and you get a hit on a serial killer

532
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:34,880
Sprite or one of two other people who killed Asian women within a year in Baltimore

533
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Well now we've got

534
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
Enough to charge and convict somebody

535
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
So

536
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,816
What you call relevant and irrelevant you can only do once you have a test result

537
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,216
Finally and Katie and Mario were all confused by the swabs that were taken from his body

538
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,288
The medical examiner had done what's known as a perk

539
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,336
Cat stands for physical evidence

540
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Recovery kit

541
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,152
The standard procedure in a rape case

542
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
But it's also down in some murder case

543
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,528
There was no evidence he was sexually assaulted

544
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
But they did the swabs just the same

545
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,696
The medical examiner's report says they came back quote- for spermatozoa

546
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
But that's about it

547
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:16,096
Which seems very thin to Deirdre that these swabs weren't examined for thoroughly

548
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,168
But they were never tested for DNA which is just weird

549
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
That's just

550
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,288
That seems very strange to me in a case like that seems very strange and you

551
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
You almost always submit that for DNA test

552
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,712
And that's what we're not seeing is a lab report that says

553
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,272
You know if it came back and that's the other

554
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
Loosey-goosey about whether it's

555
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
Not Jay not Adnan you know

556
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
That's strange

557
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Right

558
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
So okay

559
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
So so

560
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
Is that something that you guys

561
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Wood

562
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Want to get to

563
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Tested

564
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Absolutely

565
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,312
Yes it didn't correct me if I'm wrong but this certainly seems to be

566
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
Quite a bit to get started

567
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,640
Do you have any

568
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
Metric of how

569
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Hopeful

570
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
/ hopeless

571
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
This one looks

572
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Point in terms of

573
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
Finding out something useful and usable

574
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
Mario shaking his head

575
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,000
That's because he's a pro-government

576
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,072
Right-wing Republican operative

577
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,984
I checked with Mario he said it was fine

578
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
You know

579
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
It's always an outside shot

580
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Always

581
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,688
But there's enough here is what I guess what I'm saying is there's enough here that you

582
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,296
I think it's worth asking these questions

583
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,368
You don't even like you guys independently feel like

584
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
Know something when

585
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,952
Or is this just like

586
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,048
Well we're sort of humor and show the reporter

587
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,168
No I would I would I would look at this as this I would have a team on this case saying

588
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Keep going

589
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
I say

590
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
They all seem so hopeful

591
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,664
So sure that with enough digging they're going to shake something loose

592
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
Skeptical

593
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,368
I felt like I did in that same mindset for so many months and I haven't found anything that absolutely tip the scale

594
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Favor

595
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
Noticed

596
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,512
There are you sound really down on Adnan today

597
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:27,424
I don't know yeah you're sometimes I'm totally with them

598
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
And then other times I'm like

599
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
Why

600
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,104
I can't remember anything why does nothing

601
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,456
I don't know that

602
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Of all days

603
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,320
You knew it was important that you got a call from a cop that day

604
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,112
Asking where your ex girlfriend was

605
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Surely

606
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
You must have gone over it

607
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
Before 6 weeks

608
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Had passed

609
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Surely

610
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
I don't have that reacts

611
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
But I see what you

612
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,520
And then I just am aware of like

613
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,128
What if he is this amazing sociopath and not just like I'm being played

614
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
When I don't get that

615
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Sense

616
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
Really Charming he's

617
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Really smart

618
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
He's really

619
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Funny

620
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,440
And you're like yeah

621
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
Here's where I go with that like

622
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
In my 20

623
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
How I'm sick

624
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
6 years of doing this

625
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
Frey for associate

626
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,448
Cuz I never get those

627
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,544
I get the innocent ones as I get these dumb

628
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,384
So me and my friend smoke crack for 3 days and we drink 5 bottles of

629
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Whatever and then we got a plan

630
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992
That's who I get all the time

631
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
So I think like

632
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
The odds of you getting the Charming sociopath you're just not that lucky

633
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,952
Very few times if I had a client and the ones

634
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
Really did it end

635
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,304
Date they have serious metal

636
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Issues and there are not

637
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
Sociopathy there

638
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,216
Schizophrenia or florid psychosis because of a

639
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Whatever

640
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
I just think

641
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
The odds of

642
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,664
Him being that and no one having detected any signs of it until

643
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
The Kills

644
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
His girlfriend

645
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
So he's moved on

646
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
From

647
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,136
Deirdre and her gang they're going to stick with stuff they can bring to a quart

648
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Friends mostly

649
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,744
Another explanation is

650
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Entirely

651
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,328
They did not had nothing to do with this at all

652
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
Maybe it was a serial killer

653
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,424
Maybe there's a clue from another Baltimore Cold Case
