I went through the things I was going through when I was younger cuz I was young and dumb

From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago

00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
It's serial one Courthouse told week by week on Sarah Koenig

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
When I began this project I didn't plan on covering any juvenile case

29
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,128
Juvenile records are public for one thing

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,712
I figured we got plenty to look at right here in the adult system

31
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
After while juvenile cases juvenile crime became impossible to ignore the newly-elected

32
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,208
County prosecutor it seem to be talking about juvenile violence and every opportunity

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Young people

34
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
14 to 21

35

A crime drivers

36
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
The data supported his alarm

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
More and more juveniles were being charged with the worst crime

38
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
Serious assaults robberies

39
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Rapes homicides

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
All Rising for the past 5 years

41
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,176
Once these juvenile crimes made their way into the juvenile courts though

42
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
And once the juveniles themselves made their way into juvenile prisons

43
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
They disappear from View

44
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
Juvenile court rooms are tightly controlled

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,696
Names of juvenile defendants aren't publicized for good reason

46
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,512
The crimes children commit should not Forevermark them

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,376
But as a result I didn't have a picture of what Juvenile Justice look like in Cuyahoga County

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
I'd your mutterings at the Justice Center though

49
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
Mostly from defense attorneys grousing to each other

50
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
You're not going to believe what just happened to my juvenile quieter

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Tumi

52
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
You think this place is bad

53
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
You should head over to juvenile

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
But I think

55
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Why

56
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
What are you talking about

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
Then I met Joshua

58
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
He was 19 at the time

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
So not a child

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
He tell you he was grown

61
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
But he was still in the juvenile system

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
You can stay there till your 21

63
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,912
Keep in mind the juvenile system its mission is different from that of the adults

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
The point isn't to punish

65
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Retribution

66
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
The point is to rehabilitate

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
In the juvenile system

68
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
That's where we're supposed to think like parents

69
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Are the standard should be

70
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
My child

71
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Is this what's best for my child

72
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
But this help my child

73
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
So

74
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
I'm going to tell you about Joshua

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Joshua sometimes starts off a story with

76
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
Okay so boom

77
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Boom is big in Cleveland

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Shorthand for

79
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Let me try to explain

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
For real

81
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
I feel like all the way like phone

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
All the tape I have with Joshua is from prison

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
So the sound is mostly at any threat of terrible

84
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm sorry about that

85
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
Prison system allow me to interview Joshua and purse

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
But I can tell you is his longtime interlocutor I like it when Joshua says boom

87
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Or better yet

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Boom boom

89
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
Means I might start to understand something

90
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,440
So just how Joshua came to inhabit his current predicament

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
One Night in June of 2014

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
Joshua freshly 16i down to sleep after a night at a bar

93
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Next thing you know

94
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
FBI agents for pulling him from his bed

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
They took him to an interrogation room in Cleveland Heights

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,407
They told him they had him for some robberies

97
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
Like these

98
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,463
Instagram Facebook

99
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,535
Famous 15 year olds are rarely criminal mastermind

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
Posing with all these other kids

101
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
The FBI agents were saying not only do we have video evidence of what you've done but thank you social media

102
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
We also know who you run with

103
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
The crimes Joshua was charged with were serious armed robberies from many months back

104
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,527
Gas stations in a friend held up to BP's in one day

105
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
And a third robbery of a Popeye's Joshua said he was coerced into that one by an older gang member they barely got Nemo

106
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,535
Money he said they left with this pathetic little plastic bucket that had small bills in it

107
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
Greenfield police reports read a hundred fifty bucks would be handed over to the boss for the restaurant had teeth

108
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
Who had to lie down on the ground with a multiple kidnapping indictment right there Joshua had jumped over the couch

109
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,431
Connor and pointed a gun at someone and again according to the police report said

110
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
You have 5 Seconds to open the safe or I'll shoot him

111
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,671
Joshua said his gun had no bullets in it that his co-defendants gun was broken the firing pin was busted

112
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,999
Are the customers and workers at Popeye's that Wednesday morning didn't know that

113
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,911
The FBI agents were telling Joshua we've got you on video so let's friends are our choices shall we

114
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,263
We can hand you over to the adult court system that's called a bind over

115
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,871
In Ohio children as young as 14 can be bound over to adult court for certain crimes

116
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
To Joshua adult Court sounded serious that was an adult system Joshua would be

117
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
Facing between 20 and 30 years in prison

118
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Or the officer said

119
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Another option

120
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
We can talk

121
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
If we talk

122
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
We can keep you in the juvenile

123
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
We won't find you over

124
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
Okay. When you're 21 5 years from now

125
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
With no adult felony record

126
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
My talk

127
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
Joshua was operating on a couple hours sleep

128
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
If he remembers right he was handcuffed

129
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
He said the officers weren't rude or abusive to him

130
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
This cool he said

131
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
They left him alone for a while

132
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
To think about the deal they were offering

133
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
At any point did you say to them I want to talk to a lawyer or I need to speak to my mom

134
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Is there any

135
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
Adult or any lawyer involved in any of that

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
I like

137
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
Did you say can I have a lawyer

138
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
For now

139
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,087
No I never said that

140
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Right

141
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
Okay

142
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,863
Adult store

143
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,959
When they said Mike was having an adult here with me what did they say

144
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
And how long do they keep you there

145
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
I was there for about like

146
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Polite

147
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
With no adult knowing where you were

148
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
No

149
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Really

150
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Doesn't it sound illegal

151
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
It's not

152
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
It's allowed

153
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
My children haven't robbed any gas station so I feel the apples and oranges here

154
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,295
But I have to sign a permission slip for my teenager to go on a quote-unquote field trip that's a five-block walk from her school

155
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
I could check the box to allow my son's photo from summer camp to be used for promotional purposes

156
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
What year was Joshua

157
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
16

158
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,815
Followed by exhaustion and the prospect of everlasting incarceration

159
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
And no adults but a hand on his shoulder

160
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,495
To crouch down and whisper in his ear what I believe most of us would have whispered if we've been in that room

161
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
Ask for a lawyer

162
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Do it now ask for

163
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Lawyer

164
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
Joshua had

165
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
The interview would have

166
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Should have stopped

167
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
And maybe his story would have

168
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
Should have gone another way

169
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
As it was Joshua took the deal

170
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
That fast

171
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
It was June of 2014

172
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
Two months earlier his daughter had been born

173
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,559
Those two months with already told me where the happiest of his life

174
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,423
You couldn't handle the idea of being locked up until both he and she were decades older

175
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,775
And also Joshua's relationship inside the gang he was in

176
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Heartless felons

177
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Complicated

178
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,943
I know it's hard to square but Joshua says he was an armed robber who wasn't into violence

179
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,551
Isn't the only benefit of joining the heartless felons with the protection they offered

180
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
From the heartless felons

181
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
From them

182
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
He said they extorted people into committing crimes

183
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
Especially the younger kids like him

184
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
When do serious time if they got caught

185
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
So yeah

186
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
He did stuff with them and for them

187
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Didn't feel anything for most of them

188
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,495
The only one he have considered a friend you told me

189
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
You're not guy had pulled a gun on him once during an argument

190
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
So he took the deal

191
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Juvenile life

192
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
The catch

193
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
Something called a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence

194
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,575
Usually people just call it an syo

195
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
It works like a suspended adult prison sentence

196
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
You young man are going to stay in the juvenile system that's

197
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
The carrot

198
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,327
We're hanging a ghostly adult sentence over your head that's the stick

199
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
Which we can invoke if you can't keep it together in juvenile prison

200
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,983
So if you want to stay in juvenile you have to behave

201
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
Joshua believed he could behave he took the deal

202
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
That same day he got arrested

203
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
Joshua says he drove around with the cops showed them places

204
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
Identify people in photographs

205
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
People associated with the heartless felons

206
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,231
In the coming months he'd meet with investigators a couple more times

207
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
Joshua has terrific recall for all manner of information

208
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
I'd give them dates

209
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Addresses

210
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
X

211
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,471
He told them details of crimes about which they already knew and about ones they didn't

212
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
As a source

213
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
He was a champion

214
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
He really Joshua is extremely unusual

215
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
This is Lissa Rankin

216
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
She was Joshua's public defender

217
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,319
Choose a scientist case only after Joshua had agreed to cooperate

218
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
When I called her to ask about Joshua

219
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
It been a client for only a couple months

220
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Earlier

221
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
Remember him immediately

222
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,327
She's used to clients refusing to cooperate with the police

223
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
Refusing even to tell her information that might help their defense

224
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
So for him to be

225
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,823
So open and volunteering information and

226
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
How this whole thing

227
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
Start is that when he had met with the office

228
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
It's worth before the arraignment

229
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
Before he was represented he had volunteered information

230
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
And he really helps them

231
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,231
On a number of Investigations because they didn't have starting points

232
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,583
This is when the heartless felons really started coming in

233
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
The play

234
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,935
They were freaking a lot of havoc in Cuyahoga County and I believed

235
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
The state of salar

236
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:58,079
And so the police were very desperate to get as much information as they can

237
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,919
And Joshua really connected a lot of.

238
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
And I think he explained it in a way

239
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
That really was almost like a tutorial

240
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
And he could tell you

241
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Everything

242
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
You know he could explain hierarchy housings work

243
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
You know there's really no such thing as a King app

244
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Because

245
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,727
There aren't people in these gangs you know studying these games that kind of studying from a sociological standpoint

246
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:31,615
I felt like Josh was probably one of the clearest historians that they've had in a long time

247
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Really

248
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
Put himself out there and because of Josh

249
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,111
You know other other major crimes were solved and

250
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
You know the Hope was that

251
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
Much more dangerous individuals

252
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Zorbing

253
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Taking off the streets

254
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Because of Josh

255
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
This gang is affiliated

256
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
With the heartless felons

257
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,495
The gang operated in the Glenville neighborhood between

258
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
Saint Clair Superior

259
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,079
East 105 Street area

260
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
7 months after Joshua begin cooperating

261
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
A bunch of important people in Cleveland would hold a press conference

262
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
The mayor of Cleveland police chief

263
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
People from ATF FBI County Sheriff's Office

264
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Prosecutor

265
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
They said

266
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
Six months ago we began an investigation

267
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
Announce the 13-person indictment

268
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
All members of a heartless felons Affiliated group

269
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Call the Cutthroats

270
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Joshua's General neighborhood

271
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,031
We looked at these gang members for crimes ranging from

272
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Voice results

273
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,199
Aggravated robberies kidnappings various weapons violations

274
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,063
They're also tied to at least one homicide that we know of right now

275
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,439
There were drug charges Rico charges gang charges more Gang Related rest will follow

276
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,071
BFDI didn't talk to me about Joshua's case or his cooperation by the way north of the Cleveland Police

277
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
Almost everyone in the Cutthroat indictment pleaded guilty

278
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
A couple of people went to trial

279
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
And again Joshua kept up his end of the deal

280
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
A year had gone by since his arrest

281
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
He thought he was all done helping

282
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,687
But then off they took him to the Justice Center

283
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
Or he got up in front of his dangerous Earth while friends

284
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
An out at himself as an informant

285
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,183
He knew that hate him for it could get killed for it if he's got the chance

286
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
We also figured

287
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
Everyone on that cuts word indictment all these cases

288
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
They were adults

289
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
They be going into adult prisons

290
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
He was staying in juvenile

291
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,799
He testified at the trial of one guy charged for a drive-by shooting like I was acquitted

292
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
And also in a murder trial

293
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,687
For that one Josh was only job was to identify the defendant

294
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Yeah I know him

295
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Joshua had no first-hand information about the crime

296
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
But the state put him on the stand anyway

297
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,415
Ask the prosecutor MOA dollar

298
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
Why put Joshua up there then

299
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
You had other people ID in your guy

300
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Including an ATF agent

301
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Including the defendant's own mother

302
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,727
Who said yeah that young man sporting the distinctively energetic ponytail in the surveillance tape

303
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
That's my son

304
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
So I put Joshua up there

305
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
You don't want to leave evidence

306
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Not you

307
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
You know you have evidence

308
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
We're going to use it

309
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Ensure that

310
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Yeah something like this a homicide word person

311
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Life is taken from him for no reason

312
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
Another person is Gravely injured

313
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
That we don't leave at the chance

314
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:30,559
You guys ever hesitate to use juveniles cuz you're just like let's try to keep them out of the stuff

315
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Sometimes

316
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
At it again depends on the case

317
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,495
Your problem is a lot of our Shooters are people who are killing people are

318
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Are Young

319
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
And other people to hang out with

320
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
The prosecutor from the other trial

321
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
The drive-by shooting told me

322
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
Of course they never want their witnesses to get hurt

323
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
He also said

324
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
In terms of Joshua after he was done testifying

325
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
I didn't really give him any thought

326
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,791
Lissa Rankin the public defender happened to be in the courtroom and Joshua was on the stand

327
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
He wasn't her client anymore but she recognized

328
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
And she thought

329
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
Wow they are still using him

330
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
This is still going on

331
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,871
You know I was very concerned for Joshua safety because we know how these

332
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Cases go

333
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
You know any of the kid

334
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,319
Other defense attorneys told me they do not advise their clients to

335
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
To cooperate unless there's no other solution

336
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,695
Too often the benefits aren't what they're cracked up to be

337
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
Well the risks crackle on for years

338
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,583
I talked to another public defender in the juvenile division

339
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Morgan Pierce

340
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
She told me she quote rarely if ever has a could cooperate with law enforcement

341
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Unless your kid can jump out of plane she said

342
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,895
They're either going to go to juvenile prison and be in danger or they're going to go back to their neighborhood and be in danger

343
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,735
And still very much trust the system to follow through on what they say

344
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
The prosecutors are not beholden to anything

345
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
So the kids are used

346
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Are naive

347
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:06,303
Lissa Rankin remembered how much the police officers had seemed to like Joshua when they interviewed on

348
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
I did encourage him

349
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
There's talk of him getting out of prison

350
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Going to school

351
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
There was a lot of talk that they would check in on him and

352
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,591
I guess you know ideally you hope that that means

353
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
Somehow protecting him

354
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
Juvenile prisons in Ohio

355
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,535
Are run by the Ohio Department of Youth Services odys

356
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
And if a juvenile prison system could have a golden age

357
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
This would be it 4 Ohio

358
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
10 years ago the system was forced to remake itself

359
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,335
After lawsuits and a state investigation that a federal investigation

360
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
If I need a consent decree

361
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,247
Back in 2007 a court-ordered investigation found what sounded like child abuse

362
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Potentially

363
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Severely overcrowded housing units

364
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,439
Untrained confrontational poorly supervised sometimes even vengeful staff

365
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
Using excessive force

366
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,791
And quote Reckless and malicious practices

367
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
Choke holds that created extreme risks of asphyxia

368
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,471
Java juices tactics in strategic locations to avoid cameras

369
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
Kids were also being harmed by other kids

370
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
I need no real Avenue to complain or to get help

371
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
Sometimes they threaten suicide just to get into isolation

372
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,295
Then came federally-mandated and fairly massive reforms

373
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,879
It's hard to do away with solitary confinement as a punishment

374
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,207
Art staff from using Force except in extreme circumstances

375
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
And added lots of educational and therapeutic programs

376
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,143
Most impressively they really did redefined what juvenile prison should be for

377
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Weather condition before

378
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:53,055
Unless your child is hurting other people using a gun committing rape setting housefires

379
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,383
He's probably not going to an odys closed facility

380
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:01,503
Is going to go to a smaller residential or non-residential program in his own community

381
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,135
I want some young hot wires and spray painters still do end up in odys prisons for the wrong reasons

382
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,975
Address of Alternatives in their own rural counties or around head of Judge

383
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,071
Generally speaking Ohio is not locking up kids like that anymore

384
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,423
2004 through 2000 kids in Ohio juvenile prisons

385
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
Now they're about 500

386
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
In 2015 the Department of Justice issued a report

387
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,711
Celebrating a turnaround that has quote resulted in what is many ways a model system

388
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
We are calling the Ohio model

389
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Excellent progress yes

390
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,415
The one downside is that the kids who do get sent to odys

391
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
To borrow a phrase from Donald Rumsfeld

392
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Are the worst of the worst

393
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,351
Or if Donald Rumsfeld had a compassionate social worker said she might say

394
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,447
The kids arriving at odys now or more traumatized and higher needs

395
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,055
And instead of being divided among nine institutions there now corralled into 3

396
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,407
The higher concentration of sometimes-violent always struggling children

397
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
Living together in a smaller space

398
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,807
The facility where Joshua landed in September of 2014

399
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
It's called Indian River

400
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,183
Not officially maximum-security but functionally it operates like Judy Mac

401
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
One big building housing at time about 140 kids

402
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
They have their own school which is across the yard

403
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
I've been inside the main building

404
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
What's clean brightly-painted

405
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
Life-size posters of basketball stars are decorating the hallway

406
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
What does 8 units roughly 20 kids doing unit

407
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
Single rooms with doors that close

408
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Each unit has ad a room with a TV

409
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
They can play video games

410
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Play cards of Dysart

411
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Contraband

412
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,111
The kids go to school to therapy they might have jobs cleaning a cup

413
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Cafeteria ordering maintenance

414
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
At first things went okay for Joshua to Indian River

415
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
No one knew he cooperated with law enforcement

416
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Josh Rosen family didn't know

417
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
He saw that the heartless felons were in charge of some of the unit

418
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
Controlling the video game remote

419
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,055
Taxing kids for their food forcing them to clean up or to make 3-way phone calls for them

420
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
All of which Joshua had anticipated

421
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,175
Heartless felons were invented in Cleveland's juvenile lockup

422
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
And Joshua had been inside one of them before

423
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
When is about 13

424
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,111
Does the first time he saw how tightly they operated inside prison

425
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,208
Joshua had already passed the various tests to get absorbed into the Gang

426
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
They call it getting twisted

427
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,144
If you don't want to be perpetually bullied and assaulted

428
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
If you want to be able to eat

429
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
Other kids taking your food

430
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,520
Joshua said you try to join

431
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
And to join you have to get three bodies

432
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Assault 3 people

433
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
Other other juveniles are staff

434
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Strike

435
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,328
An Indian River Joshua with an Insider well-positioned

436
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
Nobody was asking him where you from

437
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
Always the first loaded question

438
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
She was friends with the leader of the heartless felons

439
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
The Godfather

440
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Rgf

441
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
Vouch for him

442
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Is good for about a year

443
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
Then he had to testify at the trial downtown

444
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
And a Slither of rumors started back at Indian River

445
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
The Joshua had told

446
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
Cuz like the beginning of 2000s

447
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
The Donald

448
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
Popped up like what are you talkin about what what specifically is happening

449
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Working around me

450
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,880
Whenever I ask Joshua what it was like to testify how he felt about cooperating with the

451
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
The police

452
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,208
The dancers are rushed in a little mechanical

453
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,560
As if the subject triggers a tiny Guillotine window and is Brian to zip closed

454
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,632
Protecting the more fragile synapses from exposure

455
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,472
What account with practically digital accuracy though

456
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,032
Is when the trouble really really started

457
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
Indian River for about 2 years

458
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
And then he transferred

459
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
To a minimum-security juvenile prison

460
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
Call Cuyahoga Hills

461
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Summer 2016

462
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,112
That's when the bare-bones rumors about Joshua started to Take On Me

463
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,560
Cell phone

464
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,864
He was like

465
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
Ambulance

466
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Cuyahoga Hills is in a suburb right outside Cleveland

467
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,856
Lots of people from his neighborhood or rival neighborhoods

468
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
Coming and going

469
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Family members visiting

470
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
Calling gossiping

471
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
And someone from the drive-by shooting case

472
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
The Joshua helped

473
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
The police with

474
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Not one of the defendants from that case

475
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,192
But the victim you've been shot in the leg with an assault rifle

476
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,520
That victim he was also at Cuyahoga Hills

477
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,616
Joshua said they'd seen each other a year earlier at the Justice Center

478
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
When Joshua had to testify the trial

479
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,528
And now I Cuyahoga Hills that kid was telling people who Joshua was

480
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
What Joshua did

481
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
It was Open Season

482
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
Everyday

483
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
Cuyahoga Hills unlike Indian River

484
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,768
Is 8 units with open dorms

485
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,328
There's one seclusion room per unit in case

486
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
But otherwise kids are mingling all the time

487
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
Which if your target

488
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Is tantamount to a hellscape

489
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,824
A quick look at the odys rundown of incidents involving Joshua

490
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,384
You see the rush of assaults as soon as he gets

491
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
Cuyahoga Hills

492
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944
Like a blood pressure spike

493
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
July 3rd

494
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
July 7th

495
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
July 19th July 22nd

496
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
Joshua can fight

497
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
A few staff members told me he can really fight

498
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
He told me his moves got the attention of one guard who's also a gym teacher

499
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,560
Joshua said the guys to watch the surveillance videos

500
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Best fights in admiration

501
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
Anyway Joshua fought back

502
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
But he said more and more people were assaulting him

503
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,544
First of the three people than for people than 6 people

504
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,896
The worst assault in terms of the physical damage done to Joshua

505
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
Was in September of 2016

506
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
It happened in the schoolhouse

507
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
Haven staying clear of school because you knew it wasn't safe there

508
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
But he said they told him he wouldn't be allowed to take his GED test

509
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
If you didn't have 90%

510
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Attendance

511
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,120
Then next thing you know like I was walking through the school hall

512
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
And then

513
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,008
Black dolphin

514
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
I woke up in the hospital that's all I remember

515
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,384
Oh my god really have no memory is like

516
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah I got to start it

517
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
My head on the door

518
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
On the ground

519
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,440
On the doorknob when I was

520
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,256
Lay down and I'll just had a seizure

521
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,096
I was coughing up blood

522
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Modern members

523
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Oakland Hospital

524
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,704
Clothes full of blood

525
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
How long are you in the house

526
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Hospital

527
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
I was just there for a couple of hours and I

528
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:30,272
Are they coming back in the same part of the institution with the higher higher higher ranking

529
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,832
I worry about wearing some back at square one

530
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Another attack

531
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
December 30th 2016

532
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
Joshua's jumped again

533
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
This time he firmly believes a guard made that happen

534
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,144
You just been moved to a new unit and he started arguing with the guard on duty

535
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
Joshua said he went and took the unit phone

536
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
And the guards desk

537
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Deploy to get some attention

538
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
He put it in his Foot Locker by his bed

539
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
When give it back

540
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
The guard had ordered pizza from the kids on the unit Joshua said when the guard came in with the pizza boxes

541
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
He told some kids

542
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Go get the phone back from Joshua

543
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
And you can have your pizza

544
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,208
Knowing full well Joshua says that that would likely lead to an assault

545
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
I did

546
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
Three kids jumps Joshua

547
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
I got out of hand

548
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Joshua said the guard then cuff them

549
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
Start to walk him out

550
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
But then a bunch more kids

551
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
Joshua thinks about five of them

552
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
They joined in

553
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,872
Got trash on the ground so now he's got about eight kids on them all heartless felons while he's handcuffed

554
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:34,016
Joshua said the guard didn't call a signal 88 to ask for help that's for a serious fight or riot

555
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,576
Is that a different guard called a signal 5

556
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
Which means other staff are more likely to mosey over to help

557
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
Rather than run

558
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
But Joshua says more guards finally did come over and one of them put his own body between Joshua and the kids

559
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Door stopping him

560
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
If I pick you up

561
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,576
Sutter Clinic

562
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
Three guards were also injured

563
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,952
Joshua says after that they took him to operations

564
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,768
We sat there for another hour or two handcuffs

565
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
Then just went into seclusion cell for a while

566
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,192
I ran all of what Joshua told me by odys

567
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,264
But the department would not answer any questions about Joshua

568
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
Did you not discuss juveniles in their custody

569
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,944
Nor were they provide anyone for me to interview about their policies or procedures are philosophy generally

570
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,040
Because they said it would be in service of a story about a particular use

571
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
They did send me a general statement which will get to later

572
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,720
Joshua said all along he's been telling me administration at Cuyahoga Hills

573
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
I am not safe

574
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
I heard similar complaints from other kids at odys

575
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
I told them

576
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
They didn't really do anything

577
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
You see an Institutional reports and lawsuits over the years as well

578
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,336
Allegations that staff knew kids were in danger from other kids

579
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
I didn't do enough

580
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,736
Joshua said he practically begged the people in charge at Cuyahoga Hills

581
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
You got to send me back to Indian River

582
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
Snuffer's Dallas all down there

583
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Stop

584
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
And then

585
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Institution like they basically

586
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,304
I kept coming back and back for like parlay

587
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
2 months

588
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,144
Like I'll never stop never stop

589
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,448
Dancing by sending look like

590
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
And they danced they still didn't do it

591
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,080
Apply how to speak methadone with the

592
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
But the superintendent at the institutional Hills

593
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
He basically said like

594
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,992
Like it was my fault that I was getting started like

595
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
Again odys did not comment on Joshua

596
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
This case including whether he asked to be moved

597
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
But I don't know

598
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
That was bringing everything on me

599
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Likes and like that I called the boss

600
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
People

601
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
She just told me like

602
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,776
You better stop or so me gorgeous what's wrong

603
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,896
He thinks you're a heartless felon still

604
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
Yeah that's

605
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
But nobody was saying I kept telling him I can't explain

606
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,808
Lights flickering off and gorgeous

607
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Lake Emily

608
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Like bring it back on me

609
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,208
Like like you just keep your mouth closed

610
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,072
After about six months at Cuyahoga Hills Joshua met with a couple of lawyers

611
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
Defense attorney

612
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,448
Who said he'd figure out if he could get Joshua early release from odys

613
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,776
Anna civil rights attorney mr. Paul cristallo is matter of fact

614
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
Then you might remember from aramis's case

615
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
That's how I learned about Joshua and Paul

616
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,456
Attorneys were shocked they said

617
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,272
It seemed like the heartless felons were colluding with staff

618
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,368
They considered asking the State Attorney General's office to launch an investigation

619
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
In the meantime

620
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
Paul had called the facility to say

621
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
I know Juvenile Justice expert but

622
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Seems like you might want to move this kid

623
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
NPS

624
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
You might be suing you

625
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
More after the break

626
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
This is the road to hire

627
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:13,408
Brought to you by zip recruiter just Toro works as the lead recruiter for terrafugia

628
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
Latin for escape the Earth

629
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Terrafugia is a company

630
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
That builds

631
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,552
Flying cars

632
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,624
They already have one prototype that really flies

633
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
But that's just one vehicle

634
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
They got all kinds of stuff in the works

635
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,280
One project will be more of an Urban Air Taxi

636
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
That will help transport

637
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:38,240
Passengers through the air invalid congested major cities

638
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:43,360
I could pick up a Supreme Being reincarnated in humanoid form on the run from authorities

639
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,712
But that probably would be one used because of the wrong hands yeah

640
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
Cool movies n

641
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Yes

642
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,112
In order to do that they got to make a bunch of hires

643
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,696
In fact they've expanded from 20 people to 135

644
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
And just this past year

645
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,536
Embedded systems engineer

646
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,680
Senior controls engineer in HMI / ux engineer a manufacturing engineer

647
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
That's a lot of different kinds of Engineers

648
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
Yes

649
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,104
Define people qualify for some of those positions Jeff says he hires like

650
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
People who just barely missed the cut to become astronauts

651
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
Aeronautics geniuses

652
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
That's why he uses ZipRecruiter

653
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
It looks futuristic too

654
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Aesthetically aesthetically

655
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
So it just seems to be

656
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,464
Very easy to Monitor and read and track all the activity

657
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,512
Also tracks

658
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,560
How many people have used the job

659
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,864
So it's pretty good times and metrics that way

660
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
Check to see if someone time for me

661
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,216

676
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
I have to think back now

677
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:33,184
To access a more innocent time around 18 months ago

678
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
When I was still incredulous

679
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Give me a second

680
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
There it is

681
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
How could the government take a teenager

682
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
An unrepresented teenager

683
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:48,544
Persuade him to do the thing almost Nobody Does the thing law enforcement has been desperate for someone to step up and do

684
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Cooperate

685
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,896
Get him to generously spin through his heartless felons Rolodex

686
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
Then put him on the witness stand not once but twice

687
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,576
Then put it back in juvenile prisons patch pretty tightly with heartless felon

688
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,160
Offer parting handshake and a general note to behave himself

689
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
Remember that syo hanging over your head

690
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,560
And I'll get that same government then sit back and watch him get jumped

691
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,864
Again and again and again

692
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
How do they call an ambulance

693
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
To take him to the hospital

694
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
A month later according to Joshua

695
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,288
Arrange transportation to a couple of neurologist

696
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
Directions to the brain bleeds he said he was diagnosed

697
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
Oh and then that other check for CAT scan

698
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
How could all that have happened

699
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
And be happening

700
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,088
And yet I couldn't hear anyone aside from Joshua raising an alarm

701
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
Considered

702
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
Does anyone in my position would

703
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
There's probably more to the story that I'm not seeing

704
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
I set out to fact-check Joshua

705
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Begin with Miss Turner

706
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
Shayla Turner

707
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,752
Jimena literacy and Social Action Program inside Indian River and Cuyahoga Hills

708
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Call Freedom School

709
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,848
It's a curriculum design by the children's defense fund

710
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,456
Joshua says Freedom School was by far the best thing that happened to him inside odys

711
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
I changed his whole demeanor he said

712
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,064
Permit enraged suspicious scholar

713
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,648
Young man who is beginning to recognize his feelings and manage them

714
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
Every time I got mad she asked me why

715
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,816
Was the first time somebody actually ever sat down and listen to me vent

716
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
I tried to coach me

717
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Work with me

718
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
Joshua stayed in the program for two years

719
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
Longer than anyone else

720
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,312
When the program lost funding Miss Turner positioned herself as Joshua's mentor

721
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Kept in touch

722
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,944
I asked Miss Turner about Joshua's version the pizza incident

723
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,040
Because I figured she knows him well she seen his worst and best behavior

724
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
I figured she'd know whether he was exaggerated

725
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
Weatherguard really have handcuff Joshua

726
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,720
Are there more or less allowed more kids to assault him

727
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
I'm hearing stuff like

728
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Canal

729
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
The guard put handcuffs on them

730
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,216
Yes that is absolutely real in the way that I verify that is just

731
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
When asking to be able to see the footage

732
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,384
And their inability to do that only reason I know any of information about it is because

733
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,688
They called me to calm Joshua down

734
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,296
Are they called you yes so the facility called me with Joshua tomorrow

735
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Kevin Thomas mentor

736
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,440
To calm him down and that is the most angry I've ever heard him I can hear him crying

737
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
And I couldn't even manage that myself

738
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:21,120
I told him I needed to see him I said to talk to him in person and we went to go see him

739
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168
And that's when I saw the bruises

740
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
And the beating

741
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
That's was very strong

742
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,312
He's a fighter this is what got him into like this

743
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
This is something that

744
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
Straight comfortable answer to see him

745
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,736
That bad and be able to talk to him and find out what happened

746
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,296
It was horrible and then the guard was fired afterwards

747
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,112
The car wouldn't have been fired at the car when they've been in the wrong

748
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,696
I eventually got the Personnel records for this guard

749
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
He was fired

750
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
The later through a settlement with the Union

751
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,864
He was allowed to resign along with a pledge to never again working odys

752
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,448
The guard wasn't sanction for Joshua getting jumped

753
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,496
Who sanctioned because of the pizza

754
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,312
Did minute to taking 20 bucks from one of the kids

755
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
And using it to buy them Pizza

756
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
It's against the rules

757
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
It seems like

758
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,808
Every time he's telling me a story I'm just like it feels like inside of there

759
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,416
Certainly Cuyahoga Hills but also to return extended Indian River that it's just

760
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Chaos

761
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,584
It is absolute chaos

762
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
A little chaos

763
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
And that the kids seem in charge

764
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Or is that not true

765
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
I would absolutely agree with that

766
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:38,176
Yes and I want to resume our program was so beneficial because the children were outside with the program

767
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,016
If we were to have relied on just the staff I would not have failsafe

768
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
So the children

769
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,904
I wanted to speak to other kids who didn't odys

770
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,512
Juneau weather Joshua situation was real and whether it was common knowledge

771
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
It was me it was crazy I don't know

772
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Is that

773
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
This is Malik he's 18

774
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
Music Cuyahoga Hills with Joshua

775
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
He's an adult prison now

776
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,688
Blake said he saw Joshua get jumped multiple times

777
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
I feel bad for me

778
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
I got Malik name from a former staff member

779
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:23,232
It suggested he might be a good person to talk to you about what life was like at Cuyahoga Hills

780
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,840
She giving me a couple of names of remarkably Frank former ody us kids

781
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,960
She didn't know Joshua and she definitely didn't know that Malik is actually Joshua's cousin

782
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,800
If you overlay Cleveland and odys you see a lot of coincidence

783
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
Just like this

784
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,848
It's a pretty small world

785
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,968
Malik told me Joshua had it worse than anyone he'd seen come through Cuyahoga Hills

786
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,576
He said he himself had been high up in the heartless felons when all this was going on

787
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
He loves his cousin

788
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
They stuck up for him

789
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,168
So I went in and did Shannon like

790
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,384
He had words with a couple of the guys he said ask them to cool it

791
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,968
Did you personally get any blowback of Life why are you friends

792
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,320
Scatter yru

793
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
Heartless felons started to turn against Malik

794
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Sergeant steel from him he said

795
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,792
One night when he was sleeping someone hit a leak in the face with a combination lock

796
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Between the eyebrows

797
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
You need stitches

798
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,936
I talked to another guy named Leo from Toledo

799
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,496
Who did at Cuyahoga Hills at the same time as Joshua

800
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
Remember the assault in the school

801
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,336
When Joshua woke up in the ambulance

802
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
Somebody laughing hard

803
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Copt means hit

804
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
It was a big dog opossum

805
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,320
He went to sleep but he hit his face on the concrete wall

806
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
Caesar

807
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,024
My whole face is swollen and had went to the hospital for that

808
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,888
Leah said it was because where it had gone around Cuyahoga Hills the Joshua with a snitch

809
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,728
She was giving a prison staff information about the heartless felons

810
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Family

811
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Yeah

812
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,616
You know a lot of stuff about the time and he was just telling her a lot

813
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
He was on

814
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
Trying to get a better 10% or something

815
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,064
Getting a lot of people asking about his name

816
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Okay

817
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:32,256
When you heard like all the others guys a snack or did you have any feeling about that personally one way or another

818
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,840
It's what he deserves

819
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,776
I was heavily involved in there

820
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
You were

821
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,456
Snitching on me

822
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
Okay

823
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:59,904
So you did you know this like this hit on him was going to happen or no

824
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Yeah I know

825
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,536
Are you now okay can I ask you did you order it

826
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,584
I like talking to the man who ordered it

827
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
Yeah

828
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,408
At the time Leo said he was in charge of a section of the gang called YF

829
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
Young felons

830
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
So he called the hit on Joshua

831
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
Coincidence

832
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
He later become The Godfather

833
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
Joshua said he wasn't telling on the heartless felons at Cuyahoga Hills

834
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,976
But they were conflating his past cooperation

835
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
The present

836
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
Regardless

837
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
Leo said he was mostly hearing about Joshua

838
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
From the guards

839
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,424
Black Panther

840
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,496
I found out that he was on snitching

841
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,592
For telling you about him

842
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,527
In Cuyahoga Hills a kite is how you get a message to the office

843
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,367
Operation

844
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
And Annika superintendent

845
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,519
Staff was informing on Joshua Leo says to the most dangerous people in the prison

846
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Him

847
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
Leo

848
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,919
And his guys

849
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,975
I spoke to a couple of other former and current odys units from different facilities

850
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,535
I also spoke to current and former guards

851
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
Not disgruntled

852
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
People who like their jobs

853
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,911
Also current and former odys Social Work

854
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,007
Mostly adults Pokemon background for fear of retaliation

855
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
What they described

856
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
Remind me of a black market

857
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,175
Is it the juvenile prisons have their own Subterranean economy

858
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,319
Sucking in both Youth and staff who trade-in favors power and also cash

859
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:10,719
Of course I know corruption exists and I know juvenile prisons in particular are prone to bullying in Tamil

860
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:14,559
But this was a system recently out from under consent decree

861
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Metamorphosed

862
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
Ohio model

863
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:22,751
Who stated mission is not to punish but to habilitate Youth and Empower families and communities

864
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,895
Cuyahoga Hills has won a national award for how it treats the children in its care twice

865
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
And yet

866
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,223
Well I'm just going to run through some of what I learned

867
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
Take contraband

868
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
I interviewed a former guard

869
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Edward Kennedy

870
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
Is the only guard who agreed to go on the record

871
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
Possibly because he's got nothing to lose

872
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
He lost his job already after he was charged with domestic

873
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Silence

874
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,095
When we talked he was actually in prison

875
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
As a prisoner

876
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,423
Before that he worked the other side

877
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Azaguard

878
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
The Cuyahoga Hills

879
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
They called him why Isis and odys

880
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
OSU special

881
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,359
Edward said guards bringing in contraband

882
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Yes

883
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,815
Everybody knew about it

884
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,143
The guy worked on one of the most unruly units Edward said

885
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
When he was on duty

886
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
Everyone was curiously chill

887
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
Edward said that guard ended up getting fired

888
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,151
Edward said he himself didn't bring anything in like that but he said kids did ask him to

889
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,223
We'll keep the unit under control if you bring in a cell phone

890
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Are some weed

891
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:44,159
A lot of feels on hand a suggestion I deal with on this phone that type of situation

892
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
That's Malik Joshua's cousin

893
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
And quite the businessman

894
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:52,351
Who's bringing stuff into the North and South buildings he said with the help of guards

895
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,655
Two or three at any one time he said

896
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,471
They go pick up stuff from his people on the outside

897
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Bring it back into Malik

898
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Sell it

899
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,615
And for the guards this wasn't just about keeping the units calm

900
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
Was about making money

901
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Lakewood pay them

902
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
And how much were they getting

903
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:17,695
Maybe it depends

904
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,999
707 interior

905
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,631
Oh my God that's funny

906
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,591
Oh my God how much does a cell phone go for it

907
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
So there's that much money moving around in there

908
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
The heartless felons

909
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,559
They're also called the family or the fam

910
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Which is another meaning

911
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Forever about money

912
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,727
Leo the former GF told me they take it seriously

913
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
You got to move product

914
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
Malik estimated there was anywhere from 7 to $10,000 in cash circulating at Cuyahoga Hills at any one time

915
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
Muscat sending money home sometimes through visitation by the time Malik left he said he'd sent home about 2500

916
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,391
Dollars and had about 900 on hand

917
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,767
The commodity running alongside and sometimes feeding into the Contraband Market

918
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
Is violence

919
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:31,935
Three guards I talked to one current to former the guards feel hamstrung sometimes

920
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,775
Because some of their best tools for controlling the kids were taken away by reforms

921
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,311
Certain physical restraint

922
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Seclusion

923
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:43,199
I could even put kids to bed at 7 p.m. anymore could make them keep their hands behind their back

924
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,527
The kids can be violent the guards are outnumbered

925
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,087
You can't count on Swift backup from operations

926
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
There's a fight or riot

927
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
So yeah the guards will sometimes provoke kids

928
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
Tom Thumb or insult them

929
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
So that the kid will respond in kind

930
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,119
And then the guard has an excuse to shut them in their rooms and not have to deal with them

931
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
I talked to a former social worker named Casey hotels

932
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,751
I told me she saw that kind of thing a lot

933
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,823
Casey worked at the Cuyahoga County Detention Center

934
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
The therapist until last summer

935
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,943
The Detention Center isn't technically odys

936
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,759
But there's a lot of cross-pollination with odys

937
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,551
Especially with Cuyahoga Hills

938
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Terms of staff and kids

939
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
And gang culture

940
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,951
Stafford Sharon's and

941
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:32,607
Show the doorway of their room. Do something do something do something

942
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:39,007
When you come out like when they're in their transition so they're locked up in their rooms over you come out like I want to see you I see you do that

943
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,431
North another site happens you can lock down the whole unit and then you just sit in the Bay Area for the stripper

944
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
Watch TV

945
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
And you would see stuff like that

946
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Yeah

947
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,623
Casey tell me a story about two kids who fought

948
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,463
And then when the loser of the fight was being a pain in this one guards ass

949
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,791
The guard asked the winner of the fight to go after the kid

950
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
A second time

951
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
He offered

952
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Scott use

953
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
Extra commissary

954
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,191
Shoe

955
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
No

956
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Incidents like this

957
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
Stop orchestrating youth on youth attack

958
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,247
Everyone I spoke to from Odyssey

959
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,527
It's common

960
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,599
Edward the former Cuyahoga Hills guard said

961
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,183
Yeah girl formal relationship with the highest-ranking gang member

962
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,231
Ross the strongest youth on the unit

963
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,047
And use that kid to keep the rest of the kids in line

964
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,887
Did you ever experience that were a guard said to you

965
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,191
Like can you go take care of

966
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
Sound so or called a hit on

967
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,823
Stephen Shore

968
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,967
Getting off to take care of

969
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,271
We're going to take care of y'all

970
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,599
Wait who is taking care of who

971
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,439
If you don't take care of whatever you need whatever you want and we going to get it

972
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,487
If you did what

973
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
And why were they wanting you to be honest

974
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
I mean

975
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
Disrespectful

976
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
Whatever

977
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
And what would you do

978
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Return

979
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Funny whatever I wanted

980
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,759
The final thing I'll mention

981
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
Sex

982
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,599
Sexual assault or attempted sexual assault

983
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
And also

984
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Sex

985
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,975
Does Leo and Malik said they had sex with multiple female guards

986
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,023
Who are in their 20s and 30s

987
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
A Cuyahoga Hills

988
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:44,959
Before Joshua was transferred to Cuyahoga Hills back when he was

989
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:49,055
Is doing okay at Indian River he was swimming along in this corrupt Water 2

990
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,895
Taking advantage of it he could get anything in there he said

991
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
P*** weed lighters

992
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Tequila

993
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,807
He said he never jumped anyone for money but he did operate as a middleman

994
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:04,671
Gardner Pam maybe $20 maybe 42 arranged hits on certain kids

995
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:10,303
Joshua said sometimes the hits were in retaliation for something violent a youth had done to a guard

996
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,119
Maybe the kids through pee on them or attacked a female

997
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,215
The guards aren't supposed to strike back so they use the kids are proxies

998
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
Right

999
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Flight

1000
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,623
I don't know man flight

1001
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:40,767
Many people I spoke to about odys they didn't explanatory wall like this

1002
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Detect

1003
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
You just

1004
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
You have to see it you have to

1005
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
I can't

1006
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:51,007
Joshua's best effort I thought was when he explained it as a kind of madman's vacation

1007
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,823
Vacation

1008
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,943
Vacation for the youths uninor vacation for the garden

1009
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,671
Slither going to wait for you to come in and get

1010
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
Any of this I'm going to be a totally

1011
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
Squeaky clean

1012
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:17,375
Just do my time card and not get pulled into anything is it possible to exist like that

1013
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,519
Or something

1014
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Yeah

1015
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,199
Youths guards

1016
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Social workers

1017
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
They all told me

1018
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,575
Forget to quote-unquote succeed at odys

1019
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,903
To get help stay out of trouble and get back out

1020
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,463
You need a rare rare confluence

1021
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,863
Havelock grit and influence

1022
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:58,847
I spoke to for social workers who are two different odys facilities

1023
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,503
Their experiences span 2012 to 2018 they all said there were plenty of people who wanted to help

1024
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,831
The kids to advocate for them but there was no way

1025
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,135
When former Indian River guard told me

1026
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
Everything was Hush

1027
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
Hush hush

1028
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
The social worker said they were discouraged from Raising problems or calling out cruelties guards who added kid to sex

1029
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
Defender say or look the other way when a child got jumped

1030
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,751
The social worker said there was a strong no snitching culture

1031
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
Among the staff

1032
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:33,919
A couple of them told me it was made clear to them they might not be protected if they were to be assaulted on the units

1033
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,503
One person tell me the clinical notes she was writing her kids files

1034
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,063
Airports that had to go to the courts every 6 months

1035
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,367
We're being edited by another staff member

1036
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
Tell her boss put a stop to it

1037
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
When she went to look back at a note she put in one kid's file describing a salts on him that appear to have been facilitated by staff

1038
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,631
Her documentation was missing entirely

1039
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,031
Several social workers told me that they started to lose their own sense of what was normal what was ethical

1040
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,639
It felt like the kids had no protection from abuse or from coercion

1041
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,479
I've been trying to stop it they'd help the kids navigate it

1042
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,295
One told me there was nothing I could do

1043
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Another told me

1044
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:19,231
I mean I just have to be realistic about it to pretend like they were getting rehabilitated was foolish I tell the kids all the

1045
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,791
The time the system is not designed to help you

1046
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,351
Georgia Cuyahoga Hills

1047
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,215
National award winner had a mask on she said

1048
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:35,103
Every story I heard about odys every allegation from Houston staff current and former

1049
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,735
We're at it by odys again they didn't comment on anything specific but they gave us this statement

1050
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:46,879
Whenever there are allegations of misconduct we swiftly investigate and take appropriate action they wrote

1051
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,463
Dys has increased programming security and supports

1052
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:57,119
Deserve the most challenging youth in the state who have lengthy criminal histories and often have gang affiliations that they bring into the

1053
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,911
Facilities

1054
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
January of 2017

1055
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,639
Joshua went back to Indian River

1056
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,967
This time they didn't keep him on one of the heartless felon yunnan

1057
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,039
A alpha B Bravo an end November

1058
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
Instead they put them on D Delta

1059
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,927
Delta was the closest thing Indian River had to protective custody

1060
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:24,255
Mix of kids from Columbus to Cincinnati Youngstown

1061
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,279
A few clevelanders

1062
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
When I first started talking to Joshua that's where he was

1063
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
D Delta

1064
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,399
On unit restrict

1065
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,471
Meaning he couldn't go to the normal places in the facility

1066
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,335
Okay the teacher comes to you

1067
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,663
I can't go to school

1068
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
All the time like now

1069
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,527
I can't go to the school to the cafeteria

1070
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,511
How long is that been going on that you're not leaving the unit

1071
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,863
It's been like that

1072
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
It was now mid May

1073
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,215
5 months of unit restriction

1074
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,007
For Joshua's own protection

1075
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,079
He felt safe fish on his unit

1076
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,639
He said he was cool with most everybody Indie Delta

1077
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,943
His hopes were set on early release

1078
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
And then who knows maybe a lawsuit but

1079
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,551
Early release was the main thing he wanted

1080
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
I talked to Joshua every couple of days

1081
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
Sometimes everyday

1082
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,463
Early on he started describing what sounded like

1083
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,255
An uptick in the usual chaos

1084
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Catholic holidays

1085
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
Crazy

1086
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,399
What do you mean

1087
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,215
Like a whole nother

1088
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,431
He said about 15 kids from a alpha heartless felons unit

1089
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
Had yanked the door open and stormed the kids on D Delta trying to conquer

1090
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
Are there unit basically

1091
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,207
Because their unit wasn't joining HF wasn't submitting to HF

1092
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,511
Do Delta was more HB

1093
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Headbusters

1094
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
Rival gang

1095
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,887
Do Delta had kids from Columbus and Cincinnati

1096
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,727
Kids from those places if they're in a gang they tend to BHB

1097
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:15,103
That was most of the tension and then persona non Joshua was on detail tattoo

1098
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,431
The distress dispatches kept coming

1099
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,479
His unit had been rushed on their way to school

1100
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,039
Doesn't the kids swarming at them from across the yard

1101
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:27,391
Stop heard them back inside before anyone is hurt but it's really scary

1102
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,671
Evan another riot

1103
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
The time on a alpha

1104
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
It's in stop attack of Youth in his room

1105
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,351
There's so many people walking around here in my unit with black eyes and stuff piece

1106
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:41,215
We just got two new dudes on our unit dude from Toledo they jumped him twice in one day

1107
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,751
A dude from Cleveland

1108
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:49,407
Azusa Cleveland

1109
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,183
Sometimes in the Carl's Joshua sounding jangled

1110
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,231
He said he couldn't take it anymore

1111
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,767
Too much stress on me

1112
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,375
I don't want to go to this forever

1113
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,935
I would like

1114
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:17,311
In early July Joshua's unit was put on aov protocol

1115
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,103
Act of violence protocol

1116
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,639
Turn up like lockdown

1117
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,431
7 p.m. bedtime

1118
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,015
Meanwhile he said the heartless felons were larking around

1119
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,807
TV and video games all day

1120
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
Getting to go outside

1121
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
Indoor Nike shoes jogging pants

1122
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Watches

1123
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,207
His unit Allstate issue stuff

1124
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,279
Stuck inside watching the heartless felons the aggressors

1125
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
Through the Windows

1126
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,119
An Indian River guard I spoke to confirm

1127
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,447
Yes they had been putting some units on aov protocol lately

1128
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,775
But b-bravo the unit where the heartless felon leaders are

1129
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
Too dangerous

1130
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
Yeah this guard said

1131
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
They won't even try

1132
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
Who said his unit

1133
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
United

1134
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
They discussed it

1135
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,783
This isn't fair we're not safe

1136
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
The staff isn't protecting us

1137
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,903
It feels like the superintendent is siding with the heartless felons

1138
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,671
Protecting them

1139
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,463
And we're the ones being punished

1140
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,231
For fighting back

1141
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,535
They all rode up grievances

1142
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,839
Which they sent to the odys central office

1143
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,983
Stir in three letters

1144
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Are you home are you in Spanish

1145
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
Said that we don't feel safe

1146
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
Nobody

1147
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,295
Words that whose idea was to do this

1148
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,319
This is ma

1149
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,599
Activism

1150
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
Look at that

1151
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,183
Respectful to whom it may concern activism

1152
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,999
WhatsApp member didn't Riverhead help Joshua with a

1153
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
You should send the package

1154
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
Did you go to Columbus

1155
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,119
In care of Julie walburn

1156
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
Assistant director of odys

1157
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,239
Joshua didn't know who Julie walburn was

1158
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,055
But the judges down in juvenile court in Cleveland.

1159
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,847
Including Joshua's judge

1160
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,127
Kristen Sweeney

1161
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
Who's also the administrative judge for the juvenile court

1162
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,247
Here's how she described Julie walburn to me

1163
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
Stage

1164
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,599
Drenching spring rain after

1165
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Months of drought

1166
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,719
Julie walburn had come to work at odys that April

1167
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,023
A month before I started talking to Joshua

1168
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,327
And he start describing the Mayhem in Indian River

1169
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,911
Auburn had come to a recent meeting of juvenile judges

1170
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,935
In Cuyahoga County

1171
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
And she said

1172
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,287
We know about the violence and the world breaking we're going to fix it

1173
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
Text Sweeney Todd

1174
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Finally

1175
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,431
How long has it been that I have

1176
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
Like the end

1177
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,527
Petition is sort of not taking some of the

1178
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,063
The violence seriously

1179
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,135
Probably at least for 5 years

1180
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
At least four or five years

1181
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:46,303
That's in the post consent decree post reform era of odys

1182
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,143
One of Jake Sweeney's colleagues judge Denise Rini

1183
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
Choose Malek's judge

1184
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:54,495
Give me the backstory of how the spring rain came to be

1185
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,055
She got the case back in December

1186
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
Accident Indian River

1187
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,359
Heartless felon

1188
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,919
Inside his case File or pictures

1189
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,455
Heritage meaning

1190
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,551
And I'm looking at all these photographs in their photographs of

1191
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
You smoking marijuana

1192
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
What weight I have

1193
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,439
Judge Rini keeps the case folder on her desk

1194
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Remind her she explained

1195
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,767
Power failing these use

1196
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,815
When we let heartless felons run the facility

1197
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
Instead of the adults

1198
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,655
We look through the stack of photos together

1199
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,959
From inside

1200
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,287
There are definitely smoking

1201
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,151
Diwali smoking listening to

1202
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
Give me an iPod sign that

1203
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
Gang signs

1204
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,039
Why don't know from gang signs but

1205
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,855
I assume that's what that is

1206
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,647
So then money

1207
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
Holding up

1208
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Wad of money

1209
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,815
Where was he posting from inside

1210
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
Oh really

1211
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:57,471
The kid had a cell phone and an Instagram account where he was posting these photos

1212
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,823
So just be nice all these images and December of 2016

1213
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,103
She flipped her lid

1214
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
The impunity

1215
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,527
The message they're sending to other kids go to anyway us smoke weed make money kick it with your friends

1216
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:14,623
Good rainy sits on the state judges committee for juvenile law and procedure

1217
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,903
Can I just

1218
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,975
Sent them to all of the members

1219
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,815
So they started calling odys and saying this is unacceptable

1220
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
In January

1221
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,911
Officials from odys came to a judge's meeting

1222
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:31,519
And they were trying to explain why this was occurring

1223
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,799
And

1224
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,823
I was

1225
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:40,223
Visibly distraught to say the least we're done Floyd put her hand on my arm and said

1226
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:46,879
Where cuz what was the explanation like how do you say it was an isolated incident I'm like he is 37

1227
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:53,279
1 Pages how isolated is this we you know I'm in the facility everyday and you know this doesn't really

1228
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Only happened on my

1229
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,655
It's on Instagram what do you mean it doesn't happen so they were basically just kind of like

1230
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
Whitewashing it

1231
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,847
My biggest issue was you are not helping our community you take these Youth and you put them in here and they come out in there

1232
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,175
And then you know actually they've no tray there no vacation

1233
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,759
And they have no ability to act appropriately

1234
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,575
So what what are we doing besides housing now

1235
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,903
Anna in a facility where we're not teaching them anything

1236
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:25,279
A few months after that meeting the assistant director of odys abruptly resigned

1237
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,583
And Julie walburn took her place

1238
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:34,239
As soon as she came on board she walked through the according to her she walks are all the facilities

1239
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
She met with all of the the

1240
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,335
Heads of each facility

1241
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
And she said

1242
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:46,015
And we're going to take back the facilities and we are going to ensure that the Jews are not only safe because there was a lot of fighting

1243
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:50,623
But the ones that are the Bad actors are going to be removed

1244
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,167
In mid-june

1245
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,983
Joshua told me that the superintendent of Indian River

1246
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
I gather the syo

1247
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,335
The kids who had adult time attached to their sentences

1248
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,895
I could kick in if they didn't do well in juvenile

1249
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,735
Odys hadn't been invoking Goose adult sentences

1250
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,783
But now the superintendent told them

1251
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
New sheriff in town

1252
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,391
We now have a zero-tolerance policy for syo

1253
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,927
Any infraction

1254
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,463
Doesn't even have to be violent

1255
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,999
We can seek a bind over

1256
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,791

Late July

1259
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,423
Another call

1260
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,215
Joshua told me

1261
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
He just found out

1262
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,519
Had a court date

1263
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,079
This is tomorrow

1264
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
Tomorrow

1265
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,639
Yeah

1266
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,431
Why would you have any court dates

1267
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
Why would you have a court date coming up

1268
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
Oh you're kidding

1269
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,159

1270
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,767

1271
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,047
Stuff like that

1272
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,679
I told Joshua I couldn't imagine anything drastic was going to happen

1273
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
How could it

1274
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
The system knew his situation

1275
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,311
The Joshua wasn't hearing that

1276
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,871
I don't know what to do like

1280
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
Look at 18 years life though

1281
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,791
If Joshua got bound over

1282
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,839
That was the adult sentence he was looking at

1283
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
18 years

1284
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
That was his syo

1285
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,239
Joshua wasn't going to the court date tomorrow

1286
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,519
But I could go

1287
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,799
And watch the adults

1288
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,103
