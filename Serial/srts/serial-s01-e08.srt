1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Previously on serial

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:07,680
I think the odds of you getting the Charming sociopath you're just not that lucky

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:12,032
Buy please please James Moore so I was kind of like

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
Maybe the police are putting them up to this

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
I said

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
What measure volume

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,688
Newton ball

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,368
Willing to take us out and show us where the vehicles Park

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
Are you still willing to do that

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
Global Tel Link prepaid call from

11
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
An inmate from Maryland Correctional Facility

12
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
Okay

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,232
My name is Miss Stella Armstrong

14
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
Baltimore Maryland

15
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072
And you were a juror

16
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,120
Adnan Syed case right

17
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Yes I was

18
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,520
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one story told week by week

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Sarah Koenig

20
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,920
I wanted to know from Stella Armstrong why she voted to convict Adnan Syed

21
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
She immediately talked about J

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
But you believed him

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,344
Like I said it's been a while but I remember the one young man

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Who was the

25
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
Supposedly his

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Friends

27
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
Who had enabled him to move the body

28
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
Right hand that struck me that

29
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,144
Why would you admit to doing something that drastic if you hadn't done it

30
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,776
You know what I mean for what reason what was he going to gain from that he still had to go to jail

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Oh he didn't defend didn't

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
He walked

33
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
And estranged

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,344
The same thing I asked anyone who's come in contact with j

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
What is Jay's deal

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,024
I don't mean that he pled guilty to accessory after the fact in a first-degree murder

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Testified against Adnan and got no prison time as a result

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,400
I'll talk more about that in another episode

39
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
What I mean is what did you make of Jay

40
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,288
Which of course is code for what am I supposed to make of Jay

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
How to become a cross sitting up there on the witness stand

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,920
What's his demeanor on the stand

43
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
Kid did he seem like

44
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
He seemed like he was

45
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
StreetWise

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
I hope that's the best way to put it

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,744
He seemed like he you know got around in the neighborhood tour

48
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,560
He was able to take care of yourself

49
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
He remind me of

50
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,936
He would be that friend if you got in trouble you would call

51
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
You know what I mean

52
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,616
Save I was back in high school and I'll and somebody was bothering me he remind me of somebody I would call

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
To help me

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Like if somebody was fighting me or

55
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:04,832
It was believable to you that he would be that guy for I like he would be the guy that I return to

56
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah

57
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
That was my impression

58
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
And no because we all have somebody in our life like that

59
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
You know

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
That you may know a cousin or

61
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
A relative

62
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
Who is something go wrong

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
You think you can call to help you

64
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,544
Just said that I just did a very quick scared of all of my

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,944
I contacted my family and I said I feel like I can't think of one of their also useless

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
We will say they also useless

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
Wearing a tie sometimes a jacket

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
He's handsome he's tall and thin

69
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,424
You can see in the video over a little each time he speaks into the microphone in front of them

70
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,264
Since JS credibility was the state's case

71
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Attorney Christina Gutierrez

72
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Try to rip it to shreds

73
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
That essentially was her defense

74
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,784
She uses the word truth and lie as often as possible in a cross examination

75
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Exchanges like this one

76
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
Pictures asked him

77
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
I know your second interview on tape

78
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
That you were not telling the truth were you not

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Chase's

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
I was not telling you everything now

81
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,423
What you were telling them

82
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
Were they not

83
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,103
Some

84
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
Is it not stink

85
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
Pictures ask Jay about Best Buy told him there were security cameras in the parking lot and at the

86
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
The entrance

87
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
Jaden kill hey why would they care whether there were cameras there she asked

88
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
Cheapest to Jay almost casually

89
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
Believe

90
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,375
Directions to do

91
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,215
With the death of Haley Wright State

92
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Funny question

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Did you kill him in one

94
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
You want Frozen

95
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,063
The defense attorney tried to make him

96
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
But basically she was trying to show DJ killed

97
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
I was blaming it on and on

98
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
Which disorder that's what I remember

99
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
Nothing led us to believe that

100
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
She had a

101
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Motive

102
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
To kill misli

103
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
That really stayed with me because she was so adamant that he was a liar

104
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Right

105
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
Did you just didn't buy that he was lying about it

106
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
I didn't bother that it was a lie I bought the fact that he was telling the truth about what happened at that moment

107
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
Different

108
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
This must have been a harrowing nerve-racking stretch in his life

109
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,959
The trial itself really boring

110
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
Manchester procedural stuff that's always boring

111
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
The cross-examination is boring

112
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Even if the star Witness

113
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,455
When defense attorney I talked to said that boring this can be a strategy

114
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,295
She's a lawyer's know that people can only pay close attention for so long

115
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
45 minutes an hour

116
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Before they start to flag

117
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
So it's not see a tricks that gets people to crack

118
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Tedium

119
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,327
Which would explain so much of a Gutierrez was doing if in fact that's what she was doing

120
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
She spends a lot of time on streets for instance

121
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
The trajectories of different roads where they travel Northeast or Northwest with their names change as they cross from the city into

122
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
County

123
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
On buildings how they are situated

124
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Is

125
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
A box

126
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Structure

127
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
With the Best Buy

128
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,183
Logo of an Angel

129
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
Three more visible

130
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
Home Security Boulevard

131
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
If not

132
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
Ryodan and that's

133
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
There's a light there that if you were not on Security Boulevard

134
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
He went straight

135
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
We will go into the parking lot

136
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Up Security Mall

137
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
Jay doesn't crack though

138
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
He's alert he is polite he stays with her

139
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,695
He stays with her when she's calm and soothing and boring and he stays with her when she gets a little more shouting

140
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Yes ma'am no ma'am answers which if I had to guess is probably 75% of what Jay says in Cross

141
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:38,751
There's a part where the chair is tries to suggest that Jay was cheating on his girlfriend Stephanie with Jen pusateri

142
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,359
If you were stepping out on Stephanie

143
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,943
Funny relationship

144
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
With me

145
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
With anyone

146
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Call Stephanie

147
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,159
If you or stepping out

148
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
What that term means don't you

149
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Anyone

150
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
Henning name anywhere

151
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
That would have been passive

152
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,055
Stephanie would it if not

153
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
If

154
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
You were stepping out with Annie girl of any name from an

155
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Funny location

156
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
That would have been packing

157
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
Your relationship

158
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:31,231
Stephanie wood

159
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
Fishman

160
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
Irritated is Sybil

161
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
Excuse me your honor he says when Gutierrez gets loud

162
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
Could you ask her to stop yelling in my ear please

163
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,615
Goodyear has died a few years after this trial so I can't ask her but I have to take nothing

164
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Doing here as accidental

165
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
Choose a successful sought-after defense attorney choose aggressive and obviously the court room is no place for pulling punches

166
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
But you got to wonder whether moments like this hurt and Nas case rather than helped it because

167
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,815
It's Baltimore half the jury is black 7 out of 12 actually

168
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,423
She probably comes off as a nice young Man and the Sea

169
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,007
Sometimes unwittingly testimony is almost poetic

170
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,103
He says you told Jen pusateri to be honest with the detectives because quote

171
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
The lies that we were telling to try to protect each other during the truth

172
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
Anon wanted to kill her

173
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,439
Mysterious took it as a grain of sand instead of concrete

174
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
Image of hay in the trunk of the car stuck with him he says I've never seen anyone dead before

175
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
The first thing I thought was how fragile Stephanie was

176
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,431
People lie in court under oath all the time

177
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,295
Witnesses lie lawyers lie police lie this should come as a shocker to no one

178
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
And I'm not saying that's what happened here I'm just saying that I'm not assuming that everyone who participated in a nun's trial told the

179
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,559
But clearly the jury found a believable or believable enough

180
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,399
After 6 week trial the convicted in on in Just 2 hours

181
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,751
We talked to six jurors and none of them had any lingering doubts about the

182
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
The case none of them wondered if the investigation was shotty

183
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,663
None of them are much bothered by had J statements to police had shifted over time

184
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
To be hung up on that

185
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,831
I should be concerned about the inconsistencies

186
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
I'm concerned about you are

187
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,487
As I mentioned the detectives involved in this case didn't want to talk to me for the story

188
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
I turned to this guy

189
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,375
You are Jim trainum James to deal with James

190
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
And we weave

191
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
We hired you

192
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
I'd like

193
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,567
Me you're a real detective I'm just playing one on the radio

194
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,151
Homicide detective in Washington DC

195
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
A jurisdiction not too different from Baltimore

196
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,599
He's become something of an expert on false confessions and an advocate for better interrogation techniques

197
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
It goes around the country during presentations about it

198
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
Everything we had on this case

199
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Niles tapes transcripts

200
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,887
And again I want to be clear that we paid him for his time to huge amount of material to go through

201
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
Turn on two things

202
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
First just overall

203
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
How is the investigation into Hae Min Lee's murder

204
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
Did the detectives do a good job or did they screw it up

205
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,503
I'm second how should I be thinking about Jay as a witness

206
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
What were the detective scene that maybe I wasn't

207
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,183
Yes he thought the inconsistencies were a problem to

208
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
Also said don't forget the flip side

209
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,143
But I'm also looking at some of the consistencies to write at some of the

210
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
He took them to where the car was

211
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
Grandpa

212
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
That's a huge thing right there

213
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,919
Jay had a big piece of reliable information that the cops themselves did not know

214
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Where his car was

215
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,295
Story complete the circle for the cops

216
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
They were suspicious of a non from the beginning

217
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
Adnan Cell records

218
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,743
They get to Jen who leads them to Jay who tells them it's Adnan

219
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
Their suspicions have now been born out

220
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
Thanks to Jay truan on tones phone

221
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
Satisfying investigative Circle

222
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
A murder case

223
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
On a silver platter

224
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Substratum

225
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,335
Put on who they consider to be The Logical suspect

226
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
I mean yeah

227
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
It's pretty much a dream case

228
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,479
Part of what training does is review investigation

229
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
This one is better than most of what he sees

230
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
The detectives in this case were cautious and methodical they weren't rushing to grab suspects or to dismiss them either

231
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
The evidence collection is well-documented

232
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
Which I didn't expect to hear that even though it's basically a one witness case the cell records mostly don't match Jay state

233
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
There's no physical evidence linking Adnan to the murder

234
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,383
Despite all that to an experienced detective like this looks like a pretty sound investigation

235
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
I will say this is better than average

236
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
But what I'm saying is this

237
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
The mechanics the documentation the steps of a took

238
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
And all of that

239
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
They look good

240
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Okay

241
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
I would have probably follow the same route

242
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
However

243
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
What were unsure of

244
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,167
Is what happened to change a story from A to B

245
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,239
And we do not know

246
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,079
What happened in the in those three hours or whatever like that

247
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
And that will always

248
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Result

249
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
And a question

250
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
As to what the final outcome I mean should have been

251
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Here's what he's talking about

252
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
Both of J's tape statements there's a before

253
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
Period of time before the tape recorder is turned on

254
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,279
When the cops first bring Jay in on February 28th

255
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
They talked to him for about an hour before the tape one on

256
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
March 15th the second interview

257
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
Jason's is initials to an explanation of Rights form at 3:15 p.m.

258
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Send a text Art

259
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,383
Today's date is the 15th of March

260
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
It's a proxy

261
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
20 minutes after 6

262
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Good night

263
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
6:20 p.m.

264
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
So from 3:15 to

265
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
620

266
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,903
3 hours have gone by since Jay sign that form

267
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
This is what's called the pre-interview

268
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,023
Training says that's where the Mischief can happen

269
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
The contamination

270
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
Necessarily intentionally but it happens

271
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,775
The pre-interview was when the cops in the witness kind of iron out the statement so could be taped as a coherent thing and that was

272
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Standard procedure back then

273
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Now look a lot of jurisdictions

274
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,991
Baltimore homicide detectives videotape the entire interview from the moment the person steps in the interview room

275
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
On March 15th we know the cops had shown J at least some photographs from the investigation they refer to that on the tape

276
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
And races at trial that he was confronted with the cell records during that interview as well

277
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Do you have to wonder says China

278
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,143
Whether he was massaging his story to fit with the cops wanted to hear

279
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:08,287
Inconsistencies in Jay statements that the cops are catching him in cops are used to that

280
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
Every confession has inconsistencies

281
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
You just need to understand why they're happening

282
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Is he minimizing his role is he

283
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Protecting someone

284
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
JS case yes and yes

285
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,111
But how do you make sense of the inconsistencies that don't seem to have a purpose

286
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
Like the one about going to the Cliffs at Patapsco State Park that afternoon

287
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
Drops out of the narrative at trial

288
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,607
And for my where I said I'm like yeah it doesn't work because doesn't fit your timeline and he can't get back

289
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
The track in time

290
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
If you went out and smoke

291
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Edjoin

292
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,079
No you're not at all because I think that you could on one of the biggest problems

293
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
That we have with the way that we interview and interrogate

294
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
I hear

295
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
And the fact that

296
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
We have a excellent Witness

297
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
Do we got somebody who's giving us the whole case right here he's broke it wide open for us we don't want to ruin him

298
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Insults

299
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,583
You know how much do you want to push how much do you want to create quote unquote bad Evan

300
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
Love like there's no such

301
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,007
Like I said it's called bad evidence

302
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Right

303
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
You don't want to do something if it's going to go against

304
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Your theory of the case

305
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:23,039
I don't get that I mean that's likely with my father used to say all facts are friendly

306
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,111
Action that be more true for a cop than for anyone else like

307
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
You can't

308
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Picture you can pick and choose

309
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
I'd rather than trying to get to the truth what you're trying to do is build your

310
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Case

311
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
And make it the strongest case

312
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Possible

313
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
But how can it be a strong

314
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
Hayes and how can he be a great Witness

315
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Their stuff that's

316
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
Not true or or unexplained

317
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
And

318
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,247
Come back is it there's always going to be things that are on

319
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Explainable

320
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
But like I said

321
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
Also remember verification biases

322
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Kicking in here

323
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Where is well

324
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
I want to believe you

325
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,767
I am because you're my witness and I think this is what happened and all that

326
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,839
So the fact that you're giving me something that's inconsistent

327
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
It doesn't fit my theory of the case

328
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
What is verification bias caused you to do

329
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Ignoring push it aside

330
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,591
And that's what they're doing here with these inconsistencies are kind of pushing them

331
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,711
I was curious to him that the cops never search J's house for instance

332
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
But they never subjected him to a polygraph

333
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,879
He said maybe that's because he was on their team now helping so you don't want to push too hard

334
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:36,255
He said the cops quote probably settled for what they thought was good enough to be the truth on quote

335
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,351
He said he did have doubts about Adnan claim of Innocence

336
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,447
But that he definitely thought there was something quote-unquote off about this case

337
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
But we still don't know what happened in this murder

338
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
We still don't have the true story

339
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
I don't believe James Version

340
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,455
I think that there is a lot more to it than that

341
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
Is the eye I feel that

342
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Definitely minimizing

343
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
His involvement

344
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
Peter to either protect himself

345
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,487
Peachisoda for water water freeze

346
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
Protect himself to protect somebody else

347
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
Or because I wanted it was right there with them

348
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Right

349
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,751
But I cannot prove that he's given to me without contamination

350
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
Write the real problem is is that

351
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
How do you prove it one way or the other

352
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Right

353
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,551
The answer's probably live in those unrecorded pre-interview hours

354
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
A black hole of crucial information

355
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,743
The stuff wasn't all video to Interlink their holes were never as you're saying like we're never going to know the in

356
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
But for what things that I could know the answer

357
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
You're too if your me what's the biggest thing I need to

358
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Figure out then

359
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Did Jada talk

360
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Okay

361
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,759
Okay so we passed the city limit

362
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,599
Schneider and I went to CJ

363
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,951
We did not warren j we were coming which is not the gentlest reporter move I know

364
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,535
The best chance of success if we met him face-to-face

365
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,167
Taking a car case for why we wanted to talk to him and he could have a better sense of what we were about

366
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
Dick move to show up at someone's door

367
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
Joe and I were nervous

368
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
I am so hyped up

369
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Listen to the tape I wanted to get myself a Xanax

370
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,991
Super excited to talk to him

371
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,319
Like if this works and I mean

372
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,183
He knows he knows everything we want every question we've had

373
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
For the past

374
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
7 months

375
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
Weather like

376
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
There's a

377
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
Treasure chest

378
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Answers

379
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
That we've been looking for this

380
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
Whole time

381
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
And he

382
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Has it

383
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Cheez-It

384
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,575
Whether or not we don't even know if he's home

385
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
We arrived

386
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
He was not home

387
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
So we came back again many hours later

388
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Knocked

389
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Answer the door

390
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
Tall and skinny and exhausted looking

391
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
It was Friday probably end of a long work day for him

392
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
He nevertheless invited us and asked us to sit down

393
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
We didn't record anything

394
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
20 minutes maybe

395
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Does a tense meeting

396
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
An emotional meeting in fact

397
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
Afterwards Julie and I felt like we walked into a stranger's house lobbed a Grenade on to his living room carpet and then

398
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Goodbye

399
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
We debriefed back in the car

400
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
Here's the first thing he said I mean you said

401
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
But there are a lot of people who say that they don't

402
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
I think I did it

403
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,911
Keep very forcibly settled and who did

404
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
He said he did

405
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
He was like I was there

406
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,823
I saw it like I know what I know

407
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,687
He was very forceful like I can't believe he

408
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
He won't even man up

409
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
And admit it

410
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
He just totally scoffed

411
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Shut the idea that

412
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
Anon

413
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Whidbey Clinic

414
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
He was very calm

415
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
Like how would you describe his demeanor

416
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Tired

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Yeah

418
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
She seemed tired

419
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
And a little and weary but not

420
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
But actually very polite and actually started very

421
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Sweet

422
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
Tired

423
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
But he also said

424
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
I'm feeling like so much are animal rage right now even you bringing this up now

425
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
But you got a good job of

426
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
You know

427
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
I'm keeping it in cuz he didn't seem like he was about to about to hit something but in

428
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,656
More frustrated understandable way

429
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,008
Jay was understandably skeptical of us and of our motives

430
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,360
When we left Jay said he think about an interview and get back to us

431
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
He left a strong impression

432
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
Julie maybe even more than on me

433
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
Even just hearing him

434
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,112
So forcefully deny in a land so forcefully say I know he did it

435
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,976
You know it's your face to face

436
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,536
He's right there he's a person

437
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
He sang at he seems

438
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Like he really means that

439
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
This is not pleasant for him to talk about

440
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
So you know

441
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
It sounds

442
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
Believable

443
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,968
Add ice totally saw the appeal of him

444
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
Other

445
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
Person in a friend and a witness

446
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,744
Correspondence sporadically by email in the weeks following our meeting

447
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
He said he wasn't afraid of the truth

448
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Finally in so many words

449
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Decline an interview

450
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,920
What is the deal with Jay

451
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,760
I talked to dozens of people mostly his friends and classmates

452
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
Woodlawn High School a range of opinions about whether he was a good guy or not a good guy

453
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
Define categorization

454
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
He was different

455
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
Can you like the Rodman of our

456
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Like

And I had a belt buckle belt buckle

463
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,000
Dennis Rodman is the best way I can describe it

464
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,840
You know if I buy if he was at my house my mom came home and he left you be like who's that

465
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Then why is he here

466
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Salo

467
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Either weirdo

468
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,056
I didn't know too many black guys that were into all those kisses and chicks

469
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
In the big

470
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Like that

471
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688

You know

474
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Fs17

475
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Anything different from you is weird

476
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
School

477
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,656
He loved animals giant rat eating frog

478
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
We love the outdoors

479
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:45,312
Fishing hiking swimming

480
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
I think it was actually pretty good at lacrosse

481
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,760
Call Winery dude could run for days there was no training needed for that kitty could just run forever

482
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,832
What you think he wasn't the type to put on training in

483
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
Right because he wasn't a jock

484
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Is more of a Stoner

485
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
They didn't seem to care whether he fit in

486
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
And you always change

487
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
Very honest

488
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
With who he was

489
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
My beautifully unconventional guy

490
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,128
Jaden come from the same kind of household as a lot of the other kids he hung around with

491
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
He lives with his grandparents and his mom

492
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,016
But his friends say it seems like he was more or less taking care of himself

493
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Had a job

494
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
His mother depended on him

495
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,928
Program at Woodlawn who is Gen pop

496
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,512
Their term not mine like general population at a prison

497
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,888
He hung out with some of the magnet kids because his girlfriend Stephanie was in the program

498
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,216
People told me contradictory things about Jay

499
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,544
Woodlawn including one teacher

500
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592
Unflattering things about him

501
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,176
Nothing terrible just that he was mean or intimidating

502
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,736
Some kids thought of him as quote-unquote Shady

503
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
But you wouldn't want to push him

504
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,600
You got the sense that if you cross jaehee come after you

505
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
But then I also her descriptions of that included the word goofy

506
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
AR stoner

507
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,536
Or it was just a pose

508
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
Something to put on to Cintas

509
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,376
He's he's Alpha

510
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
Is definitely an alpha male

511
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,008
This is Chris who says he was one of Jay's best friends around this time

512
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,360
He said in the hallway at school

513
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,456
He wasn't mad or anything he's just messing around

514
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
Chris remember this one story or it seemed to me all the different versions of Jay I'd heard

515
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,880
The Goofy and the scary were contained in it

516
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:40,768
You know we have weird argument sometimes I remember outside of one of my cousin's house has he tried to stab me

517
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
I'll because I hadn't been stabbed before so we got into a fight over a actually I gave him a knife

518
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,472
If I work at a knife shop

519
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,800
I gave him

520
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:59,200
So we're literally like fighting outside of my cousin's house and he's like

521
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,600
Before you need to know what it's like and unlike your own I can let you stab me

522
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:15,584
I talked to three people who said they knew Jay well or hung out with him around the time of the crime

523
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,400
About what happened

524
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:24,288
I want to Chris first because when J spoke to detectives that first night during his first

525
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
Jay mention Chris by name

526
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,200
How to ask Jay if you told anyone else about this murder and Jason he told Chris

527
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Bristol me police never questioned him

528
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,344
Not that he can remember anyway and he thought you remember something like that

529
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
There no notes in their files about an interview with Chris

530
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,744
Kristen was true Jay did tell him about what happened

531
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
His version

532
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,864
The building blocks are the same but this running details are unfamiliar

533
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,704
Of course giant caveat it's 15 years later that I'm asking Chris

534
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Tell me

535
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,032
For comparison purposes here goes

536
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,944
Chris has Jay told him he was at a pool hall out on Route 40 in Catonsville when he got a call from a non

537
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
Precise they were crossed

538
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Street from each other at the time

539
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,672
He told you that I done came to get him when he was at

540
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:18,048
He was shooting

541
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
Yo where are you we told her where it was

542
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,936
Add nacho. Because I know I got to talk to you is like

543
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,568
Convinced him to come outside with him

544
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
And

545
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
Is car or I don't know if he's driving his car Haley's

546
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,480
In this version the trunk pop happens at the pool hall

547
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,832
Chris AJ told Adnan he wanted nothing to do with it but not enforce them

548
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,392
He was in it now he was an accessory

549
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,976
Couldn't go to the cops because of his own illegal activities

550
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
CJ Woodstock

551
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Help bury the body

552
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,888
Chris figured Linkin Park with likely J's idea rather than add-ons

553
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,008
Present information about the crime itself doesn't quite match the states version

554
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,312
He said Jay told him

555
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,640
Confronted hey about flirting with another guy

556
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Car salesman

557
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,248
And when she call the nun crazy he snapped and strangled her

558
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
Chris said he heard this happened

559
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
In the parking lot of the Woodlawn Public Library

560
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
That's the one that's right there on campus

561
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
Where Asia said she saw Adnan that day

562
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
Chris has Jay told him that Adnan threatened to kill Stephanie if Jaden keep

563
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,800
His mouth shut this is not the first I'd heard about something like this Jay told the cops that he worried and none would hurt Stephanie to

564
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:38,944
And you also testified at trial that have not had made it clear he could get to Stephanie anytime we wanted since they were such good friends

565
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,296
Stuffing herself tells the cops this is in their notes from their conversation with her

566
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,856
The J told her to stay away from a non

567
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,744
Chris has Jay told him and showed up at Jay's house with Stephanie not long after the crime

568
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
I made a gesture to indicate

569
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
I'll hurt her if you're not careful

570
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,608
So

571
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,960
Stephanie goes in your inside pack jammie steps out onto the

572
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,264
It all the porch with Adnan he's like

573
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Snuggling terrorize me

574
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Can you keep your mouth shut or something

575
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
App

576
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
If it if he had any weakness it was Stephen

577
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
David duhigg move heaven and hearth if it

578
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Kanto

579
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Protecting Stephanie

580
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,024
I talked to Laura a friend of Jays and Stephanie's and John's and Alvernon

581
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
Laura Estrada Sandoval

582
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
She was close with Stephanie

583
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
They play sports together

584
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,984
Her parents didn't agree with their relationship cuz he was just like

585
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,848
They felt like he's like he wasn't going to melt anything wasn't going to school

586
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
You know Stephanie

587
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
She's beautiful and she said she was

588
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
Start Ashley

589
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,064
She said she got a scholarship to college Lake

590
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:54,464
Perfect you know like she ran the fastest she's always like

591
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,792
In-Shape no matter what you could eat anything

592
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
It Mike

593
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,192
She always saw the good in people no matter what like no matter if her parents are telling her

594
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,984
Good influence on you

595
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Because she looked Jay so much

596
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
For him

597
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
Douglas

598
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
She was his like good thing in life

599
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:19,040
She was like out of all the craziness like Stephanie was like his amazingness

600
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
Stephanie didn't want to talk to me

601
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,160
I know what I spoke to who knows her was surprised by that

602
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,744
Two person they said she never talked to them about what happened either

603
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
I said it was like a wall came down and they can penetrate it

604
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Lord in their friendship

605
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
Because we really needed to talk about it

606
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
And Stephanie wouldn't or couldn't

607
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:44,384
Laura hung out with Jay all that summer before the trial and she says they just didn't discuss it

608
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:49,504
His murder was this enormous sad frightening elephant nobody wanted to go near

609
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,088
Jason Patrick told me he couldn't get you to talk about it either

610
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,416
What happened

611
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,976
Dodge Ram

612
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,096
Does Patrick by the way isn't the one I've already mentioned in an earlier episode from the call log

613
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
Different Patrick

614
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,752
This Patrick went to Woodlawn he was a year ahead of Jaso 2 years ahead of Adnan and Hae and Stephanie

615
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,128
Patrick lost touch with J when all this went down he says he tried and tried to call but you never responded

616
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,224
Years later maybe around 2005 Jacob back in touch one day

617
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
And then they saw each other a little party

618
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
Patrick asked him about it

619
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,904
Turn all of these like Renditions and versions of stories from the Sun

620
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
Having fun of me now like I can get to the truth and

621
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
End

622
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
You know

623
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
I was afraid he was going to hurt

624
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Stephanie

625
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
And I was like

626
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
Staten Island

627
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
Can you threaten her and

628
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:52,480
He said he was afraid that he was going to hurt her that's why I guess I took it as a threat now

629
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Everyone I pushed him

630
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,952
Detail at Christian for more

631
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
It wasn't

632
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
I didn't get it

633
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
Like he wasn't he wasn't going to

634
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
Go any further with it you know and there was a lot of

635
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
What does drink beer

636
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,664
Patrick says the Stephanie explanation sounded pretty thin to him

637
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,504
But you can't get anything else out of Jay and figured it wasn't his place to force it

638
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:31,648
LJ's friends I spoke to whether they thought J was telling the truth about what happened that night

639
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
I got some Curious answers

640
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,024
Because his friends had a reputation for lying

641
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
But not for lying about something like that

642
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
Something so big

643
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,936
Sort of the same way he had a reputation for being scary but not

644
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Scary scary

645
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,032
The first thing that popped in my head was like jail eyes

646
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
Why does that jayla's about everything

647
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,432
But Kathy again that's not a real name or her real voice

648
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:59,552
She's the person who said I was acting weird at her apartment that night of the murder when they brought him over

649
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,880
Talking about it and saying you

650
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,208
Vajazzling inconsistencies at the first thing that

651
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,584
Cuz Jay lies Jay doesn't tell the truth

652
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
About what what kind of stuff

653
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,936
I think it was kind of like

654
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
But everything nothing

655
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,336
I can definitely remember sometimes it would be telling a story

656
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,152
Hey what's really know it was b*******

657
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,248
LOL I remember one time I'm looking at Jen and generally guys like

658
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,064
Here we go again you know I mean like this is a b*******

659
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,256
Chris and Patrick told me that Jay would tell them stories

660
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,328
Tall Tales almost that they figured had to be made up

661
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,400
Then sometimes the stories turned out to be true

662
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:53,312
And Kathy said sure Jay might lie about what he had for breakfast or even whether you went to Patapsco State Park on the afternoon

663
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
January 13th 1999

664
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,432
But she didn't think Jay was lying about the crime itself

665
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,528
Because she's convinced Adnan is guilty based on a nonce behavior that night

666
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
What he was saying when you got that phone call at your house

667
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
Teresa Terry

668
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
Of all the people about this crime

669
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
She ever thought J was lying about that night

670
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
I spoke to her briefly at her work

671
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
Shorts at a discount store

672
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,712
But she was totally uninterested in talking to me

673
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,320
Nothing to hide she said she just did not want to talk about that time in her life.

674
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,392
She did answer my one big question though

675
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
And her answer was yes

676
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,024
She believes Jay then and that hasn't changed in the intervening years

677
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
But she did lie to you somewhat back then

678
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:54,752
Remember he tells Jem that night that he doesn't know where add-on put his body but they don't know enough to go to the police

679
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,592
Jen told me she could understand that kind of lie

680
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,432
But anyone in his position forced into something he wanted no part of

681
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
Anyone might have told the same kind of lie

682
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,552
I didn't shake her trust in his overall story

683
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,136
Then she was one thing she never believed

684
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,464
She said she never believed the murder happened at Best Buy

685
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
Because you thought there would have been security footage

686
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
And that never came out

687
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,656
I told her it seems like maybe there really weren't security cameras at Best Buy Back Then

688
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
She kind of shrugged and said

689
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,496
Oh well I don't know

690
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,736
I talked to said when I heard Jay was wrapped up in a murder

691
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
It didn't surprise them

692
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,344
Shocking

693
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
Not so shocking

694
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,512
People also said they couldn't Square J feeling threatened by

695
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,072
But that's just being wrong to them

696
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,168
Does Patrick and Laura and Kathy

697
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,472
People who spent a lot of time with j

698
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,520
The were shocked by Jason Baughman

699
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,872
Or something like that

700
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,944
They said that wasn't you

701
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,016
Same thing almost every single one of them

702
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Says about him

703
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,112
So the end up in this in-between place

704
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,440
Swear they can't quite wrap their minds around the story of that night

705
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Who's Patrick again

706
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,584
Intelligent inquisitive sweet goofy guy

707
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,376
Beautifully unconventional

708
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
I think

709
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Artemis

710
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,872
I know this so terrible to say I hoping someone

711
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
The source that she was

712
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
They had no choice so that

713
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
Hoosier outside of his

714
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
Control in that

715
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,976
Maybe he was looking out for the safety and well-being of others

716
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,072
He wasn't such a willing participant as she was

717
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
I hope that it wasn't

718
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,288
That grappling you can hear in his voice that's so common among this group of friends

719
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:08,384
People like Laura who can't imagine a non killing anyone

720
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
But also can't imagine Jay doing what he said he did

721
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,760
Or why he would lie about something so huge

722
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,856
If you're Laura and there's no scenario here you can rationalize

723
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
You're left with fog

724
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:24,512
This piece of tape I'm about to play you it's my favorite piece of tape from all my reporting so far

725
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
Because I relate to it so precisely

726
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,144
It could be me talking to Laura instead of the other way around

727
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,960
So then who's affected it like why would

728
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,288
State five ways it doesn't make sense why would

729
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,104
Why would

730
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
Hayward

731
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
I just I can't

732
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
Okay just as confused as you are

733
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,536
A J sentencing for his accessory after the fact conviction

734
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,864
He's wearing a white shirt has long arms hanging at his side

735
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
Towering over his lawyer whose teeth

736
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,264
She tells the judge all the stuff a defense attorney tends to cover at a sentencing

737
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:11,360
Just have upbringing that he didn't have adults helping instead of moral compass

738
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,432
What is hardworking and loves animals and is good with kids

739
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
He's headed to college and wants to better himself

740
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
She says she underwent quotes

741
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,624
Rigorous and demeaning cross-examination on the part of Christina Gutierrez

742
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
And she says he's remorseful

743
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
She says just now

744
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,768
He was weeping in the hallway about Haley

745
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,400
Prosecutor Kevin urick tells the judge he is thoroughly pleased with his participation in the case

746
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
And impress

747
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,288
I said very satisfactory you and I believe honestly testified

748
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
And also I would say something I

749
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:45,664
You don't usually see I think he actually showed remorse

750
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Judges impress to

751
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
NJ does seem genuinely torn up

752
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
There anything you want to say before I impose the sentence

753
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Justin

754
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,632
Whatever you do decide I'm like you know that

755
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
A real hard time even sitting here

756
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
People look at me

757
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
Ameristar food

758
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
Apartment at

759
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,464
The judge sentences J2 two years probation no jail time

760
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
His lawyer Mouse the words

761
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
Thank you to the judge

762
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,376
Courtroom with the only person who came with him that day

763
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Stephanie

764
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,800
Anon didn't testify at his trial which isn't unusual

765
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:51,200
Pictures aren't supposed to take that into consideration the judge tells himself that they are not allowed to hold that against the defendant when they

766
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Deliberating

767
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:58,368
Did it bother you guys as a jury that I done himself didn't testify didn't take the stand

768
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Yes it did

769
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
Text Lisa Flynn one of the jurors

770
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
That was huge

771
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
We just

772
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
I think

773
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
That was huge

774
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
We all kind of like gas

775
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,264
It's like Blown Away by that

776
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,080
You know why not if you're a dependent IRS

777
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,664
You know why would you not get up there and defend yourself

778
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
I try to prove that

779
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,040
The state is wrong that you weren't there that you're not guilty

780
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
We are trying to be

781
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
The open mind it was just like

782
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,952
Get up there and say something no

783
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,512
Try to persuade even though it's not your job.

784
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,536
Wait us.

785
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
I don't know

786
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
All this was going down

787
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
What do I know about it

788
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
But the jury didn't

789
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Next time

790
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
