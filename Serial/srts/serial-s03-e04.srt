When you're not in jail do you live with those 5 people

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,512
That's completely false

20
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
They lied under oath

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,376

Before we get started I want to give you a warning

28
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
I know a lot of the material in this series is hard to hear and hard to think about and this story maybe especially

29
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
In part because it involves children

00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
Rhonda gray is a police officer in Cleveland

Work your way up to Detective

Then homicide detective

36
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
She's experience is what I'm saying

37
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
She seemed a lot

38
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,568
In early October of 2015 she spoke to a reporter from cleveland.com

39
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,688
Yesterday I sat at Rainbow Babies & children's hospital with a

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,248
Mother of a five month old infant

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
She was too distraught for me to interview her

42
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
So instead I find myself comforting her

43
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
I am

44
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
I listen to her scream that they went through the ER

45
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,752
The five month old infant was in davia Wakefield

46
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,080
She been riding in a car with her family talked into a car seat

47
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
When someone started shooting from the street

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
I'll be always killed

49
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Chatterer chest

50
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,832
And I watch the mother the grandmother wash blood off her as she tried to save

51
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
And I just want to

52
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
Tied to the citizens of Cleveland

53
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
To speak up it's time to speak up there are people who know what happened there are people who saw what

54
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
Are people who hurt what happened

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
And it's time for them to speak out

56
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,080
Audio shooting came at the end of a hideous month for Cleveland

57
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Four children were shot

58
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
Not teenagers

59
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
Little little kids

60
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Three of them died

61
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
They weren't targeted

62
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
These are mistakes

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
Collateral damage from Street violence

64
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
The whole city was bereft

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Public officials people who deal with tragedy for a living

66
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
Unravel by what was going on

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,168
And the days after IBS death cops the mayor of the County prosecutor

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
Beggs public to speak up

69
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,800
Help us talk to us speak up speak up speak up

70
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Implored Delta chastised

71
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
Police chief Calvin Williams was plainly aggravated

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
All you people who complain about violence in the police

73
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
When are you going to stop yammering and do something

74
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Didn't say it quite like that

75
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
But almost

76
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
We need people out there in the community that are concerned

77
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Black lives

78
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,327
Brown lies White Lies with purple eyes

79
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,679
The stop out and do something not just have chance and slogans

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
We need people to do

83
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Help us

84
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Which really means

85
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Trust us

86
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
About two months after this press conference

87
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
The city held another press conference

88
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,135
This time they were grateful people had spoken up

89
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
They had someone in custody

90
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,791
This past Friday Devon Holmes was indicted on 13 felony counts

91
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
For the

92
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
Homicide of Avio Wakefield

93
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
On young guy named Devon Holmes

94
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
He just turned 19

95
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Indictment against him was robust

96
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,383
2 counts of aggravated murder plus one regular murder that was for the baby

97
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:09,503
Three more attempted murders and three more felonious assault for the other passengers in the car that day

98
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,551
Miraculously were unhurt

99
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
And another attempted murder and felonious assault for a bystander

100
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,743
Was it one big law enforcement fist were pounding on the public podium

101
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
This should not be happening in our city

102
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
And we got to do something about it

103
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,983
Add a Vons first court appearance the prosecutor noted that quote mr. Holmes has a history of violence as a juvenile

104
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
He asked for a million-dollar Bond

105
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
The judge said sit at 1.5 million

106
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
Couple days later another judge would raise it to two million

107
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,759
A year after that second press conference

108
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Almost to the day

109
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
I happen to be at a holiday party at a restaurant downtown

110
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
Biblical defense bar was trying in

111
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
I was tagging along with an attorney I've been interviewing

112
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
He's our friend and he said hey how's it going

113
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
And the friend also a defense attorney was beaming

114
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
Is a great we just got my guy out

115
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Oh really what's the case

116
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
A murder case

117
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
Baby

118
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
We're about taking a bath

119
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Wait what

120
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
Typically said it's a horrible case but my guy didn't do it

121
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
They got the wrong guy

122
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,295
Davon Holmes have been quietly released from the Cuyahoga County Jail

123
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
The charges against him dismissed

124
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Without prejudice

125
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
Which means the county could try to resend item in future

126
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
It for now

127
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
He was free

128
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Fabio's death

129
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
Are unassailable innocence

130
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
It's one of the 911 operator said that day

131
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
A baby baby

132
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
Killed in her car seat

133
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
It was a kind of incident that makes a city stop arguing for a bit over what the criminal justice system is doing right and what it's doing

134
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Wrong

135
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
So that everyone seemed to lineup

136
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Fired up

137
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Define justice for Avio

138
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
That's why I looked into this case

139
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
And all these awful shootings from the fall of 2015

140
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
Because I figured if any homicides were going to get the full menu of police and prosecution resources

141
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
It would be these

142
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
Everyone wants to solve the case of the five month old baby

143
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
So what happened

144
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
After all that effort wrong guy

145
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
What happened why did the police think it was Davon in the first place and what happened over the course of that

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
At your to make the state let him go

147
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
I heard about heard about all the tiles all the kids being killed as monitor

148
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
It was it was a big issue

149
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
It was all over the news

150
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
This is Davon Holmes did you know that there was gossip that you had done it

151
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
That's what freaking me out

152
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,687
I didn't never thought my name was in a situation

153
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
When I knocked on his door if he'd only been out of jail for a couple of months

154
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
He was living at home with his mother I had a speech in my head about why he should talk to me but there was no need degree

155
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,535
Right away is it people waiting for someone to come along and ask what the heck happened

156
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
I was not able to ask the police what the heck happened

157
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
The detectives weren't allowed to talk to me and techno Cleveland officials no police officials no one from the mayor's office

158
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
Would agree to an on-the-record interview for the series

159
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,199
I frankly never encountered a city government with a jaw locked up tighter than Cleveland

160
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
They wanted nothing to do with us

161
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:26,367
Which is too bad because Cleveland has some interesting Leaders with ideas and lots to say about their City

162
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
Just not to me so well I did meet the homicide detectives in charge of aavielle Wakefield case I could not

163
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Ask them

164
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
How much did you know about Davon Holmes before you arrested him

165
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Instead

166
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
I went to Dave on

167
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,543
He started at the beginning right after Thanksgiving 2015

168
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
I was at my mom house going to make me a plate from

169
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Leftover Thanksgiving

170
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
I was making a play in my mom said

171
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
What the police doing her like that

172
00:08:55,295 --> 00:09:00,415
So meet me at me I just look I ain't got nothing to be scared of I ain't you know I'm saying I did nothing wrong

173
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
So I come in and dining room my mom said come here

174
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
So I woke up there

175
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
They just

176
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Arrest

177
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Wake up me up

178
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
I said what am I being arrested for they don't talk to you

179
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Wouldn't talk to me

180
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
They say what I say what am I being arrested for

181
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
He say will tell you when you get downtown

182
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
It wasn't just a couple of cops at the door

183
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,015
It was the US Marshal's Northern Ohio violent fugitive task force in full battle rattle

184
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
There's a warrant out for his arrest

185
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
But he didn't know that

186
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
They take him downtown to the Justice Center to an interview room

187
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
And I sent a detective

188
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,095
You just dissed you a baby killer you you killed the baby I know you did

189
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
Everybody saying you did it we know you did it

190
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,263
Me I don't know what you talkin about I wasn't there I heard about the tile done

191
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,847
I feel bad but I'm not the one that did it y'all got the wrong guy

192
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,151
Are you you baby killer

193
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
You did wrong Houston

194
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Call me baby girl

195
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
Economy all type of baby killers in

196
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Towers in

197
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Just belittling me

198
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Hologram board

199
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
It was to the point that I just can't take it no more

200
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
Cuz I was cuffed up

201
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
I know what was going on

202
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
I think they was trying to scare me to

203
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Like

204
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Telling myself

205
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
But I can confess

206
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
I can confess to somebody to do

207
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
People do it all the time

208
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
You know

209
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
But

210
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,503
I was really innocent

211
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
Sussy okay I'm ready to go home

212
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
So the lady detective said no

213
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
You going

214
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
To jail for the rest of your life

215
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,767
The lady detective was Rhonda Gray

216
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:45,119
Same one who listen to Avila Wakefield mother screaming down the halls of the ER

217
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,751
Davon understood the pressure political and personal to solve crimes like these

218
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Over weeks then months

219
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
That's what scared him

220
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
The knowledge that he didn't kill ivy all Wakefield

221
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
And he could well be convicted for killing aavielle Wakefield

222
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,807
Cuz I know to 3-year thano probation

223
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Treatment this is the rest of my life

224
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
The death penalty

225
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Does a child we talkin

226
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
So I know what to do

227
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,631
Davon had been locked up before but the circumstances this time made everything more foul

228
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,775
The creeping mold the roaches having to wash his clothes and sheets in the sink or more often the toilet

229
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
The Relentless bologna sandwiches nothing healthy to eat from commissary no no no no

230
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
Norfolk Norfolk Norfolk do this when a thing sticks in his mind

231
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Repeat it in batches

232
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,743
Cuz if he's skipping a mental Stone Princeton one of his appointed attorneys Michael Shaughnessy

233
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,607
Is Shaughnessy a good dude though he a really good dude here real good dude

234
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
Quebedeaux ain't here just now

235
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
Savon said she honestly believed him so he didn't commit this crime

236
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
You could do what do they say do you like what do they say the state had against you

237
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Lodi weather

238
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Somebody saying they save me

239
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,927
Running with a gun in my hand somebody saying they can't identify me

240
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
No fingerprints no guns no ballistic test

241
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
No not all his work

242
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
Souly had

243
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
China Sea in another appointed attorney the one I met at the party

244
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
Would visit Des Moines periodically tell him they were working on it you have an interest in keep your head up.

245
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Davon said he was struggling

246
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,199
He was pent-up in every way a person can be

247
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:40,831
He said it was almost a relief when he got in a fight with some guy and got sent to the hole

248
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
About five months in a date was set for diwan's trial

249
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
June 27th

250
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
June 27th came and went

251
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
They said another child

252
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
For late October

253
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Week before that trial date

254
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
It too was canceled

255
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
A month after that they Vaughn's lawyers came to see him in jail

256
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
They said

257
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
Congratulations you're going home

258
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
It been a year since he was arrested

259
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,175
Davon said don't play with me like that

260
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
He say you go home I say when he said today

261
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
I said call my mom and tell him to come get me

262
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Cuz I just didn't believe them

263
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
I didn't call my mom and tell her to come get me

264
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Dakar

265
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Can do number cry

266
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
It was just like

267
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
All my Warriors

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
What's relief

269
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
But it's still hurting me cuz

270
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
I just did a year

271
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Wasted a year of my life

272
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
But telling these people is saying

273
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
They

274
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
I did not do it

275
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,319
David's not mad that the cops brought him in for audio Wakefield stuff

276
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
He feels like

277
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
They had information they acted on that information

278
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Fair enough

279
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
What came after

280
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Post-arrest

281
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
He's mad about

282
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
I feel like they should have did a little bit more investigation

283
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Cleveland they don't

284
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
Augusta cake

285
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
They good when they come and get somebody

286
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Today

287
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Dang good cops for investigation

288
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
When I asked Avon why they finally let him go

289
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
He said this

290
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Does the family

291
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,063
The family said that they know I had nothing to do with it

292
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
With which family

293
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
The child family

294
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,303
Wait that's what your lawyers told you that the child's family said you didn't have anything to do that in the Cordon

295
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
Said they heard I had nothing to do with it

296
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
How would the family now

297
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
That's what I like

298
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
Understand by the same time I'm happy that day

299
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
Realizing that I read into it

300
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
I don't think that's what happened

301
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
My mother told me

302
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
He said that's why you're getting out

303
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
So we had court in the family came

304
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
And said you didn't have nothing to do with it

305
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
And judge

306
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Dismiss the case right there

307
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
That's crazy

308
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
If they had court why weren't you there

309
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
That's what I understand

310
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
This story made no sense to me

311
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
But once I thought about it

312
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
It makes sense why it would make no sense

313
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
Many of the defendants I talk to in Cleveland

314
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
Especially the ones who were waiting in jail

315
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,807
I often knew more about what was going on with their cases and they did

316
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
Just taking a quick look at the public records

317
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
Because their contact with the outside world with the workings of the Court

318
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,839
Is stymied by multiple layers interference like a frustrating game of telephone

319
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:36,191
Maybe you're signed attorneys checking in briefly but that's about it

320
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
So there you are in the county jail only an elevator right away from the courtroom and Prosecutors office but all you have is a

321
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,431
Cloudy porthole to help you decipher what's going on upstairs

322
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
I don't know what evidence Dave us attorneys did or didn't show up I don't know what they told Davon about why he was being released

323
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
Attorneys will not talk to me for the story

324
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
I think they said no out of concern for Davon

325
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
The case of Bobby a Wakefield is still open

326
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:12,287
From the list of evidence the state handed over to the

327
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,895
And I can roughly piece together the swatches of information that led to demands arrest

328
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
In the days right after the shooting anonymous tips began income in certain names begin to percolate and repeat

329
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,879
Appears 4 days after the shooting

330
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,487
Crime Stoppers tip Davon Holmes another one the next day

331
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:36,863
Couple days after that TC telephone call from Anonymous mail reef tank

332
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
Take his Dave on his nickname forever

333
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Other names were still coming into

334
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
Then on October 10th

335
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,895
Little more than a week after the shooting police show a photo lineup to an eyewitness

336
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
I'm going to call this eyewitness the landscaper

337
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Because he worked at a landscaper

338
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
The landscaper was there when the shooting happened

339
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
On East 145th Street off Kinsman Road

340
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Brighten the middle of the 4th Police District

341
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
Busiest one in the city

342
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
Possibly the entire state of Ohio

343
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
The landscaper been working at a house across the street for some months

344
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,519
I only know the specifics because Dave owns lawyers filed a motion to suppress the evidence the landscaper gave police

345
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,407
In their motion they say that at first the landscaper had told police he hadn't seen the shooter

346
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
But that a little more than a week later

347
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
He came forward to say that in fact

348
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
She had

349
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
The police show him some photo arrays

350
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
He doesn't positively identify anyone

351
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
But he says two people look sort of like the shooter

352
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
Neither of them was Davon

353
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,839
The defense says Damon's photo was in that initial array

354
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
State says it wasn't

355
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,495
Any case about 5 Weeks Later the cops show the landscaper another photo lineup

356
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
First he rules out Davon

357
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Then changes his mind

358
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,383
Sense of someone else's photo looks like the shooter

359
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
Finally a week after that

360
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
So 57 days after the shooting

361
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
They show the landscaper that same photo array

362
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,695
And he says he's going to go with his gut and that he's 90% sure it's this guy right here

363
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Davon Holmes

364
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:15,679
Inner suppression motion Des Moines lawyers reference studies about how memory is malleable and subject to contamination

365
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,751
Especially in times of high stress we missed details

366
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,871
They argue the Davon doesn't really match the landscapers initial description of the shooter

367
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
Devon is younger shorter significantly heavier

368
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
By showing the landscaper his photo in these lineups maybe the police were in fact creating a memory

369
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
Landscaper was recognizing Davon

370
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975
Because he'd seen him before in these very photo arrays

371
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
They don't mention the studies I start looking into this the talk about how when eyewitnesses pick out someone as a purpose

372
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:51,263
Trader in a police lineup they identify innocent people more than 30% of the time

373
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
30% or the ones that say you're never supposed to show an eyewitness the same photo more than once

374
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
So yeah

375
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,087
Nearly two months after the fact the landscaper is suddenly 90% sure of his ID

376
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:13,535
I was aware of the landscaper statement but he was more focused on and Trouble by

377
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Another ID witness the state had

378
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
A guy I'm going to call John

379
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,495
Steven said John claimed to have seen Dave on after the shooting running with a gun in his hand

380
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,079
John had given this evidence when he himself was locked up

381
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
And facing serious charges

382
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
Aggravated robbery felonious assault

383
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Kidnapping

384
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,039
Damon thinks it's John statement that got him arrested

385
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,647
Paper it does look as if the case clicked into place as soon as John talked

386
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,743
Court records show that detectives talk to John on November 18th

387
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,607
And that same day they showed the landscaper another photo lineup with a Vons picture in it

388
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,959
9 days later is when the violent fugitive task force banks on Devon store

389
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Interruptus Thanksgiving leftover

390
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
But the disturbing part for Davon is that he knows John

391
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Well

392
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
And why did he idea

393
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,367
It was it was something to happen with my brother a long time ago

394
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
Invite you want a little tangent now

395
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999
Just because when I first heard what happened

396
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
I couldn't quite believe it

397
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
John's older brother and a Vons older brother

398
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
We're best friends

399
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:27,519
One day in 2007 when David's brother was 16 John's brother was 15

400
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
They tried to rob a guy coming back from the corner store

401
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,151
We just bought Newport cigarettes in a bag of popcorn

402
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
Teenagers had a gun

403
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
The guy also had a gun

404
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,295
And he shot and killed John's brother

405
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
The fifteen-year-old

406
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
Because they were together

407
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
And we're trying to commit a crime

408
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,511
And this is the part that blew my mind until I looked up the definition of felony murder

409
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,607
But de Vaughn's brother was charged with the murder of his best friend

410
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,655
Even though he didn't fire the weapon

411
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,263
Davon 16 year old brother was bound over to the Justice Center

412
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,823
Meaning he was transferred from Juvenile Court

413
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
Where the maximum sentence he could get was around 5 years

414
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
And prosecuted as an adult

415
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
He was sentenced to 18 years to life

416
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
He can try for parole in March of 2025

417
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
He's unlikely to get it

418
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
In the aftermath of all this

419
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,512
David said his family and John's family refine

420
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
Animosity

421
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,608
In fact his uncle is with John's mom

422
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
I thought of John has a brother

423
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,800
The way John statement was worded interpretation was that John wanted to hurt Deion's family

424
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,384
Maybe he blamed a Vons brother for his own brother's death

425
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
And wanted Revenge

426
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
I like the pain

427
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,184
I want to make clear that this isn't one of those cases where the honor student gets profiled by the cops because he was wearing a hoodie and lives in Ark

428
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Kingsman

429
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
When was treated like The Usual Suspects

430
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Because he is the usual

431
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
Who's part of the largest most Troublesome gang in Cleveland

432
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
The heartless felons

433
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Imagine the cops in Cleveland's fourth district were familiar with the Burley kid called tank long before I'll be awake field was killed

434
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
What is brother was locked up for his best friend's death

435
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Davon was 10 years old

436
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Damon told me himself was first locked up

437
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
When he was 10 years old

438
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Strong arm robbery

439
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,160
Much as I am tempted to connect these two events

440
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Davon is in

441
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,024
Made it I was angry about it like you I lost my big brother but

442
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,632
That wasn't the reason I was in the streets cuz I was in the streets when he was home

443
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
My brother used to make me go home

444
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
I get out go home

445
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
And I

446
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,360
Fake like a act like I was going home but I'll just go down another Street

447
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
What were you doing just being in the neighborhood

448
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,552
Throwing rocks at cars just being bad

449
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,952
And were you just skipping school all the time are you going to school fight

450
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Beautiful teachers

451
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,072
Breaking a cars going to school

452
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Anyway

453
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
Dora rocks

454
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Just

455
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,496
Give me food at the cafeteria in school

456
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,056
Run around security chasing me

457
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,456
They called my mama mama chase me through the school this is the school right across the street from Dave a

458
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,016
Don's house it's closed now boarded up

459
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,088
Davon has abiding respect for his mother

460
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
She loves them she tried to guide him never gave up on him

461
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,304
But when he was at that age he says he listen to No One not as mother definitely not as teachers

462
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,168
It doesn't actually know how far he got in school maybe 7th grade maybe 9th

463
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,984
Devin said he loved being in the streets

464
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,568
Infatuated with the word he used you loved all of it

465
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,968
The fast money and the car is in the girls the most of the rush adrenaline running away from people

466
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,832
Being chased he hated school but this came easily to him he said

467
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
Is a leader among his friends and organizer

468
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
You got older be sold drugs got a gun with the money got caught for Stuff Center residential programs group

469
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Holmes Escape

470
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,240
Has 14 he got seriously hurt shot in the elbow going to vicious car from it

471
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,080
You sent to a juvenile prison for the first time that same year

472
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,896
By that time Davon was already a heartless felon

473
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
A gang members prefer to call it a family

474
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,808
That was born about 15 years ago inside Ohio's juvenile prisons

475
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
And then spread to the world outside

476
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,440
Loyalty in his willingness to engage in combat

477
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
Earned him a pretty high rank in prison

478
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
He got into fights with guards

479
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,632
Which brought new assault charges which in turn brought more prison time

480
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,216
Is original six-month sentence stretch to 3 years

481
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,312
When he was almost 18 he came home

482
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,944
When he got picked up for the murder of adiel Wakefield he was just starting to Tire of the streets he said

483
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Starting to slow down

484
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
Idle hard time comprehending devons resume

485
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,696
Specifically Dave on the early years

486
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
When he was a little boy

487
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
9-10 years old

488
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Richard scare though doing it by your side understand like how a little kid can be like I know why don't I

Did you know it was did you feel like

493
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,112
It was wrong do you feel like it's wrong now

494
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
What you mean

495
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,976
I don't I don't I don't

496
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072

Okay be sorry for someone I did

501

La Colonia

Only

503
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Change from it

504
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
But I ain't going to be sorry for what I did

505
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
Oh I'll regret nothing at all

506
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Did

507
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Lights out

508
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
Even if I see somebody today that I harm

509
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,720
That is some years ago

510
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,168
Imma be one soon as I see him honestly would as soon as I see him imma get into I'm going to get in defense mode

511
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Did you get it

512
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
Oh no I'm probably weird to you

513
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
He is weird to me

514
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,176
We talked a lot about remorse which he doesn't feel

515
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
And regret

516
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,272
Would you also says he doesn't feel but which I think he does

517
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
And responsibilities

518
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Which he feels keenly

519
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
He told me he's not going to deny he did something

520
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
If he did it

521
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
He says he didn't shoot that baby

522
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
He says he doesn't know who did

523
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
But even if you did now

524
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
He wouldn't tell

525
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
We're sitting right here on this couch she said

526
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,984
And he sees out the window someone shoots someone else

527
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,544
He's either going to leave before the cops show up

528
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Or if he does get question

529
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
He's going to help

530
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
The cops is unhelpfully as he can

531
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
I don't know what happened

532
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
I didn't see it

533
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
But what if you did see it

534
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Island I don't know

535
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Who did it

536
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Did you see

537
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,440
Okay did you see it yeah I sent it

538
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
What happened

539
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
He got killed

540
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
How

541
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
He got shot

542
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Who did it

543
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
I don't know

544
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Did you see him

545
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
Yeah

546
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,472
What do you look like I don't know

547
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Which way he go

548
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
He just ran

549
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
I'm helping but

550
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
I'm not going to say

551
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:34,016
He having a black coat he went down that way he got in that car I'm not doing all that

552
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
Because why that's what I'm trying to understand why not

553
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
I wasn't raised like that

554
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,512
I don't care if you was my worst enemy I'm not telling on you

555
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
I don't care what you did

556
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
It don't matter if you was

557
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,936
If you was the oldest nice as mean as lady

558
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,568
I am the oldest makes me not even if even if it was a lady

559
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,456
Because it's your principal you're just saying it's not about the consequences for me it's just a principle

560
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
That's against my religion

561
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
Number say that

562
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,344
That's against my religion to tell us

563
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Cuz you're going to make me I'm not going to feel right

564
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Imma feel less of a man

565
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
What if it was like a relative who is your

566
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
The victim of it

567
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,680
You don't even has your principal Bend at all with

568
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,520
Nature of the crime yet

569
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
No

570
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
We just going to have to handle it a different way

571
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
Meaning Street Justice

572
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Which Davon can get behind

573
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
The Cleveland Police Justice or Justice Center Justice

574
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
No way

575
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,720
This is precisely what vexes police investigations in cases like ivl's

576
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
It's probably as old as crime itself

577
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
Friendly's old is organized crime

578
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
No snitching

579
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,912
It's not just about gangster quotes of loyalty though

580
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,752
Over the decades it's been helped Along by the criminal justice system itself

581
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
Especially during the War on Drugs

582
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:05,408
You could argue no snitching was a rational response to the widespread use of low-level informants

583
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,736
To be threatened with mandatory prison sentences if they didn't talk

584
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,576
Prom was his Lola bond form and sometimes didn't know that much

585
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,672
Some people are getting arrested based on flimsy or false information

586
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
And then of course people don't cooperate because of straight up fear

587
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Well-supported fear

588
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,680
Until we watch the no snitching principle play out during trials and Cleveland

589
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,008
I've never fully understood How Deeply it muddies cases

590
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
We watched a capital murder case

591
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,872
In which Witnesses were visibly scared

592
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
Even some of the jurors were scared

593
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
And they weren't paranoid

594
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
The defendant was a heartless felon

595
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,856
Already one witness have been shot and killed in his driveway just before he was supposed to come to court

596
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,696
We watched another case in which a police informant had been murdered

597
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,744
We saw people squirm on the stand

598
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Prevaricate

599
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:58,144
Probably the most torture testimony we saw it was from a man who goes by RJ

600
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Hey banana gang

601
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,056
He was an important witness during the trial for the murder of one of the other children killed that follow 2015

602
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
Major Howard

603
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
It was 3 years old

604
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
It was a drive-by

605
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,992
When the shooting happened RJ was there on his front porch

606
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
University became a bit of a media hero because you tried to help major

607
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
Any news video he's sitting on his porch shirtless being interviewed

608
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
It looks sad and dazed

609
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
He's got staples up his arm

610
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:29,376
Holding together a wound from wrist to Elbow the result of an unrelated shooting the week before

611
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:33,984
The words never snitch are tattooed in fancy script just below his collar bones

612
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,568
A trial the prosecutor and a fry Leah

613
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,920
Made it clear to the jury that RJ had told detectives he seen the defendant

614
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Donnell Lindsey known as now

615
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
Shooting from the window of a white car

616
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,648
Now today almost a year-and-a-half since he made that statement

617
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
RJ was on the stand

618
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
Saying it wasn't true

619
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Nice and nobody showing

620
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
Okay

621
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,376
Didn't see the shooter didn't even see the car

622
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,216
Soon as he heard shots he ducked down onto his porch floor he said

623
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
To all he saw was his porch ceiling

624
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
And the little chairs he's got out there

625
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,384
Didn't see Donnell Lindsey at all the day major Howard was killed

626
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:17,760
Jennifer Ali-A tries to tease out of him why the discrepancy between these two statements

627
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
I will

628
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,928
I don't know what to do

629
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
RJ begins to spiral

630
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
It's hard to follow

631
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
Which I have to think was at least partly by Design

632
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,144
He says he's got all this pressure on him and no one can help them

633
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
Is Eva nassios in prison

634
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,984
He's serving time now in a different case

635
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
What should I do should he testify

636
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,616
He feels it was right to help the baby says

637
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
Best thing I ever did

638
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,712
A lot of people in the street or talking about him

639
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Threatening him

640
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,528
Is getting in fights in prison now

641
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
Because people afraid he's a snitch

642
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,136
Eventually he says to Anna faraglia

643
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
I didn't see Donna Lindsay myself

644
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
I just told detectives what I'd heard from other people

645
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,584
Because my face is already been in the news and since I was already public

646
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,400
People in the neighborhood started coming to me with information

647
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,240
People who are scared themselves with scattered before police arrived that day

648
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,848
It's really passing their information to the detectives not my own information

649
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
And that was also a good deed

650
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,712
I could have run like other people did I could have shut my door

651
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
I knew the police were looking for me for another shooting

652
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
But I tried to help that baby

653
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
I talked to detectives

654
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
What else do you want from me

655
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
It went on like this for hours

656
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Finally

657
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
I have heard

658
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
It's a movie move

659
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,752
State's exhibit 351 is an autopsy photograph

660
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,824
Adorable little major Howard's dead body

661
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,408
She has the photo to RJ

662
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
Is that what you tried to help

663
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Is that a yes or a no

664
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
You try to help us little boy

665
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
Okay

666
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
And don't you think you owe it to him

667
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,632
The tallest jury who shot this little boy and not be afraid anymore sir

668
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Front

669
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
RJ swamp

670
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
Starts to cry

671
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,360
Play major was shot RJ random

672
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,664
Took off his own shirt wrapped around him

673
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
Jumping a car and held onto major

674
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
Well they rushed to the hospital

675
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
Major was still conscious

676
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
Looking up at him

677
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Touching his chest

678
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Dying

679
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
4 years old

680
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
RJ was still tormented by it

681
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
Did now shoot this little boy

682
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,912
Two-seater shooting from a white car that night

683
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,448
And all I asking you

684
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,080
Other people saying

685
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
Can you step up

686
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,688
Should I'm trying to do the best way I can

687
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,344
Alvin Gators telling the truth

688
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
I told you my truth

689
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Anna says to him

690
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
Let's get real

691
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,792
You won't deliver because you're afraid of Retribution

692
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,376
Tell me gay members that come in the courtroom sat in the back

693
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Trying to get Margie's head

694
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
She said to RJ

695
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
Afraid because you broke the code

696
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,848
He says that ship sailed the moment I picked up that little boy

697
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,944
I broke the code by talking to the news reporter who approached me on the street

698
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,992
I broke the code by speaking to the cops

699
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,064
I'm breaking the code right now by sitting in this courtroom

700
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,624
Doesn't even really matter what words I say

701
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
Just being here is enough

702
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,232
Like I said I already said I broke up with her talking to you

703
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Tomorrow

704
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,816
Marlene is more fun to talk to you

705
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Carpro

706
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:55,104
I talked to a few jurors about the case afterwards

707
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,200
Two out of the three said they didn't believe are Json Ellen the car

708
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:05,856
But there was other evidence aside from RJ and Donna Lindsay was convicted he got 37 years

709
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Instalife

710
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:11,488
For what it's worth his lawyers don't think he did it that's actually unusual for them

711
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
Watch the whole trial and he came away not at all convinced Donnell Lindsey was guilty I still don't know what to think

712
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,624
So what exactly did they have on Davon Holmes

713
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,160
New video

714
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
No physical evidence

715
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
No fingerprints no DNA

716
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
Logan

717
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:49,120
I found out Davon apparently had made a statement placing himself in the vicinity of the crime

718
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,960
Saying he been at the Family Dollar at the top of the street and it seems people running

719
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,288
Tumi Davon denied making any such statement

720
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
Police had gotten his cell records would show that he was indeed nearby at the time of the shooting but considering he lives only a few blocks

721
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
Max from where the shooting happened

722
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
The cell records seems underwhelming

723
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,856
The eyewitnesses were Paramount

724
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,928
At least on paper they look wobbly

725
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,488
It was John the guy Dave on new

726
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
. offered information from jail

727
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Witnesses like that are inherently weak

728
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,912
The defense can always argue the person's lying to get a deal

729
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
I wasn't able to reach John

730
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
But I did talk to someone close to him

731
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
I believe is reliable

732
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,384
Who said they had talked to John about his statement

733
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
This person told me

734
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
That was John told the police

735
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,248
Code it's not true

736
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
This person said John had lied

737
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
To save himself to try to avoid going to prison

738
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
Didn't think John did it because of his brother's death

739
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
But yes

740
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
He does still suffer over his brother

741
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,560
But they didn't think that was the reason John lied about Davon

742
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,168
So the landscapers ID was probably the strongest thing they had

743
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,032
I wasn't sure what to make of his sudden Clarity 57 days post shooting

744
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,432
Was he somehow manipulated by the police or maybe he been scared of choosing the wrong person or the right person

745
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
Maybe he just made a mistake

746
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,576
I went looking for him one day at various addresses around the city

747
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,928
Emmanuel and I left notes and our business cards talk to mail boxes in front doors

748
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
It works

749
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
I got a call that same night from the landscaper

750
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
He did not trust me

751
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,912
The neighbors had seen a manual and me walking around with her hands in her pockets

752
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
We look like cops

753
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
I told him it was cold outside that's why

754
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,592
I asked him if we could meet so we could see if himself I was harmless

755
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,432
But the more I asked the more suspicious he thought I was trying to set him up to arrest him

756
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,248
We spoke a couple of times on the phone

757
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,320
He was upset his name was part of Dave on the case

758
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
He was told his name would stay out of it

759
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,696
He said they threatened me that if they didn't come to court they put me in jail

760
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,304
He thinks they dropped avons case because they didn't want to pay out the reward money

761
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Which is $25,000

762
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,168
Landscaper was full of conspiratorial forever

763
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
I got the feeling he come by honestly

764
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,800
Sometime later a woman called me

765
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
She said she was family to the landscaper

766
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
She said you should be careful what you do

767
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,064
Because you can come in and ask all these questions but then you get to leave we don't we live here

768
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Kill you

769
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,904
Will cops in our family I know how things happen

770
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,208
I told her I know she's right

771
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
I am trying to tread delicately

772
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
We talked for a long time

773
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,912
We're finally by the end she said she tell the landscaper to talk to me

774
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
But he never did

775
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:39,360
Fred hung up with him that last time the landscaper asked me have you talked to the baby's family

776
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,200
You been in contact with Charles Wakefield Abigail's father he said

777
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,504
You should talk to the family

778
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
That's coming up

779
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
After the break

780
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
This is the road to hire

781
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
Brought to you by ZipRecruiter Charles Becker works on an oil field in Tech

782
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,120
For the company PML exploration services

783
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,192
And it's his job to hire mud loggers

784
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,496
Basically is a rig is drilling for oil

785
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,824
It's also pumping a bunch of mud out of the ground and mud loggers

786
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Monster Mutt

787
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,432
They look at it and analyzed the chemicals in rocks that are coming out of the ground

788
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
You're looking for indicators of

789
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Where

790
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
Highest amount of oil and gas is

791
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:27,232
Call methane is in Tater of oil it smells like farts that means that there's oil

792
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
H2S

793
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
Sh2 S&S bad

794
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:35,680
Because I would have already killed

795
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,496
Yeah drilling rigs are not the most safest place

796
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,104
That's just one of the reasons why it's really hard to find people who are willing to become a bloggers

797
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:48,480
You also have to be away from home 21 days out of the month in the middle of nowhere sturdy it's hot

798
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,040
It was so hard to find people

799
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,856
Until Charles started using ZipRecruiter

800
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,672
He started getting tons of qualified candidate

801
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:02,816
The point where I now have a pipeline of people who are waiting an eager to jump into whenever any people just turn on the hose

802
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,120
That's a lot of metaphors

I've been waiting to contact mr. Wakefield

818
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Until

819
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,368
I don't know I had more information I guess

820
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
But really I was avoiding it

821
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,512
I figured it would be painful for him and professionally a little used to me

822
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,072
We know I know the whole story so

823
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,144
I got to say it's just the waiting game

824
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
I was being a dummy

825
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,800
Charles Wakefield is a lovely welcoming person who says he knows exactly what happened

826
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
First shot hit in the

827
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
Back at the front

828
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
Passenger tire

829
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:30,880
And I think the bullet wanted to the dashboard in a second but it went in the corner of the passenger window

830
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
Wish where my mom was sitting at

831
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,536
Then the third bullet went in the back door and through her car seat

832
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Charles wasn't there himself

833
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
He wasn't a witness

834
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,936
He doesn't have any proof for his version of what happened

835
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,496
Song information he's gathered from other people

836
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm going to be beeping at a name here

837
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,384
The version of the story he feels confident is true

838
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,735
Is it some guys were shooting dice in a building on East 145th Street off Kinsman

839
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
Sometime earlier one of them had been robbed maybe at another dice game or there's been some gambling issue Charles wasn't sure about that

840
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
That part

841
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,719
I later learned there had been a shooting

842
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,279
Anyway these guys were ready to retaliate

843
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
They're on the lookout for particular car

844
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,399
A car that looked a lot like Charles's car

845
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,007
House of the guy they were after I had a white 2000 Oldsmobile Aurora

846
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
Charlesetta White

847
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,591
2001 Oldsmobile Aurora

848
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,895
Only difference was

849
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
He has had tinted windows

850
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
And ours had a sunroof

851
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,599
The guys playing the dice game see an Oldsmobile coming

852
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,903
Charles has one of them recognized it

853
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
Somebody

854
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
That was there with them

855
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
New my car

856
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
Tomato

857
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
They said that ain't the car

858
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167
But once I started firing anyway

859
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,983
Beyonce Ayesha was driving

860
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,287
His elderly mother was in the passenger seat

861
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
Behind her was aviao

862
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,383
I'm behind Aisha was her other daughter

863
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
Who is 8 years old

864
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,527
They were driving to the Save-A-Lot just a few blocks away to get ingredients for Charles's birthday cake

865
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
Is his birthday the next day

866
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,903
I just seen the person with that car but I don't know who he is

867
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:13,023
I actually met him up at the carwash when I first met him

868
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:19,935
You know somebody got the same type of car they and you know it just bursts a conversation and next thing I know somebody was shooting at

869
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
That same car but it was my car thinking it was

870
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
His car

871
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
I'm not sure why this hadn't occurred to me before

872
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
But it was hitting me now talking to Charles

873
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
He lives right here

874
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,527
The shooting happened down the street from where we're sitting

875
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,623
The people he thinks are involved with his daughter's death they also live

876
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
Right here

877
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
Within blocks of each other some of them

878
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Of course he knew things

879
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
I heard things

880
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,071
Best Charles about Davon

881
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Tank

882
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,911
When he got arrested did you think oh okay they got them

883
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
Yeah I know right away was to

884
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
I know this is where I'm going to start beeping

885
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
Because trials

886
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
Doesn't think it was

887
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,151
He told me a story about another person

888
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
How many names

889
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,991
Soon as the shots was fired my car was hit

890
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,319
Wanted to do is come running to me

891
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
First words, his mouth is

892
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,903
Said he going to holler at you

893
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,511
And in my head I'm thinking like why would he say

894
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
And I'm putting on highlighter

895
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
What did you take that to me as he's going to holler at you

896
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
But he's got to see how to speak to you about something

897
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,543
I pretty much he was either gone or I believe

898
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
They didn't think my daughter was going to die

899
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
So he was going to

900
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:38,783
You know try to patch up but but she end up dying so it

901
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,599
I couldn't become do it no more

902
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
And then it was

903
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
Probably few days later

904
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,511
United States started talking then

905
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,583
All fingers pointing back to

906
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
How many people talk to you about it

907
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,935
Well for 5 p

908
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,751
People that came out of their mouth

909
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:05,151
And you're pretty sure it wasn't just an echo chamber where is like they'd all her the same single rumor it was a different information

910
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
Different information

911
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
Charles knows this guy he's talking about

912
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,087
They weren't close friends but they definitely knew each other and had been cool with each other

913
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,183
He says ever since the shooting this guy acts strangely when he sees them

914
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Twitchy

915
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,047
Twitchy is a useful towel in the movie version of the story

916
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
But it is not evidence

917
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
Anything really

918
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,447
But to Charles it feels like this guy's body language is what gives him away

919
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,103
And it's not even me like he he will see one of my buddies that I'm kind of close within my buddy with her this hot new

920
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,407
Casey minajesty and I was like

921
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:42,527
He took off like he jumped in somebody car that he wasn't even in and took off

922
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,599
And I'm like well he did he like I know bro

923
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,927
Has he finally confronted the guy himself

924
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
In the street

925
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
I broke my wife cheat

926
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
Running from me

927
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
Elite

928
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:00,447
I ain't running from you I said what why I got to stay in the middle of the street to flag you down to come back right now

929
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:05,567
Is that what happened in a car

930
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,127
When you stood out travel to the people across the street

931
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,919
I was walking back from the store

932
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,479
He was facing this way

933
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
When I turned the corner

934
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
He backed up in my driveway and went that way

935
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
So I'm in the middle of the street

936
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,463
Like this with my arms up

937
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
Boyfriend look through the rearview mirror

938
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,303
Finally he looks through the rearview mirror

939
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
He stops

940
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
The car

941
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,143
He comes back when you got somebody to car one

942
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,959
And the look on his face was like

943
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,543
I think he just wanted me to do something to him so he can

944
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
Press charges and give me like that

945
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
And I'm looking at him like

946
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,503
Hybrid just tell me what happened I like my daughter did I know you want to live you Thailand

947
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
Running from you every time you see me

948
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
You know what I said he

949
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,391
I don't know what to tell you

950
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:57,791
I was at the wrong place at the wrong time or something about the card you it was the wrong car son whatever he

951
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
You told me but I'm telling him like that ain't it

952
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,959
I like I told him it ain't just me that's mad at you

953
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,031
You got it Mason of people you kill the innocent

954
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Baby

955
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,639
I can't stop people from doing what they feel

956
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,663
In my heart

957
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,223
I'm not the only person to know your face now

958
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
It's like you're telling this to me in it in a very moderate tone was at

959
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:29,791
At the tone of the conversation where you screaming in the street

960
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:36,191
Girls wasn't scared when worried about someone coming after him for telling police what he'd heard is a grieving father of a day

961
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:42,591
Dead baby daughter the rules didn't apply to him or if they didn't care he should sidestep the game

962
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,991
M2 and turn himself in

963
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,695
Calling in anonymous tips about Davon

964
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:03,327
One reason he said was because Davon changed his appearance soon after the shooting it cut his dreads

965
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:09,215
Because he cut his dreads off claiming that he had a warrant for some he did on the Westside

966
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,543
So it made everybody think you know he has something to do with it

967
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
So

968
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
He had a gun

969
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
But he didn't shoot

970
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,015
Wait so you're saying tank was there

971
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
He was there and he had a gun he just didn't you

972
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Who was there

973
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,159
Have you ever spoken to him

974
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,743
News from the tank

975
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Oh you did

976
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
Where'd you see him

977
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
At the store

978
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,167
Teavana told me he didn't know the Wakefield family

979
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,751
And you guys speak what do you say

980
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
You know he just say

981
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:51,455
He seemed pretty much sizing me up to see if I still think if he had something to do with it or if I'm going you know.

982
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,015
Do something to him or you know like that but

983
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Hino

984
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,855
If I want to do something other than did it

985
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:03,743
I respect that man enough he stayed in jail for about a year for something he didn't do so

986
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
But you're saying he knows what hap

987
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:11,423
He knows but I mean he didn't do it it's a difference between knowing and doing are two different things

988
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,799
Why do you think it took so long

989
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
For them to let

990
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,871
Pink out

991
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:26,015
That was too they was trying to get him to snitch on that I was just at the dry out

992
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,087
Turn the volume up that's all that was

993
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,391
They know team didn't do that and never let him out

994
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:38,303
Charles thinks the state indicted Davon on three different kinds of murder charges and held them in a filthy jail cell for a full year

995
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
And Hope

996
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
That he turn on

997
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,167
Kevin told me he doesn't know

998
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
Charles feels pretty sure he does

999
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,567
3 clear Charles did not know who Tavon was before all this happened

1000
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,151
But he told me several times he's got no problem with him now

1001
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Okay

1002
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:01,599
So I've been talking to Dave on for 4 months by this point and he had not said any of this to me

1003
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,135
Given categorical

1004
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,231
He knew nothing about that shooting wasn't there didn't know any of these people

1005
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,095
After I talk to Charles I went back to Davon ran all this by him

1006
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:16,959
Are you set aside from yes recognizing Charles Wakefield on the street none of it was true

1007
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,775
He said he'd heard all these same rumors I had

1008
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
That's what they were

1009
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Rumors

1010
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Stories

1011
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,175
Which by virtue of repetition do not become true

1012
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,527
I don't know if they Vons telling me the truth about what he knows or doesn't know

1013
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:36,927
But now that I know what I know I wouldn't be surprised if he's not I might be the oldest nicest meanest lady

1014
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,999
But at the end of the day I'm still an outsider

1015
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,607
Well I can understand why Charles feels that his information is solid and true

1016
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
At the end of the day

1017
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:50,751
It's all secondhand

1018
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,223
You're naming to me like individual people who you think were there and would know the same story your time

1019
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,295
And yet not one of them it seems like has

1020
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,367
Gone to the police or talk to the police about it does that surprise you

1021
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,535
No not really I mean like I said comes the boys down to nobody want to be labeled a snitch

1022
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,095
And everybody to tell me

1023
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Who did it

1024
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,471
But you know cuz I can't go to the office or welts I just told me

1025
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,031
They have to tell the you know so

1026
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,103
I don't notice that make you mad at all your

1027
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,503
This is me all the way up like every time I go outside I just look at everybody different like you know

1028
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
What happened

1029
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
Don't say that

1030
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
You know so

1031
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,903
That's just how I look at everybody like

1032
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:44,767
You know that's the same one

1033
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,631
And then I would let you cuz you know you've been through this whole time

1034
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
Charles is a big man

1035
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
Big and soft around the edges

1036
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,311
His mother told me he was always a crier

1037
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,871
But now that your seem to leak from him unbidden

1038
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,455
His mom told me the loss of his baby was a soft hurt

1039
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,759
Which I took to mean still tender

1040
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,575
I didn't know him before Abigail died

1041
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,647
But my son's now is that he is ravaged by the loss of her

1042
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:16,255
Halfway through a conversation I realized I was talking to him from the same place he sleeps

1043
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,839
An oversized armchair and matching ottoman in the living room

1044
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,167
At the foot of the makeshift bed with a coffee table

1045
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,239
Covered with photographs and mementos of IDL

1046
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
Charles has been a stay-at-home father

1047
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,615
I used to work and so he took care of IBL all day

1048
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
He felt very close to her

1049
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:39,551
Since the shooting he's had a hard time not thinking about her and her death in the unsolved case

1050
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
Every minute

1051
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,671
It just kind of makes me want to take matters to your own hand

1052
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:51,583
Is that a possibility that you would do something about it yourself

1053
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,143
No I'm not not okay

1054
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,935
But nobody in this in

1055
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,727
This pain that I feel

1056
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,263
Cuz nobody else deal with it

1057
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,847
Just the me knowing is somebody going to be sitting

1058
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,639
Feeling like this

1059
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
Hotel versus bro man

1060
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Vista disable pay yuan

1061
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,767
It might be I got a conscious like I can't live life

1062
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
But

1063
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
Play worth it

1064
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
I've had the opportunity

1065
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,031
Plenty of times I know where you at

1066
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,127
No worries they know where you be I know everything I need

1067
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,199
That's what hurt me

1068
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
Maybe I should go get her

1069
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
Imma be on the road

1070
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,511
That's where I get my satisfaction from knowing that

1071
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,095
His life will never be the same

1072
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
But

1073
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,703
All going right now as we speak he probably laughing it

1074
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
But it is mine

1075
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
It's not right

1076
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:24,511
Charles feels as though he can't directly ask anyone to come forward and speak to the police

1077
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,583
Understands snitches get killed

1078
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,655
He wants to live in a world where snitching is unnecessary

1079
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,727
I heard this from several people interviewed in Cleveland

1080
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,287
If the cops just did their jobs better

1081
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,847
Civilians wouldn't be put in an impossible position

1082
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,151
System shouldn't send

1083
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
Need

1084
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,479
The public to do its job

1085
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,807
That's the stamp I like they all they do is get out here

1086
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,903
Ask somebody else to do their job like no you get out here and

1087
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
Look for the person you think did it

1088
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,279
Steady want somebody else to tell on somebody

1089
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:04,191
But I mean isn't that them doing their jobs always try to get how I mean they're not magic like they weren't here the only way they could

1090
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,727
Information is people telling them information

1091
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:11,871
No they get information about getting out here in these streets in in finding information except just like I did

1092
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,223
Right but that still would require someone to tell

1093
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
I mean like if they go to

1094
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,087
The same people who talk to you they're asking them to tell

1095
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
Right but no I'm saying

1096
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,975
That person will be telling them instead of telling me

1097
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:31,583
You said I was saying like this is easy like I said the whole neighborhood and told me what happened

1098
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,863
Exactly

1099
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
Because he's not a cop

1100
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,007
I got to say most the detectives I talked to told me that back in the day

1101
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
20 years ago

1102
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,055
Even 10 years ago

1103
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,127
They did have better relationships with the people they police

1104
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,199
There wasn't as much animosity toward them for one thing

1105
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
They used to have a substantial community policing unit

1106
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
Former Commander that told me

1107
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
22 police mini stations

1108
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
Staff with two officers each

1109
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
Plus dare officers at schools

1110
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
Officers at public pools

1111
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,327
Police didn't materialize only in the aftermath of disaster

1112
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,119
They were visibly around

1113
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
They could develop relationship

1114
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,703
Which in turn could lead to information

1115
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,751
You make a quiet phone call

1116
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,311
And people on the other end of the line with trust you

1117
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,591
To keep their names out of it

1118
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,919
I don't know whether these guys were waxing nostalgic

1119
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:23,295
But everyone I talked to agree that it has been degrading in recent years this relationship with the public

1120
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,903
The team in charge of police reform in Cleveland recently surveyed officers

1121
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,951
They should report a few months ago

1122
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:35,071
That included officers estimating that 60% of people they come into contact with

1123
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
Want nothing to do with them

1124
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,447
The police many stations were asked more than a decade ago

1125
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:44,031
Budget cuts led to the department losing hundreds of officers

1126
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,711
Charles said he did relay everything he'd been hearing to the cops

1127
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,271
Specifically to detective articles

1128
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,343
And detective Rhonda gray we're running the investigation

1129
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,415
Joe says he was calling and calling leaving messages

1130
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,975
I got information I got another person

1131
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,767
He says he never got a call back

1132
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,071
My dad just went cold

1133
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,911
The guy Charles believe shot ivl the police are aware of him

1134
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,983
Charles didn't tell me anything he hadn't already told police

1135
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:19,615
And anyway he said detective Ackles already heard that same guys name almost as soon as Charles dead

1136
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:26,527
This man himself knows the police are aware of him I met him at is I recognized in one day at the justice

1137
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,855
Center while he was sitting on a bench waiting to make a 10 a.m. Jail visit

1138
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
And I asked if I could talk to him about the Wakefield case

1139
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
I gave my card

1140
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,255
He was unequivocal no

1141
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,327
I got nothing to say I just want to leave all that in the past

1142
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,655
It's over

1143
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:52,127
The last time Charles met with the detectives was late November of 2016

1144
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,967
They called him and Ayesha to tell them they had important news

1145
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
They all gathered in the prosecutor's office

1146
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,647
For the detectives and prosecutors explained they be letting Davon Holmes out of jail

1147
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,951
Charles said he told them yeah

1148
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Because tank didn't do it

1149
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,047
They said they'd still be pursuing the case

1150
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
Still looking at other suspects

1151
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,143
Including the guy Charles Blues today

1152
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
They discuss that guy

1153
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
They discussed Avon

1154
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
I wanted to take the told me he liked well

1155
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:24,639
You know I believe they're going to be at each other and you know this and that like you don't even

1156
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,943
Basically saying they're going to kill each other

1157
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,991
That's what he said to you

1158
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
This is Echo

1159
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
Olympic

1160
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,975
That was the day they let think about you and I will you know

1161
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:45,631
How do you say don't worry about it Mr Rayfield delegate they're going to still deal with each other

1162
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
Pretty after a while

1163
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,751
They're going to close passing they going you know it's going to be between them to now

1164
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,311
That's what it was

1165
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,407
I pretty much shocked it

1166
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,223
Me and the guys I'll be with haven't did nothing

1167
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,831
No kind of proud of you like you know I'm glad you ain't did nothing yet but

1168
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
Don't worry it's going to happen

1169
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
You know me like

1170
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,183
That's kind of was

1171
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,863
I wasn't able to run this by detective Ackles

1172
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,679
Again the Cleveland Police Department didn't want to comment on it

1173
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:24,287
Prosecutor at the meeting said he didn't remember detective Echols saying that

1174
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,335
But I can kind of imagine it

1175
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:32,735
I had this meeting the Cleveland Police Department had only 12 homicide detectives murders in Cleveland reaching the

1176
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,527
Are highest numbers in a decade

1177
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,599
So yeah I can see a cop saying to Charles

1178
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,439
Between us I think your best bet is to let them kill each other

1179
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,767
Quiet bitter nod to the supremacy of Street Justice

1180
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
So

1181
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,119
What did get out of jail

1182
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,679
Well it was detective work

1183
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,983
But not by detectives

1184
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,519
